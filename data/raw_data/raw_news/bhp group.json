In the largest class action in British legal history, victims are now demanding billions in damages from mine operator BHP.\n\nBuried under a mudslide: Residents look out over the village of Bento Rodrigues following the collapse of the Mariana dam in November 2015. Ricardo Moraes / Reuters\n\nOptimieren Sie Ihre Browsereinstellungen NZZ.ch ben\u00f6tigt JavaScript f\u00fcr wichtige Funktionen. Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan.

The church, the house she had lived in with her mother, and the neighboring houses had all disappeared. The 600-person village in Brazil's state of Minas Gerais was completely submerged in mud.\n\n\u00abI was totally desperate,\u00bb the 39-year-old recalls in a video interview. \u00abAt the same time, I thought that I probably would have died if I hadn't gone to work in the neighboring village that morning.\u00bb\n\nToxic tsunami\n\nOn that devastating November day, a total of 19 people lost their lives in Bento Rodrigues and other villages. After the collapse of a tailings dam at a nearby mine, 32 million cubic meters of sludge mixed with iron ore swept into the valley. The toxic surge of mud destroyed villages and poisoned the Doce River over a length of 650 kilometers, all the way into the Atlantic Ocean. The Mariana dam collapse is considered the worst ecological disaster in Brazilian history, impacting the living environments of around 2.5 million people.\n\nOnce the initial shock subsided, dos Santos got angry \u2013 especially at the negligence shown by the BHP and Vale mining companies, which had run the mine as a joint venture under the name Samarco. Company representatives had repeatedly assured residents that the dam was being monitored 24 hours a day and that there was no danger, says dos Santos.\n\nMonica dos Santos has fought for justice for the victims of the disaster in Brazil. Now her hopes lie with the British High Court in London. Washington Alves / Reuters\n\nShe is also angry about the way the companies and the Brazilian authorities responded to the accident. Those who lost their homes were initially given hotel rooms, and then inexpensive replacement lodging. However, dos Santos and her mother were not reimbursed for their destroyed house, with its well-tended garden. As the head of the family, her mother was awarded a compensation of around 230 Swiss francs per month, while other family members received the equivalent of 30 francs per month. Dos Santos describes these payments as \u00abridiculously small.\u00bb\n\nAfter the disaster, dos Santos, who had been working as a dental assistant, sought out legal training in order to carry on the fight for justice. But she says she has lost faith in the Brazilian justice system. \u00abCompanies have a free hand in Brazil. They pay as much as they want, when they want and to whom they want.\u00bb\n\nLargest class action to date\n\nNow dos Santos' hopes lie in the United Kingdom \u2013 in a stuffy hearing room at the High Court in London, to be precise. The Australian-British company BHP, which had its headquarters in London at the time of the accident, is facing a class-action lawsuit in which claimants are seeking damages amounting to about 36 billion pounds (about $47 billion).\n\nAs the case was argued earlier this month, a civil engineer was called to the stand as an expert witness. He provided a detailed technical analysis, outlining whether he believed that the joint venture between BHP and Vale had taken sufficient precautions to foresee and prevent the dam's collapse. He stated that the joint venture had \u00abpushed the dam to the limits of its operational tolerance.\u00bb\n\nAn army of lawyers from London's most powerful law firms, assembled by BHP to fight the damages claim, were gathered on the left side of the courtroom. Opposite them, on the right, were arrayed lawyers from the firm of Pogust Goodhead, representing disaster victims including dos Santos.\n\nTom Goodhead, the managing partner of the London law firm, led the questioning of the witnesses and experts. The attorneys asked about cracks in the dam that had appeared in 2014, to which the mine operators failed to respond. They additionally cited documents suggesting that BHP may have been aware of the risks involved.\n\nTom Goodhead. PD\n\nThe U.K. has a long tradition of legal action against multinational companies. However, the lawsuit against BHP is unprecedented. Pogust Goodhead is representing around 620,000 victims, including members of Indigenous peoples, farmers and fishermen. \u00abThis is the largest class action in British and possibly global legal history,\u00bb Goodhead says in an interview.\n\nBHP's lawyers initially contended that the British court system did not have jurisdiction in this case. This argument was dismissed. The company has also argued that BHP was a nonoperating partner in the joint venture in charge of the mine, and thus was not responsible for the dam's collapse. Finally, BHP has asserted that the trial in London is thwarting efforts in Brazil to compensate the victims of the accident.\n\nBackers with deep pockets\n\nThe trial, which lasted several months, came to an end in mid-March. The High Court's ruling is expected in the summer, although an appeal to a higher court remains possible. Goodhead says he is confident. The trial showed that BHP was involved in operational decisions relating to risk assessment, safety and investment in the Samarco joint venture, the lawyer says. \u00abIt was impossible to write a check without someone from BHP being involved,\u00bb Goodhead notes.\n\nThe fact that the case went to court at all makes it unusual. British law provides strong financial incentives for the parties involved in such disputes to reach out-of-court settlements. Goodhead attributes the fact that no settlement was reached in this case to the enormous amount of money at stake. Experts say BHP could be ordered to pay around $44 billion in damages.\n\nThe toxic mudslide left a trail of destruction in Bento Rodrigues. Ricardo Moraes / Reuters\n\nDue to these large sums of money, the financial risk for everyone involved is massive. If they lost, dos Santos and her fellow campaigners would never be able to pay litigation and legal costs totaling several hundred million dollars. Consequently, investors that focus on alternative asset classes have taken over this part of the risk. \u00abIt's the story of David versus Goliath, but this time David has hedge funds with deep pockets behind him,\u00bb says Goodhead.\n\nThese investors, which include wealthy families and charitable foundations, have effectively lent his law firm large sums of money. If BHP wins the case, they will lose their stake, and the Pogust Goodhead law firm will only barely cover its costs. If the mining giant loses, however, there is the prospect of significant returns for the investors, as well as a considerable profit for the law firm. However, Goodhead does declines to provide precise details regarding the investments, the legal costs or the amount that would ultimately be left over for the 620,000 claimants.\n\nIf BHP loses the case, it may also signal that international companies will see their legal responsibilities defined more broadly in British courts in the future. \u00abWe are already receiving inquiries from investors about cases from all over the world,\u00bb says Goodhead. In particular, donors and nongovernmental organizations are expressing great interest in subjecting oil and mining companies in countries such as Indonesia, Myanmar and Libya to court review, he says.\n\nPossible criminal repercussions\n\nFor dos Santos, the trial in London is not just about winning compensation. \u00abNo amount of money in the world can bring back my home, the mementos, the lost years,\u00bb she says. For this reason, she did not participate in a Brazilian settlement totaling $23 billion, which BHP and Vale offered to some of the victims \u2013 on the condition that they waive all further claims and not participate in the London lawsuit.\n\nDos Santos hopes that a judgment against BHP in London would prompt other mining companies to take safety concerns more seriously. And she hopes that the hard-fought lawsuit will lay the groundwork for criminal proceedings. \u00abThose responsible belong behind bars,\u00bb she says. \u00abThat's the only deterrent that works.\u00bb\n\nA Brazilian woman protests in front of the British High Court ahead of the trial against BHP.

If you're curious to read about the flying lesson experience, skip to the second post. For the backstory, continue reading.\n\nPrologue: Late 90's, Early 2000s\n\nYear 1998, my family moves to Vadodara and the then 8-year-old me is enrolled in a school that was located right under the final approach of Runway 04 at Vadodara airport (BDQ). A small aerodrome combined with an airforce base, I was exposed to a variety of aircraft flying low, hence providing a detailed view of each of those.\n\nIn the year 2003, National Geographic launches \"Air Crash Investigation\". To fulfil the \"Minimum 30 mins of compulsory National Geographic/Discovery channel on TV\" diktat set by my parents, my brother and I pick this show as our weekly watch.\n\nYears pass by and the school arranges a trip to the local flying club located within the airport. By then I had flown a few times during summer vacations in the years gone by. I've made up my mind to become a commercial pilot.\n\n\"You have glasses, you cannot be a pilot. Have you ever seen a pilot wearing glasses?\" - say my expert classmates at school. The timid me believes that as a truth, as I had never seen a pilot wear vision correction glasses. Oh wait, I had never seen a pilot in real life at all!\n\nThe curiosity about aircraft was well ignited within the minds of both brothers, though mobile phones and computers (later classified as \"electronics\") also were competing for their rights in our minds. This was further skewed by the fact that while our dad worked with the non-aviation version of the Rolls Royce RB211 he being an electrical engineer could explain our questions about how an aircraft worked, but not much about how pilots fly one. The fact that he could explain more about electronics than flying meant that the electronics were slowly winning the battle.\n\nDuring one of our flights in 2005, my brother (then a small kid) asked the cabin crew \"Can I please see the cockpit?\". The crew couldn't refuse the cute boy and replied \"We'll show you after we land!\". They kept their promise and I tailgated to follow him into the flight deck. I was amazed by the variety of screens and buttons in the flight deck; it was an Airbus A320 operated by Indian Airlines. The first officer madam was explaining different screens and buttons to my brother while I was observing her eyes.\n\nMy friends were right. Pilots don't wear glasses.\n\nThe 2010s\n\nA decade passes by and in 2012, I graduate from my engineering course, having pursued electronics and telecom (computers and mobile phones won the battle with aviation in the mind of the then young me). However, I was more informed now. I knew that anyone with a vision that can be corrected to 6/6 with glasses could apply for a commercial pilot training course. I was also made aware that becoming a pilot would cost close to a crore Indian rupees and that was the end of my pilot dreams.\n\nNonetheless, there was still a space for commercial aviation in my heart, and both me and my brother would satisfy our thirst for it by using the then available Microsoft Flight Simulator X. Running it on mid-spec laptop meant that we quickly lost interest in the sim because it would run at it's lowest setting- leading to application crash and a sub par experience. Nonetheless, it gave us a rough idea of what flying looks like and how an aircraft reacts to control inputs.\n\nA chat with a senior IndiGo pilot in 2014 re-affirmed the fact that commercial aviation was not for me. His words were \"As a young man, I used to enjoy flying and travelling to new places. Turning 50+ now, having to miss family events, festivals and not able to maintain a sleep routine, it can get boring and tiring as the years pass by\".\n\nMy parents think that the actual reason that I do not pursue a career in commercial aviation is because it has no place for laziness - for which, yours truly will win the first prize if there was ever a competition.\n\nThe 2020s\n\nHaving moved away far from Electronics and Telecom engineering in the decade gone by, the victory of electronics was short-lived. That void was quickly filled in by the still-burning embers of aviation in my mind.\n\nI started studying more about the engineering behind aircraft, which was further accelerated by a visit to the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Hamburg, Germany as a part of my Operations & Supply chain study tour. I self-educated myself with available sources, which included (re)watching all episodes of Air Crash Investigation, Reading up on websites like Wikipedia, Aviation StackExchange, PPRuNE, Airbus SafetyFirst and talking to a lot of pilots to clarify my doubts.\n\nCirca mid-2020 and Microsoft launches its Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and the av-sim world goes crazy. The \"proper\" logical successor of their own Flight Simulator X, this simulator promised \"near real world\" flight models, real world scenery and amazing graphics.\n\nUsing the sim created a deep desire to experience the feel of flying a real aircraft. The Netherlands had some flying schools offering trial flying lessons, mostly for leisure. In short- all the infrastructure for me to take a trial flying lesson was in place, but remember my note about me being lazy? The trial lesson never happened.\n\nNot until my brother gifted me a flying lesson in November 2024 as a birthday gift. The fire inside my mind about aviation that was slowly burning, now got its full tank of petrol (or should it be avgas?)\n\nCessna 172 Pre-flight\n\nIn mid-November, is when I got an appointment for the trial lesson. The location was a flight training school in Lelystad- a town that's 60 kilomters north of Amsterdam.\n\nOn the appointed day, I set off to the airport to arrive well in time and accounting for any delays. The \"check in\" process was effortless- I showed them the gift voucher and my passport (for ID check). I was asked if I'd like to record the flight and it was a no-brainer to say yes. Once the request formalities were completed, I was directed to the \"briefing room\" where they had an informational video about the basics of flight.\n\nThe video explained the control surfaces and the basics of flight (lift, thrust, etc.) but I soon lost interest due to the information being redundant. My instructor (Rik) soon joined me in the room and he reminded me that the video was important. I told him that I am an avgeek and a simulator pilot. Fortunately, he too was using the same simulator and spared me from watching the (boring) video.\n\nHe briefed me on the flight plan using a map, explaining that we'll be following VFR (Visual Fight rules) and staying under 5000 ft. He also showed me the Terminal Control Area (TCA) of Amsterdam Airport (Schiphol) on the map, which for us was a \"do not enter under any circumstances\" zone for this flight. He further briefed that unlike in the Microsoft simulator, we'll be flying an Old Cessna 172 without the glass cockpit (\"with steam gauges\" in his own words). After the briefing, it was time to head out to the aircraft, after wearing our high-visibility safety vests.\n\nMy first flight was going to be this Cessna 172 registered PH-AHJ (nickname: Alpha Hotel Juliet)\n\nWhile every pilot is supposed to do a walk around and perform a pre-flight inspection, Rik explained that he had already done it, so a preflight inspection by me wasn't required. I trusted him, as I was too excited to waste any time performing the pre-flight checks (another reason why I probably shouldn't fly passengers!)\n\nSo we entered the aircraft, with me being on the left seat (captain's seat!). This is what the view from the pilot's seat looks like on a Cessna 172\n\nLike cars, this Cessna comes with a key to start the engine, which is logical, considering that it's a piston engine that powers the Cessna (My guess is that it is the Continental O-300). We put on our headsets and adjusted the seat to ensure that I can operate the rudder pedals and brakes properly. The yoke is the \"steering wheel\" equivalent in this case. The seat belt was worn and the entire process of finding a comfortable flying position was similar to how one would do it in a car. No electronic adjusts here, everything is manual. Both of us used noise-cancelling headsets for communication with each other, while Rik said he would be the sole one to communicate with the ATC while making it clear that the aircraft controls during final approach and landing is going to be exclusively his.\n\nIt was now time to insert the key into the key-slot (seen at the bottom left of the controls image, close to the yoke) and turn it two notches (just like we do in a car!). The electronics fired up and I could see some lights and the fuel gauge come alive. We verified the fuel quantity and I performed a control check. The controls felt very heavy, but Rik mentioned that it will be fine once we're on the move.\n\nStarting up the Cessna and taxiing to the runway\n\nIt was now time to crank the aircraft. I don't remember a \"startup clearance\" communication with the ATC, but that might be my bad memory. Nonetheless, I cranked the engine by turning the key to the ignition position (again, just like a car!) and the piston engine sputtered to life. It goes without saying that one must release the key once the engine has started\n\nGiven my experience with the flight simulator, my passion and theoretical knowledge of controlling a Cessna 172, Rik said he'll allow me to taxi to the active runway and take off. I was super excited and my instructor shared my excitement.\n\nOnce we had the clearance to Taxi, Rik increased the power and moved the aircraft out of the parking spot to the taxiway and with the command \"Your controls\", he gave me the controls. What was about to happen can also be related to the first driving lesson for a lot of us- I started over-controlling. Like how some newbies turn the steering a bit too much to left and right to maintain a straight line at slow speeds, I did the same by pressing my foot on the rudder pedal a bit too much. The aircraft was now zig-zagging on the taxiway and it didn't take too long for Rik to say \"My controls\" and take back controls. Strike 1.\n\n\"You must not push the rudder pedal too much. Be gentle on the controls! Try again\". Rik said and I remembered that the simulator also used to warn me for the same thing. Nonetheless, I followed his command and could then control the Cessna right upto the runway hold short point. It wasn't too long of a taxi distance, maybe 300 meters or so.\n\n\"I was thinking of letting you take off, but I am not so sure anymore!\" said Rik. Oh boy, this is not good. I asked for a second chance by asking \"How about you control the rudder to keep us on the centre line and I'll control the yoke and the throttle, if that's OK with you?\".\n\nHe agreed. So far, very similar to a driving lesson.\n\nThe airport we were at is not yet operational for commercial traffic, but multiple flying schools were active. We had a Piper Archer ahead of us while a Cessna 172 was on short final for landing. While we were waiting, Rik briefed me about the upwind pattern. \"Take off and maintain runway heading to climb till you see a set of trees on your left, that's our cue to turn to the left and continue our climb to 1000 feet. Do not use the rudder- just bank left about 10-15 degrees using the yoke to make the left turn.\"\n\nAfter waiting for the Cessna to land and the Piper to take off, it was our turn to fly. Rik requested takeoff clearance and aligned us with the runway centreline.\n\n\"Now, push the throttle lever all the way in and at 60 knots, we'll rotate\". said Rik. For reference, the throttle lever is the black knobbed stick, to the left of the red knobbed stick at the bottom right of the controls image attached above.\n\nContinue reading govindremesh's experience for BHPian comments, insights and more information.",

            "content": "We are going to sail her home via a different route than last year.\n\nBHPian Jeroen recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nAnother day fiddling on Sirion! I spent another day on Sirion doing a bunch of odd jobs. The first thing when I got to the marina is to hook her up to shore power.\n\nI had noticed the batteries were about down to 25% charge. Not a problem after not being used for almost three months and this cold weather. You better start charging them up.\n\nFixed the missing Bimi-hook-thingy- attachment. I checked all the other ones and tightened them up.\n\nThe main job for today, though, was to install my new iPad converter. See my previous post on the purpose of this little electronic box.\n\nIt means opening up the dashboard and various lockers to get access. I was a bit apprehensive about routing the cable inside the various cable ducts. As you might recall I had huge trouble getting the radar cable through. Luckily this particular cable had a smaller diameter. I had come prepared with all my \"cable-pulling tools\". Luckily I managed to get it through in literally a few minutes. Last time it took several hours. So again, practice makes perfect I guess.\n\nUsing my trusted bit of plastic flexible cable puller here.\n\nOut it comes!\n\nThe Installation instruction calls for this box to be mounted at least 0,5m away from other electronic boxes.\n\nPretty straightforward installation job, but it still requires a lot of tooling, and removing panels. All of sudden, the Sirion cabin is full of stuff.\n\nThe new electronic box powered up without any problems. Going by the LEDs it is also handling the data. On my Raymarine Display, I can see it is on the Network as well. However, I could not log onto the WiFi signal with my iPad.I had quite a long cable so I could move the box around a bit see if that made any difference, but no!\n\nI called Smart Marine, the supplier and spoke to Hans who had also advised me on which box to get. Hans is well-known in yachting circles. He has helped many people and I see excellent reviews on social media all the time.\n\nWe checked a few things. Hans thought there might be interference from other WiFi sources. Look at the image of the available networks. The first one is the new box I am trying to connect to. The one below, Quantum etc, is a network from a Raymarine navigation system (in this case the radar). It is not my Raymarine and or radar. I don't use WiFi, I keep it switched off unless I am updating the Raymarine Software. I double-checked by powering down all my equipment and my iPad still saw this one. So somebody has left their radar on!\n\nI am not sure if this is really the cause of my not being able to log onto my new box. Hans suggested waiting until Sirion was out in the open again and seeing what that brings. For now, I'm ok with that. Let's see what happens.\n\nI had a long chat with Anton, the yacht painter. He has been talking to Andre and his guys (harbourmaster). Sirion is going to be moved outside by the end of this week. Anton will fix the paint scratch on the bow. With Sirion outside, but still ashore, I will be able to hose down her decks and superstructure and polish/wax the deck and superstructure.\n\nAnd test my electronic convertor box of course.\n\nThe last job I did, was to polish the propellor blades! Left before, right after.\n\nThe provisional planning is for us to board Sirion on the 1st of April. We are going to sail her home via a different route than last year. For several reasons, the most important one we want to explore a different route. Also, the very first lock we would encounter of the normal route south is out of commission from 1st to 16th of April. So we have to choose a different route. We will sail up to Kampen, sail up the river IJssel, join the Nederrijn, Lek and finally make our way into the Merwedekanaal. We will have 3-4 overnights on Sirion.\n\nOur original plan was to sail all the way north to Friesland and do a bit of exploration. But that will take a lot more time and we have some other things and events to attend to.\n\nFingers crossed all final preparations and jobs go well in the next week!\n\nJeroen\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Investors in BHP Group Ltd (Symbol: BHP) saw new options become available today, for the November 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 246 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BHP options chain for the new November 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BHP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.07/share today.\n\nBecause the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.16% return on the cash commitment, or 4.68% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for BHP Group Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of BHP stock at the current price level of $49.07/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.87% if the stock gets called away at the November 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BHP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for BHP Group Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BHP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.97% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.07) to be 25%.

For example Volkswagen was the biggest car maker in year 2008, in 2025 the biggest car maker by Market Cap is TeslaAny Business has 4 major stages- Introduction, Growth, Maturity and then Decline. All businesses including automakers also go through the 4 stages. In order and to attest the 4th stage, car makers plan various strategies to expand and rejuvenateStrategy 1. DiversificationMoving into other zones, territories, and entering new horizon. Done mainly to expand. Can be performed via Investment, Expansion projects, Acquisition, Mergers, etc.Strategy 2. RebrandingChanging the known brand image into something new, this is performed through process of communication which reflects the changeStrategy 3. Letting go off Non Performing AssetsIn any organization there are Non Performing Assets or assets that don't provide adequate return on investment.

            "content": "The 2025 390 Adventure also gets the crawl function that ensures the bike will not stall if you let go of the accelerator; it'll keep the bike running at specific speeds (~10 km/h in the first gear for instance) and manage the rpms to prevent killing the engine.\n\nRiding the KTM 390 Adventure\n\nThe new 390 Adventure gets the same 399cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled four-valve DOHC engine that debuted on the 2024 Duke 390. This LC4c engine is capable of producing 45 BHP @ 8,500 rpm with a peak torque of 39 Nm @ 6,500 rpm. 80% of the torque is available right from 5,000 rpm. Purely for academic interest, with the new engine, the bike gets a bump of ~25cc, translating to about an additional 2.5 BHP and 2 Nm.\n\nWhile the 2024 Duke 390 is an absolute maniac to ride, the 2025 390 Adventure has a much more sane power delivery. There's ample power on tap and it makes its presence felt without an ounce of hesitation, but it is delivered gently. KTM has also worked on the torque delivery of this engine to ensure that it generates enough pull through the rpm range. The power and torque delivery chart provides ample evidence of just how humongous the mid-range is, supported strongly by the top-end that has more than enough juice to allow you to cruise at the upper end of the legal speed limit. The new engine gets a bump in torque at the low-end of almost 5 Nm.\n\nThe second and third gears are the most fun to be in given how tractable they are and the comprehensiveness of the power/rpm band.\n\nRemember, the 2025 390 Adventure also gets the crawl function that ensures the bike will not stall if you let go of the accelerator; it'll keep the bike running at specific speeds (~10 km/h in the first gear for instance) and manage the rpms to prevent killing the engine.\n\nA redesigned sprocket, with three additional teeth, plays a part as well in the difference in the power and torque output.\n\nThe 390 Adventure gets a curved radiator with two cooling fans, allowing for more efficient cooling. There was hardly any heat felt on the legs/thighs even as the coolant temperature touched ~100 degrees C while riding on trails or when riding through dense city traffic. We put the bike through the off-road trail and even then, it chugged along effortlessly without a drastic rise in temperature. On some other bikes on similar trails, we have had instances where we've seen the high coolant temperature warning and even the check engine light, where the bike shut off proactively. The heat management seems to be better in the new 390 Adventure.\n\nRounding up the powertrain is the 6-speed manual gearbox that gets a slipper clutch and quickshifter as standard.\n\nThe quickshifter is pretty good - a definite improvement over the outgoing 390 Adventure. That had a noticeable tentativeness in executing the gearshifts. The downshifts are generally smooth, quick and effortless, and come with just a missable hint of a jerk. That said, the gear lever, during upshifts, tends to be hard and feels like it is resisting the gear change. Throughout our test ride, we found the quickshifter to be most comfortable with upshifts when the rpm is ~4,000 +/- 100. The gearshifts between 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 gears are slightly jerky, while those between 4 - 5 - 6 gears are significantly smoother.\n\nFor academic consideration, KTM claims that the new 390 Adventure does 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds (down 0.2 seconds compared to the outgoing version); and 0 to 100 in 6.2 seconds (down 0.5 seconds).\n\nRiding Modes\n\nThe 390 Adventure comes with three riding modes - Street, Off-Road, and Rain. You can customise the ABS, traction control and quickshifter for each riding mode and for the Off-Road mode, you can even set the throttle response.\n\nABS: You can choose ABS to be in the Road or Off-Road setting. ABS is available on both wheels when in Road mode and is switched off on the rear wheel when you choose Off-Road mode.\n\nTraction control, quickshifter: These come with simple On/Off options.\n\nThrottle response: This new customisation is available in the Off-Road mode and determines the aggressiveness of power delivery on tusiting the throttle. This setting comes with three options: Rain, Street, Off-Road, in increasing order of urgency of output. The Rain mode provides a very measured throttle response, allowing for cautious riding, while the Off-Road mode lets loose the 46 horses from the engine. The Off-Road mode follows a linear, almost 45 degree, response for power vs. rpm, while Street has a moderate low-end, a lively mid, and an enthusiastic top-end. The power curve in the Road mode is very subdued in the low-end (compared to the outgoing 390 Adventure), with the pace picking up in the mid and top end.\n\nA common first reaction to the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure, especially since most would start in the Street mode, is the relaxed throttle response and power on tap. It just feels so very un-KTM-like. But switch to the Off-Road mode and it just becomes an entirely different bike, with a very different character. Throttle input translates to power without hesitation, and the engine makes its entire faculties available for use. No holds barred, just ready to rock 'n roll! Having the Off-Road mode to be the most aggressive mode seems to align with KTM's vision for the 390 Adventure to go back to its roots as a hardcore off-roader.\n\nThere's a very good chance riders may want to be in Off-Road mode for throttle response while turning on the electronic aids, even for everyday riding, just to enjoy the KTM's capable 399cc LC4c engine.\n\nOff-roading with the 390 Adventure\n\nDuring the time that we had the bike with us for review, we were able to take it for a ride over a variety of terrain - a typical hill laden with rocks of all sizes, a trail around a lake with hard soil, and a hardcore off-road trail on a hill that led to the backwaters of a dam.\n\nWith the bike in Off-Road mode, off we went. Remember that in this mode, rear ABS is turned off and throttle response is at the highest setting. The trail consisted of passing through hard mud, patches with lots of stones, thick foliage and lots of areas with steep gradients that had an inch or so of very loose soil. No complaints or a wish list, really, of what could be better in the bike. The crawl feature allows you to remain in gear without stalling. The throttle response is aggressive and that comes in handy in getting out of tricky spots quickly and correspondingly, engine braking is more aggressive (compared to the older 390 Adventure). This reduces the need for braking by allowing you to modulate your speed. The ergonomics are pretty sorted as well and you can sit or stand and ride with ease. The foot lever/pegs could be a tad more comfortable if you take the rubber bushing off.\n\nRefinement & NVH\n\nThe new engine is very refined and you don't feel any unusual vibrations, feedback or harshness on the physical touch-points with the bike in your typical riding conditions. The engine of the 390 Adventure is a single-cylinder unit, so it carries the typical vibrations one would expect in a single-cylinder. The tight fit of the instrument cluster and ORVMs ensure things don't get blurry even if the view up front does.\n\nAnother aspect of the bike that is very un-KTM-like is the exhaust note. It isn't the typical tune that we're so accustomed to with KTMs. There's only a handful of rpms where it bears the hint of a KTM, otherwise, it's a very vanilla growl.\n\nThe tall windscreen that the 2025 390 Adventure gets as standard does a good job of deflecting the airflow from your chest/face and subjects your ears to much lesser wind noise.\n\nSuspension and Handling\n\nThe 2025 390 Adventure carries forward the adjustable front suspension, introduced on the 2023 390 Adventure, along with the adjustable rear suspension.\n\nAt the front, you get a 43 mm WP APEX USD (Upside Down) open cartridge fork suspension with a 200 mm travel that can be adjusted for compression and rebound damping. The front suspension gets a 30-step adjustment. Adjustments for both compression and rebound, are easy with simple turn-switches on the top of the forks under the handlebar. You can make these adjustments without the need for any tool.\n\nAt the rear is the WP APEX monoshock suspension with 205 mm travel. It allows a 20-step rebound damping and is 10-step preload adjustment. To change the suspension setting here, you'll need a C-spanner and a screwdriver.\n\nThe 390 Adventure continues to be effortless to handle and across a variety of terrain, the bike feels surprisingly nice to ride. The suspension is set up well, and a ride on bad roads isn't backbreaking.\n\nThe ground clearance has gone up noticeably to 237 mm, from 200 mm of the outgoing model. The wheelbase is 1,470 mm, and although the 2025 iteration is a kg heavier than the old bike, it is as easy to very to flick around the trails, as it is to navigate through the city.\n\nBraking\n\nBraking duties are handled by disc brakes from Bybre, Brembo's brand for small to medium-sized motorcycles, which has now become the norm for most bikes in the segment. At the front is the 320 mm disc with the new four-piston axially-mounted calliper, while the rear gets a 240 mm disc brake with the new twin-piston floating calliper. The 390 Adventure gets sintered brake pads and axial callipers.\n\nThe 2025 390 Adventure gets several electronic riding aids as standard such as cornering and off-road ABS and traction control. These are customisable through the MID and can be defined independently for each ride mode.\n\nThe brakes are competent, and using them in conjunction with engine braking by leveraging the quickshifter, makes braking a breeze in most situations.\n\nHowever, as a slightly unusual experience, we found the ABS triggered far too often during hard or high-speed braking, even on surfaces that offered very good traction. It just felt unnecessary and a departure from the braking behaviour of other bikes. It gives you a momentary feeling of uncertainty about how effective the braking will be. The braking capability from the brake infrastructure doesn't seem to be a problem. Perhaps it has to do with how the ABS is set up, or maybe even the tyres.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe KTM 390 Adventure has made a name for itself over the years - a competent off-roader and a fairly comfortable tourer. There's not really been a lot to find fault over in the bike - a capable engine, equipped with all the hardware and electronics that you'd want in the segment or even a segment above and reasonably comfortable for the purpose it has been built for.\n\nThe new generation has a tall legacy to live up to, and it does look like it will carry on with the good work of its predecessor. There are plenty of hits, some changes that you'd feel neutral about, and a few misses, but at the end of the day, when it comes to it, you'd want to carry your cheque book along and get yourself the 390 Adventure.\n\nWe mentioned in the KTM Duke 390 review that the bike is an absolute hooligan. The 2025 390 Adventure comes across as one that has seen things, has a few grey hairs, and is now, wiser.\n\nContinue reading the discussion on the KTM 390 Adventure on our forum.",

            "content": "libranof1987 Team-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2010 Location: All over! Posts: 8,134 Thanked: 20,485 Times\n\nRiding the KTM 390 Adventure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new 390 Adventure gets the same 399cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled four-valve DOHC engine that debuted on the 2024 Duke 390. This LC4c engine is capable of producing 45 BHP @ 8,500 rpm with a peak torque of 39 Nm @ 6,500 rpm. 80% of the torque is available right from 5,000 rpm. Purely for academic interest, with the new engine, the bike gets a bump of ~25cc, translating to about an additional 2.5 BHP and 2 Nm.\n\n\n\nWhile the 2024 Duke 390 is an absolute maniac to ride, the 2025 390 Adventure has a much more sane power delivery. There's ample power on tap and it makes its presence felt without an ounce of hesitation, but it is delivered gently. KTM has also worked on the torque delivery of this engine to ensure that it generates enough pull through the rpm range. The power and torque delivery chart provides ample evidence of just how humongous the mid-range is, supported strongly by the top-end that has more than enough juice to allow you to cruise at the upper end of the legal speed limit. The new engine gets a bump in torque at the low-end of almost 5 Nm.\n\n\n\nThe second and third gears are the most fun to be in given how tractable they are and the comprehensiveness of the power/rpm band.\n\n\n\nRemember, the 2025 390 Adventure also gets the crawl function that ensures the bike will not stall if you let go of the accelerator; it'll keep the bike running at specific speeds (~10 km/h in the first gear for instance) and manage the rpms to prevent killing the engine.\n\n\n\nA redesigned sprocket, with three additional teeth, plays a part as well in the difference in the power and torque output.\n\n\n\nThe 390 Adventure gets a curved radiator with two cooling fans, allowing for more efficient cooling. There was hardly any heat felt on the legs/thighs even as the coolant temperature touched ~100 degrees C while riding on trails or when riding through dense city traffic. We put the bike through the off-road trail and even then, it chugged along effortlessly without a drastic rise in temperature. On some other bikes on similar trails, we have had instances where we've seen the high coolant temperature warning and even the check engine light, where the bike shut off proactively. The heat management seems to be better in the new 390 Adventure.\n\n\n\nRounding up the powertrain is the 6-speed manual gearbox that gets a slipper clutch and quickshifter as standard.\n\n\n\nThe quickshifter is pretty good - a definite improvement over the outgoing 390 Adventure. That had a noticeable tentativeness in executing the gearshifts. The downshifts are generally smooth, quick and effortless, and come with just a missable hint of a jerk. That said, the gear lever, during upshifts, tends to be hard and feels like it is resisting the gear change. Throughout our test ride, we found the quickshifter to be most comfortable with upshifts when the rpm is ~4,000 +/- 100. The gearshifts between 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 gears are slightly jerky, while those between 4 - 5 - 6 gears are significantly smoother.\n\n\n\nFor academic consideration, KTM claims that the new 390 Adventure does 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds (down 0.2 seconds compared to the outgoing version); and 0 to 100 in 6.2 seconds (down 0.5 seconds).\n\n\n\nRiding Modes\n\n\n\nThe 390 Adventure comes with three riding modes - Street, Off-Road, and Rain. You can customise the ABS, traction control and quickshifter for each riding mode and for the Off-Road mode, you can even set the throttle response.\n\n\n\nABS: You can choose ABS to be in the Road or Off-Road setting. ABS is available on both wheels when in Road mode and is switched off on the rear wheel when you choose Off-Road mode.\n\n\n\nTraction control, quickshifter: These come with simple On/Off options.\n\n\n\nThrottle response: This new customisation is available in the Off-Road mode and determines the aggressiveness of power delivery on tusiting the throttle. This setting comes with three options: Rain, Street, Off-Road, in increasing order of urgency of output. The Rain mode provides a very measured throttle response, allowing for cautious riding, while the Off-Road mode lets loose the 46 horses from the engine. The Off-Road mode follows a linear, almost 45 degree, response for power vs. rpm, while Street has a moderate low-end, a lively mid, and an enthusiastic top-end. The power curve in the Road mode is very subdued in the low-end (compared to the outgoing 390 Adventure), with the pace picking up in the mid and top end.\n\n\n\nA common first reaction to the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure, especially since most would start in the Street mode, is the relaxed throttle response and power on tap. It just feels so very un-KTM-like. But switch to the Off-Road mode and it just becomes an entirely different bike, with a very different character. Throttle input translates to power without hesitation, and the engine makes its entire faculties available for use. No holds barred, just ready to rock 'n roll! Having the Off-Road mode to be the most aggressive mode seems to align with KTM's vision for the 390 Adventure to go back to its roots as a hardcore off-roader.\n\n\n\nThere's a very good chance riders may want to be in Off-Road mode for throttle response while turning on the electronic aids, even for everyday riding, just to enjoy the KTM's capable 399cc LC4c engine.\n\n\n\nOff-roading with the 390 Adventure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the time that we had the bike with us for review, we were able to take it for a ride over a variety of terrain - a typical hill laden with rocks of all sizes, a trail around a lake with hard soil, and a hardcore off-road trail on a hill that led to the backwaters of a dam.\n\n\n\nWith the bike in Off-Road mode, off we went. Remember that in this mode, rear ABS is turned off and throttle response is at the highest setting. The trail consisted of passing through hard mud, patches with lots of stones, thick foliage and lots of areas with steep gradients that had an inch or so of very loose soil. No complaints or a wish list, really, of what could be better in the bike. The crawl feature allows you to remain in gear without stalling. The throttle response is aggressive and that comes in handy in getting out of tricky spots quickly and correspondingly, engine braking is more aggressive (compared to the older 390 Adventure). This reduces the need for braking by allowing you to modulate your speed. The ergonomics are pretty sorted as well and you can sit or stand and ride with ease. The foot lever/pegs could be a tad more comfortable if you take the rubber bushing off.\n\n\n\nRefinement & NVH\n\n\n\nThe new engine is very refined and you don't feel any unusual vibrations, feedback or harshness on the physical touch-points with the bike in your typical riding conditions. The engine of the 390 Adventure is a single-cylinder unit, so it carries the typical vibrations one would expect in a single-cylinder. The tight fit of the instrument cluster and ORVMs ensure things don't get blurry even if the view up front does.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of the bike that is very un-KTM-like is the exhaust note. It isn't the typical tune that we're so accustomed to with KTMs. There's only a handful of rpms where it bears the hint of a KTM, otherwise, it's a very vanilla growl.\n\n\n\nThe tall windscreen that the 2025 390 Adventure gets as standard does a good job of deflecting the airflow from your chest/face and subjects your ears to much lesser wind noise.\n\n\n\nSuspension and Handling\n\n\n\nThe 2025 390 Adventure carries forward the adjustable front suspension, introduced on the 2023 390 Adventure, along with the adjustable rear suspension.\n\n\n\nAt the front, you get a 43 mm WP APEX USD (Upside Down) open cartridge fork suspension with a 200 mm travel that can be adjusted for compression and rebound damping. The front suspension gets a 30-step adjustment. Adjustments for both compression and rebound, are easy with simple turn-switches on the top of the forks under the handlebar. You can make these adjustments without the need for any tool.\n\n\n\nAt the rear is the WP APEX monoshock suspension with 205 mm travel. It allows a 20-step rebound damping and is 10-step preload adjustment. To change the suspension setting here, you'll need a C-spanner and a screwdriver.\n\n\n\nThe 390 Adventure continues to be effortless to handle and across a variety of terrain, the bike feels surprisingly nice to ride. The suspension is set up well, and a ride on bad roads isn't backbreaking.\n\n\n\nThe ground clearance has gone up noticeably to 237 mm, from 200 mm of the outgoing model. The wheelbase is 1,470 mm, and although the 2025 iteration is a kg heavier than the old bike, it is as easy to very to flick around the trails, as it is to navigate through the city.\n\n\n\nBraking\n\n\n\nBraking duties are handled by disc brakes from Bybre, Brembo's brand for small to medium-sized motorcycles, which has now become the norm for most bikes in the segment. At the front is the 320 mm disc with the new four-piston axially-mounted calliper, while the rear gets a 240 mm disc brake with the new twin-piston floating calliper. The 390 Adventure gets sintered brake pads and axial callipers.\n\n\n\nThe 2025 390 Adventure gets several electronic riding aids as standard such as cornering and off-road ABS and traction control. These are customisable through the MID and can be defined independently for each ride mode.\n\n\n\nThe brakes are competent, and using them in conjunction with engine braking by leveraging the quickshifter, makes braking a breeze in most situations.\n\n\n\nHowever, as a slightly unusual experience, we found the ABS triggered far too often during hard or high-speed braking, even on surfaces that offered very good traction. It just felt unnecessary and a departure from the braking behaviour of other bikes. It gives you a momentary feeling of uncertainty about how effective the braking will be. The braking capability from the brake infrastructure doesn't seem to be a problem. Perhaps it has to do with how the ABS is set up, or maybe even the tyres.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\n\n\nThe KTM 390 Adventure has made a name for itself over the years - a competent off-roader and a fairly comfortable tourer. There's not really been a lot to find fault over in the bike - a capable engine, equipped with all the hardware and electronics that you'd want in the segment or even a segment above and reasonably comfortable for the purpose it has been built for.\n\n\n\nThe new generation has a tall legacy to live up to, and it does look like it will carry on with the good work of its predecessor. There are plenty of hits, some changes that you'd feel neutral about, and a few misses, but at the end of the day, when it comes to it, you'd want to carry your cheque book along and get yourself the 390 Adventure.\n\n\n\nWe mentioned in the KTM Duke 390 review that the bike is an absolute hooligan. The 2025 390 Adventure comes across as one that has seen things, has a few grey hairs, and is now, wiser. The new 390 Adventure gets the same 399cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled four-valve DOHC engine that debuted on the 2024 Duke 390. This LC4c engine is capable of producing 45 BHP @ 8,500 rpm with a peak torque of 39 Nm @ 6,500 rpm. 80% of the torque is available right from 5,000 rpm. Purely for academic interest, with the new engine, the bike gets a bump of ~25cc, translating to about an additional 2.5 BHP and 2 Nm.While the 2024 Duke 390 is an absolute maniac to ride, the 2025 390 Adventure has a much more sane power delivery. There's ample power on tap and it makes its presence felt without an ounce of hesitation, but it is delivered gently. KTM has also worked on the torque delivery of this engine to ensure that it generates enough pull through the rpm range. The power and torque delivery chart provides ample evidence of just how humongous the mid-range is, supported strongly by the top-end that has more than enough juice to allow you to cruise at the upper end of the legal speed limit. The new engine gets a bump in torque at the low-end of almost 5 Nm.The second and third gears are the most fun to be in given how tractable they are and the comprehensiveness of the power/rpm band.Remember, the 2025 390 Adventure also gets the crawl function that ensures the bike will not stall if you let go of the accelerator; it'll keep the bike running at specific speeds (~10 km/h in the first gear for instance) and manage the rpms to prevent killing the engine.A redesigned sprocket, with three additional teeth, plays a part as well in the difference in the power and torque output.The 390 Adventure gets a curved radiator with two cooling fans, allowing for more efficient cooling. There was hardly any heat felt on the legs/thighs even as the coolant temperature touched ~100 degrees C while riding on trails or when riding through dense city traffic. We put the bike through the off-road trail and even then, it chugged along effortlessly without a drastic rise in temperature. On some other bikes on similar trails, we have had instances where we've seen the high coolant temperature warning and even the check engine light, where the bike shut off proactively. The heat management seems to be better in the new 390 Adventure.Rounding up the powertrain is the 6-speed manual gearbox that gets a slipper clutch and quickshifter as standard.The quickshifter is pretty good - a definite improvement over the outgoing 390 Adventure. That had a noticeable tentativeness in executing the gearshifts. The downshifts are generally smooth, quick and effortless, and come with just a missable hint of a jerk. That said, the gear lever, during upshifts, tends to be hard and feels like it is resisting the gear change. Throughout our test ride, we found the quickshifter to be most comfortable with upshifts when the rpm is ~4,000 +/- 100. The gearshifts between 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 gears are slightly jerky, while those between 4 - 5 - 6 gears are significantly smoother.For academic consideration, KTM claims that the new 390 Adventure does 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds (down 0.2 seconds compared to the outgoing version); and 0 to 100 in 6.2 seconds (down 0.5 seconds).The 390 Adventure comes with three riding modes - Street, Off-Road, and Rain. You can customise the ABS, traction control and quickshifter for each riding mode and for the Off-Road mode, you can even set the throttle response.ABS: You can choose ABS to be in the Road or Off-Road setting. ABS is available on both wheels when in Road mode and is switched off on the rear wheel when you choose Off-Road mode.Traction control, quickshifter: These come with simple On/Off options.Throttle response: This new customisation is available in the Off-Road mode and determines the aggressiveness of power delivery on tusiting the throttle. This setting comes with three options: Rain, Street, Off-Road, in increasing order of urgency of output. The Rain mode provides a very measured throttle response, allowing for cautious riding, while the Off-Road mode lets loose the 46 horses from the engine. The Off-Road mode follows a linear, almost 45 degree, response for power vs. rpm, while Street has a moderate low-end, a lively mid, and an enthusiastic top-end. The power curve in the Road mode is very subdued in the low-end (compared to the outgoing 390 Adventure), with the pace picking up in the mid and top end.A common first reaction to the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure, especially since most would start in the Street mode, is the relaxed throttle response and power on tap. It just feels so very un-KTM-like. But switch to the Off-Road mode and it just becomes an entirely different bike, with a very different character. Throttle input translates to power without hesitation, and the engine makes its entire faculties available for use. No holds barred, just ready to rock 'n roll! Having the Off-Road mode to be the most aggressive mode seems to align with KTM's vision for the 390 Adventure to go back to its roots as a hardcore off-roader.There's a very good chance riders may want to be in Off-Road mode for throttle response while turning on the electronic aids, even for everyday riding, just to enjoy the KTM's capable 399cc LC4c engine.During the time that we had the bike with us for review, we were able to take it for a ride over a variety of terrain - a typical hill laden with rocks of all sizes, a trail around a lake with hard soil, and a hardcore off-road trail on a hill that led to the backwaters of a dam.With the bike in Off-Road mode, off we went. Remember that in this mode, rear ABS is turned off and throttle response is at the highest setting. The trail consisted of passing through hard mud, patches with lots of stones, thick foliage and lots of areas with steep gradients that had an inch or so of very loose soil. No complaints or a wish list, really, of what could be better in the bike. The crawl feature allows you to remain in gear without stalling. The throttle response is aggressive and that comes in handy in getting out of tricky spots quickly and correspondingly, engine braking is more aggressive (compared to the older 390 Adventure). This reduces the need for braking by allowing you to modulate your speed. The ergonomics are pretty sorted as well and you can sit or stand and ride with ease. The foot lever/pegs could be a tad more comfortable if you take the rubber bushing off.The new engine is very refined and you don't feel any unusual vibrations, feedback or harshness on the physical touch-points with the bike in your typical riding conditions. The engine of the 390 Adventure is a single-cylinder unit, so it carries the typical vibrations one would expect in a single-cylinder. The tight fit of the instrument cluster and ORVMs ensure things don't get blurry even if the view up front does.Another aspect of the bike that is very un-KTM-like is the exhaust note. It isn't the typical tune that we're so accustomed to with KTMs. There's only a handful of rpms where it bears the hint of a KTM, otherwise, it's a very vanilla growl.The tall windscreen that the 2025 390 Adventure gets as standard does a good job of deflecting the airflow from your chest/face and subjects your ears to much lesser wind noise.The 2025 390 Adventure carries forward the adjustable front suspension, introduced on the 2023 390 Adventure, along with the adjustable rear suspension.At the front, you get a 43 mm WP APEX USD (Upside Down) open cartridge fork suspension with a 200 mm travel that can be adjusted for compression and rebound damping.

It\u2019s a dangerous cultural shift where entertainment is being prioritised over safety.\n\nBHPian soji recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve noticed a disturbing trend on our roads\u2014an increasing number of cab drivers and even private vehicle owners watching reels and videos while driving. It\u2019s happening everywhere. At traffic signals, on highways, and even in stop-and-go traffic, I frequently see drivers glued to their phones, scrolling through social media.\n\nI used to think distracted driving was mostly about calls or texting. But now, short video platforms have taken this to another level. It\u2019s not just a momentary distraction anymore; it\u2019s full-on entertainment at the cost of safety.\n\nThe Alarming Reality\n\n\n\nJust last week, I was in a cab on my way to the office. The driver had his phone mounted on the dashboard towards the right, playing reels continuously. His eyes darted between the road and his screen. Every time he laughed or reacted to a video, my anxiety levels spiked. I had to politely ask him to stop, and while he obliged, he seemed indifferent\u2014like it was no big deal.\n\nI wish I could say, this was a one-off incident, but it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve seen it with private car owners too\u2014some holding their phones in one hand while navigating through traffic with the other. The worst part? Many don\u2019t even think they\u2019re doing anything wrong.\n\nWhy Is This Happening?\n\nAddiction to Short Videos \u2013 Social media algorithms are designed to hook users, making it hard to stop scrolling, even while driving.\n\n\u2013 Social media algorithms are designed to hook users, making it hard to stop scrolling, even while driving.

No Immediate Consequences \u2013 Unlike drunk driving or running a red light, watching reels doesn\u2019t have an instant penalty unless it results in an accident.\n\nAccording to multiple studies, taking your eyes off the road for just 2 seconds doubles the risk of a crash. Watching a reel? That\u2019s easily 5\u201310 seconds of distraction. At 60 km/h, that means the car moves 100\u2013150 meters blind. That\u2019s more than enough to hit another vehicle, a pedestrian, or lose control.\n\nWhat Can We Do?\n\nSpread Awareness \u2013 Talk about it.

As car lovers, enthusiasts, and responsible citizens, we need to take this seriously. A moment of distraction is all it takes for an irreversible tragedy.\n\nHere's what BHPian arnav17 replied:\n\nVery true. Most of the Auto drivers who I go with keep watching videos on full volume, and due to that, they are distracted and drive slower than usual, making me late everywhere I go. Another important point is that all these new aftermarket android head units encourage users to watch movies and what not while driving. This should be strictly discouraged IMHO.\n\nHere's what BHPian roy_libran replied:\n\nAutomobiles need a tech solution now to PREVENT drivers from using mobile phones while driving. And governments need to mandate this Tech in all automobiles. It's getting crazier by the day!\n\nHere's what BHPian bblost replied:\n\nI have also observed this new trend and it's frankly very scary. At least the people in cars and autos have a false illusion of safety, but the organ donors on motorcycles take it to a different level.\n\nHere's what BHPian Samurai replied:\n\nUnless the apps are forced to suspend playing videos while the phones are moving, this menace will not go away. Laws are not going to help here. Only a tech enforced ban can work.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "China\u2019s economy and trade tariffs are serious challenges, but some commodities like copper are booming.\n\nGlobal commodities stocks have been caught up directly in the trade war between the US and China. But despite the tariff-related volatility spreading through global markets this year, some of the largest UK-listed mining stocks have managed to gain ground.\n\nShares in the largest FTSE 100 mining stock, Rio Tinto RIO, have risen year to date but are still screening as undervalued. The Morningstar UK Basic Materials Index, which holds Rio Tinto as its largest holding with a 36% weight, is up so far in 2025.\n\nDespite the obvious challenges, there are positives for the sector too: the renewable energy transition is resource intensive, and commodities like copper are booming.\n\nChina\u2019s Economic Growth is Key for Mining Stocks\n\nAs a resource-hungry country, China is a swing factor for mining companies. They benefited from the post-pandemic bounce in 2021 and were able to distribute special dividends on the back of exceptional profits.\n\nBut China\u2019s appetite for raw materials slowed as the economy battled an ailing property sector, weak consumer demand, and, most recently, Trump\u2019s tariffs. Still, the country has shown a willingness to pump cash into the economy in a bid to reinvigorate growth - and this has helped boost demand for mined products for infrastructure projects.\n\nMichael Field, chief market strategist EMEA at Morningstar, says that China doesn\u2019t need to be booming for mining stocks to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese economy has been struggling since the pandemic. But if you look at their targets for the year, China\u2019s still looking to grow at 5%. Do I think China\u2019s going to have a blowout year and miners are going to benefit as a result? No, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do we need that to happen for miners to do well? No. They\u2019ve been managing so far without that massive growth from China.\u201d\n\nAnd while the era of bumper special dividends may be over for now, London-listed miners are still in scope for dividend investors.\n\nCallum Abbot, portfolio manager of the JP Morgan UK Equity Core Fund, which has a Morningstar Bronze Medalist Rating, says:\n\n\u201cWe like the cash generation, we like that they are more shareholder friendly, that they are giving us good dividends. We like that they are buying back their shares, and we think this will continue going forwards.\u201d\n\nWhich Mining Stocks Are Overvalued or Undervalued?\n\nMorningstar analysts cover four mining stocks: two of these, Glencore GLEN and Rio Tinto, are screening as undervalued, while Anglo American ANGLO and BHP Group BHP are screening as fairly valued.\n\nThere has been plenty of consolidation in the sector too as the mining giants battle slower growth: Rio Tinto and Glencore held talks on a merger last year, while BHP moved its primary listing to Australia in 2022. Anglo American, which has a secondary listing in South Africa, has also been the target of BHP\u2019s takeover interest.\n\nAfter recent results, Morningstar analyst Jon Mills lowered the fair value estimate for Glencore on weaker-than-expected guidance.\n\n\u201cLower near-term thermal coal and metallurgical coal prices along with concerns over the impact of tariffs on economic growth and copper demand are likely why shares trade 34% below our updated fair value estimate,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWith spot thermal coal prices of $100 per metric ton below our assumed midcycle price of $107, Glencore is weighing production cuts at some of its Australian thermal coal mines until prices recover. This is sensible but any cuts are too difficult to quantify at this stage.\u201d\n\nAnglo American and Rio Tinto Earnings\n\nRio Tinto is also screening as undervalued, and Mills says the results, which showed an 8% fall in net profit to $10.9 billon, were in line with expectations.\n\nIron ore prices were a drag on Rio Tinto\u2019s results for the last financial year, he adds.\n\n\u201cA 10% decline in the average realized iron ore price, to $97 per metric ton, and 2% lower iron ore volumes more than offset higher aluminum and copper prices, along with improved copper volumes.\u201d\n\nAnglo American\u2019s results were below expectations, he says. But booming copper prices are keeping shares supported, he adds.\n\n\u201cAfter successfully rebuffing BHP\u2019s overtures, Anglo American continues to streamline its portfolio in line with its strategy to sell all businesses other than copper, iron ore, and Woodsmith, its nascent crop fertilizer business.\n\nAnglo is looking to dispose of its platinum and diamond divisions too.\n\n\u201cThe company also plans to demerge and spin off its platinum group metals business to shareholders later in 2025. And while it still hopes to sell its De Beers diamonds business, it too is likely to be demerged and spun off, in our view. Both industries are currently in cyclical downturns, so this is likely better for shareholders than trying to sell the businesses at potentially depressed prices.\u201d\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Ripcord09 BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2021 Location: Bangalore Posts: 80 Thanked: 1,074 Times\n\nIndia's Pickleball Boom | Do you play this raquet sport?\n\n\n\nQuote: A whopping 275%! That\u0092s how much India\u0092s active pickleball player count has shot up in the past three years. If you put a number to it, that\u0092s around 60,000 players by the end of 2024. And if you count the casual ones who\u0092ve picked up a paddle (pickleball racquet) at least once, that number easily crosses 1 lakh. Quote: Maybe you\u0092ve heard Nikhil Kamath mention it often on his podcast. Or you might have seen celebrity-backed teams battling it out in India\u0092s first and only franchise-based Pickleball League (WPBL) on Sony Sports Network. So you know that it\u0092s a paddle sport played on an open badminton-sized court, a cusp between tennis, table tennis and badminton. And the fact that you already know this is proof that the pickleball buzz is real.\n\n\n\nQuote: Startups and venture capitalists (VCs) are betting big on it, convinced that pickleball could be India\u0092s next sporting revolution, just like IPL (Indian Premier League) was for cricket. Quote: The real boost for pickleball came during the pandemic. Public gyms were out of the question and contact sports weren\u0092t an option. People needed an easy way to stay active. That\u0092s when pickleball took off. Unlike badminton, tennis or squash, which required some kind of training, pickleball was simple to pick up. The rules were basic and anyone from a Gen Alpha kid to a baby boomer retiree could play it.\n\n\n\nQuote: Fast forward to 2022, and India hosted the Bainbridge Cup (named after pickleball\u0092s birthplace), the first international pickleball event in the country. The prize was a staggering $50,000, which was a hefty sum for a non-professional court game! Quote: Its appeal and simplicity wasn\u0092t just about people being able to pick up paddles but also about how easy it was for businesses to jump in. Setting up a pickleball court requires just a fraction of the investment needed for other sports like badminton. A pickleball court can be up and running in about \u20b93-5 lakhs\u0097less than 30% of the \u20b915 lakhs it takes to set up a badminton court.\n\n\n\nQuote: According to The CapTable, India had approximately 200 operational pickleball courts in early 2024. Today, that number has surged past 1,200, with 3-4 new courts popping up every week in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Surat. And with the number of active players projected to hit 1 million by 2028 (up by a staggering 1,500%), demand for courts will only skyrocket to 2,500 courts by then. Quote: If India follows the US model, the scope is even bigger. In the US, where pickleball is the fastest-growing sport, it\u0092s not just about selling paddles online or booking courts, there are full-fledged restaurants and caf\u00e9s built around the game, turning it into a social experience. Tech companies are even stepping in, creating apps that help players find courts, book lessons and organise leagues. And India isn\u0092t far behind.\n\n\n\nQuote: And at this point, you might be thinking, \u0091This sounds like the perfect startup opportunity!\u0092 But hold that thought because while the opportunity is exciting, there are a couple of roadblocks to consider. Quote: The sport is already thriving in urban cities, and expanding from here won\u0092t be a walk in the park. Take Mumbai, for example. Space is a luxury here, and setting up new courts can be a logistical and financial nightmare. This means that businesses which already own a tennis court or a gym might have the upper hand.\n\n\n\nQuote: There\u0092s a chance that the sport gets premiumised\u0097kind of like golf or tennis. Some groups, especially the elite, might want to keep it exclusive rather than let it go fully mainstream. And if that happens, pickleball could shift from being an accessible, community-driven sport to a high-end experience only a select few can afford. Quote: So yeah, the pickleball opportunity is huge. But if it ends up benefitting only a select group, be it businesses, investors or the elite, its growth could become skewed. And that kind of goes against the very idea of making pickleball a game for everyone, doesn\u0092t it?\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\nImage 1, Image 3, Image 5, Image 6 Will pickleball remain a widely accessible sport, or is it on track to become an elite pastime?

So I'll do my part and share the cons and pros I've observed in my ownership so far.\n\nCONS\n\n1. No headlight at night (half my odo has been night drives, and I haven't exceeded 60kmph most of the time due to this almost non existent light, I feel like triumph is enforcing speed limits without electronically locking the machine with this headlight)\n\n2. Horn sounds so weak that people don't even acknowledge I'm there (I've had an easier time getting space to overtake while revving my engine like a madman)\n\n3. Lack of specific spare parts (in my case the right hand guard, I haven't had a replacement available for almost an Year, thank God for m-seal.\n\n4. Rear brake feels lacking compared to the front, lacks bite.\n\nPROS\n\n1. I've never had the vehicle stay at service for more than 12 hours even without appointments, very supportive.\n\n2. Never had any lack of power during the last year of owning this beautiful bike, did a top speed run and hit 157kmph on the speedometer, which is more than enough for our roads.\n\n3. Tires provide more grip than I initially expected as they weren't road focused, in quiet a few cases the bike could lean more but it was me hesitating. It does give the occasional rear end slip while on a sandy patch like I'm drifting but I've gotten used to it by now. It's fun raising clouds of sand behind me, don't know about the people following me though.\n\n4. Best mileage I've had is usually at 70-80 kmph at 5th gear of 35kmpl. The same at 90-110 kmph in 6th gear but only when roads are flat, so forget it. I also tried driving for a week letting everyone on the road know that my bike revs to over 10k rpm in every gear and got 20kmpl mileage, don't do this.\n\n5. The sound you get when let go of the accelerator and don't touch the clutch is absolutely heavenly, I usually let the vehicle slow down by itself due to lack of acceleration and downshift instead of breaking and this beautiful sound has also cleared my pathway more times than the horn ever did. People just assume I'm fast even though I'm slowing down and just give away.\n\n6. Watching people stop and look while the vehicle is parked, and kids asking to do a rev bomb is a bonus of owning this.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Removing a brake drum can be a bit of a challenge. Especially if the drum is worn, the shoes might get stuck behind that inside ridge.\n\nBHPian Jeroen recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nVarious brake jobs on the Fiesta!\n\nMrs. D Fiesta will need an annual service and an APK (Dutch MOT equivalent). As this Fiesta turns 10 years, its distribution belt must be replaced. I discussed it extensively with spanner mate Peter. In the end, we decided to let the Ford Garage handle it. Even though Peter and I must have replaced at least several dozen distribution belts and chains on all kinds of cars over the years.\n\nThe Fiesta requires five special tools that I would need to buy. More importantly, it would most likely take us at least 3-4 days, we don't have a lift, and we would have a very worried Mrs. D looking over our shoulders and driving one of my cars all that time. We have an excellent marriage, but I'm not sure if we could handle that sort of stress and anxiety.\n\nSo I made the appointment with Ford for the service and APK in two weeks. Last time we noticed that the front discs were getting a bit thin. I decided to check before taking the Fiesta to Ford. Replacing front discs is a straightforward job. And it will save an awful lot of money. So with Mrs. D out for the day, I started.\n\nAs per the usual, rear wheel choked, and front up on the jacks and axle stands.\n\nI have this set of special \"disc-calipers\". As the discs wear, a ridge will form around the circumference of the disc. You need this special tool to measure properly.\n\nThe disc was only about 0.1mm above the minimum thickness\n\nFor good measure I also checked the drum brakes at the rear. Front wheel choked, jack, axle stand etc.\n\nRemove the wheel and next remove those two little torx-bolt holding the drum. Next pry of the drum. It is good practice to clean the whole area of brake dust before starting this little job.\n\nRemoving a brake drum can be a bit of a challenge. Especially if the drum is worn, the shoes might get stuck behind that inside ridge. In which case, you need to adjust the shoes and turn them in. These drums might also get very stuck. Look closely, the drum has a single threaded hole, thread a bolt in there and it will push the drum outwards! Drum removed\n\nI measured the thickness of the brake shoes and the internal diameter of the drum. All well within specification. Before re-assembly, give everything a good cleaning.\n\nAnother image of the internals of a drumbrake.\n\nBefore cleaning\n\n\n\nAfter cleaning. The mating surface on this inside and outside of the drum must be properly clean.\n\nSo I needed some parts, the front discs and the pads. The pads on the Fiesta were quite fine. But when you install new discs you should always install new pads too.\n\nSo I called my friendly local car parts shop. They look up the parts by car registration number. Not in stock, so they have to order it. Which means it will be there around 13.30 the same afternoon. So I decided to start taking out both discs, do all the necessary cleaning, pick up the parts after lunch and fit them.\n\nI paid about Euro 170 for the two discs and set of pads. If Ford does this job, they will charge at least double for the parts and it will take their mechanic a couple of hours as well, at Euro 100 per hour, this simple job is a Euro 500 job at the dealer and not much less at an independent garage.\n\nFirst thing is to suck some brake fluid from the reservoir. I will be pushing the brake piston inwards and that means brake fluid will be displaced from the caliper back into the brake reservoir.\n\nTo be able to remove the disc, you need to remove the caliper, which is attached with just two bolts.\n\nYou also need to compress the brake piston a bit. Because as shown in the earlier image, the disc has a bit of a ridge. With the piston extended, the pads will get stuck behind this ridge and you can't pull the caliper off the disc. So you need to wriggle it a bit, or use very large pliers to move the pads/piston inwards a bit.\n\nAlternatively, you could take the caliper apart and remove the pads before removing the caliper from the car. I did not want to do that, as it takes a lot more time.\n\nGetting the disc out requires a lot of whacking from behind whilst turning it. Took a couple of minutes of violence on each side.\n\nLots of cleaning of the various mating surfaces\n\nWith the caliper off the disc I used my special brake pad tool to push the pistons in. The new disc will be wider than the worn disc and the new pads will be thicker than the old ones as well. So you need to push the pistons in. You could do it with a large pliers, but I have this nifty tool which works well.\n\nMake sure the caliper does not hang from its brake hose. Use a bit of string or tie wrap to tie it up properly.\n\nI got the parts. New brake discs come coated with a protective oil film, so clean very thoroughly with brake cleaner.\n\nAs per my usual mode of operation. Always check old and new parts to ensure they are identical. In this case they were not! The new one has a threaded hole in it. That means, just as with the brake drum, you can thread a bolt in there to help remove them. Less whacking with a hammer, violence and cursing!\n\nThere were two problems with the new brake pads. They came with the incorrect anti-rattle springs and they had these special wear indicators.\n\nThis is the cheap, mechanical, wear indicator. As the pad wears at some point in time, this little metal clip starts hitting the disc and that gives a peculiar noise. Time to put new ones in. But I was not convinced it would not interfere with the pads sliding back and forth. So I just cut them off\n\nInstalling the disc and the new pads is simply the reverse procedure. Put a little copper slip on the brake pad ears. (That's the area where they slide across the caliper and or anti-rattle clip.)\n\nBolts on the caliper are torqued at 70Nm. Fill up the brake fluid reservoir. Very gently tap the brake lightly till you have a hard pedal. Check the brake fluid level one more time and take the car for a short test drive.\n\nIt took me most of the day, but that was partly because I had to wait and get the parts and go back to get the correct anti-rattle clips. The actual spanner time of this job was probably around 3-4 hours. Of which a substantial amount of time is always due to cleaning!\n\nWorking on brakes, especially disc brakes, tend to be straightforward. You don't need any special tools. Even though I have and use some, it can all be done with just some regular tooling.\n\nYou do want to check the torque values and have a proper torque wrench. Also, on some cars removing the disc means pulling out the front bearing as well. You can see me doing that on the Alfa Spider a couple of years ago. That always requires some more careful spannering. In most cases, those bearings require careful re-installation with a very special sequence of tightening and loosening with specific torque values.\n\nMost importantly, these are the brakes, so make sure what you do!!\n\nJeroen\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

That said I have experience riding for quite sometime now. I grew up seeing the Yezdi Roadking and Kawasaki RTZ. None in family circle had a Royal Enfield but the appearance, stance and sound \u0096 a big fan. Fast forward, I got my first bike - a Pulsar 150 in Flame red shade. Being my first bike, Electra/Bullet was never in radar, heck I learnt to ride bike in Pulsar. Round light, muscular tank, peppy engine- bike became an instant hit. While I loved the CBZ, somehow could not match the aura of Pulsar . Bike was not available in my hometown and had to book it from Manipal. Since I did not know riding, had to ride as pillion while Dad did ride the bike back home. Did not take me much time to learn and bike was my companion for 5+ years. I used to often ride Bengaluru- Puttur during college days and bike did not give up even once.\n\n\n\n5 years later, I upgraded my bike to Pulsar 200 when it was launched. While I wanted a Bullet or an Electra, plethora of issues that one would have to go through was a deterrent. Yet again had to let go off the RE dream. I used bike for couple of years and sold it when car usage increased. For a brief time, didn\u0092t have a two-wheeler until I got a used Activa back in hometown. Activa purchase was soon followed by another new Activa 3G, which was bought for city errands in Bengaluru. A bike was never in consideration. After around 5 years, let go off the Activa and was looking for Aprillia SR150. Found a well maintained one in OLX. I had this for 5 years and scooter clocked only 6K KMs before selling . With age catching up, lack of use case- did not bother to buy a two-wheeler again.\n\n\n\nAt my workplace, many auto manufacturers demo their vehicles as its inside a techpark, some two-wheeler manufacturers also offer test ride. One of the days RE had displayed the bullet and Classic, I took the price sheet for reference but didn\u0092t bother to take it forward. After couple of months, Hero was offering test ride and I with my son took Xpulse for a test ride. It was almost 2 years since I rode anything and more than 3 years since I rode a bike. My last experience was riding a Jawa and Meteor in Jaisalmer. While I liked the idea of riding, Xpulse or ADV was not my cup of tea. I checked few bikes like Xpulse, Speed400, Honda CB350 for some time and then gave up as I felt that I would not ride much after getting one. That said, came across a nice low run Honda highness CB 350, test rode one and found it in line with idea of riding a bike. Bike was comfortable, decent power and had features but I could not connect with bike. One must rev the bike and frequent gear shifts were a mismatch with the type of bike. Another ride and felt the bike lacks character. Idea of buying bike got dropped again.\n\n\n\nA month later, I was at a shopping complex, after finishing shopping, noticed neighbouring shop was a RE showroom. Me and daughter were casually checking out the bike, and sales advisor came and asked If I would like to test ride any of the bike. I asked for Bullet, they said Bullet has gone out, but they had classic 350. Took it for a spin and loved the ride. Comfortable, deep bassy exhaust note, oodles of low-end torque and riding posture felt perfect.While classic looked great, Bullet was a childhood dream. Asked for price list and told dealer will come next day to check the stock. Next day, me and wife went to stock yard where they had lot of bikes. While I liked the seat design and vintage taillight of Batallion black Bullet, the seat was too soft and lacked dual channel ABS. They had one piece of Maroon and I liked the color , Would have preferred the vintage tail lamp though. Came back to showroom and made the payment and asked to install few basic accessories like sump guard, crash guard and backrest. To my surprise, advisor told bike will be ready for deliver by 5PM in the evening same day! Reached showroom at around 6PM and noticed bike was ready for delivery with all accessories included. Delivery was simple affair and took bike back home. Bike was delivered with temporary registration. Was told permanent registration would take a week or two more.\n\n\n\nI must say, a big thumps up to Jagadamba motors, right from casual visit to delivery to permanent registration, experience was very good. I was not forced on any accessory, and they followed up and kept me posted in a timely manner till bike got permanent registration.\n\n\n\n@Showroom before delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bike\n\n\n\nPaint finish is great, but gets scratched quite easily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositives\n\n\n\n- Looks great, especially if you like the vintage design.\n\n- Fit and finish is good may be a notch below Honda/Triumph.\n\n- Lovely engine gearbox combo. Makes for a nice leisure ride.\n\n- Comfortable for two. Seats offer good support and right firmness.\n\n- Suspension is great and soaks bumps quite well.\n\n- For 195KG motorcycle, handles reasonably.\n\n-\n\nNegatives\n\n\n\n- Even after paying 2.7L, no tubeless tires!\n\n- Engine is not smoothest of the lot.\n\n- Brakes are average especially the rear ones.\n\n- Frequent service interval, needs to be serviced every 6 months.\n\n- 6th gear would have made for nice cruise on highway.\n\n- Clutch is a bit heavy to operate.\n\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\nCurrent bullet is almost same as the Classic 350. Not that the latter looks bad, but difference is minimal. That said the paint scheme and seat make the bike standout. For most, it might be hard to distinguish current bullet from the previous generations one, which to me is a good thing. While the bike is a looker, it\u0092s quite common on Indian roads and hence not an attention magnet. Paint quality is decent and chrome finish on engine, mirror, wheels etc. go very well. I love the finish on the silencer and appears to be made well. Except for few bits like ugly welding joints, most of the bike appears ro be well made and finish is good. Difference between say a Honda/Triumph is not much, latter still scores a notch higher.\n\n\n\nRiding the bike\n\n\n\nBike has covered close to 1000KM in 3 months and most of the ride has been within city. Straight line stability is quite good and feels planted. Bad roads are handled quite well, at the same time suspension is not overtly soft. Handling on corners is decent, though the bike does not like to be pushed too hard. I must mention the seats, they are quite supportive and are firm enough. I wish the handlebar was bit more closer . Footpegs are placed quite well.\n\n\n\nLike riding bullet at 50-70KM/Hr. At these speeds there is nice thump, and bike is happy cruising in 5th gear. Even when speed drops to 40KM/Hr one need not change gear and bike won't stall in 5th gear. Gear shifts are smooth and finding neutral is quite easy. I like the conventional heel and toe shifter which is quite intuitive to use. On highway one can cruise all day at 90KM/Hr and may be even 100KM/Hr. At these speeds though there is no thump, I do like the exhaust note. Given the weight, crosswinds doesnot affect stability as much.\n\n\n\nEngine doesnot like to be revved. You have to gradually build speed . Engine reminds me of diesel engine , oodles of torque but is hesitant to revv quickly. While Engine is smoother than previous gen, there still a bit of tappet sound and definitely not as refined as Japanese engine. Found it actually smoother than my Aprillia scooter engine which was way too noisy.\n\n\n\nOther observations\n\n\n\n- While I haven\u0092t measured using tankful method, fuel efficiency is somewhere around 30-35KMPL. Fuel gauge is not very accurate keeps fluctuating a bit.\n\n\n\n- I like the Halogen headlight, it\u0092s quite powerful for city rides and goes well with vintage theme of motorcycle.\n\n\n\n- Indicators are chrome finished and are halogen too and appears to be solid.\n\n\n\n- Tiger eyes lights are halogen and look nice. These are not DRL and lights up along with headlight. There is no separate switch to turn these off.\n\n\n\n- MID has basic info- 2 trip meters, a digital clock and ODO. There is service reminder indicator, which can be turned off.\n\n\n\n- Speedo console is almost same as old bullets.\n\n\n\n- Bike came with CEAT tube type tyres, these are quite good. Offers decent grip and looks neat.\n\n\n\n- Round toggle switches for headlight and engine start/stop takes some time getting used to.\n\n\n\n- While the horn is single piece unit, its loud and unmistakably Bullet.\n\n\n\nService\n\n\n\nFirst free service is quite short at 500KM/45 days and what\u0092s more surprising is RE recommends oil and filter change. Got this done are Jagadamba motors and experience was quite good. There was no optional extra added and bill came to 1000Rs. Fuel cap does not openly smoothly, and I missed mentioning this, as expected they did not rectify. Second issue I had was clutch lever play was on higher side, again I missed to mention. After getting bike home, got clutch corrected using tools provided.\n\n\n\nBullet is a simple bike. It does not have features neither the engine is refined as say Honda 350. Its not as fast as say a commuter 150cc bike and at times even an Activa may speed past you. It has mere 20HP and weighs close to 200KG. In this modern age with so many more modern retro bikes like Speed400, CB350, RE\u0092s own Guerilla etc. does bullet makes sense? Well, I was initially of same impression and had tried out few other bikes over a long period, but nothing clicked. Someone wants to ride fast, nimble to handle, Speed 400 is a great choice, for someone who likes refined big commuter bike-CB350 may be. For me its cruising at 50-70KM/Hr with that bassy thump and a relaxed ride - had to be bullet. Extra power, nimble handling , squeezing through traffic or reaching the destination quicker, these were never in consideration. Be it riding to office (which is a 5KM ride) or weekend ride to favorite restaurant with my wife, bullet does makes for an experience. Yes, It\u0092s not perfect and is probably dated by todays standard for many, but every time I ride \u0096 experience makes for its short comings.\n\n\n\nFew more pictures taken during leisure ride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not a seasoned rider neither I have done long rides in the past or plan to do in future.

            "content": "This place is incredibly scenic in the monsoons, when the hills and the valleys are lush green and the weather is magical. However, this trail become extremely tricky and challenging in the monsoon\n\nBHPian Dr.AD recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nShola Heights (location: https://maps.app.goo.gl/t7WqRmkep63Hgyhh9) is a famous homestay in the offroading circuit. This is located atop a hill, overlooking the majestic Kudremukh Peak (one of the iconic mountain peaks in Karnataka, and a popular place for hiking and mountaineering). In fact, the homestay owner mentioned this is the highest homestay in Karnataka! A nice high altitude place overlooking scenic valleys and mountains all around! This being the highest and the last house on that hill, if offers both a vantage viewpoint as well as total seclusion from the rest of the world.\n\nWhile the homestay itself is beautiful and a great place for sure, the reason this place is famous in the offroading circuit is because it can only be reached by a 6km of treacherous hill climb on a dirt track where only 4x4 vehicles can ply! Even with a 4x4 vehicle, this trail offers enough challenges and fun, and is a sought after trail for offroading. Rarely do you get a chance to do proper offroading, that too for full 6km, just to reach the place of stay! That is indeed a USP of this place!\n\nFor those not going there for offroading, the homestay offers a secure parking space below the hills, where the normal road ends. You can park there and the homestay team will pick you up in the their own 4x4 vehicle. However, most offroading enthusiasts drive up in their own 4x4s, and that drive is often the biggest motivation to visit this place.\n\nThis place is incredibly scenic in the monsoons, when the hills and the valleys are lush green and the weather is magical. However, this trail become extremely tricky and challenging in the monsoon. One needs a good support and rescue team to attempt this in the peak monsoon. On the other hand, in this dry month of March, the trail is not that difficult - it is easy enough for a solo traveler, and yet difficult enough to have some good offroading adventure - just the perfect combination for solo offroading.\n\nI love solo drives, as evident from many of my solo travelogues, but solo off-roading is something that one rarely gets to do. Offroading is usually a group activity because of the support (spotting and other help) and rescue requirements. With the point mentioned above, I thought this trail in March would offer me that rare solo offroading opportunity, and I decided to give it a shot on a weekend. Thankfully, it turned out that the conditions were perfect for a solo offroader. Not too difficult a trail where I would need to be rescued, and yet difficult enough to offer me some adrenaline rush and some scary moments. A nice mix of fun and adventure without being too risky!\n\nIn this dry month, the main challenge in the trail is that it is full of loose and slippery soil and gravel, and offers very low traction on the steep slopes. Most of the trail is steep slope (it is a good amount of climbing), and some of the sharp hair-pin bends, combined with steep slope, and the loose gravel can become tricky. One needs a 4x4H in the entire trail even when this is dry, and for sure would need 4x4L in the monsoon when this is wet and there is plenty of mud. I climbed the entire trail in 4x4H. I did some driving around the homestay too after reaching there, and it was all in 4x4H. Thus, once I exited the \"normal\" roads below the hills and started climbing, I had 4H engaged throughout, for the entire weekend, till I got down to the main road the next day!\n\nGiven that the homestay is only reachable by that 6 km of treacherous 4x4 trail, the homestay owner described it aptly that it is almost like an island of its own! You are totally cut off from the rest of the world, except for that one link that is that offroad trail. The homestay itself depends 100% on their own 4x4 vehicle (a Mahindra Bolero Camper 4x4) for their survival there. There is just no other option, and no other way.\n\nI loved this concept and the experience! In my entire hill climb to and from the homestay, as well as my local wanderings there on the hills, I did not see any other vehicle, or any other human being other than the homestay owner and the staff. Absolutely alone and secluded time in the hills, and I loved it so much! Just me, my Thar, those scenic mountains and views all around, and that treacherous trail to drive around. Exactly the poetic experience that every 4x4 owner desires to have. I am thankful to this place for offering me that experience!\n\nThe drive from Bangalore to Samse, the town where you exit the normal roads and start this hill climb, is about 6 hours drive. The last 100km of the roads, from Sakleshpur to Samse (via Mudigere and Kalasa) is a scenic forest route, with dense forest, green hills and ghats. Even in these summer months, this drive was quite nice and scenic.\n\nHowever, the biggest fun starts after you exit the tarred roads, and start driving on the trail leading to Shola Heights.\n\nFor me, the challenge started with finding the right trail in the first place. Turns out there are two trails to reach this place. The most commonly used is a 6km long trail, and there is another one that is shorter (about 4.5km long), but steeper and much narrower. Google Maps by default gives this shorter trail. However, even worse, it does not show the trail accurately. In general, Google Maps in this area are off by about 200m, and in the hills, that makes them useless. Google Maps wrongly showed that trail at a point where nothing existed, and when I joined the actual trail, it was the longer one (6km long). That was still fine! But now the problem was that Google Maps does not know this trail, and for the entire duration, the maps became useless.\n\nI spotted a couple of old boards of Shola Heights initially, but later they disappeared, and for a long time I kept on wondering if I was on the right trail. So there I was, enjoying my off-roading, tackling the trail in 4x4H, enjoying the views all around, but still a bit nervous that I might actually be lost! Thankfully, and surprisingly, the phone connection worked throughout, and I called the homestay owner a couple of times to describe where I was and used his guidance to find the path forward.\n\nBefore I describe the rest, let me mention that my vehicle for this was my beloved \"Dusty\", my Thar 4x4! Dusty enjoyed this as much as I did. It was these kind of experiences for which I bought the Thar 4x4 in the first place, and I was so glad I was able to do justice to that.\n\n\"Dusty\", my Thar 4x4, on the trail to Shola Heights:\n\n\n\nMost of the trail is dry and dusty (in these summer months), and full of loose soil and gravel. The trail is very steep and slippery. The pictures do not show the slope at all. The pictures make it all look flat. But believe me, the trail was so steep that even walking up and down on the trail was tricky.\n\nThe slippery and steep slopes that pictures fail to capture:\n\n\n\nOne more reason why I loved this trail so much is because in addition to offering a good 4x4 experience, the trail is also very scenic! It is not some boring, artificially created track for the sake of offroading. It is a natural hill path with scenic hills and views and all around. Those landscape views were the icing on the cake for me.\n\nI enjoyed stopping, getting out and looking at such views from the trail:\n\n\n\nAlthough most of the trail is dry and dusty, there is a section where it goes through thick trees, and passes a stream. It was a nice shaded area there, with a canopy of trees covering the trail. The stream was dry now, and apart from a small puddle of water, there was no water. In fact, there are two stream crossings in this 6km long trail, but both of them were dry in this month.\n\nAt a stream crossing (which was dry now):\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more photo of Dusty on this trail:\n\n\n\nThe sharp hairpin bends, with steep climb, were at times a bit tricky. The Thar would not turn that sharply in one go, and I had to take 3-point turns. And when I tried to reverse in those maneuvers, in the middle of the slope (and now reverse would mean I am going downslope), the car would just slide on the loose gravel and steep downslope. I had to stomp on the brakes to stop it, and had a couple of scary moments. I learnt my lesson and later tried to go wide and drive the outside wheel out of the trail just to avoid taking 3-point turns. That turned to be a much better strategy than trying to reverse in the middle of the slope.\n\nViews of the trail and the mountains in the mirror:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I climbed up, the views in my windshield near the top of the hill:\n\n\n\nAfter enjoying that hill climb, stopping at numerous places to enjoy the landscape views, taking my time, and yet feeling nervous all the time thinking if I was lost, finally I reached the homestay at the very top of the hill.\n\nArrived, with a sudden view of this beautiful house, after wondering whether I was lost:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the house:\n\n\n\nI was the only guest in the homestay that day, as has been the case in some of my recent trips, for example, this stay in Konkan. Maybe because I pick these off-beat places, and go there in the off-season, and that too not on any major holidays, I usually find myself the lone guest there.\n\nDusty being alone there, got this nice parking space:\n\n\n\nThis homestay is indeed a very unique place. I had a great time there. However, this is a very basic place. The room was as basic as it gets. It was very clean and comfortable, but very basic. The room had just simple cots and a fan (no AC), a clean but again very simple bathroom, and that is it. There are a total of 5 such simple rooms in the house. And there is a common dining area where they serve homemade fresh meals. Everything was clean and comfortable, but as basic as it gets. No luxuries or special amenities anywhere.\n\nHowever, what makes this homestay so special was the amazing location, the breathtaking views all around, the feeling of isolation and seclusion, the feeling of adventure, and above all, the fantastic team. The owners, Mr. Abhinandan and Mr. Kumar were both there and they were very friendly, polite and nice. We chatted a lot and became friends. And the staff was very good too. They cooked some delicious food, snacks, tea and coffee. Their hospitality and friendliness made me feel right at home there.\n\nAfter that delicious lunch, and some rest, I headed out again in the evening for the trails, and exploring sunset views.\n\nDusty heading out in the evening for sunset trails:\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing another dry stream:\n\n\n\n\n\nI parked and climbed a small hill to take this photo:\n\n\n\n\n\nView of the trail in the evening light:\n\n\n\n\n\nView of a distant tree on that hill, and the other trail passes by that tree:\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned, I was there not for offroading for the sake of offroading. But I was there to explore the views and enjoy the landscapes, and I got plenty of opportunities for that.\n\nSunset in the dry hills:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dry grass against the backdrop of the mountains:\n\n\n\n\n\nView of one of the steep hairpin bends against the sun:\n\n\n\n\n\nView of the trail at sunset:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a shot of Dusty on that trail at sunset:\n\n\n\nAfter enjoying this sunset trail and the views, I came back to the house and had a great sleep that night.",

            "content": "Biking was never just about the machine. It was about a dream, freedom, about overcoming fears, and about finding new reasons to ride.\n\nBHPian drive.helios recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nBiking was always something personal to me. I grew up among my elder cousins who taught me to ride a bike at age 14 (Class 7 school vacations) and always fancied owning a bike. My parents are the typical working class who would want you to earn everything in life, and their staunch belief in horoscopes and astrology meant they would never get me a bike, or will allow me if they are informed.\n\nSo It started in October 2013 when I surprised my family with a brand-new Royal Enfield Classic 350 after landing my first job. No test rides, no other options evaluated, and just went ahead and booked it. That first ride,the surprised face of my brother and parents, and my mom asking me to drop her at the school she worked the next day\u2014it was everything I had dreamed of. In hindsight, I should have gone and got the Bullet 500 instead of the Classic 350.\n\nMaking the purchase was a tough affair especially given that I had just started working in Nov 2012 with a meagre in hand salary of 18000. Thankfully there was a wait time for the bike (nearly 6 months) and that allowed me to save the 35000 for the down payment and then HDFC bank processed my vehicle loan for the balance amount. 1,35,000 something was the on road price at that time.\n\nBut life had other plans.\n\nJust two months later, in December 2013, I met with an accident\u2014not while riding, but while crossing the road on foot. A biker hit me and drove off without stopping, the hospital misjudged the fracture and I was bedridden for 3 months and off the bike for nearly 6 months. Then something inside me changed. I still rode, but the carefree nature had shifted to being cautious on the road. It took about 3 months more to eventually build the confidence back to handle the weight of the bike again.\n\nThen came 2019. A speeding taxi hit me at a four-way intersection. This time, it was bad. The accident wasn\u2019t just physical\u2014it shook my confidence to the core. I parked the bike at home, unable to bring myself to ride again. But even though I wasn\u2019t riding, I couldn\u2019t let go of it. I kept maintaining it, keeping it in perfect shape, telling myself that someday, I\u2019d get back.\n\nThe Restoration\n\nDuring the Covid years, with nothing but time on my hands, I decided to restore the bike completely. It was left unattended in an open parking lot in Bengaluru while covid started as i have moved down to Kannur, and after a few months, i got it transported to Kannur. It was stripped down, rebuilt piece by piece, brought back to life with new parts and fresh paint. Even then, it was just a project, not a return. The fear still lingered. I spent about nearly 40000 in the repair, repaint and labour charges, i also overpaid and experimented on a few things like the off road crash guard which i removed after a week, and kept the bike naked after.\n\n\n\nBike after the restoration job.\n\nThen, something unexpected happened.\n\nA New Beginning - With A Partner This Time\n\nAfter getting married, my wife took an interest in biking. She wasn\u2019t just curious\u2014she wanted to ride. Watching her enthusiasm, I realized I couldn\u2019t keep running from this. If she was ready to start from scratch, I had no excuse. We rented out a Thunderbird X where she learned to ride, and further polished her craft by attending a women only riding class in Bengaluru.\n\nWe fixed up the bike one more time, together. This time, it wasn\u2019t just about repairs\u2014it was about reclaiming what I had lost. I spend nearly 30000 this time fixing the bike, with the changes including a new RD350 handle bar ( the original handle bar had bend in the accident and i liked the raised handlebar a bit more), new set of suspension, new set of wheels, an overhauled wiring system, electrical parts, a new bend pipe (old one had started showing rust, thanks to the coastal air in Kannur) and the general maintenance. I also swapped the stock seats to ensure pillion comfort. During the covid break, I had switched to synthetic engine only and continued to use the same. And when the bike was ready, we took our first road trip.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a ride\u2014it was a moment of closure. Years of hesitation, self-doubt, and fear were finally left behind on the road.\n\nFull Circle\n\nWhat started as a solo journey turned into a shared passion. From buying the bike as a surprise in 2013, losing confidence over the years, rebuilding it during Covid, and finally returning to the road with my wife by my side, it all came full circle.\n\nBiking was never just about the machine. It was about a dream, freedom, about overcoming fears, and about finding new reasons to ride. And this time, I knew\u2014I was back for good.\n\nContinue reading BHPian drive.helios's post for more insights and information.",

The company\u2019s first half result in fiscal year 2025 was strong and ahead of market expectations. Operating revenue of $591 million was up 5.9 per cent on the prior corresponding period and statutory net profit after tax of $243.5 million was up 5.6 per cent. Modernising the ASX technology platform is on track and, importantly, in line with budget. We\u2019re seeing signs that listing volumes may improve. With positive signs developing, we view ASX as an attractive alternative to banks, offering a similar yield, but with a more defensive profile supported by a monopoly market position and low gearing.\n\nBUY \u2013 Brambles (BXB)\n\nThis supply chain logistics giant delivered a solid first half result in fiscal year 2025. While revenue growth was at the lower end of its target, Brambles offset this by continuing to deliver on efficiency and productivity measures. These improvements are increasing margins and delivering strong cash flow. This cash flow has enabled Brambles to increase its dividend by 27 per cent on last year\u2019s corresponding period and conduct a significant share buy-back of up to $500 million. While Brambles is sensitive to economic growth and currency movements, the underlying business appears to be in top shape, with management building a solid track record.\n\nHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHOLD \u2013 BHP Group (BHP)\n\nThe global mining giant is focusing more on increasing copper production. Based on its most recent first half result in fiscal year 2025, copper now makes up 38 per cent of BHP\u2019s earnings, with iron ore down to just 55 per cent. This appears to be a smart long term strategy. Iron ore prices have been resilient, but we do expect a decline in the long term, as steel demand from China matures. Copper appears to have a more buoyant future, driven by widespread use in electronics. A declining iron ore division may limit growth in the short term, but it provides the cash for BHP to continue expanding into copper, setting the company up for a brighter future.\n\nHOLD \u2013 Sonic Healthcare (SHL)\n\nSonic Healthcare is a global leader in pathology, with operations across Australia, the US and Europe. Sonic experienced a post COVID-19 hangover. It scaled up significantly into COVID-19 testing, only to see these revenues fall faster than anticipated. This left Sonic with a high cost base and compromised margins. SHL is now returning to a period of growth and higher margins, as it reduces costs and benefits from acquisitions made after the pandemic. Operationally solid, Sonic\u2019s long term growth is underpinned by an ageing population and resulting demand for healthcare and pathology services.\n\nSELL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSELL \u2013 Nine Entertainment Co. Holdings (NEC)\n\nThe media giant has a diversified portfolio of assets. Streaming service provider Stan and the company\u2019s controlling interest on online real estate platform Domain were solid performers in NEC\u2019s first half results in fiscal year 2025. Nine is a leader in Australian print media and free to air television, but these businesses face fierce competition for readers, viewers and advertisers. Group revenue of $1.390 billion was up 1 per cent on the prior corresponding period, but net profit after tax and minorities of $95.1 million was down 29 per cent. We find it difficult to identify a catalyst that would provide a brighter outlook in the medium term.\n\nSELL \u2013 Fortescue (FMG)\n\nFortescue is the fourth largest iron ore producer in the world, growing its scale to the point where its operating costs now rival the levels of BHP Group and Rio Tinto. Unlike BHP and Rio, Fortescue is a single commodity producer. This leaves Fortescue heavily exposed to economic conditions in China, particularly as it produces a lower quality ore that can be discounted during times of weaker demand. We prefer exposure to BHP or Rio, which offer diversity through copper and aluminum, markets we expect to generate stronger demand over time.\n\nNathan Lodge, Securities Vault\n\nBUY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBUY \u2013 E79 Gold Mines (E79)\n\nThis gold and copper explorer has tenements in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The company\u2019s market capitalisation remains modest relative to its peers, providing substantial upside if exploration success continues. Given the company\u2019s strategic land position, ongoing drilling programs and a favourable gold price, we believe E79 represents an attractive high risk, high reward opportunity for investors.\n\nBUY \u2013 Decidr AI Industries (DAI)\n\nDAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) enablement group. It was formerly known as Live Verdure (LV1). DAI has a controlling interest in AI platform Decidr.ai. Decidr helps businesses automate hundreds of simple mundane tasks without supervision. The company recently signed a partnership heads of agreement with Go1, one of the world\u2019s largest corporate learning platforms. We believe DAI offers a bright outlook in the rapidly growing AI sector.\n\nHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHOLD \u2013 4DS Memory (4DS)\n\n4DS is a semiconductor development company, specialising in non-volatile memory technology, particularly interface switching ReRAM for storage in mobile and cloud applications. The company recently completed a $6 million placement from institutional and high net worth investors. It raised a further $2.6 million from a share purchase plan. The capital will be used to progress the design agreement with Infineon Technologies. The shares have been slashed during the past year, but there\u2019s potential for a recovery. However, the stock remains speculative and suits investors with an appetite for risk.\n\nHOLD \u2013 Zelira Therapeutics (ZLD)\n\nThis biopharmaceutical company is involved in cannabinoid based medicine. The company\u2019s portfolio includes formulations targeting conditions, such as insomnia, autism and chronic non-cancer pain. The company has a pipeline of drug candidates undergoing clinical development that are positioned to enter global markets. The share price has fallen significantly since July 2024. However, the company is active in securing new markets for its products, so, in our view, the outlook is optimistic.\n\nSELL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSELL \u2013 Pursuit Minerals (PUR)\n\nThis mineral exploration company focuses on lithium projects, notably the Rio Grande Sur project in Argentina. Lithium prices have been smashed in the past few years, impacting many companies across the sector. PUR reported a net loss after tax of $2.099 million for the year ending June 30, 2024. We believe companies in other sectors are more appealing at this point than those operating in the volatile lithium sector. Shares in PUR have fallen from 30 cents on April 26, 2024, to trade at 7.3 cents on March 13, 2025.\n\nSELL \u2013 PolyNovo (PNV)\n\nThe company provides dermal regeneration solutions via its NovoSorb biodegradable polymer technology. The company posted record sales of $54.1 million in the first half of fiscal year 2025, up 28.1 per cent on the prior corresponding period. However, the company recently announced it had changed its chief executive officer. The company had been dealing with internal issues. PNV shares have been slashed from $2.29 on January 22 to trade at $1.197 on March 13. The company\u2019s performance and governance remains under scrutiny.\n\nDon\u2019t Buy Just Yet\n\nYou will want to see this before you make any decisions.\n\nBefore you decide which shares to add to your portfolio you might want to take a look at this special report we recently published.\n\nOur experts picked out The 5 best ASX shares to buy in 2025.\n\nWe\u2019re giving away this valuable research for FREE.\n\nClick below to secure your copy\n\nNiv Dagan, Peak Asset Management\n\nBUY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBUY \u2013 NoviqTech (NVQ)\n\nNoviqTech focuses on tracking and tracing carbon. The company\u2019s platform carbon central seamlessly integrates carbon reporting to measure, manage and tokenise assets. Its digital twins capability enables clients to replicate their plant or operations in real time and create an international sustainability and carbon certificate to reduce costs. We are a major shareholder in NVQ and expect tokenisation revenues to flow this quarter, leading to a re-rating of the stock. The shares were trading at 5 cents on March 13.\n\nBUY \u2013 Triangle Energy (Global) (TEG)\n\nTEG is an energy producer and explorer based in Western Australia. The company has a 78.75 per cent interest in the Cliff Head oil field. It has a 50 per cent share of the L7 production licence and the adjacent EP437 exploration licence, both in the Perth Basin. The company has expanded its interests outside the Perth Basin, with a 50 per cent holding in UK permit P2628, which contains the Cragganmore gas field operated by Athena Energy. The company has suffered from a previous exploration result and issues at Cliff Head. However, the company had $10.89 million in cash on December 31, 2024. The Becos well is planned to be drilled in late March 2025. Triangle continues to pursue opportunities in Australia, Europe and Asia. TEG is highly speculative, but could re-rate on any successful news flow. The shares were trading at less than a cent on March 13.\n\nHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHOLD \u2013 CSL (CSL)\n\nThe biotechnology giant posted a 15 per cent increase in immunoglobulin product sales in the first half of fiscal year 2025 when compared to the prior corresponding period. Albumin sales rose 9 per cent and haemophilia product sales increased 11 per cent. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver on net profit after tax and amortisation growth guidance of between 10 per cent and 13 per cent at constant currency in full year 2025.\n\nHOLD \u2013 Telstra Group (TLS)\n\nThe telecommunications giant posted a positive first half result in fiscal year 2025. EBITDA of $4.2 billion was up 6 per cent and net profit after tax of $1.1 billion grew 7.1 per cent. The fully franked interim dividend of 9.5 cents a share was up 5.6 per cent. The company announced an on-market, share buy-back of up to $750 million, which was earlier than we expected. In our view, this signals Telstra\u2019s intention to return capital to shareholders and its positive view about its capacity to generate strong cash flow growth.\n\nSELL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSELL \u2013 Mineral Resources (MIN)\n\nMIN is a leading diversified resources company, with extensive operations in lithium, iron ore, energy and mining services across Western Australia. Revenue of $2.290 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2025 was down 9 per cent on the prior corresponding period due to weaker iron ore and lithium prices. The company reported a statutory net loss after tax of $807 million. The result included $352 million of post-tax impairment charges related to its Bald Hill lithium project. The company didn\u2019t declare an interim dividend. The company\u2019s Onslow haul road needs to be repaired at a cost of about $230 million. In our view, lingering debt issues and potentially weaker commodity prices are among the challenges faced by the company.\n\nSELL \u2013 Pilbara Minerals (PLS)\n\nPilbara owns 100 per cent of one of the world\u2019s largest, independent hard rock lithium operations. Located in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region, the company\u2019s Pilgangoora operation produces spodumene and tantalite concentrates. Revenue and EBITDA in the first half of fiscal year 2025 were down on the prior corresponding period. The company posted a statutory loss after tax of $69 million. The shares have fallen from $4.17 on March 14, 2024, to trade at $1.767 on March 13, 2025. Given weaker lithium prices, we envisage further pressure as short sellers possibly push the stock lower in the short-term.\n\nRelated Articles:",

However, the German carmaker has now announced that the VW Tiguan R Line will be launched on April 14. It will be brought to the Indian shores via the CBU route and the bookings will be opened soon.\n\nIn the international markets, the VW Tiguan R Line comes in multiple engine options - a 1.5-litre petrol mild-hybrid, a 1.5-litre plug-in hybrid, a 2.0-litre petrol and a 2.0-litre diesel. For the Indian market, VW is likely to offer the 2.0-litre petrol engine mated to a 7-speed DSG and the 4Motion all-wheel drive system.\n\nBeing the range-topping variant, the VW Tiguan R Line has been given a more sporty treatment on the outside compared to the standard Tiguan. For example, there is a more aggressive front bumper with large vents and a gloss black fascia. The SUV also comes with LED light bars at the front and rear, as well as 19-inch alloy wheels.\n\nOn the inside, the VW Tiguan R Line has sports seats, a 3-spoke steering wheel, a 10.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.9-inch central touchscreen.",

Suffice it to say that I \u2018used\u2019 my vehicle to the hilt and loved every moment\n\nBHPian shankar.balan recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nOn this visit to Ooty, after charging the vehicle back to 100%, I covered about 70kms on day 1 (local loafing to Aruvankadu and Wellington and Kotagiri and the Doddabetta stretch back up etc) and another 80kms on day 2 (more local loafing - to Emerald and Avalanche and back to Edakadu and Gandhipettai and Manjoor and Chamaraj and so on, returning to Ooty).\n\nWonderful twisty roads and ups and downs with the regen settings on Zero.\n\nHaving a lot of fun actively working the paddles, to slow down on the downhill stretches and curves and hairpin bends and on zero when accelerating.\n\nUsed the vehicle throughout on eco mode with the AC on and the windows down for significant periods so as to enjoy the hill country air redolent with the scent of eucalyptus and pine - with plenty of photography stops.\n\nAfter all, this was a leisure trip, and I actively kept it completely free from the subtle tyranny of \u2018agenda driven activity!\n\nWhile this is an EV, the joy of driving and the principles of the angles of attack on the banked curves, remain the same and the sheer exhilaration of acceleration on the lovely uphill stretches, makes for a feeling of freedom like no other.\n\nThe Kona stays planted on these curves and the phenomenally blistering power when overtaking, is addictive.\n\nSuffice it to say that I \u2018used\u2019 my vehicle to the hilt and loved every moment.\n\nAt the end of all the loafing - around 150kms local use, the vehicle had drunk up 53% of charge while having done ~ 150kms.\n\nI really think that\u2019s fine and with this, the third medium-long distance trip in my EV, I have decided that I will continue to use my EV just like I do my normal ICE vehicles and attempt to banish the demon of range anxiety, forever from my head.\n\nI charged the car to 100% for the 300kms drive down the hills to Mysore and beyond, to Bangalore. While I believe I will enjoy some regen on the way down, I really don\u2019t think I will be doing any \u2018babying\u2019 of the car, so will definitely stop and do a 20-30 min top up at Shell before getting on the Expressway for the last bit of the journey later today.\n\nFor now, enjoy a few photos.\n\nLovedale Tunnel - our own Hogwarts Express.\n\n\n\nLovely landscapes somewhere near Wellington\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the high road\n\n\n\nEmerald Lake and Dam\u2026.there\u2019s a big hydel project happening and the water release is choked off which is why the level is so low (a local bloke told me.)\n\n\n\nAvalanche Ranges\n\n\n\nBeautiful Tea-scapes\n\n\n\nOn the road\n\n\n\nBig Brother Browsing Bison\n\n\n\nThe long and winding road\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "In Sweden, each new car that leaves a dealership undergoes a process called type-approval and roadworthiness acceptance, the date of which goes into the car's registration certificate\n\nBHPian supermax recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nThe first time a car needs to be subject to a repetition of the roadworthiness check, i.e. the second check, is three years from the date of the above-mentioned check. The third check is to be carried out not later than 2 years after the second check, and after the third check, all further checks need to be carried out every 14 months. This is very strictly implemented and cars that aren't inspected in time, or cars that fail the inspection are automatically banned from the roads. Driving a car that's banned is an offense punishable with steep fines and leaves one without insurance coverage, in case of any incident/accident.\n\nMy car underwent its second check in March of 2023, and was therefore due for its third check now. Information about one's address, membership in steering committees, vehicle and property ownership etc is by default fully public in Sweden, and so companies that perform the roadworthiness checks start sending out reminders and their special discount offers to car owners, a couple of months before the actual test is necessary, which is a nice thing, as it ensures that I don't need to remember to create a reminder myself, or risk getting the car banned due to forgetting. The reminder messages started pouring in around January, and I just needed to select the provider closest to me, and who offered the biggest discount, as there's nothing extra special in how the test itself is executed, as long as it's a licensed and approved test center.\n\nAfter some price-checking, I decided upon Dekra. Formula One enthusiasts here might remember that Dekra was an F1 sponsor whose logo figured on Michael Schumacher's Ferrari cap in the days of old. They offered a discount if I prepaid on the web, which I gladly did, and chose the station near me, and a time convenient to me. My vehicle is registered with a removable tow-hook, and I found out that it must be present during the inspection. It didn't matter if it was mounted or removed, as long as it was present in the car. The other thing that's on the mandatory list is a warning triangle. After ensuring that both items were present, I drove to the checking station.\n\nA short wait later, one of their techs took my keys and took the car for a small spin to perform a mandated acceleration and brake test. Upon his return, he drove the car into the inspection hall. I asked if I could take photographs for my blog, and was given the greenlight to do so, as long as I didn't capture faces of their personnel.\n\nThe car was placed onto a lift, and raised.\n\nDuring a thorough under-body inspection, they inspected the shocks and the wheel angles. They performed wheel turning checks to ensure that the alignment was not off.\n\nThe car was lowered and a scanner attached, to check for error codes. Lights were checked, and an emission test carried out. The car passed the roadworthiness inspection without any comments or faults. Had there been any issues that were noted, I'd have had to rectify the faults and book a second inspection. If we are maintaining/servicing the car ourselves, we need to pay close attention to all the points on the test protocol to ensure that the car is in strict compliance, but if the car is being serviced as per the manufacturer's recommendations, this is almost never an issue. All of the checks were completed in under 20 minutes, and I was handed the inspection certificate which noted that the vehicle had passed all inspection checks. I logged into the department of transportation's app after driving home, and was impressed that the date of last inspection had already been updated! The next such check is now needed in 14 month's time.\n\nThe issue with 2G/3G removal and roadworthiness testing\n\nI'd posted in June of 2024 about the issues connected with the phasing out of 2G and 3G networks across operators in Sweden . What this means for those who own cars registered after some cut-off date in 2018 is that if the SOS/e-call button on the car doesn't work, this automatically gets noted as a failure, on the roadworthiness tests. When a car gets a failure on any test, the owner has 14 days to rectify the issue, but the issue with the SOS/e-call failure cannot be fixed, as car makers have collectively thrown in the towel, saying it's too hard-baked into the system to make it possible/feasible to simply swap out the old tech for newer tech. Car owner associations have been actively lobbying the government to change the test protocol, to allow for cars to stay on the road even if the SOS/e-call functionality is no longer functional. While It looks highly likely that this suggestion will be accepted, as with any significant deviation in the stated laws or regulations, this is going to take a while before the change comes into effect. Till then, car owners would be hoping and praying that their cars don't fail the test. Some telecom operators in north Sweden have already shut down the 2G/3G services, resulting in some cars already reporting SOS/e-call failures, but I guess they have to drive to a different location where 2G/3G services are still available, to carry out the test. I certainly hope the problem would have been laid firmly to rest by the time my car is due for its next inspection in May of 2026!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

So, how can you put a value on the BHP share price?\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nThe key metrics\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried reading a company\u2019s income statement on the annual report, you\u2019ll know just how complex it can get. While there are any number of ways you could slice up the statement, three key figures are revenue, gross margin, and profit.\n\nRevenue is important for obvious reasons \u2013 everything else (profit, margins, return on equity etc.) is downstream of a company\u2019s ability to generate sales and revenue. What we\u2019re looking for is not so much the absolute number, but the trend. BHP last reported an annual revenue of $56,027m with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 3 years of -0.7% per year.\n\nThe next thing we\u2019ll want to consider is the gross margin. The gross margin tells us how profitable the core products/services are \u2013 before you take into account all the overhead costs, how much money does the company make from selling $100 worth of goods and services? BHP\u2019s latest reported gross margin was 82.3%.\n\nFinally, we get to profit, the real headline number. Last financial year BHP Group Ltd reported a profit of $7,897m. That compares to 3 years ago when they made a profit of $11,304m, representing a CAGR of -11.3%.\n\nFinancial health of BHP shares\n\nNext, we could consider the capital health of the company. What we\u2019re trying to work out is whether the company is generating a reasonable return on their equity (the total shareholder value) and whether they have a good safety buffer. One important measure to consider is net debt. This is simply the total debt minus the company\u2019s cash holdings.\n\nIn the case of BHP, the current net debt sits at $9,467m. A high number here means that a company has a lot of debt which potentially means higher interest payments, greater instability, and higher sensitivity to interest rates. A negative value on the other hand indicates the company has more cash than debt, which can be seen as good (a big safety buffer) or bad (inefficient capital allocation).\n\nA metric that might be more valuable to us is the debt/equity percentage. This tells us how much debt the company has relative to shareholder ownership. In other words, how leveraged is the company? BHP Group Ltd has a debt/equity ratio of 45.3%, which means they have more equity than debt.\n\nFinally, we can look at the return on equity (ROE). The ROE tells us how much profit a company is generating as a percentage of its total equity \u2013 high numbers indicate the company is allocating capital efficiently and generating value, while a low number suggests that company growth may be starting to slow. BHP generated an ROE of 19.7% in FY24.\n\nWhat to make of BHP shares?\n\nOne way to have a \u2018speedy read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is could be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.68%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Be careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing, or both. In the case of BHP, last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price.",

The agreement, announced on Monday, marks a significant investment into the region\u2019s resource sector, targeting Cobre\u2019s Kitlanya East and Kitlanya West copper projects.\n\nCobre CEO Adam Wooldridge described the agreement as a major milestone for the company, highlighting the importance of securing financial and technical support from a leading global mining firm.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with BHP will provide us with the funding and support necessary to implement a technology-driven work programme designed to discover the Tier 1 deposits we believe may be hosted in our Kitlanya East and West projects,\u201d Wooldridge said.\n\nStrategic Exploration Investment\n\nUnder the terms of the earn-in agreement, BHP will finance exploration activities over multiple years in exchange for a 75% stake in the Kitlanya projects. The funding structure includes an initial commitment of $5 million within the first two years, with exploration activities scheduled to begin in April 2025. The first phase of the program has been allocated a budget of $7 million, which will be directed towards key exploratory activities such as deep diamond drilling and seismic surveys.\n\nThis investment follows Cobre\u2019s successful participation in BHP\u2019s 2024 Xplor programme, which previously provided funding for a seismic survey at Kitlanya West. The new agreement builds upon that collaboration, expanding the scope of exploration efforts in search of large-scale, high-grade copper and silver deposits.\n\nGeological Potential of the Kalahari Copper Belt\n\nThe Kitlanya East and Kitlanya West projects are located along the northern and southern basin margins of the Kalahari Copper Belt, a region known for its rich sediment-hosted copper-silver mineralization. The geological setting of the area, characterized by structural folds and fault systems, provides favorable conditions for the formation of large-scale deposits.\n\nThe exploration campaign will focus on evaluating these geological structures, particularly tight, upright folds and anticline hinge zones, which are considered prime targets for high-grade mineralization. If successful, the program could significantly enhance the understanding of the region\u2019s resource potential and lead to the discovery of Tier 1 copper-silver deposits.\n\nPath to Discovery and Future Development\n\nBeyond the immediate exploration investment, the agreement also includes additional financial provisions tied to key project milestones. These include further payments linked to the declaration of a maiden Joint Ore Reserve Committee (JORC)-compliant mineral resource. Additionally, BHP could receive a net smelter royalty if the project advances to commercial production.\n\nThe exploration initiative is expected to contribute to the broader understanding of the Kalahari Copper Belt\u2019s mineral potential, a region that has drawn increasing interest from international mining firms in recent years. If successful, the discoveries made under this partnership could pave the way for future mining development, bringing economic benefits to Botswana\u2019s mining sector.\n\nWith exploration activities set to commence in April 2025, the industry will be watching closely to see whether BHP and Cobre\u2019s investment yields significant discoveries in one of Africa\u2019s most prospective copper belts.\n\nThe above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

The disaster killed 19 people and caused massive pollution to water sources.\n\nShaheed Fatima KC, for BHP, told Mrs Justice O\u2019Farrell: \u2018We submit indirect polluter liability requires a specific breach of duty of safety. [There was] no specific duty of safety in this case, let alone a breach. We say that is a matter of law. BHP were not a direct polluter, they were not an indirect polluter and that is the end of the claimant\u2019s environmental claim.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018The claimants do not get close to showing that an act of omission of BHP caused the collapse.\u2019\n\nFatima added: \u2018As I have said on our case, it is not necessary to go into the facts at all. BHP were not direct polluters, they were not an operator of the polluting activity, the mining or storage of the tailings, the operator was Samarco [Minera\u00e7\u00e3o, a joint venture between BHP and Brazil-based miner Vale]. BHP were not indirect polluters plus they owe no duty of safety.\n\n\u2018There is no dispute about what the relevant activity is. It is important in my submission, on the facts, we have a reminder of that. In the claimants\u2019 skeleton\u2026they explain that the relevant activity in this case was activity of mining generally and storage of tailings behind the dam more particularly.\u2019\n\nIn written submissions, she said that it was not suggested in cross-examination that \u2018anyone at BHP had known that dam safety was compromised\u2019. She added: \u2018On the contrary, as the evidence shows, they were repeatedly assured by external geotechnical engineers that the dam was safe. Nor did [the claimants] suggest to any witness that BHP had prioritised profit over safety.\u2019\n\nFatima, in written submissions, said BHP\u2019s cross-examination during the trial \u2018exposed the extreme and novel interpretation advanced by [the claimants\u2019] Brazilian law experts\u2019.\n\nBHP\u2019s closing submissions will continue until Wednesday with a day expected for the claimants\u2019 reply.

            "content": "The global iron ore market could increase production over the next five years, with output surging as high as 2.92 billion tons by 2029. This trend could put additional pressure on leading exporters like Australia, whose currency has declined by around 20% against the U.S. dollar since 2015.\n\nPer Mining Weekly, BMI's latest report expects iron output to grow at an annual rate of 2.5% until 2029\u2014more than double the 1.2% growth it saw over the previous five years. Expansion of existing mines and new projects, like Guinea's Simandou, which BMI highlights as a long-term milestone, should drive this growth.\n\nHowever, the report also warns that geopolitical instability and resource nationalism could cause delays, and after 2029, a lower price environment could push production into stagnation.\n\nGlobal iron ore exports increased by 2% in 2024, reaching approximately 1.6 billion tons. Australia maintained its position as the world's top exporter, shipping 866 million tons\u2014an increase of 1.4% year-over-year.\n\nBrazil followed with 390 million tons, marking a 2.6% rise, while South Africa shipped 61 million tons, up 3.4%. China, the world's largest importer, brought in a record 1.24 billion tons in 2024, a 4.9% increase driven by stable steel production and lower prices for Australian fines.\n\nMajor mining companies also saw production increases in 2024. BHP BHP boosted output by 3% to 290 million tons, Fortescue Metals Group FSUMF increased supply by 2% to 194 million tons, and Vale VALE achieved a 2% rise to 328 million tons, its highest level since 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, India's exports declined as domestic demand surged by 4% to 242 million tons, driven by growth in steel, pellet, and sponge iron production.\n\nBMI has set an optimistic forecast for Brazil, expecting its ore production to rebound following a contraction around 2020. The firm forecasts a 3.1% average annual growth from 2025 to 2029, with output increasing from 463 million tons to 528.7 million tons.\n\nThis growth is expected to continue beyond 2030 as planned projects contribute to further expansion.\n\nStill, China is expected to lag in market growth, boosting its output by 1% this year. Despite its effort to reduce reliance on ore imports, it faces a cost problem owing to lower-grade ore. India's iron ore production is projected to grow by 2% in 2024, reaching 284 million tons, but growth is expected to slow after 2025, with output forecasted to hit 306.5 million tons by 2034.\n\nAustralia, the global leader in iron ore, is set to increase output by 2.5% in 2025, with expansion projects such as Mineral Resources' Onslow Iron and Fortescue's Iron Bridge contributing to growth.\n\nYet, Rio Tinto has faced challenges due to resource depletion at Paraburdoo and adverse weather, with cyclones expected to impact shipments by 13 million tons in Q1 2025.\n\nWhile cornerstone projects like Simandou offer a supply boost, declining prices and competitive pressures could reshape the industry \u2013 particularly if decarbonization efforts gain stronger momentum.\n\nPrice Watch: VanEck Steel ETF SLX is up 4.33% year-to-date.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: BJP7Images via Shutterstock",

And eventually I would also be stuck somewhere with this demon? The truth got unfolded in a dramatic way!\n\nAfter sharing my North Sikkim snow experience with Gurkha, I was honored to be invited to and joined an unofficial Kolkata Team-BHP group. I got to interact with the people whose travelogues, knowledges inspired me for years, if not decade. Few of them were also curious to know my struggle with Gurkha DPF and were surprised knowing that I hadn't faced any! I again started doubting the reality, thought it best to dig the bigger picture.\n\nI am also part of a national group of Gurkha BS6.2 owners. I requested the admin there, if we can have a poll on the DPF related issue to get the actual picture nationwide. It was organized on 9th March, 2025 and We got many participants to share their votes and here goes the nationwide picture, the first one!\n\nIt could be also be beneficial for the larger audience to know the different regions these BS6.2 Gurkhas belong to with their current age and ODO readings. The different terrains, traffic conditions, weather; these all could be variables to/not to create the DPF issue. Further data collection and summarization yielded more surprising picture! We went to find out how big is the elephant in the room, and it appeared to be a mouse! Please refer the mouse in the second picture!\n\nIt seems, poor experiences get highlighted on social platforms because those create easy buzz and viewership, also creating the perception that they are the majority. The so-called influencers (not owners) also play some role in it. Happy owners are usually busy in exploring the country and enjoying their vehicle.\n\nI mentioned earlier, that I shifted from driving a BS4 diesel 2.2L for around a decade, I shifted to BS6.2 Gurkha. I haven't taken any special precautions or changed my driving style to have a happy experience with it. If someone is still facing DPF issues with Gurkha BS6.2, he/she would surely face the same with other BS6+ diesel vehicles too.\n\nThanks everyone for your patience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

If we add those back in, then the accumulated value of BHP stock is down a lesser 2.0% in a year.\n\nThe miner has come under pressure amid cost inflation and a weakening iron ore price, with some support from a relatively strong copper price.\n\nBut with shares now down almost 8% in a year and down almost 15% from the recent 30 September highs, is now a good time to buy BHP shares?\n\nThe case to hold\n\nRed Leaf Securities' John Athanasiou recommends not pulling the trigger on buying more BHP shares just yet (courtesy of The Bull).\n\n\"This global miner remains a hold due to its high-quality assets, solid balance sheet and a fully franked dividend yield of about 4%,\" said Athanasiou.\n\n\"It's widely regarded as the most popular choice among large resource stocks, benefiting from diversified exposure across iron ore, coal, copper and other commodities.\"\n\nBut with an eye on the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Chinese steel output alongside other supply and demand factors that could impact the iron ore price in 2025, Athanasiou said:\n\nHowever, near-term uncertainty surrounding iron ore prices and weakening demand from China poses risk. While BHP is a well-managed company with an enviable cost position, the lack of immediate catalysts leave it as a hold rather than a buy or sell at current levels.\n\nBroker tips BHP shares as a buy\n\nBell Potter counts among the prominent brokers who believe BHP shares now present good long-term value.\n\nThe broker is optimistic about BHP's increasing exposure to copper and the outlook for further Chinese stimulus measures to boost iron ore demand.\n\nAccording to Bell Potter:",

It will be based on the Lanzador concept that was shown back in 2023, and will be built on a platform developed specifically for Volkswagen Group\u2019s performance and luxury brands.\n\nSpeaking at Volkswagen Group\u2019s annual media conference, boss Oliver Blume shed some light on the upcoming EV from the Raging Bull. He said that the EV would use a platform for Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini and Porsche, that will allow for up to 1973 bhp and 980 volts. He said it\u2019s a very specific setup for Lamborghini. The platform development is being led by Porsche.\n\nLamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann had previously dropped hints that the upcoming EV would at least have 1341 bhp, citing a high power output as \u201cone of the pillars\u201d of an electric performance car. At the same time, driver feel and emotional engagement was more important than outright power.\n\nA 980V electrical architecture for future performance models from the Volkswagen Group marks another substantial step. Most EVs currently use a 400V architecture, although an increasing number use an 800V system that allows for faster charging, better power delivery and increased range efficiency. Some Chinese cars now use a 900V architecture.\n\nBlume confirmed that the EV would be assembled at Lamborghini\u2019s Sant\u2018Agata headquarters in Italy, but didn\u2019t comment where the body or batteries would be produced.\n\nHe said, \u201cI promise that it will be a typical Lamborghini, something very emotional.\u201d\n\nWinkelmann said that because Lamborghini's first EV is an all-new model, rather than a replacement for any current car, there is less risk of it impacting the company's sales volumes; and it could even increase them.\n\n\"We have enough time to decide if we need to accelerate or delay the introduction of the electric cars,\" he said. \"So far, we are not thinking about delaying anything. We said we want to have our first electric car by the end of this decade, and this is something that we will continue to foster because we said it has to be an additional car - a fourth model.\u201d \"It's an additional model \u2013 a new body style, a new type of car in general \u2013 so it's also going to attract new customers to Lamborghini.\"\n\nLamborghini\u2019s current model lineup is now fully hybridized. These include the Revuelto V12, the URUS-SE SUV and the newly launched Temerario.\n\nThe production version of the Lanzador EV will launch by 2030, the end of the current decade.\n\nSource: Autocar UK",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against other best Australian stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nAustralian Market Outlook 2025\n\nIn December 2024, Ausbil Investment Management Limited released its equity market outlook 2025. Ausbil anticipates Australia\u2019s economic growth will improve heading into 2025, supported by global monetary easing and Australia\u2019s low unemployment rates. It foresees the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) potentially reducing rates in 2025, aligning with other central banks, which could boost earnings growth and revitalize cyclical demand. Moreover, the report also expects earnings growth across various sectors to exceed market expectations. However, geopolitical risks, particularly potential trade wars under a newly elected President Trump, pose the most significant threat. If you want to read more about the recent tariffs imposed by the US you can look at the 10 Most Undervalued High Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nAusbil\u2019s general outlook is that a Trump presidency will favor business and markets, but trade changes could cause disruptions and opportunities. It identifies potential in several sectors and expects earnings growth to surpass consensus estimates in FY25. In contrast to widespread recession predictions since late 2023, Ausbil has maintained a more positive view. Australia\u2019s GDP is projected to recover in the latter half of 2024, averaging 1.4%, and further increase to a trend pace of 2.5% in 2025. Household consumption is expected to contribute less of a drag on economic activity. On the other hand, while the labor market remains strong, a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 4.2% is anticipated as labor supply grows and demand relatively slows. Despite this, the economy is expected to maintain its broad-based gains over the past 50 years, which is good news for companies whose earnings depend on household spending. The report expects that the structural demand for resources and a favorable interest rate differential should strengthen the Australian dollar, with forecasts predicting it will rise to US70 cents and the trade-weighted basket will increase.\n\nAusbil expects that Australia\u2019s global interest rate participation will ease in 2025, which is anticipated to support high-quality resource and energy companies. Moreover, the report also expects the earnings growth to recover more than the market anticipates in FY25, broadening across sectors and market capitalization. The FY24 reporting season was weak due to high inflation, higher interest rates, and softness in China. However, looking to 2025, the report foresees relief for balance sheets and income statements from the RBA potentially starting to ease monetary policy, joining other developed markets, which would reduce debt costs.",

This investment follows Cobre\u2019s participation in the 2024 BHP Xplor programme, which funded a seismic survey at Kitlanya West.\n\nUnder the agreement, BHP will contribute a minimum of $5 million within the first two years, with an initial $7 million allocated for exploration, set to begin in April 2025. The exploration plan includes deep diamond drilling and 2D seismic surveys to assess the mineral system's potential for Tier 1 copper deposits. Mobilization for drilling will commence in April 2025, targeting areas identified during the 2024 seismic programme.\n\nBHP has the option to earn a 75% stake in the Kitlanya projects by fully funding the $25 million investment, inclusive of the initial $5 million. During the earn-in phase, Cobre Botswana will serve as the project operator and will receive a management fee of at least $250,000 annually. The agreement does not cover Cobre\u2019s Ngami and Okavango copper projects, which the company will continue developing independently.\n\nCobre CEO Adam Wooldridge emphasized the significance of this partnership, stating, \u201cThis transaction with BHP is a major milestone for Cobre and a testament to the success of the BHP Xplor programme. The collaboration provides us with the necessary funding and support to execute a technology-driven exploration program aimed at discovering Tier 1 deposits within our Kitlanya projects. Meanwhile, we will continue advancing our Ngami and Okavango copper projects, ensuring multiple avenues for discovery and development.\u201d\n\nUpon forming a 75:25 joint venture (JV), BHP may extend a loan to Cobre for its share of JV expenses until a final investment decision is made. Additionally, if a participant\u2019s stake in the JV drops below 10%, the other party will have the right to acquire it at fair market value. If a JORC-compliant mineral resource is declared at the Kitlanya Projects, Cobre will receive an additional $10 million payment. Should BHP exit the agreement after investing at least $20 million, it will be entitled to a 2% net smelter royalty on the Kitlanya Projects, with Cobre retaining the option to repurchase 50% of the royalty under specific terms.\n\nTim O\u2019Connor, BHP\u2019s Group Exploration Officer, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, \u201cWe are excited to continue collaborating with Cobre, a distinguished alumnus of the BHP Xplor programme. This agreement underscores our confidence in Botswana\u2019s exploration potential and highlights the strength of partnerships fostered through BHP Xplor. The Kitlanya projects represent a promising opportunity to uncover Tier 1 copper-silver deposits, and we are eager to contribute our expertise and resources to this venture.\u201d",

Independently, Cobre will continue advancing its Ngami and Okavango copper projects.\n\n\u201cThis combined strategy provides exposure to potential Tier 1 discoveries, a development opportunity at Ngami and short-term discoveries on our Okavango project.\u201d\n\nUpon forming a 75:25 joint venture (JV), BHP may offer Cobre a loan for its share of JV expenses until the final investment decision.\n\nThe JV is also subject to an agreement which specifies that, should a participant\u2019s share in the venture decrease to less than 10%, the other participant will have the right to buy that party\u2019s interest at its fair market value.\n\nAn additional $10m is payable to Cobre if a JORC-compliant mineral resource is declared at the Kitlanya Projects.\n\nIf the agreement ends during the earn-in phase, with BHP funding at least $20m, BHP will receive a 2% net smelter royalty on the Kitlanya Projects. Cobre can buy back 50% of this royalty under specific conditions.\n\nBHP Group exploration officer Tim O\u2019Connor said: \u201cWe are thrilled to continue our partnership with one of the BHP Xplor alumni, Cobre Limited, through this agreement. This collaboration reflects our excitement for the exploration potential in Botswana and underscores the high standard of partnerships we see coming out of the BHP Xplor programme.\n\n\u201cThe Kitlanya projects in Botswana represent an exciting opportunity to uncover Tier 1 copper-silver deposits, and we are pleased to contribute our expertise and resources to this venture.\u201d",

            "content": "The new R8 will use the same aluminium spaceframe structure used by the Temerario. It uses 50% fewer components than the earlier Hurac\u00e1n and second-generation R8.\n\nThe Audi R8 is one of the most loved supercars by enthusiasts worldwide. It was in production between 2006 and 2024 and sold 45,949 units over two generations.\n\nWhile the original R8 came with a 4.2 TFSI, it later got the 5.2 litre NA V10 from the Lamborghini Gallardo. The second-gen car came in 2015, sharing its underpinnings and powertrain with the Lamborghini Huracan.\n\nNow the third-gen R8 is all set to see the light of day, and just like its predecessors, it is expected to use the drivetrain, key structural elements, electronics and chassis of the Temerario, the Huracan successor, which was launched last year. Power will come from a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 paired with three electric motors. The combined output stands at 907 BHP, and a rechargeable 3.8kWh lithium-ion battery pack offers electric-only driving of approx 10 km. A more powerful 1000 BHP version is also rumoured to be in the works.\n\nIn the Temerario, two motors are mounted on the front axle to create a four-wheel-drive setup. The third motor is positioned between the V8 and an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox to act as a starter generator and offer regenerative braking. The new R8 is expected to have the same setup.\n\nThe new R8 will use the same aluminium spaceframe structure used by the Temerario. It uses 50% fewer components than the earlier Hurac\u00e1n and second-generation R8, along with an 80% reduction in welds. It is also claimed to bring a 25% increase in stiffness over the older spaceframe.\n\nThe next-gen R8 is expected to have a 0 to 100 kph timing of under 3.0 seconds, with a top speed close to the Temerario\u2019s 338 kph. These figures will make it the most powerful and fastest Audi to date, beating the fully electric RS E-Tron GT Performance.\n\nThe adoption of the plug-in hybrid tech will allow Audi to showcase its electrification prowess, similar to what Mercedes-AMG and Porsche have done with the GT and 911 respectively. As such, the R8 e-tron nameplate is being considered.\n\nThe decision to revive the R8 is reportedly down to an agreement reached between the Audi board and its Volkswagen Group parent on how the brand can transition to an all-electric line-up. Audi is said to use this tech in future ICE models and expand its plug-in hybrid portfolio.\n\nThe new R8 is expected to be produced at Audi\u2019s B\u00f6llinger H\u00f6fe facility in Germany, the same site as its predecessors. Market launch is slated for 2027 and it is expected to come in Coupe and Spider body styles.\n\nSource: Autocar UK",

            "content": "\n\nBHP Group To Spend Up to A$40M on Cobre Tenements\n\nSydney, Mar 10, 2025 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Cobre Limited ( ASX:CBE ) is pleased to announce that CBE, and certain wholly owned subsidiaries (also Cobre), have executed an Earn-In Agreement (Transaction) with a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP Group Ltd (BHP) under which BHP will provide up to US$25 million (~A$40m) for exploration expenditure for Cobre's Kitlanya East and Kitlanya West Copper Projects (Kitlanya Projects) and be granted the right to earn a 75% interest in the Kitlanya Projects, located on the northern and southern basin margins respectively of the Kalahari Copper Belt (KCB) in Botswana. The Transaction is a result of Cobre's successful participation in the 2024 BHP Xplor program which also provided funding for the recently completed seismic survey on the Kitlanya West Project (see ASX announcement 22 August 2024 ).\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\n\n- The Transaction comprises the following key funding terms (detailed in Schedule 1*):\n\n\n\no A minimum of US$5 million of committed funding to be paid to Cobre within 2 years of the commencement date with a planned budget of US$7m (A$11m) for exploration expenditure for the Kitlanya Projects starting in April 2025; and\n\n\n\no BHP can earn a 75% interest in the Kitlanya Projects by funding US$25 million (inclusive of the initial US$5 million) for exploration expenditure for the Kitlanya Projects.\n\n\n\n- Cobre Botswana will be appointed operator during the earn-in phase and will be entitled to a management fee of no less than US$250,000 per annum.\n\n\n\n- Upon commencement of the 75:25 joint venture, BHP may provide a loan to Cobre to fund Cobre's portion of joint venture expenditure up until the final investment decision.\n\n\n\n- An additional payment of up to US$10 million, calculated at $5/tonne contained copper, is payable to Cobre upon the declaration of a maiden JORC Compliant Mineral Resource (JORC) at the Kitlanya Projects.\n\n\n\n- If the Transaction is terminated during the Earn-In Phase and BHP has funded at least US$20 million for exploration expenditure, BHP will be entitled to a 2.0% net smelter royalty in respect of the Kitlanya Projects. Cobre may, in certain circumstances, buy back 50% of this royalty for an amount equal to the aggregate of exploration expenditure funded by BHP at the time of electing to exercise the buy-back.\n\n\n\n- The Transaction does not cover Cobre's flagship Ngami and Okavango Copper Projects which Cobre will continue to operate and advance independently.\n\n\n\nThe Transaction underscores Cobre's confidence in the potential for its projects to host Tier 1 coppersilver deposits. A partnership with BHP provides the exploration funding, scale and expertise to maximise Cobre's chances of making significant new discoveries on our basin margin exploration ground while retaining 100% ownership of its Ngami and Okavango Copper Projects.\n\n\n\nThe planned work programme for the initial US$7m includes several deep (~1km) diamond holes combined with active 2D seismic survey designed to assess key components of the Mineral System required for Tier 1 copper deposit formation. Mobilisation for the first phase of drilling, which will test targets identified in the 2024 seismic programme at Kitlanya West, is scheduled for April 2025.\n\n\n\nTim O'Connor, BHP Group Exploration Officer said:\n\n\n\n\"We are thrilled to continue our partnership with one of the BHP Xplor alumni, Cobre Limited, through this agreement. This collaboration reflects our excitement for the exploration potential in Botswana and underscores the high standard of partnerships we see coming out of the BHP Xplor program. The Kitlanya Projects in Botswana represent an exciting opportunity to uncover Tier 1 copper-silver deposits, and we are pleased to contribute our expertise and resources to this venture.\"\n\n\n\nCommenting on the Transaction, Adam Wooldridge, Cobre's Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\n\n\n\"This significant transaction with BHP, one of the world's leading mining companies, is a major moment in time for Cobre as a company as well as a testament to the success of BHP's Xplor programme. The partnership with BHP will provide us with the funding and support necessary to implement a technology-driven work programme designed to discover the Tier 1 deposits we believe may be hosted in our Kitlanya East and West Projects.\n\n\n\nIndependently, Cobre will continue advancing its Ngami and Okavango copper Projects. This combined strategy provides exposure to potential Tier 1 discoveries, a development opportunity at Ngami and short-term discoveries on our Okavango project.\"\n\n\n\nCommenting on the transaction, Martin Holland Chairman of the Cobre board, said:\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, I would like to extend my gratitude to BHP for their exceptional efforts in the 2024 BHP Xplor program, which aims to foster bold thinking and elevate global exploration to new heights.\n\n\n\nI would also like to thank the Cobre Board and team, especially our CEO Adam Wooldridge and Technical Lead Thomas Krebs, for their tireless dedication throughout the year-and-a-half-long process that has led us to this point and for their efforts in successfully finalising this transaction with BHP.\"\n\n\n\nGeology, Mineralisation and Exploration Target\n\n\n\nMineralisation in the KCB is sediment-hosted and structurally controlled, with copper-silver mineralisation most frequently hosted along the redox contact between the basal units of the reduced marine sedimentary rocks of the D'Kar Formation and oxidised clastic sedimentary red bed units of the Kuke and Ngwako Pan Formations and the underlying volcano-sedimentary Kgwebe Formation. Of particular interest for Tier 1 deposits are the tight, upright folds which offer ideal trap-sites for upgrading of copper-silver mineralisation and formation of large deposits. These folds are typically bounded by district-scale shears (often with evidence of copper anomalism) which would provide the necessary plumbing architecture for movement of copper-rich fluids during basin formation and subsequent closure and deformation. A schematic illustration of the preserved fold hinge model is illustrated in Figure 2*. The upcoming exploration programme will focus on testing these buried anticline hinge zones along with assessing primary basin architecture, source rocks, fluid pathways and trap-site mechanisms.\n\n\n\nTransaction - Key Terms\n\n\n\nThe key terms of the Transaction are set out in Schedule 1*\n\n\n\n*To view tables and figures, please visit:\n\nhttps://abnnewswire.net/lnk/2E1O5DTG\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Cobre Limited\n\n\n\n\n\nCobre Limited (ASX:CBE) is a copper and base-metals explorer with projects in Western Australia and Botswana. The Company recently discovered a new high-grade VMS deposit enriched in Copper, Gold, Zinc and Silver in Western Australia, and is currently exploring approximately 8,100 km2 of tenements within the Kalahari Copper Belt (KCB) in Botswana.\n\nRelated Companies",

Fully agree with the comparison made by Santosh and others. My observations:\n\n1. Suspension is now quite complaint in the comfort mode. I was driving and my wife spent the time in the front passenger as well as the rear seat. Both could clearly notice the impact of the different settings for the adaptive suspension.\n\n2. We are used to comfort oriented cars like Superb and E-Class and still the ride quality of LCI2 felt acceptable despite driving it on slightly rougher surfaces whereas LCI1 wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t think those used to 3 series variants would have an issue.\n\n3. One can setup the car in Sports Individual mode with suspension in Comfort and rest like drivetrain in sports mode to enjoy the driving experience without the passengers suffering.\n\n4. The exhaust note is now tangibly lower and overall the car feels a bit tamed and matured compared LCI1. Can be both good or bad based on one\u2019s priorities. The dealership mentioned that M performance exhaust was only available as accessory prior to LCI1 and we can't have it now as official accessory. That's a bummer as it would have given us an option to spice it up while retaining the comfort of the suspension!\n\n5. GC is pretty decent. Went over multiple speed breakers of all sizes and did not have an issue except once where I saw the unmarked breaker a bit late and scraped a tiny bit at decent speed.\n\n6. Though I don\u2019t like black interiors, the blue stitching makes it a bit more lively.\n\n7. The leather seats with the side bolstering made my back sweat within 20 min despite the temperature out being just 27d. Should have been atleast perforated. Took a drive of the X5 M40I immediately after the 340I and it felt like heaven to sit on the ventilated seats!\n\n8. The Arctic Blue on the 340i looked pretty good in person though I was more inclined towards the Tanzanite blue prior to seeing it. The X5 was in TB and didn\u2019t appeal as much perhaps since the color has been around for a while and also the car was not very clean. The darker TB shade needs to be kept clean for it to shine through. Adding a few images for the m340i in Arctic blue and x5 in TB for reference.\n\nMy wife who is generally completely disinterested in cars and needs to be dragged out to check out any car, summed up the experience as \u201cone wouldn\u2019t sleep in this car\u201d and I would put it as \u201cfeeling more alive!\u201d It\u2019s a different story that on the way back dropped in to the new Porsche showroom in Hyd and now the lust for a carmine red GTS has been seeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 50.37 in case the stock turns against the trade. 50.49 is the first level of resistance above 50.16, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 50.49, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short BHP slightly near 50.49, target 49.63, Stop Loss @ 50.61. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of BHP if it tests 50.49 with a downside target of 49.63. We should have a stop loss in place at 50.61 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 50.49, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.\n\nCheck the time stamp on this data. Updated AI-Generated Signals for Bhp Group Ltd.

They remove rightly rated fuse and complete the circuit by replacing the fuse with copper wires.\n\n\n\n2. To draw current to newly installing device, they cut some other live wire and does not do proper insulation (to save few inches of tape)\n\n\n\n3. They don't do proper grounding since it requires thick wire and long enough to reach chassis. They will try and connect it to nearby negative cable although it may be thin.\n\n\n\n4. They use audio wires to connect to devices which may not have capacity to run high currents for heating circuits\n\n\n\n5. Amplifier circuit requires specially manufactured high current capacity cables for power. Our experts put low quality cables and charge extra from customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the list goes on. How can we avoid this?\n\n\n\n1. Unless we are 100% sure about the capability of the auto electricians, we should never go to some electrician to install accessories.\n\n\n\n2. Never use local accessories or Chinese accessories. These are another major reason for fire. Always use IEC certified accessories.\n\n\n\n3. Stick to Manufacturers installed accessories and be happy with it.\n\n\n\nI am the person who takes the last option above and most conservative approach.

The driver was trapped in the car and was charred to death. On information, the RGIA police reached the spot and called in a fire tender which doused the flames. The body was later pulled out and shifted to the morgue.\n\n\n\nThe police suspect that the fire might have occurred due to a short circuit. A car catches fire in Hyderabad. This is the 2nd time happening in around a month. In both cases, it was mentioned as electric short circuit issue. The earlier one was Honda Amaze. This one seems to be a Ford.Earlier incident where a doctor unfortunately lost his life when his car caught fire on ring road.Wonder what is causing these fires to break out. The first assumption by police always seems to be electric short circuit. Could it be these cars had some modifications that might have caused these electric issues? Or anything else in the engine bay that might cause these issues?\n\nFormer Meghalaya CM\u0092s son dies after car catches fire in Ri-Bhoi district.\n\n\n\nQuote: The youngest son of former Meghalaya Chief Minister late E K Mawlong was charred to death when the car he was travelling in caught fire in Meghalaya\u0092s Ri-Bhoi district on Saturday.\n\n. . .\n\nAccording to reports, the vehicle in which Ferdinand B Lyngdoh was travelling suddenly caught fire in Umran area on Shillong-Guwahati road.

I had had a couple of really short rides on the 900 GS and loved what I felt in that very brief experience. I\u2019m really itching to take it out on a longer test ride once I have some dedicated time for it. So far not been able to match my availability with the availability of Navnit\u2019s demo. Will hopefully pen something in more detail on this thread once I get the chance.\n\nFrom my brief ride, it was evident how immensely flickable and off road friendly this bike was, specially since I was coming right off the heavier 1300 on both occasions. There will be some touring comfort compromises though in the way they\u2019ve designed this, some of which are not so pronounced on immediate competition like the Tiger 900 RP.\n\nAll in all, BMW seems to have moved the game significantly forward from its predecessor, the 850 GS and I love how this generation has ended up. It\u2019s a definitive match up to the Tiger now and brilliantly priced too, for what it offers - a pretty penny cheaper than both the Desert X as well as the 900 RP in Maharashtra.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "We were a team of six, and this trip was an absolute test to our physical and mental strength.\n\nBHPian graaja recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nIn Search of the Himalayan Ghost - Snow Leopard Expedition to Kibber, Spiti\n\nRecently, I completed a photography expedition to Kibber in Spiti to photograph the elusive Snow Leopard, also known as the Himalayan Ghost. Mr. Vipul of Wild Ark. organized the expedition. This was a 10-day trip that started and ended in Chandigarh - 2 days of travel from Chandigarh to Kibbar, 6 days in Kibber photographing the wildlife, and 2 days of travel back to Chandigarh.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe snow leopards are called ghosts for a reason. They are elusive and excellently camouflaged in the rocky and snowy terrain of the Himalayas. They stay far from humans and can be spotted mostly at high altitudes. We were a team of six, and this trip was an absolute test to our physical and mental strength. We faced extreme weather, with typical temperatures ranging from -15 degrees in the daytime to -28 degrees at night. We trekked in high altitudes (as high as 15,500 feet) at low oxygen levels, and after such arduous treks, we found the snow leopards too far to reach with even the biggest of the telephoto lenses. But with all this hardship, we also had a wonderful time. We experienced the grand landscapes of the mighty Himalayas, the harsh life the locals lead in these remote parts, and the great hospitality of the people in Kibber. We ate simple yet tasty food and spent the evenings around the warm stove sipping hot soup and having humourous conversations.\n\nTo me, this trip was 20% photography and 80% experience. I returned with average (or even below average) pictures of the snow leopards but with a lifetime of memories! So this report will have more pictures of the landscape and the life we experienced than of wildlife.\n\nAs this will be a very long report that can get heavy and even boring, I am providing a link to various parts of the thread below. Please skip to the topics of interest.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPreparation:\n\nThe Snow Leopard Expedition has been on my wish list for a long time. When I saw the announcement from Wild Ark of one in February, I signed up for this sometime in December. I received a detailed document about preparations. Some of the key points are listed below:\n\nNot a Tour: It was clearly mentioned in the document that this is not a tour with luxuries but an expedition with lots of hiking in challenging weather and living it rough for the 6 days in Kibber. Fitness: This is a very important part of preparation. As we expected to do many hikes at high altitudes, cardiovascular fitness is very important to deal with the exertion at those low oxygen levels. I had already started running and continued with the training. I did 3 or 4 runs a week with distances between 15 to 20km a week. And this preparation was a life saver. I was able to manage all the treks and did not face any AMS symptoms. Gear: As the snow leopards and other animals like Ibexes are expected to be quite far, we were told the minimum focal length needed would be 500mm. I had a Canon RF 100-500 zoom lens, and decided to go with this. A good tripod and gimbal mount were recommended if I planned to shoot videos. As I did not have a Gimbal mount, I purchased one. As we expected to shoot at very low temperatures, the batteries will have less life. I already had two batteries for the camera. I bought a third one with a spare charger to be on the safe side. Warm clothes: To deal with the very low temperatures below -20 degrees, we must wear multiple layers of warm clothes - anywhere between 2 to 4 layers, depending on the temperature. I have made some trips to Hanle in similar weather conditions (much warmer compared to Kibber, though), so I already had all the warm clothes required.\n\nJourney from Chandigarh to Kibber:\n\nThe starting point of the expedition was Chandigarh. All of us reached Chandigarh one day before the start of the trip. We visited the famous Pal Dhaba in Chandigarh in the evening for a tasty dinner of butter roti, butter chicken, and kulfi falooda.\n\nA Tempo traveler had been arranged for the journey. We covered the distance between Chandigarh and Kibber in 2.5 days. We stayed at Rampur Bushahr the first day, in Kaza the second day, and reached Kibber by about 11:30AM on the third day. We could have directly gone to Kibber on the 2nd day, but stopped at Kaza for some acclimatization to the altitude and temperature. The last bath we had was in Rampur on Day #2, and the next bath would be again in Rampur on Day#9. For me, this was one of the two toughest parts of the tour - the other being the use of chemical toilet and wet wipes in Kibber\n\nThe first day was a sort of boring drive from Chandigarh to Rampur via Shimla. The drive from Rampur to Kaza was through some scenic routes, and we enjoyed the grand Himalayan landscape with snow-capped mountains during this part of the journey. We stayed in Kaza in a homestay. We had cozy rooms with electric blankets, and had some tasty homemade food. We left Kaza the next day after breakfast and reached Kibber after an hour's drive. We unloaded our luggage, had some tea and snacks and were ready for our first photography session of the Snow Leopard.\n\nA few pictures from this part of the trip.\n\nThe famous Pal Dhaba. There are two hotels in the same complex - The Old Pal Dhaba and The New Pal Dhaba. We had dinner at The Old Pal Dhaba, as this was the original one.\n\nButter roti and butter chicken with some kulfi falooda to finish. The butter rotis were literally dripping butter!\n\nThe journey begins. We left Chandigarh at 5:30 in the morning in a Tempo Traveler.\n\nWe stopped for breakfast at the outskirts of Shimla, in a hotel called Sher-E-Punjab. This hotel had an open terrace with a view of the grand mountain ranges. We had some tasty breakfast and resumed our journey.\n\nPuri and tea for breakfast.\n\nThe first view of the grand mountains.\n\nTea with a view.\n\nWe stayed at Bushahr Regency, run by Himachal Tourism in Rampur.\n\nNeat and clean room.\n\nContinue reading about graaja's photography expedition for BHPian comments, insights and more information.",

(Image by Chensiyuan \u2013 Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nBiotechnology company BPH Global (ASX: BP8) has found gold and copper concentrations in seaweed, as part of an ongoing research program to potentially extract precious and base metals from seawater.\n\nThe firm\u2019s hypothesis is that seaweed can absorb higher mineral concentrations from polluted waters compared to pristine waters, acting like a sponge for these minerals. This would mean seaweed can act as a \u201cnatural miner\u201d as it can absorb valuable metals from seawater.\n\nThe latest assays, conducted by Temasek Innovation Holdings (TPIH) in Singapore in collaboration with Gaia Mariculture, revealed gold concentrations of up to 14.85 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and copper concentrations of up to 10.88 mg/kg in seaweed cultivated in clean, filtered seawater from the island of Sentosa.\n\n\u201cThe presence of gold and copper, in addition to the previously identified cobalt and silver, marks another exciting milestone in our research,\u201d managing director Matthew Leonard said in a statement. \u201cThese results further support our view that seaweed has the potential to act like a sponge for base and precious metals in seawater. We look forward to investigating this further in Phase 2 of the R&D programme.\u201d\n\nPhase 1 of BPH Global\u2019s research focused on cultivating Sesuvium portulacastrum seaweed in a controlled laboratory environment using water free from industrial or urban pollution. Initial assays confirmed significant levels of silver and cobalt, prompting additional testing for gold and copper.\n\nBuilding on these findings, Phase 2 will shift research to brackish, polluted waters in Johor, Malaysia, to explore whether mineral absorption increases in less pristine conditions.\n\nBPH Global is among a growing number of companies investigating seaweed\u2019s potential for mineral extraction. Blue Evolution, a California-based regenerative ocean farming company that merged with Blu3 last year, is developing seaweed farms to extract critical minerals, including rare earth elements, recognized as strategic resources by the US government.",

            "content": "Having caught up on many issues of the Autocar Magazine while at home on break, I had read enough to understand that this would certainly be something worth attending. And it absolutely was.\n\nBHPian GForceEnjoyer recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nIt was an extremely fortunate coincidence of events that let this happen. My university semester began on the 20th of January 2025, which meant that by simply flying back to Delhi one day earlier than I would otherwise have done, I could attend the Auto Expo for the first time in 5 years!\n\nHaving caught up on many issues of the Autocar Magazine while at home on break, I had read enough to understand that this would certainly be something worth attending. And it absolutely was.\n\nA lot of it was because @CentreOfGravity, @TheHondaLover and I were able to coordinate our visits and meet up at the BMW drift event and explore onwards together! My first planned Team-BHP meet. Additional respect to @TheHondaLover for changing his plans last minute to make it on Sunday and meet us.\n\nI'll cut right to the chase: the car that I was the most excited about was the new Superb. Hence, when we finally got to the Skoda pavilion, I was like a kid let loose in the candy store. Here it is in the flesh! One of the few cars that looks quite similar in real life as it does in photos.\n\nJust like the previous generation, this is also unmistakably a Skoda. However, you can see their new, slightly more rounded design language showcasing itself on this car as opposed to the sharper lines of the previous one. As usual, exterior fit-and-finish is absolutely top-notch with amazingly even panel gaps.\n\nI am not sure how I feel about the new lights. It somehow seems as though they lack the purposeful look of the old ones. However, overall, the stance is definitely a little more imposing than before due to the car looking much larger. Here's a look at the lights carrying forward a slightly toned down version of the lighting elements behind the DRL, homage to Czech glassmaking.\n\nAnd a look at the tail lights (credits to @CentreOfGravity for photographing the Superb's lights). Note the 4x4 badge; the model on display was the 2.0 Litre 4x4 TDI. Also note how the subtle integrated spoiler on the boot gives away the fact that it doesn't perfectly align with the quarter panel: the only uneven panel gap I could find.\n\nThe interior is simply stunning in terms of design. The way the tan leather inserts have been used, the nice false wood, the chrome embellishments and the absolutely beautiful A/C vents make for a very visually pleasing place to be in.\n\nHowever, I am not fully sold on the quality of a few bits. For example, the textured surface on the top of the dashboard and door-pads. This generation also does away with the traditional automatic shifter; it now gets a Mercedes-like column shifter instead.\n\nThe three multifunction dials at the centre console to control A/C temperature, drive modes, blower speed and ventilated seats are quite easy to get used to, and hopefully should not require you to look down while driving, unlike the disastrous touch controls used in newer VWs.\n\nThe seating position was quite good for someone of my height (5'10\" with long legs), and the front seats were large, firm and supportive. The type of leather used seems quite different to the outgoing car; it felt very different to that of our 2021 Superb. Overall build quality wasn't really easy to judge; the touchpoints felt solid enough though (minus the multifunction centre dials).\n\nAll in all, it is certainly a much more flamboyant design than before, and a 9/10 according to me. The single point deducted is because in my opinion, the screen should not be as tall as it is, and the S K O D A lettering on the steering wheel isn't quite to my taste. This is of course, subjective.\n\nThe car that was the real crowd-puller however was this, the Octavia RS. And my goodness, what a beautiful shade of green this is!\n\nThe blacked out grille and air dam look incredibly tasteful and combined with the low stance, this is the first time in a while that a new Octavia has captured my desire.\n\nCheck out the beautiful lights! Credits to @CentreOfGravity for the second photo.\n\nThe same interior which looks a little clinical in beige with piano black now looks smashing in all-black with alcantara and carbon-fibre inserts. The touch controls are still a bummer functionality-wise though. I would not want to have to look down from driving hard on a track or windy road to change the blower speed or volume!\n\nI am a fan of Skoda's style of door handles; this is from the new Kodiaq for example. Extremely elegant (although polished chrome might suit it better, right?). Look at the incredible amount of textures and materials surrounding it!\n\nA little story: a young kid of around five years old was intently examining the interior sitting in the passenger seat, while his dad clicked pictures. Upon noticing me waiting in queue, the kid's mother asked him to hurry up, causing him to flash an annoyed glare. Because I would have spent time in the interior in exactly the same way at that age (even today in fact; doing so is how I was able to write this post!), asking the parents to let their child take his time felt incredibly good!\n\nHats off to Skoda for having an incredible display and for also letting people sit inside even the expensive CBU models. I was also shocked to see that the crowd was pretty civilised at this pavilion; not something one expects at such events in India.\n\nTata's Avinya concept was another crowd puller, with its sheer size and good proportions. A decidedly RWD stance. I have to say though, I see a bit of Vinfast in the logo.\n\nThe Mercedes pavilion had two beautiful displays right up front: the SL 55 AMG and a mean, sleeper-spec S-Class. Pictures are worth a thousand words, these tasteful designs are in stark contrast to the jarring ones BMW is now putting out.\n\nWhile on the topic of BMW, I essentially had to skip their pavilion at hall 6. There was nothing short of a literal stampede in there, right between BMW and Porsche's displays. Missing the latter is a bit unfortunate, as the new Panamera and a tasty yellow 911 was on display.\n\nToyota's new Camry was on display too. I'm not sold on the front, but the side profile looks great (ironically due to the large and impractical-for-India wheels).\n\nRight next-door was the Lexus LF-ZC. While it is a striking design, I am bound to forget the rather confusing name quite soon. By the way, \"the endless pursuit of perfection\" was a slogan more befitting for the meticulous attention to detail and quality upheld by Lexus, don't you think? Perfection at the end of the day is a concept impossible to universally define, and is a goal one can only incrementally and endlessly inch towards through continuous improvement.\n\nSo, here is my little account of snippets from the 2025 Auto Expo that I found the most interesting. It was an absolutely fantastic day made even better by the presence of @CentreOfGravity and @TheHondaLover. Such events are always made more fun when you're in the company of those you can geek out with.\n\nThe expo this year was jam-packed with new concepts, and a far grander iteration of the event compared to the comparatively rather sad 2020 expo in Greater Noida.\n\nHope you've enjoyed this post; as parting shots, here are two displays from MG that we all loved.\n\nThe truly British MG Midget...\n\n\n\nAnd this very creative display showing old and new side by side.\n\n\n\n@CentreOfGravity will take it from here with his absolutely incredible collection of photos and expert observations of all the other pavilions and expos.\n\nUntil next time, cheers!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "The Australian Securities Exchange is experiencing an influx of Canadian producers seeking dual listings.\n\nThere has been a trickle of dual listings on the ASX since 2018,, but the trend has significantly accelerated following Canadian uranium developer NexGen Energy (TSX: NXE), adding an Australian listing in 2021.\n\nCapstone Copper\u2019s (TSX: CS) ASX listing in February 2024, however, seemed to have open the floodgates, with a further four Canadian mining companies initiating the listing process since.\n\nThe ASX has been capitalizing on weaker market conditions in Canada, conducting roadshows to attract new companies. \u201cResources companies have really been struggling to attract capital in Canada,\u201d BDO deal advisory partner Adam Myers told the recent RIU Explorers Conference in Perth. \u201cThe ASX is certainly a great place to be exposed to this market.\u201d\n\nASX senior manager, listings Sasha Conoplia told MINING.COM that Canadian interest in dual listings is growing, particularly following Capstone\u2019s experience.\n\n\u201cThe resources sector is the largest on ASX by number of listings and that brings a sophisticated Australian and global institutional and retail investor base that can provide capital and liquidity,\u201d he said.\n\nConoplia noted that the ASX ranks first globally in market capitalization, IPOs, and capital raisings for metals and mining companies.\n\n\u201cThe Australian capital markets ecosystem for resources is deep and well developed with strong research coverage and global capital support,\u201d he said. \u201cFor companies listing on ASX the market offers competitive valuations across sectors, earlier index inclusion than other global peers, and access to global institutional capital.\u201d\n\nThe stock is home to the biggest miners. BHP (ASX: BHP), the world\u2019s largest mining company, decided in 2022 to have its shares listed exclusively in Sydney, as part of plans to simplify the group\u2019s corporate structure. Fellow miner Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO), the no.2 mining company, announced this week that will allow the company\u2019s Australian shareholders to vote on a resolution that seeks an independent review of its dual-listing status.\n\nThe Capstone example\n\nCapstone started trading in Sydney last year with two million CHESS depositary interests (CDIs), an instrument that provides investors with the same beneficial interests as holding shares. Since then, the number of CDIs has grown to 185.1 million by the end of February, bolstered by an April 2024 block trade by Orion.\n\nCapstone director of investor relations for the Asia Pacific region Michael Slifirski told MINING.COM that the lack of quality copper names on the ASX was an opportunity for the company, particularly after BHP\u2019s (ASX: BHP) acquisition of OZ Minerals in 2023.\n\nUnlike SSR Mining (TSX: SSR), which announced this week that it was delisting from the ASX due to low liquidity, Capstone has been increasing the proportion of trading in Australia.\n\nSlifirski emphasized that a successful listing requires commitment.\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of list and investors will buy \u2013 far from it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investment case has to be compelling and relevant in quality and scale relative to existing ASX investment opportunities and then needs to be well supported by a committed and credible team that wants it to work.\u201d\n\nOther copper plays follow\n\nIn late January, another South America-focused copper play, Marimaca Copper Corp (TSX: MARI), lodged a prospectus for an ASX listing, aiming to list on March 13 after raising A$600 to meet ASX admission requirements.\n\nMarimaca CEO Hayden Locke, an Australian, highlighted the importance of accessing a broader capital pool as the company nears a construction decision for its Marimaca oxide deposit.\n\n\u201cAs we move closer to a construction decision for the Marimaca oxide deposit, and continue our aggressive exploration plans, a broader pool of capital will become increasingly important to our company,\u201d Locke, who is Australian, said.\n\nLast month, Vancouver-based junior Pampa Metals (CSE: PM) announced it was acquiring fellow South America-focused explorer Rugby Resources (TSXV: RUG) and dual list the enlarged entity on the ASX.\n\nPampa investor relations advisor Jordan Webster said the company\u2019s Australian CEO, Joseph van den Elsen, understands the local capital market well.\n\n\u201cSince he took over the company, we believe liquidity in Canada hasn\u2019t been great, while the Australian market has remained much stronger,\u201d Webster said.\n\n\u201cWe also believe Pampa can stand out on the ASX as a unique story \u2013 two discovered high-grade porphyries in South America, which is rare for a junior explorer. Canada is already saturated with South American copper explorers, so we\u2019re confident we will see better visibility and investor engagement in Australia.\u201d\n\nAfrican miners on the way\n\nThe ASX, already home to West Africa-focused gold producers Perseus Mining (ASX: PRU) and West African Resources (ASX: WAF), may soon welcome two more.\n\nOrezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE) announced last month that it was pursuing a secondary listing on the ASX to support the expansion of its flagship Bombor\u00e9 mine in Burkina Faso. The company hopes the listing will enhance liquidity and attract mining-focused funds restricted to ASX-listed issuers.\n\nSmaller gold company Robex Resources (TSX: RBX) is planning to delist from the TSX entirely and migrate to the ASX. The company, which is looking to exit Mali and achieve first gold at its Kiniero project in Guinea by the end of the year, likely aims to capitalize on the success of ASX market darling Predictive Discovery (ASX: PDI), which owns the neighbouring Bankan deposit.\n\nRobert Friedland\u2019s private Guinea-focused iron ore developer, Ivanhoe Atlantic, has also selected the ASX for its initial public offering, which is reportedly looking to raise up to A$300 million.\n\nIvanhoe Atlantic CEO Bronwyn Barnes said the company considered various bourses. \u201cGiven the strong knowledge of the iron ore market on the ASX and the familiarity of Australia with African mining projects generally and Guinea in particular, a listing on the ASX made sense for us,\u201d she said.\n\nLondon stock being deserted\n\nThe TSX isn\u2019t the only exchange losing mining companies. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has also suffered an exodus, with Glencore CEO Gary Nagle suggesting the company may leave the LSE, though not necessarily for Australia.\n\nGreatland Gold (LON: GGP), which has considered an ASX listing for years, confirmed this week that it is targeting a cross-listing in the June quarter.\n\n\u201cAs a significant Australian gold-copper producer, the ASX listing is intended to provide benefits including an enhanced capital markets profile and increased institutional ownership and index participation,\u201d CEO Shaun Day said.\n\nEcuador-focused SolGold (LON: SOLG) is also considering an ASX listing. The company, originally formed in Australia but now based in London, recently appointed Dan Vujcic as CEO. Vujcic, previously CFO of ASX-listed MAC Copper (ASX: MAC), said he sees the ASX as a natural fit for SolGold. \u201cThe ASX is a natural home for a copper and gold portfolio of this quality,\u201d he said.",

Closing submissions in Munic\u00edpio de Mariana and others v BHP Group (UK) Ltd and BHP Group Ltd, which started in October last year, began on Wednesday. The claimants and BHP are expected to provide three days of oral closing submissions to accompany their written submissions, each 506 pages long.\n\nFor the claimants, Alain Choo Choy KC told the court: \u2018The direct or indirect polluter are only different in terms of agreeing their link, but for liability purposes they remain equivalent. That is obviously the key point.\u2019 Choo Choy, added that because of the difficulties of identifying the precise background causation, it was \u2018sufficient that environmental damage would not have happened but for the collapse\u2019.\n\nThis is, Choo Choy said, in accordance with the \u2018full risk theory\u2019 which is \u2018entirely consistent\u2019 with Brazil\u2019s state appellate courts and the Superior Court of Justice\u2019s acceptance of a \u2018measures application of the theory of equivalence of conditions for environmental civil liability\u2019. No distinction is drawn between main and secondary causes or direct and indirect causes under the theory, the court was told.\n\nBHP denies the claims brought in the UK on behalf of some 620,000 people allegedly affected by the pollution. The company has previously said the English court duplicated issues covered by ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil. It argues it is a separate legal entity from Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o, the dam\u2019s operator, which is a joint venture between BHP and Brazil-based miner Vale.\n\nIn written submissions, Choo Choy said: \u2018BHP has gone to extravagant lengths, at huge cost to the parties and significantly increasing the burden upon the court, to make the claimants\u2019 case appear more complicated than it really is.\n\n\u2018The claimants submit that BHP\u2019s liability is straightforward and obvious: BHP is a \u201cpolluter\u201d under Brazilian law and must pay. In addition, or in the alternative, BHP caused and allowed the dam to continue to be raised, even though it ought to have been aware of the increasing risk of failure.\u2019\n\nThe hearing continues. BHP\u2019s closing oral submissions are expected to begin on Monday.\n\nThis article is now closed for comment.",

It's just about showing more than average interest.\n\nBHPian Jeroen recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI don't believe in a strict definition of a petrolhead. Anybody who is genuinely interested in cars, or particular aspects of cars, is a petrolhead as far as I am concerned.\n\nI don't think it is about knowledge about cars, be it about models, pricing, depreciation, features, or technical aspects. It's just about showing more than average interest.\n\nWith that in mind, when did it become obvious you were likely to become a Petrolhead?\n\nShare your story and or an image that tells us about your 'Petrolhead-journey from as early on as possible.\n\nI recently found my parent's photo albums. I found this image, which I presume was taken by my dad. He was the one that knew (sort of) how to operate a camera.\n\nThe year is 1960! I am 16 months old! The location is somewhere near the town of Groesbeek in the Netherlands where my parents had rented a small holiday home. My youngest sister had not been born, so it was just my parents, my two elder sisters and me.\n\nThe car is my dad's. It is a DKW Autounion 1000 or 1100. Not sure. This was a typical family car with a tiny two-stroke engine! In those days, less than half the families in our street owned cars. Going on a holiday in your car was pretty special. Most families stayed home.\n\nAccording to my mum, I always demanded to sit in the front on my mum's lap. So I could watch my dad drive and look out for traffic!\n\nIn those days there were no kiddy-seats, let alone airbags or even seatbelts. My parents were chain smoking with all the kids in the car. No speed restrictions on the Dutch motorway. Although you'd be hard pushed to get a DKW much over 100 km/h. And you would need a fair bit of stretch road to accelerate up to 100 km/h. Don't hold your breath!\n\nMy mum told me I always demanded to help my dad when he went to fill up the car or fit the roof rack for the holiday. And wherever the car was parked, I wanted to open the driver door and sit behind the wheel.\n\nThe rest is history as they say!\n\nLets have your earlier \"petrolhead story and or image\"!\n\nJeroen\n\nHere's what GTO had to say on the matter:\n\nDad loved driving. I remember him revving his Padmini in 3rd gear on Worli Seaface & Marine Drive (what a feeling!). Among other cars, he had a souped-up Ambassador with lots of add-ons and a custom dark green paint job (National Garage was famous for them back in the day), a Standard Herald (convertible IIRC), a Mercedes W111 S-Class. Guess that was a major influence and cars have been in my blood since the earliest days. Used to sit on the bed with a shirt hanger as a steering wheel and go for imaginary drives. Ditto with the cars parked down the house. All my toys were cars. The love for anything with wheels...happy to enjoy that more with Team-BHP. Starting with a picture of my first \"4 wheels\"\n\n\n\nHere's what BHPian Fueledbyfury had to say on the matter:\n\nIf you ask any generation in India, from the 1980s to the early 2000s, about the first car they owned or the one they learned to drive in, over 90% will say it was a Maruti Suzuki 800. Me with my Maruti 800, the car that put India on wheels. My trusty sister as my co-driver.\n\nHere's what BHPian saikishor had to say on the matter:\n\nI was probably 3 or 4 years old. That is our 1995 Nissan Altima that we had when we were in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

I see these sort of accidents being reported across the world. First of all we should stop labelling these incidents as \u201cgoogle maps drives man into.\u2026..if anything label them driver follow navigation system instruction blindly!\n\n\n\nLets make one thing clear. Google map did not do this.\n\n\n\nThe guy drove into this drain himself. Maybe there was an error in google map, but everybody ought to understand you can't blindly follow a map, a digital map, a GPS navigation aid. Even if you have somebody sitting next to you doing the navigation, the driver is still responsible.\n\n\n\nIts unclear to me, if there were any signage missing at this spot. But blindly following a GPS navigation system without driver due attention, focus and appropriate speeds for the actual situation is simply one hundred percentage the responsibility of the driver and nobody else.\n\n\n\nJeroen Last edited by Axe77 : 7th March 2025 at 06:33 .",

(GX doesn't get Automatic Climate Control)\n\n4. Above trip is 90% Highway drive and 10% City.\n\nIf one knows how to drive a CVT, the Innova Hycross will impress you with its refined powertrain and optimum power at a tap of throttle. While this also results in good efficiency.\n\nIf anyone has any questions related to Hycross Non Hybrid, please feel free to post here. This month on 25th, my car will turn 1 and it's been appreciated by every family members and friends since purchase.

I visited a local seatmaker nearby and added double padding, which increased the seat height. This adjustment was necessary because the stock seat was too low and didn\u2019t suit my height or leg position. With the new setup, the ergonomics are much better than before.\n\nAfter completing the bike\u2019s annual service, I decided to upgrade the headlights by replacing the stock halogen bulbs with LED bulbs. I bought a pair of Nighteye A315 S4 (2024 H4 LED) bulbs. The LED throw is significantly better, now riding at night feels much safer and more comfortable.\n\nI also asked my mechanic to install an on/off switch for the headlights. This is helpful because daytime running lights drain the battery and make starting the bike harder when the battery is low. With these updates and the annual service done, my bike feels much improved.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m having a great time riding my bike, especially on weekend breakfast rides. Next I\u2019m planning some major upgrades\u2014probably new tyres and maybe a suspension upgrade.

Why would Cricket Australia pick Steven Smith for T20s? Shouldnt he have retired from T20s too? Actually he should have retired from T20s too and focused just on Tests.\n\n\n\nAnyway, from an indian cricket standpoint, I think Rohit should retire from Tests, his high risk style will not pay off in Tests, especially in overseas conditions. And its time to bring in some youngsters who can learn with time. Rohit is still good in ODIs, i think we cannot deny that. His quickfire 30-40 runs in the first 5-6 overs always releases pressure for the middle order. But the other side of the argument is that would he be the right option for WC 2027? Im someone who does not think that everything should be planned keeping the WC in mind. It cannot be when it\u2019s still 2 years ahead. And being a top team which does consistently well across the world is more important than winning the WC.\n\n\n\nI would rather have a team that is able to match up to Australia, England and South Africa in their home conditions than an occasional world cup winner who cannot perform overseas.\n\n\n\nAnyway, lets see how the Champions trophy final pans out.",

We are looking at a replacement for our 2017 Jupiter, and as I have mentioned in the past I have never been comfortable riding it because the handlebars foul with my knees even on slight turns. With that basic ergonomic caveat, we have tested some options recently, ranging from the Ntorq 125 to the Yamaha Aerox. And Aprilia SR 160/SXR160 as well. Purely on a apple to apple replacement theory, we are also looking at the Access 125 (not test driven yet) and the Activa 125. But the Destini 125 popped out of nowhere primarily because I saw Youtube video where they mentioned that the rear tyre is 100/80/12 as opposed to the 10 inchers on the Activa/Access. And then I also stumbled upon the Team BHP review here. So went over to the nearest showroom. A few observations:\n\nThe scooter has plenty of pep, almost Ntorq like, considering they quote 9 bhp, it feels almost like a 10/11 bhp machine.\n\nThe seat base is long and cushiony as mentioned in the review.\n\nRide is stiff, but the scooter felt quite ok in terms of handling.\n\nA very important aspect: our respective full size helmets (single) fit well inside the boot, which is a pleasant surprise.\n\nSo far, I have loved the Aerox for obvious reasons, and also the NTorq for its pocket-rocket demeanour.\n\nBut the Destini 125 seems to strike a good balance in terms of comfort, practicality and performance for almost 40% less cost.

            "content": "More than anything else, rapid urbanization is driving demand for critical minerals like copper around the world.\n\nDelivering the opening keynote address at this year\u2019s Prospectors and Developers Association Conference (PDAC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, BHP (ASX:BHP,NYSE:BHP,LSE:BHP) CEO Mike Henry spoke to the opportunities and challenges posed by the growth of urban centers around the world.\n\nHis presentation discussed how the mining industry, including Canada's, can respond to the growing demands on the resource sector and deliver the critical minerals that will be required over the next few decades.\n\nThe opportunity: Copper and critical minerals demand outpacing supply\n\nOver the last 10 years, there has been a global population redistribution. For the first time, more of the world\u2019s population lives in urban centers than in rural areas. Along with this shift has come greater densification, which has pushed electrical grids to their limits.\n\nHowever, as Henry pointed out, this is just the beginning. By 2050, the global population will grow by 25 percent to 10 billion people, and the vast majority of them will live in urban centers.\n\n\u201cThey are the engines of massive opportunity for our industry. More high rises, homes, roads and infrastructure, greater electrification, more phones, televisions, cars and air conditioning. More energy, more data centers to power AI and cloud computing,\u201d he said.\n\nThis population boom means the world will need more of everything, from copper and steel to potash and other minerals.\n\nAs a company, BHP is a global powerhouse. Its portfolio of assets touches on a variety of minerals that will be critical in the coming decades; few, however, may be as important as copper. Henry suggests that demand for red metal will rise 70 percent over the next 15 years.\n\nThe massive surge in demand presents an enormous opportunity for the resource sector, especially for investors. Outlining the scale of capital required, Henry estimates that more than US$250 billion will be needed for mining and concentration to keep pace with demand growth, with additional funding needed for smelting and refining \u2014 and that\u2019s just for copper.\n\nWhen other minerals are added to the equation, the total could reach US$800 billion between now and 2040.\n\nThe first challenge: Finding significant critical mineral deposits in Canada\n\nAlthough opportunities exist, they don\u2019t come without challenges, and Henry suggests that the challenges exist both above and below ground.\n\n\u201cFirst, we\u2019re going to have to find the resources\u2026 Those resources are big, large deposits that are becoming harder to find,\" he said. \"They\u2019re deeper, they're more remote, they come with new technical challenges, and they\u2019re often in riskier jurisdictions.\"\n\nThis has led to BHP rethinking how it invests in exploration, seeing them not only fund and carry out exploration work itself, but partnering with other companies around the world.\n\nSome of these partnerships have seen work being carried out in Canada with Henry suggesting considerable untapped resources in the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, Canada has extensive exploration history already, yet much of this has been at shallow depths in subaortic areas. So there remains potential to find deeper or underexplored parts of the country, and we\u2019re engaged in that effort with a specific focus on copper,\u201d he said.\n\nThe solution, he said, is to apply new technologies from other sectors, including 3D seismic sensors and muon tomography. However, this new technology generates huge amounts of data, which benefits from advances in artificial intelligence to help make sense of all the information being collected.\n\nHenry says that BHP has taken a different approach to partnerships by borrowing from the tech sector.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also borrowed the accelerator concept from big tech, and we are supporting innovative exploration technologies, methods, and ideas through our global accelerator program, BHP Explorer,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThe implications are enormous for an industry that needs new ideas brought to the forefront in short timelines.\n\nThe second challenge: Government mining policies\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge facing the resource sector comes not from within the industry but from outside it.\n\nHenry suggested that the biggest changes can come from evolving government policy, and he thinks things are beginning to move in the right direction. Canada itself released a critical minerals strategy in 2021, and its latest update includes 34 minerals and metals.\n\n\u201cThere has been a very welcome burst of renewed government interest in critical minerals in recent times, and the motivations do vary,\u201d he said.\n\nFor some governments, this interest stems from a desire to use resources to unlock the economic opportunity associated with decarbonizing the global energy grid. Meanwhile, other governments are pursuing critical minerals needed to provide energy security, economic sovereignty and defense supply chain resilience.\n\nHenry noted that some countries are taking steps to make themselves more competitive and are working to attract capital investment for projects through fiscal reform and tax credits. He also pointed out that some governments are streamlining the regulatory process, which he suggests will speed up development time and reduce risks.\n\nHenry sees incredible benefits in Canada due to the strength of the mining sector, but he cautions that past successes aren\u2019t indicative of future success. He believes Canada is in danger of missing out on the next great opportunities in the resource sector.\n\n\u201cOther countries have some mix of even better resource endowments in certain commodities, better tax and royalty regimes, more streamlined permitting processes, while still maintaining high standards and more productivity, enabling industrial relations framework,\u201d Henry said.\n\nHenry sees complacency and bureaucracy as the enemy of growth and economic security, and believes Canada needs to accelerate its efforts to match those being carried out elsewhere.\n\nIn comparison, he points to Chile, where he says they\u2019ve accelerated permitting for multi-billion dollar greenfield projects to five to 10 years and even shorter for brownfield developments. In Canada, he said, those timelines stretch to 10 to 15 years.\n\n\u201cGlobal capital is going to flow to the best opportunities, risk return opportunities globally. So if a country isn\u2019t constantly benchmarking and saying, what\u2019s the combined effect of our industrial relations policies, our tax settings, our permitting process relative to the other countries that are chasing the same opportunity, we run the risk of falling behind,\u201d Henry said.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors?\n\nHenry outlined a potential for staggering growth in the mining sector for critical minerals such as copper over the next 15 to 20 years. He suggested there is an opportunity for investors looking to get into the sector at all levels, from exploration to production.\n\nHe also noted that it is not without problems. When investors evaluate projects, especially early in development, they should recognize that a multitude of factors could determine their success or failure.\n\nHenry touched on access to the resource, the depth of the deposit and its remoteness. He also noted that jurisdictions play a huge part in a project's success, so investors should research a country's permitting process and tax system, as well as why a country may look to fast-track projects and whether it affects a company\u2019s risk analysis.\n\n\u201cOnce capital mobilizes in one direction, sometimes it can be quite hard to mobilize back in the other,\u201d Henry said.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Dean Belder, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

I think they will lose huge volumes, but to protect brand image and regain the lost respect, I feel this might be a feasible solution.\n\n\n\nWe TBHPians sometimes have a very narrow point of view when it comes to motorcycles. We tend to believe that only the 300-400+ category matters but Indian market is still bringing the most volumes under the 200cc mark. Everyone wants a piece of that pie and KTM is missing out. Especially with their financial situation, they need all help they can get. 125s made no sense as it is a Euro market phenomenon and never really translated well into our market.\n\n\n\nQuote: FlankerFury Originally Posted by Guess we'll be seeing something similar from KTM.

MT15 is mostly bought by youngsters and squids but I don't see anybody losing their 'respect' for Yamaha. What they really need is something that sells in 5k+ volumes under 2L. In my personal opinion, there should be also a 200 or 250 Enduro in future.We TBHPians sometimes have a very narrow point of view when it comes to motorcycles.

We have a demonstrated capability in getting these minerals to market.\n\nWe have strong and stable institutions, and good relationships with our key markets.\n\nThese advantages are however not unique, nor will they prevail over time without continued investment.\n\nWe\u2019ve all watched the flurry of recent trade moves and countermoves as countries seek to shore up industrial investment and secure mineral and energy supplies.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the rules of the game are changing, and the competition is fierce.\n\nBut the case for optimism remains.\n\nOptimism, but not complacency.\n\nThere will be many factors beyond Australia we cannot directly control or influence as we would like, however, what is within our control, investments and policy settings in productivity, in energy, in labour and capabilities, these are the settings that demand our attention as business, political and academic leaders.\n\nI\u2019m hopeful that a big part of the conversation we are going to have over coming days, and indeed the conversation we will have as a nation over coming months, is how best Australia can strengthen our competitive edge, lean into our natural strengths, and be clear on the settings and capabilities that will enable us to compete.\n\nThank you.",

Kia I believed being a sister company of Hyundai would give me a bliss and problem free ownership like that of the i20. I was soon to find out what an infuriating and problematic car and post sales service felt like.\n\n\n\nMy car is a March, 2024 manufactured 29th April, 2024 purchased white Seltos GTX+ DCT. I did a through PDI using the team bhp check list and couldn't find any issues with it.\n\n\n\nTook the delivery of the car on 3rd May, 2024, as a tradition we took the car from PPS Kia, Mysore Road to Dhoda Ganesha Temple, Bull Temple Road for Pooja. On my way back from the temple, I experienced my first issue.\n\n\n\nIssues with the engine - 1) 3rd May, 2024 day of purchase 50km on the odometer [CHECK ENGINE LIGHT] - got an engine management system error warning and the engine check light came on. I immediately pulled over and gave a call to the sales advisor who advised me that I could drive on and to bring the car the next day for number plate fitting and checking the issue if any.\n\n\n\nThe next day the engine check light turned off but I had a photo of the same. The SA at PPS Kia, Mysore Road refused to open a job card or make a note of it. He told me that since the light wasn't on anymore it could be a loose connection that got resolved and assured me that it was safe to drive.\n\n\n\n2) 28th May, 2024 - car was in the ASC for the first service. I mentioned the engine check light incident to the SA. They delivered the car the same evening telling me everything was okay with the car.\n\n\n\n3)26th June, 2024 (1969km on the odometer) - Got the car into the ASC for engine oil change, something that I always do with all my cars after the break in period. During the service SA told me that when they scanned the car they found an error with the O2 sensor and that I'd have to leave the car with them overnight so that they could fix the issue. The next day the car was delivered and I was told that they cleaned the O2 sensor.\n\n\n\n4) 2nd August, 2024 - noticed a weird sound from the engine on cold start. Recorded the same and sent it to the SA who asked me to get the car to the ASC. I could not replicate the same there and it was dismissed as being a character of the BSVI TURBO engine. No job card was made, nor was the visit documented.\n\n\n\n5) 1st October, 2024 (4814 km on the odometer) [CHECK ENGINE LIGHT] - Engine check light came on but disappeared after a few engine off/on. By the time I took it the ASC the next day there was no sign of any problem. They did scan the car and told me that they couldn't find any issue and it might be due to a loose connection.\n\n\n\n6) 18th December, 2024 (8079km on the odometer) [CHECK ENGINE LIGHT] - on start up at around 8pm on my way to work, the engine check light came on with the same engine management system error. Took the car the very next morning to KIA ASC but by then the engine check light wasn't on. Also asked them to get the 2nd free service done and change the engine oil. I recently noticed when going through the Repair Order that they've mentioned that I've denied O2 sensor cleaning service. This was never brought up at all with the conversation with the SA. With regards to the engine check light I was give the same explanation of loose connection.\n\n\n\n7) 19th February, 2025 (9166km on the odometer) - had recently been on a trip to Coorg and I noticed a weird rattle from the engine during low rpm's while accelerating. Fed up with the experience at PPS Kia, I visited Naara Kia, Kanakapura Road. The sound had increased in intensity by then. The SA and mechanic acknowledged the issue. They told me that this issue was new to them as they had never seen it before.\n\n\n\nI was asked to give them 5 days time to diagnose and rectify the issue. After 6 days I was told that they did some work on the compressor, actuator and the tensioner. But that they couldn't pin point any particular cause for the issue. I was advised to drive the car around for 2 weeks and get it back if the problem reoccurs. On delivery the sound was faint, but present not as serious as before.\n\n\n\n8) 2nd March, 2025 (9227km on the odometer) [CHECK ENGINE LIGHT] - Engine check light came on again with the familiar engine system manager error. Immediately snapped pics of the same and sent it over to the SA. This time the car was lethargic to accelerate and there was increased vibrations.\n\n\n\n10) 3nd March, 2025 (today) [CHECK ENGINE LIGHT] - Took the car to the ASC at Naara Kia, engine check light again disappeared after multiple engine on/off. Asked them to scan the issue and under the history there was an O2 sensor error. They made note of the codes and cleared them from the history. No job card done.\n\n\n\nI was asked to AGAIN drive the car and come back if the engine check light comes on. I escalated the issue to the Service Manger and demanded that it be documented to which they agreed to send an email stating that engine error codes have been noted and cleared and that the car is under observation.\n\n\n\nWithin a short 6km drive form the ASC, I had to stop for some work. On turning the car back on the engine check light and Engine System Management error came back. I drove back to the ASC who have now opened a job card for the same. They are yet to diagnose the issue, nor could they give me a timeline for resolution. They have assured me that they'd update the same tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSuspension Issues -\n\n\n\nI also have a recurring Left Rear Suspension knocking sound which was previously diagnosed as a faulty Trailing arm bush. The same was cleaned and lubricated with some sort of spray a few months ago. The suspension behaved normally for a few weeks after which the knocking sound is back again. Kia ASC refuses to acknowledge this and blames it as a character of a hard suspension. I have literally gone ahead and asked them to change this outside warranty and that I'd pay for it.\n\n\n\nI was also previously told and I quote \"All rattles and weird sounds are normal in all cars, as you drive and drive more sounds will come\". Did not expect this sort of response from KIA when the car is hardly 10 months old and under 10,000 km driven. I have written an email to kia customer care narrating my ordeal but yet to receive an acknowledgement or a complaint number for the same.\n\n\n\nTill date I have 8 documented and several undocumented visits to the ASC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April of 2024, after a lot of deliberation I went ahead with selling my 2021 Hyundai i20 1.2L MT and went ahead with the purchase of a Kia Seltos 1.5l 7DCT GTX+.I was confident with my purchase having chosen a Kia over the likes of VW and Skoda.

            "content": "Readers hoping to buy BHP Group Limited ( ) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Typically, the ex-dividend date is two business days before the record date, which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves at least two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase BHP Group's shares before the 6th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.50 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, BHP Group stock has a trailing yield of around 4.1% on the current share price of AU$39.60. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether BHP Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. BHP Group is paying out an acceptable 55% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (72%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that BHP Group's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see BHP Group earnings per share are up 6.1% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. BHP Group's dividend payments per share have declined at 1.5% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nShould investors buy BHP Group for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.\n\nHowever if you're still interested in BHP Group as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with BHP Group. Our analysis shows that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Learn More\n\nIf you're wanting to receive the next BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) dividend, then you don't have long to act.\n\nThat's because the Big Australian's shares will be trading ex-dividend very soon.\n\nWhen this happens, it means that the rights to the dividend are settled and if you're not already on its share register, you won't be receiving a pay check when the funds are distributed.\n\nThe BHP dividend\n\nLast month, BHP released its half-year results for FY 2025 and revealed a disappointing 23% decline in underlying attributable profit to US$5.1 billion. This was driven largely by a decline in realised iron ore and steelmaking coal prices, which was partially offset by higher realised copper prices.\n\nIn addition, BHP advised that it generated free cash flow of US$2.6 billion for the half, which was down 30% on the prior corresponding period. This reflects its lower earnings and a 10% increase in capital and exploration expenditure to US$5.2 billion.\n\nIn light of its profit and free cash flow decline, the BHP board elected to cut its fully franked interim dividend by 30.5% to 50 US cents per share. Though, while this was at an eight-year low, it was ahead of the consensus estimate 49 US cents per share.\n\nBased on current exchange rates, this represents an 80.4 Australian cents per share dividend. And at the latest BHP share price of $39.24, this will mean a 2% dividend yield for investors.\n\nEx-dividend date\n\nAs I mentioned at the top, in order to receive this fully franked interim dividend when it is paid to shareholders, you will need to be on BHP's share register before the ex-dividend date. This will be in two days on Thursday 6 March.\n\nThis essentially means that you will need to own the miner's shares before the market close on Wednesday to qualify. Buying shares any later than that will mean you are not eligible to receive the dividend and instead the rights will stay with the seller of its shares.\n\nIf you do buy BHP shares in time, then you can look forward to pay day later this month on 27 March.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAccording to a note out of Goldman Sachs, its analysts are expecting a 52 US cents per share fully franked final dividend with its full year results in August.\n\nThis will mean total dividends of 102 US cents (164 Australian cents) for FY 2025, which represents a fully franked 4.2% dividend yield.\n\nGoldman also sees plenty of upside for its shares. It has a buy rating and $47.40 price target on them, which implies potential upside of 21% for investors over the next 12 months.",

            "content": "I feel with maturing EV tech, used EVs make a greater sense than ICE. There's hardly anything that can go wrong on a ASC serviced 2-3 years old EV that can't be fixed in warranty.\n\nBHPian rohanshivi1 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nThings you should consider buying a Used EV\n\nRecently I had some friends & colleagues here in Nordics considering buying a used electric car (around 4\u201310 years old) since there are decade old cars available now like Nissan Leaf or Model S, and online, many people seem to be worried about expensive issues after the warranty expires. There is some justification for this, as I see it, although some risks seem to be exaggerated online. Therefore, I have tried to rank the risks below according to a combination of probability and cost. This applies to electric cars in general; in practice, it varies greatly by model, so you need to check which issues affect the models you see available in the used car market.\n\n1. PTC Heater / Air Heat Pump These seem to break down sooner or later on many models and are unfortunately often surprisingly expensive to fix. The combination of cost and probability makes me rank this as problem #1.\n\n2. Onboard Charger Especially electric cars coming out of French & Czech stable (Like Citroen or Skoda), but also some others, have had a lot of trouble with the onboard charger. Expensive to fix \u2013 however, one would hope that these problems are largely addressed under warranty. Possibly a transient problem, so maybe this should be ranked lower in the future.\n\n3. Various Suspension Problems The weight of electric cars and sometimes undersized components and other suspension problems common. Usually relatively cheap to fix.\n\n4. Moisture Ingress / Condensation in High-Voltage Battery In a country like India, I find this difficult to assess, but it can be costly on older electric cars. Will rust and dirt make moisture a problem specially in coastal cities.\n\n5. Degradation / Weak Cells in High-Voltage Battery Battery replacements due to degradation or weak cells are a risk that is often exaggerated in my opinion. However, there are probably some models where this is a real risk, mainly older models but also, for example, Volkswagen has had some problems with degradation on new models.\n\n6. Brakes Risk of trouble as the brakes (depending on the model) sometimes become too inactive due to regen, but usually cheap to fix. Worth keeping an eye on, especially the rear brakes.\n\n7. Dents/Damage to Battery Housing/Undercarriage You don't want to damage the battery housing as it can lead to a increasing issues and be very expensive to fix. Important to inspect when buying a used electric car. If you know when the damage occurred, it should generally be covered by insurance. Uncommon but expensive.\n\n8. Screen/Computer/Electronics Here I am a bit unsure: problems seem to be quite rare, but various issues have occurred. Difficult to assess how these will function when the car gets old. Can be moderately expensive? Includes trouble with handles in this category, which has been unexpectedly common.\n\n9. Rust Rust occurs, of course, as with all cars. Generally, I find that today's cars are very rust-resistant, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\n10. 12-Volt Battery Wears out easily on electric cars, but cheap to replace.\n\n11. Increased Tire Wear Electric car tires wear out slightly faster than ICE cars due to high weight / rapid acceleration / regen. But all tires wear out, even on fossil fuel cars \u2013 the additional cost should be small.\n\n12. Drive Unit / Motor Problems Uncommon for the drive unit to malfunction, but it can occur (e.g., noise) on some models. Expensive to fix, but ranks low on the list as this works well on most models.\n\nHere's what GTO had to say on the matter:\n\nI tend to avoid over-complication, and prefer to simplify things.\n\n\n\nMy advice:\n\n\n\n1. Buy the latest EV you can buy. The technology and product become better & more mature each year. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying a 3 - 5 year old EV today.\n\n\n\n2. Look at the manufacturer's track record in EVs. With the 1st-gen products, you will be part of the R&D.\n\n\n\n3. Take the longest possible extended warranty that you can get your hands on.\n\n\n\n4. Avoid the duds = current example would be the e-C3 from Citroen. It's barely selling 60 units a month, the dealership experiences can be bad (no profits = unhappy dealers), the product has compromises.\n\n\n\n5. Consider the manufacturer's track record. BYD & MG have lots of experience in EVs - even the ZS EV was such a sorted product for its time. Tata's EVs are great, but be ready for niggles. Every Ioniq 5 owner I have met is super-duper happy with the car.\n\n\n\n6. Personally, even as a certified lover of pre-worshipped cars, I would avoid Used EVs. Even if you have a budget of 15 lakhs, there are plenty of great choices (Punch, Windsor, Nexon). If you go higher up, things only become better (Curvv, Mahindra BE 6, Creta & more).\n\n\n\nWhatever the budget, there are great brand-new EVs at every price point. I've never bought a used laptop or smartphone, and would generally avoid used EVs too (unless it's an EQS or Taycan at half the price).\n\nHere's what BHPian mh09ad5578 had to say on the matter:\n\nI feel with maturing EV tech, used EVs make a greater sense than ICE. There's hardly anything that can go wrong on a ASC serviced 2-3 years old EV that can't be fixed in warranty. Low mileage examples would make great buys. It would be like a year old flagship smartphone, almost as good as one new at half the price. I am certainly looking to buy a pre-worshipped top end Curve EV 55 with say 30 to 50k kms on the odo for 10 to 12 lakhs three years down the line. With current poor resale values of EVs this doesn't seem to be such a far fetched dream.\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Money at Budgets are Sexy back in 2015.\n\n\n\nJ. Money defined the LWR as:\n\n\n\nLifetime Wealth Ratio = Net Worth (NW) / Total Lifetime Income (TLI)\n\n\n\nApparently, in the US it is easy to get the TLI using your Social Security Number and using the above formula you can get the LWR. So, US residents would find it a bit easier.\n\n\n\nIn the original article, J. Money provided his own rankings for how to interpret your LWR:\n\n0%-10% \u0096 Meh\n\n10%-25% \u0096 Now we\u0092re cooking!\n\n25-50% \u0096 You\u0092re on fire, baby! Give me your number!\n\n50-100% \u0096 Marry me.\n\n100%-1,000% \u0096 How do I get into your will?\n\nDespite how unscientific his ranking system is, this is a far better way of determining your financial competence than just the Net worth.\n\n\n\nYour net worth is a stock (i.e. a snapshot of your accumulated wealth) while your income is a flow (i.e. a measure of how your wealth is changing through time). They are both great, but limited.\n\n\n\nLWR, on the other hand, controls both the stock (i.e. your net worth) and the flows (i.e. your total lifetime income) in your personal finances, to judge your financial skill. It is basically a measure of how good you are at converting your income (a flow) into wealth (a stock).\n\n\n\nLWR allows you to benchmark the two most important things in personal finance (your saving ability and your investing ability) at the same time. If you are a good saver or a good investor (or both), you will have a higher LWR than someone who isn\u0092t.\n\n\n\nHowever, LWR has three major flaws:\n\n\n\n1. LWR is skewed against young people simply because they have had less time for their assets to compound. It is basically impossible for a young person to have a LWR above 100% unless they got extremely lucky with their investment portfolio. Why? Because after paying taxes, how else could someone have a net worth more than the income they took home?\n\n\n\n2. LWR is biased against high earners who have to pay higher taxes. For example, if you made $500,000 when you were 22 and lived like a total hermit, you might be able to save $250,000 as a result. That is a LWR of 50% despite being an incredibly good saver. Even though this person in the top decile of financial responsibility he only scored a 50%. The issue is that the LWR penalizes those individuals who pay more in taxes.\n\n\n\n3. LWR is the least useful for anyone who has had low income for a long period of time. Why? Because, as the data shows, those with low income spend basically all of their money on the necessities (food, rent, etc.) Without extreme saving measures, it is very difficult for these people to build wealth. This is why the LWR isn\u0092t a great measure of their financial skills because having low income for a long time will just add deadweight into the denominator of the LWR.\n\n\n\nGiven these limitations, is there a way we can adjust the LWR into a slightly more useful metric? Yes, this is where The Wealth Discipline Ratio comes in!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wealth Discipline Ratio\u0099 (\u0093WDR\u0094)\n\n\n\nThe author of this says, WDR is identical to the LWR, except we should remove some level of basic spending from our income each year, because everyone has to spend some money on the basic necessities to get by. Therefore, we should remove this \u0093necessity spending\u0094 from your total lifetime income because there is no way you could\u0092ve saved or invested that money. The author's theory is that money that you never had a chance of saving or investing should not count against you when it comes to building wealth.\n\n\n\nHowever, money that you could have saved/grown should be counted. This is why this measure is called the Wealth Discipline Ratio, because it looks to answer the following: Of every Dollar/Rupee in wealth that you could have built through saving + investing, how much did you actually build?\n\n\n\nThis is a measure of your financial discipline through both savings and investing. It\u0092s not just your savings rate, because it also incorporates how you use your savings to invest and increase your wealth.\n\n\n\nThe WDR is defined as:\n\n\n\nWealth Discipline Ratio = Net worth (NW) / (Total Lifetime Income (TLI) \u0096 Basic Lifetime Spending (BLS))\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no perfect way to calculate basic lifetime spending, but we can make some assumptions to get started.\n\n\n\nWhat\u0092s the right amount? This is where your financial discipline comes into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to compute the WDR in the India Context?\n\n\n\nThis is the methodology that I used to calculate my WDR:\n\n\n\n1. Net Worth (NW) as of March 31st can be worked out easily and some of us do this for declaring the Assets & Liabilities Sheet/Balance Sheet as part of our IT filing. Since we are nearing March 31st, you can compute this and keep it ready as of 31/3/2025. Fortunately, only the latest NW is required for this ratio.\n\n\n\n2. Total Lifetime Income - For this, I took the Gross Total Income (GTI) (which is same as TLI) from my Income Tax Returns since the time I had been filing returns. You need to take the GTI for every financial year since the time you have been working. So, those who have just started their career would find it easier to start computing the WDR. Others, will have to do some homework of digging out your old IT returns. No pain, no gain, right?\n\n\n\n3. Basic Lifetime Spending (BLS) - As a family of 3, we have been tracking our spends in an excel sheet from FY 2007-08 onwards, so I was able to take the BLS from there for each financial year. For years before that, I used the ratio of BLS/GTI (Cumulative BLS and Cumulative GTI from 2007 to 2024) and applied that % to each of years prior to 2007 till the time I started working. So, if you don't have BLS for every year, you may want to do the same to arrive at a % and apply it for those missing years. I did go through some posts in this thread and I am sure many of you tracking your expenses already, so calculating BLS should not be a problem.\n\n\n\nAfter doing the above exercise, I created an excel sheet to tabulate NW, GTI and BLS for each year of my career and I computed my WDR (and also LWR) and I am tracking the same for the last 4 years. My WDR has been increasing every year thereafter.\n\n\n\nWhat is the ideal WDR?\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the author thinks there is no ideal WDR, but it can still be useful for understanding your financial history.\n\n\n\nFor example, if your WDR is less than 10%, you are probably living a \u0093you-only-live-once\u0094 kind of lifestyle and you may want to consider saving/investing more. However, this doesn\u0092t imply that a higher WDR is always better. In fact, a very high WDR (100%+) might be a sign of someone who is prioritizing money over living a more fulfilling life.\n\n\n\nWDR can provide some good insight into what you are doing with your money and how you might be able to change to reach your financial goals.\n\n\n\nBecause the only thing that matters in personal finance is whether you can live the life that you truly want. If you can, then, financially, you have won. If you can\u0092t, then what do you need to change to get there? Perhaps, increasing your wealth discipline ratio is a good place to start.\n\n\n\nThe intention of this post is not to publish my WDR or for any of you to do so after computing yours. I just found this method useful to see whether I am on the right track in my personal finance journey and hence wanted to share it with a wider audience.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers!\n\nHi Friends, I was looking for a personal finance thread in Team BHP but couldn't find any, so I felt this thread would be the most appropriate to post this topic.I came across this article in early 2021 and started calculating my WDR ratio starting 31/3/21 : https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wealth-discipline-ratio/ Instead of talking Net worth and Wealth in absolute terms, this methodology of calculating the WDR seemed more practical and logical to me.The article initially talks about the Lifetime Wealth Ratio (\u0093LWR\u0094) - a concept invented by the financial blogger J.

This is where your financial discipline comes into play.This is the methodology that I used to calculate my WDR:1.as of March 31st can be worked out easily and some of us do this for declaring the Assets & Liabilities Sheet/Balance Sheet as part of our IT filing. Since we are nearing March 31st, you can compute this and keep it ready as of 31/3/2025. Fortunately, only the latest NW is required for this ratio.2. Total Lifetime Income - For this, I took the(which is same as TLI) from my Income Tax Returns since the time I had been filing returns. You need to take the GTI for every financial year since the time you have been working. So, those who have just started their career would find it easier to start computing the WDR. Others, will have to do some homework of digging out your old IT returns. No pain, no gain, right?3.- As a family of 3, we have been tracking our spends in an excel sheet from FY 2007-08 onwards, so I was able to take the BLS from there for each financial year. For years before that, I used the ratio of BLS/GTI (Cumulative BLS and Cumulative GTI from 2007 to 2024) and applied that % to each of years prior to 2007 till the time I started working. So, if you don't have BLS for every year, you may want to do the same to arrive at a % and apply it for those missing years. I did go through some posts in this thread and I am sure many of you tracking your expenses already, so calculating BLS should not be a problem.Unfortunately, the author thinks there is no ideal WDR, but it can still be useful for understanding your financial history.For example, if your WDR is less than 10%, you are probably living a \u0093you-only-live-once\u0094 kind of lifestyle and you may want to consider saving/investing more. However, this doesn\u0092t imply that a higher WDR is always better. In fact, a very high WDR (100%+) might be a sign of someone who is prioritizing money over living a more fulfilling life.WDR can provide some good insight into what you are doing with your money and how you might be able to change to reach your financial goals.Because the only thing that matters in personal finance is whether you can live the life that you truly want. If you can, then, financially, you have won. If you can\u0092t, then what do you need to change to get there? Perhaps, increasing your wealth discipline ratio is a good place to start.Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The world\u2019s largest copper producer, BHP\u2019s Escondida copper mine in Chile. Credit: Caterpillar\n\nCanada and Australia could trail emerging mining nations such as Argentina if their governments don\u2019t speed up permitting and lower costs, BHP (NYSE, LSE, ASX: BHP) CEO Mike Henry warned.\n\nCountries such as the United States, Argentina and Saudi Arabia are making \u201csizeable\u201d efforts to reform their mining sector and attract capital, Henry said Sunday in Toronto. At the same time, established natural-resource powerhouses such as Canada and Australia have seen their global attractiveness erode.\n\nHenry\u2019s comments come as the US administration of President Donald Trump looks to spur domestic production of critical minerals in part by overhauling permitting requirements. According to a June 2024 report by S&P Global, the US has the second-longest average development times in the world of the 23 countries they evaluated.\n\n\u201cJust as is the case for business, nations need to remain competitive on the global stage or they will be left behind in the race for metals and minerals investment programs,\u201d Henry said in a speech and subsequent question and answer session at the annual Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada conference. \u201cThe competitive landscape isn\u2019t static.\u201d\n\nBenchmarking\n\nIf a country isn\u2019t constantly benchmarking, \u201cit runs the risk of falling behind,\u201d added Henry. \u201cOnce capital mobilizes in one direction, sometimes it can be quite hard to mobilize in the other direction.\u201d\n\nPermitting delays are a key irritant for miners. New mines in Australia and Canada typically take from 10 to 15 years to get built, compared with as few as five years in a country like Chile, Henry said.\n\nAlthough Canada possesses many advantages, including plentiful natural resources and a strong ecosystem that includes engineering firms with mining experience, the country is no longer as attractive to foreign investment as it once was, the Canadian-born Henry said.\n\nCanada\u2019s competitiveness has dropped from eighth to 19th in the past four years in the World Competitiveness Yearbook published by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development, and the country needs a renewed reform agenda to bolster mining competitiveness, he said.\n\nIssues in Australia include electricity prices that are about 50% higher than in the US and combined tax and royalty levels that are \u201csimply uncompetitive for capital,\u201d Henry said. To make matters worse, the country has limited reserves of \u201cfuture-facing commodities\u201d like copper, nickel or lithium, he added.\n\n\u201cAustralia can no longer rely as heavily on its geological advantages but instead must exercise its policy muscles to improve competitiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to confront the fact that productivity growth is sluggish across the broader economy and has fallen in the mining sector across the past two decades.\u201d\n\n\u2018Can-do\u2019\n\nAs a result, policymakers \u201cneed to examine the entire set of policy and regulatory settings and ask whether they are making the country more or less competitive globally,\u201d the BHP CEO added.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story in the US, where multiple initiatives are under way to expand mining output. Henry spent last week in Washington to meet with US lawmakers and says he came away encouraged by the \u201ccan-do, make-it-happen attitude\u201d in his meetings.\n\nCompared with Canada and Australia, \u201cother countries are mobilizing a more urgent effort and have higher ambitions around this. That includes the US, who\u2019s currently behind the curve but could very well end up being far ahead of the curve if they carry through with some of their current intent,\u201d he said.\n\nHenry is also optimistic about Argentina, given its reserves of copper, gold and lithium. In copper alone, projects representing about 1.2 million tonnes of annual output are in the pipeline, with \u201cmuch more to come,\u201d he said.\n\nBHP and Canada\u2019s Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN) recently closed the $4.1 billion acquisition of Argentina\u2019s Filo Corp as part of an increased focus on copper. BHP\u2019s contribution was about $2 billion, Henry said.\n\n\u201cArgentina could very well become a top 5 copper producer,\u201d Henry said. \u201cArgentina is serious about competing globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they need to attract capital to make it happen and they are focused on unlocking the opportunity. Our sector is taking notice.\u201d\n\nReforms\n\nSince taking office in December 2023, Argentinian President Javier Milei has taken steps to make the country more attractive for mining investment, primarily by pursuing deregulation, reducing inflation, and improving economic stability.\n\nLast year, the Milei administration introduced the Incentive Regime for Large Investments, offering 30-year tax, trade, and foreign-exchange benefits for projects investing at least $200 million in sectors such as mining.\n\nThe reforms have attracted some large investments: In December, Rio Tinto (NYSE, LSE, RIO, ASX: RIO) announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its Rincon lithium project. This development is expected to position the country as a leading lithium producer.\n\nCanada\u2019s First Quantum Minerals (TSX: FM) plans to invest $3.6 billion in the Taca Taca copper project in Salta province. If realized, this could elevate Argentina into the top 10 global copper producers.\n\nHaving abandoned attempts to acquire Anglo American (LSE: AAL), BHP is busy pivoting to organic growth. Up to $10 billion is being spent on Chile\u2019s Escondida, the world\u2019s largest copper mine, in which Rio Tinto has a 30% stake.\n\nUrbanization and growing electrification are two of the reasons the use of critical minerals is projected to soar in the coming decades. Copper, for one, is facing a 70% increase in demand by the middle of the century, Henry said. Some $250 billion will be needed over the next five to 10 years to keep pace with the surging appetite for metals, BHP forecasts.",

Learn More\n\nS&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) dividend stocks offer a great means to build a reliable passive income for life.\n\nRegular dividend payments can come in quite handy during your working years. But it's really during those retirement years that an additional passive income stream can offer a significant boost to your lifestyle.\n\nAnd with many ASX 200 stocks providing fully franked dividends, you may be able to hold onto more of that income come tax time.\n\nNow, before we look at the three top ASX stocks below that I believe will continue to provide investors with reliable dividend payouts for many years to come, here are two quick points.\n\nKeep in mind\n\nFirst, a properly diversified ASX income portfolio will contain more than just three stocks. There's no magic number. But 10 is a decent ballpark figure. Ideally, these companies will operate in various sectors across different locations. That will reduce the risk of your entire passive income portfolio taking a hit if one sector or company comes under pressure.\n\nSecond, remember that the dividend yields you generally see quoted are trailing yields. Future yields can be higher or lower depending on a range of company-specific and macroeconomic factors.\n\nWith that in mind\u2026\n\n3 ASX 200 stocks for regular passive income\n\nThe first ASX 200 stock I'd buy for a lifetime of passive income is Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL).\n\nOn the back of strong half-year results, the Aussie supermarket giant increased its interim dividend by 2.8% to 37 cents per share. That brings the full-year payout to 69 cents per share. There's still time to grab that interim payout, with Coles trading ex-dividend on 5 March.\n\nAt Friday's closing share price of $19.98, Coles trades on a fully franked dividend yield (partly trailing, partly pending) of 3.5%.\n\nThe second ASX 200 stock I'd buy for its long-term passive income is BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP).\n\nWith the mining giant reporting a 23% year on year decline in underlying attributable profit to US$5.1 billion, BHP cut its interim dividend by 29% to 78.5 cents per share. BHP stock trades ex-dividend on 6 March.\n\nBut with the BHP share price also down over the year and closing Friday at $39.04 \u2013 and adding in the $1.10 per share final dividend \u2013 the stock trades at an attractive 4.8% fully franked dividend yield (partly trailing, partly pending).\n\nWhich brings us to the third ASX 200 stock I'd buy for a lifetime of passive income, Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC).\n\nOver the past 12 months, the big four bank has paid out a total of $1.66 a share in fully franked dividends.\n\nAt Friday's closing price of $31.81, Westpac shares trade on a fully franked trailing yield of 5.2%.\n\nAtop that passive income, Westpac shares have gained 21% over the full year.",

With the fourth oversize piston and Boyesen dual stage reeds the suction capacity had increased but the pilot jet being the standard size wasn\u2019t able to cope with the extra fuel demand so we went one size up on both the pilot jets for now. As the bike is still in running period the RPM\u2019s are maintained below 5k rpm so the mani jets will be upsized in case its required once we start riding in the hooligan zone that is post 6k rpm .\n\nThe next change done was to change both the needles to the new ones I got from Yambits. The last change done for tuning up the bike was to delete the boost bottle as with the oversize piston, it wasn\u2019t required and also the design of the bottle wasn\u2019t correct to begin with and plus it didn\u2019t take a tight seat and was leaking on the manifold. Later, the excessive smoking especially at cold start was addressed by removing the 2T oil pump and recalibrating it. The setting for some reason had changed to two times the factory setting and both the one way valves were leaking oil as well. So, the pump was set as per factory setting and we increased the tension in the springs in the one way valves as the ball bearings were already changed and only needed the extra force from the springs to stop the excessive oil flow.\n\nWith the above changes the bike now runs much more smoother and the gear shifts have improved as well..

Nissan has officially stopped taking orders for the iconic car in Japan, marking the end of an era.\n\nNissan released an official statement on its website on February 28 that said:\n\n\u201cWe have received many orders for the Nissan GT-R and have now finished accepting orders for the planned production quantity. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our customers for their support since its release in 2007.\u201d\n\nIn fact, sales for other global markets had ceased much earlier.

Learn More\n\nAs we covered yesterday, finding big-yielding ASX dividend shares on the market right now is a little trickier than it used to be.\n\nBetween some popular dividend stocks rising so high that they have nothing like the yields they used to (looking at you Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) and Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES)), and other dividend shares cutting their payouts (BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)), the hunt for income has certainly become more onerous.\n\nBut despair not \u2013 the ASX still has quite a few dividend payers that offer decent yields to income investors. Today, let's talk about two examples, both of which offer strong, sturdy, and recently-raised payouts.\n\n2 ASX dividend shares worth a look today\n\nTelstra Group Ltd (ASX: TLS)\n\nFirst up is an ASX dividend share that would be familiar to most income investors. Telstra has been paying steady, fully franked dividends for decades. These have proven remarkably resilient, holding steady throughout the COVID pandemic and increasing throughout the high inflation that followed in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThis, in my view, underscores just how vital telecommunications services remain in our modern world. As well as Telstra's dominant position in the Australian telco sector.\n\nIn its earnings report last month, Telstra increased its interim dividend yet again, this time up to 9.5 cents per share.\n\nTogether with September's final dividend of 9 cents per share, this gives Telstra a dividend yield of 4.47% at Friday's closing share price of $4.14.\n\nColes Group Ltd (ASX: COL)\n\nColes is another popular ASX 200 dividend share and shares many of Telstra's defensive characteristics. After all, we all don't have much choice when it comes to regularly eating, drinking, and stocking our households with life's essentials.\n\nAs such, Coles has a highly inelastic earnings base from which it can draw its dividends. The company demonstrates this with its six-year streak (and counting) of delivering annual dividend pay rises.\n\nIn Coles' own earnings report this week, this trend continued, with the company hiking its latest interim dividend up to 32 cents per share. As is typical with Coles, this will also come with full franking credits attached.\n\nUnfortunately for share market bargain-appreciates, Coles has been one of those ASX dividend shares that have seen significant price appreciation in recent months, which has had a depressing effect on its dividend yield. Even so, the company is currently trading on a decent yield of 3.4% at last pricing.",

            "content": "In Saskatchewan, 1,000 metres below the surface of the earth, in a cavern heated to a sweltering 27 C by geothermal energy, a machine is boring into the ground, searching for a compound that is critical to worldwide food production and crucial in Canada\u2019s current trade battle with the United States.\n\nLaunched just a few weeks ago, this boring machine is hooked up to a fibre-optic connection, and operated from a climate-controlled office on the surface.\n\nThis single tunnel, called a face, was sunk at a cost of $30-million. And it is just one in a network spread across six mines owned and operated by Nutrien Ltd. NTR-T, Canada\u2019s largest mining company and a major supplier of agricultural inputs worldwide. However, the company jewel \u2013 and a source of US$3-billion in net sales last year - was a single nutrient: potash.\n\nPotash is often a coral-pink collection of minerals, the most important of which is potassium \u2013 a key element for plant life and global food systems.\n\nSince taking office in January, however, U.S. President Donald Trump has continuously threatened to levy a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods and services. The U.S. needs nothing from Canada, he says.\n\nBut the U.S. needs Canadian potash.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of the potash used by U.S. farmers comes from mines in Saskatchewan. Canada is the king of potash. It possesses the largest potash reserves in the world \u2013 by a fat margin \u2013 and the largest production by volume. The U.S. cannot source most of its potash from elsewhere. Just two other countries have large potash reserves \u2013 Russia and Belarus \u2013 and these operations are significantly smaller than Canada\u2019s and prone to geopolitical instability.\n\nIn economists\u2019 terms, potash demand is largely inelastic. Potash prices can swing widely, but U.S. farmers have to buy roughly the same amount every year.\n\n\u201cThe profitability of the [U.S.] is dependent on crop inputs that are affordable,\u201d said Ken Seitz, chief executive officer of Saskatoon-based Nutrien.\n\nThe company is also the largest provider of agricultural inputs and services in the world, with more than 1,000 retail outlets in 45 U.S. states.\n\nFrom the depths of the tunnels at Nutrien\u2019s Cory Potash mine, long conveyor belts carry ore from the mining machines to the surface.\n\nThe ore is then processed into different forms of potash, a collection of minerals containing potassium \u2013 a key nutrient for plant life, and in turn, global food systems. Matt Smith/Globe and Mail\n\nShould Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff happen, Mr. Seitz is explicit: Nutrien will pass the costs through the supply chain and onto the American farmer.\n\nBut few farmers could afford it, especially those who grow corn, the U.S.\u2018s largest crop.\n\nFacing the third year of a downturn in corn prices, those farmers are strapped for cash. The COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and high natural gas prices pushed up fertilizer costs to historic highs. Costs have since dropped, but not at the same rate as corn prices. Few corn farmers have made a profit in years.\n\nYet these farmers remain a political powerhouse. For the past three presidential elections, farming-dependent counties \u2013 concentrated in the central U.S. \u2013 have consistently voted for Mr. Trump at rates significantly above the average U.S. voter. His popularity has grown with each election.\n\nWith Mr. Trump showing no sign of withdrawing his threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods, the Canadian potash producer is therefore expecting the American farmer to be a force that pushes back against that threat. Potash is Canada\u2019s pink gold; it is a strong symbol of the country\u2019s resource riches and could be a key lever in a looming trade war.\n\nBut Canada can\u2019t count on U.S. farmers. Amid the corn rows, grain silos and Trump billboards that now characterize the Midwest, the sentiment is not panic, frustration or resistance. Not yet. It is jubilation.\n\nThe U.S. political landscape has been transformed and farmers, while they recognize the potential that their fertilizer costs could rise, are reluctant to take a stand against the proposed tariffs. President Trump is back and he will make America great again \u2013 regardless of the cost.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Along Interstate 57 in Shelby County, Ill., 'Trump 2024' is written on bales of hay. Rural Illinois, the national leader in corn production, is part of the American agricultural heartland and firmly in Trump country.Tytia Habing/The Globe and Mail\n\nA barge carrying a mountain of pink Canadian potash winds down the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi River - the lifeblood of some of America\u2019s most important agricultural states, including Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and more.\n\nThe soil in the Midwest is the best in the world, local farmers boast. It is rich, black and runs two to three feet into the ground. It is loaded with organic matter. The land is flat and rain is no stranger when the crops start growing \u2013 a confluence of conditions that make this land the agricultural American dream, and the foundation for growing corn.\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest corn producer in the world. The crop covers a land mass roughly the size of Germany (90 million acres) and in 2023 contributed US$62-billion to the country\u2019s gross domestic product annually, employed 600,000 people and paid a total of around US$35-billion in wages. And of all the Corn Belt states, Illinois is the national leader. In 2023, Illinois corn contributed US$9.5-billion to U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, the soil upon which this industry is built is missing one key ingredient: abundant potassium.\n\nThe Illinois corn farmer \u2013 like farmers in most of the Midwest \u2013 applies potash twice a year: once in spring before planting, and once in fall, after harvest.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The Growmark facility in Seneca, Ill., receives a barge loaded with Canadian potash in February, 2025. Growmark distributes potash and evaluates soil across the U.S. to formulate area-specific fertilizer formulas. Should Mr. Trump apply a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods in March, the rising cost of potash will be passed on to the farmers whose crops rely on it.Tytia Habing/The Globe and Mail\n\nThe potassium needs to be sourced from Canada because few other options exist, said Kreg Ruhl, vice-president of Crop Nutrients for Growmark Inc., a farmer-owned co-operative and distributor of potash.\n\n\u201cCan we get it from other places? Yes. To a meaningful degree? No.\u201d\n\nCertainly not in time for spring.\n\nRussia only accounts for 10 per cent of the U.S.\u2018s potash supply and switching distribution channels would be logistically challenging.\n\nConsider the barge of potash arriving at the Growmark warehouse.\n\nIt started in a Saskatchewan mine. First the ore climbed through hundreds of metres of tunnels on an elaborate system of conveyor belts. Next, it whizzed up a mining shaft to a mill, where it was crushed, ground, deslimed and crystallized until, at last, it boarded a train. Then, it was loaded onto a barge and floated toward Seneca, Ill., to a warehouse owned by Growmark \u2013 the third-largest agricultural retailer in the U.S.\n\nCanada\u2019s potash legacy Although potash is found worldwide, Canada was responsible for more than 30 per cent of global production in 2023. It is also home to the largest reserves with 1.1 billion tonnes. Saskatchewan sits atop high-quality potash deposits and has developed the mining infrastructure to exploit them.

And not just for the spring planting season, but moving forward into the fall.\n\nIn the seasons between growing crops, a team of 500 Growmark crop specialists across the nation sample farmers\u2019 soil to formulate a custom ratio of the fertilizer holy trinity: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.\n\nAll three elements are essential to plant life and potassium \u2013 a macronutrient akin to protein, carbohydrates or fats in the human diet \u2013 is key to almost everything, including the movement of sugar within plants, plant metabolism and photosynthesis.\n\nThe element is the seventh-most-abundant in the Earth\u2019s crust. Very little of that, however, is available for plant use. In extensive agricultural operations, potassium must be applied regularly. In the U.S. Corn Belt, where crops suck up nutrients at breakneck rates, it is typically applied twice a year: once after harvest, and once in the spring before planting.\n\nHowever, a farmer cannot apply potassium with abandon. Fertilizer accounts for 45 per cent of operating expenses for U.S. corn farmers. Applying just the right amount, at just the right price and at just the right time can be the difference between turning a profit and losing money.\n\nCrop specialists are currently analyzing soil. They will make recommendations. And retailers who distribute the potash will start making purchases in July and August.\n\nThese recommendations depend on accurate potash price projections. The balancing act is always tricky, but becomes near impossible when the price of fertilizer is volatile, Mr. Ruhl said.\n\nFarmers will almost certainly pay higher prices. And this won\u2019t be the first time in the past five years.\n\nWhen war erupted in Ukraine in 2022, disruptions to Black Sea trade routes squeezed global potash and fertilizer supply. Subsequent sanctions on Russian and Belarusian products caused fertilizer prices to climb. Combined with COVID-era supply disruptions worldwide, potash prices climbed 480 per cent between 2016 and 2022. Phosphorus and nitrogen also increased in price.\n\nMining companies, distributors and retailers passed the costs along to the farmer. Even for fertilizers that aren\u2019t mined, and which are therefore produced by many nations (nitrogen can be captured from the atmosphere, so the U.S. has domestic production), switching supply chains costs money and time as freight routes are altered. All of this is passed onto the farmer.\n\n\u201cWhen costs get added to our supply chain, they pile up on farmer fields,\u201d said Mr. Ruhl.\n\nBut a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian potash in 2025 is a different beast, he said.\n\nIn 2022, futures prices for corn increased sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine. A war in a global breadbasket \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 threatened to reduce food production and add uncertainty into supply chains. The war boosted fertilizer prices and corn prices. Farmers had a cushion.\n\nToday, the story is different.\n\nOn top of running their farm, Brandon and Sarah Hastings also own Hastings CCI Equipment, a company that designs, installs, and repairs grain storage systems. The Hastings were among a number across the Midwest who suffered from President Trump\u2019s first-term trade war with China. Jamie Kelter Davis/The Globe and Mail\n\nA poster of Donald Trump hangs on the back of a door at a farmhouse in Sidney, Ill.\n\nThe President scowls at the camera, his eyebrows arched. Underneath the photograph are the words \u201cNever Surrender!\u201d\n\nThis is a poster of President Trump\u2019s August, 2023, mug shot, taken in Fulton County jail in Atlanta, Ga.\n\nPresident Trump and this poster are a source of daily inspiration to Sarah Hastings and her family, who grow around 1,800 acres of corn and soybeans. It is a reminder that you can accomplish anything, she said, including go to jail and \u2013 a year and a half later \u2013 become President of the United States.\n\nBut Ms. Hastings doesn\u2019t feel inspired when she looks at the graph laid out in front of her. It is a broad snapshot of her finances across the past 10 years. It measures the two most important variables: the cost of fertilizer and the farm-gate sales of her crops.\n\nThe lines are converging. In 2014, she spent about US$200,000 on fertilizer. In 2024, she spent about US$400,000. Simultaneously, the price for corn has dropped from an all-time high of more than US$8 per bushel in August, 2012. The war in Ukraine briefly boosted the price. However, prices have declined steadily over the past two and a half years. As of Feb. 24, the price of corn sat at US$4.70, a nearly 50-per-cent drop from the record.\n\nAnd Ms. Hastings doesn\u2019t expect better prices over the next few years.\n\nWith a background in bookkeeping and accounting, she knows what this means. Profits are shrinking, and her business \u2013 a multigenerational farm \u2013 is less viable, especially if tariffs mean she has to pay more for potash.\n\nRemnants of corn debris from the previous harvest sit atop the ground before the soybean planting season begins. In 2014, The Hastings spent around US$200,000 on fertilizer. By 2024, the cost doubled, while the price of corn dropped.\n\nThe farm has some options should the tariff happen. The family can be more targeted with fertilizer application. Or they could apply less fertilizer overall, and accept lower crop yields. With the price of corn as low as it is now, that might make financial sense. Underneath all this, Ms. Hastings, like other Midwestern corn farmers, has faith in her soil and its ability to grow a good crop \u2013 even with less fertilizer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing how our soils can compensate,\u201d she said.\n\nBut every option is a risk, and the decisions made could have long-term consequences for the health of her land and her business. The uncertainty feels overwhelming to her at times, especially in a business such as corn farming, in which decisions made in spring determine her family\u2019s annual income.\n\n\u201cYou get one chance a year,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many jobs do you get one chance a year?\u201d\n\nThe Hastings family farm was among a number across the Midwest that suffered from President Trump\u2019s first-term trade war with China. In retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, in August, 2019, the major importer of U.S. corn and soybeans closed its borders to U.S. agricultural products.\n\nWashington distributed up to US$16-billion in financial aid to farmers most affected by China\u2019s actions. The Hastings received some of that money.\n\nIt was a stressful moment for Illinois farmers, said Rodney Weinzierl, executive director of the Illinois Corn Growers Association. The vast majority of the farms in his region - like the rest of the corn belt - are family owned and operated, and multigenerational. Losing a major export market was a blow to business and livelihoods.\n\nBut farmers reaped some benefits, he said. Corn exports increased after the trade war ended and China \u2013 which had a reputation for renegotiating contracts once shipments arrived in port \u2013 realized the stakes and started playing by the rules. But that was \u201ctaken off the table when a new administration came in,\u201d said Mr. Weinzierl.\n\nSarah Hastings\u2019 husband, Brandon, seconds that thought. \u201cThey knew Trump is pretty serious about what he says.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: As a professional accountant by trade, Ms. Hastings knows profits are shrinking, and her business is less viable if they have to pay a 25 per cent tariff on potash.Jamie Kelter Davis/The Globe and Mail\n\nThis is one of the many reasons Mr. Weinzierl says Illinois corn farmers voted for Mr. Trump. The Environmental Protection Agency challenged corn growers during Joe Biden\u2019s term as U.S. president by promoting electric vehicles and discouraging sales of ones powered by gasoline \u2013 mixed with ethanol from corn.\n\nWhat the industry needs above all is access to new markets, he said. Total U.S. corn yields have increased more than 360 per cent since the 1950s. Increased efficiency and supply is driving low prices.\n\nLivestock, a primary market for U.S. corn, is also making efficiency gains and thereby decreasing corn demand. Mounting competition from Brazilian and Argentinian corn doesn\u2019t help matters, either.\n\nInstead of finding new markets for corn, the EPA\u2019s push for EVs threatened demand for biofuels, he said.\n\nAround 45 per cent of total corn produced in the U.S. is turned into ethanol, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Ethanol is made from fermenting starches of grains into what is called renewable fuel. Under the 2005 U.S. renewable fuel standard, all transportation fuel in the country needs to contain a certain proportion of the stuff. Today 98 per cent of gasoline in the U.S. contains ethanol, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s focus on EVs was a short-sighted approach and failed to account for renewable fuels in the fight against climate change, said a February, 2024, letter signed by thousands of corn farmers across the country. The billions spent on EVs prioritized one sector above another, said the letter.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Tim Habing, a small-scale Illinois corn farmer, is among the few in his community who do not support Trump.Tytia Habing/The Globe and Mail\n\nTim Habing, a small-scale corn farmer in Effingham, Ill., is a minority in his community. He does not support Mr. Trump. He doesn\u2019t think the President shares his values or represents the interests of farmers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think he even cares about us. I think all we are is a vote to him.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a stark example of the White House prioritizing other interests over the farmer, he said. And it\u2019s worse than Biden administration\u2019s investment in EVs.\n\nPresident Trump has framed Canadian tariffs as a way of rebalancing a trade deficit and as a strategy to bring manufacturing (such as steel) back to America. He has also made misleading claims about fentanyl crossing the border to justify the tariffs.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to know if tariffs will bring manufacturing back, or if this is what the Trump administration really wants. At least the Democrats explicitly believed they were trying to help the planet, said Mr. Habing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay making less money if it serves the greater good... I just don\u2019t want to go broke overnight.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Potash, while categorized as a critical mineral by Ottawa, is not classified as such in the U.S.Matt Smith/The Globe and Mail\n\nAs President Trump continues to press ahead with his tariff threat, that is looking like more of a reality for Mr. Habing. He has yet to purchase his potash for the spring planting season.\n\nHe is also concerned about retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico.\n\nCanada is the top destination for U.S. ethanol exports. And Mexico, which Mr. Trump has also threatened with a 25-per-cent tariff, is the largest export destination for U.S. corn (double the second-largest market \u2013 Japan).\n\n\u201cWhy are we tariffing Canada?\u201d asked Mr. Habing. \u201cI mean, what did they do to us?\u201d\n\nFor now, the Illinois Corn Growers Association is joining other voices calling for an exemption for Canadian potash. Or, failing that, a recognition that fertilizer is an essential part of U.S. food production, and therefore entitled to the 10-per-cent tariff Mr. Trump says he will apply to Canadian energy and critical minerals. (Potash, while categorized as a critical mineral by Ottawa, is not classified as such in the U.S.)\n\nMs. Hastings would also like to see this exception. And while she does see fentanyl crossing the Canada-U.S. border as a justification for tariffs, she also doesn\u2019t want to see Canadians hurt by tariffs. She has nothing against Canada and recognizes it is an important trading partner with aligned values. She wants businesses on both sides of the border to thrive.\n\nAs for her own business, as a farmer of a highly-homogenized global commodity, she knows she is often a victim of fluctuations in global trade and geopolitical instability. But she nonetheless believes in Mr. Trump\u2019s long-term vision of an America that is great again \u2013 even if it hurts her in the short term.\n\n\u201cWe live by the sword,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we die by the sword.\u201d\n\nRed potash is stored in a warehouse at Nutrien\u2019s Cory Potash mine. More than 80 per cent of the potash used by U.S. farmers comes from mines in Saskatchewan. Matt Smith/Globe and Mail\n\nEleven potash mines spread across Saskatchewan are drilling into the ground in a race to extract Canada\u2019s pink gold, a vital nutrient for a world facing food insecurity.\n\nNutrien, while the biggest miner of potash worldwide, isn\u2019t the only player. Canada\u2019s bountiful deposits have enticed a United Nations of mining companies, including U.S.-based Mosaic Co. MOS-N and Compass Minerals International Inc. CMP-N, German fertilizer producer K+S AG and \u2013 most recently \u2013 the world\u2019s largest mining company by market capitalization: Australian miner BHP Group Ltd. BHPLF\n\nThe global masters of iron ore, copper and metallurgical coal see Canadian potash as the next frontier.\n\nGiant BHP is building one of the world\u2019s largest potash mines, the $18-billion Jansen mine, two hours outside Saskatoon. When stage one of the mine comes online in late 2026, it will produce 4.4 million tonnes of potash per year. When stage two is complete in 2029, the mine will churn out 8.4 million tonnes per year.\n\nIt is the biggest single investment in Saskatchewan\u2019s history. It is also the biggest investment in BHP\u2019s 140-year history. And there\u2019s a reason BHP chose Canada, said Canadian-born CEO Mike Henry in an interview with The Globe and Mail\u2019s Report on Business magazine.\n\nCanadian potash is emblematic of valuable growth, which is BHP\u2019s priority moving forward.\n\nPotash is needed for food production. And agriculture worldwide \u2013 facing rising living standards and a rising demand for calorie-high diets \u2013 will need to innovate. Fertilizer will fuel this innovation.\n\nChanges to global agricultural practices will drive growth for Nutrien, agrees Ken Seitz.\n\nSophisticated agricultural markets such as the U.S. are important to the business, but there is fast-growing demand elsewhere, too.\n\nWhile U.S. farmers overwhelmingly need Canadian potash producers, the U.S. buys less than one-third of Nutrien\u2019s potash sales volumes.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Nutrien has diversified its trade, building sophisticated supply chains to reach over 40 markets, said Mr. Seitz. Growth is offshore in large, developing agricultural markets such as China, Brazil and Southeast Asia.\n\nMr. Seitz has visited Washington a number of times over the past few months, trying to impress upon Mr. Trump\u2019s administration the importance of affordable Canadian potash to his farmers. Because potash isn\u2019t just a product; it is the key to growing affordable food.\n\n\u201cThis message is about the importance of domestic food security.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this article included incorrect prices for corn.

As a copper-bearing sulfide mineral, Bornite's price trend is influenced by a variety of factors, including global copper demand, mining activities, economic conditions, and technological developments. Understanding the price trend of Bornite in 2024 and 2025 involves examining these key factors and their potential impacts on its market dynamics.Bornite Price Trend in 2024:In 2024, Bornite's price is expected to be strongly tied to the overall copper market, as the mineral is primarily mined for its copper content. Several factors are likely to influence the price trend during this year.\u2022 Global Copper Demand: In 2024, global demand for copper is expected to remain strong due to its critical role in industries such as electronics, construction, and, particularly, electric vehicles (EVs). The push for green energy solutions, including renewable energy infrastructure and electric mobility, is likely to continue driving copper demand. This increased demand for copper will, in turn, impact the price of copper-bearing minerals like Bornite.\u2022 Supply Constraints: On the supply side, the mining of copper, including Bornite, faces several challenges. Some of the largest copper-producing regions, such as South America, have seen disruptions due to political instability, labor strikes, and environmental regulations. These disruptions could reduce the availability of Bornite and other copper ores, creating upward pressure on prices.\u2022 Geopolitical and Economic Factors: Geopolitical tensions, such as those involving major copper producers like Chile and Peru, could introduce volatility in Bornite's price. Additionally, inflationary pressures and the possibility of economic slowdowns in key markets could dampen demand for copper and its derivatives, potentially putting downward pressure on Bornite prices.\u2022 Technological Advancements in Mining: Advancements in mining technology, such as more efficient extraction and processing techniques, could help mitigate some supply constraints. If these technologies are adopted widely, they may stabilize Bornite production, which could contribute to maintaining stable prices in 2024.In general, 2024 is expected to witness moderate price growth for Bornite, primarily driven by sustained demand in the copper market and potential supply disruptions.Bornite Price Trend in 2025:Looking ahead to 2025, the price trend of Bornite could experience more volatility, influenced by several long-term trends and factors.\u2022 Continued Growth in Copper Demand: The strong demand for copper that began in the previous years is expected to persist in 2025. The growth of renewable energy technologies, electric vehicle adoption, and the expansion of the electronics sector will continue to fuel demand for copper. As Bornite is a key copper ore, its price will likely benefit from the overall growth in copper consumption.\u2022 Supply Chain Developments: While supply issues may persist in 2025, mining companies are likely to adapt to meet demand by increasing exploration and production efforts. However, environmental and social pressures may result in higher costs for mining operations. Stricter environmental regulations, particularly in copper-rich regions, may limit the speed at which production increases, potentially creating price volatility for Bornite and other copper ores.\u2022 Innovations in Recycling and Substitution: One key factor that could influence the price of Bornite in 2025 is the development of recycling technologies and the potential for substitution in some applications. As the global recycling industry matures, the availability of recycled copper may reduce reliance on primary copper sources, including Bornite. If recycling technologies improve, it may dampen the upward pressure on prices. Additionally, the development of alternative materials in certain applications may slightly reduce the demand for copper-based materials.\u2022 Macroeconomic Conditions: The broader macroeconomic landscape in 2025 will be a crucial determinant of Bornite's price. If global economic growth continues at a steady pace, the demand for copper will likely remain robust, supporting the price of Bornite. However, if inflationary pressures or global recessions impact industrial demand, there could be downward price pressure on Bornite.\u2022 Mining and Environmental Challenges: Environmental and regulatory challenges in copper-rich regions could continue to pose significant risks to production. For example, environmental concerns in Peru, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of Congo may slow mining growth, which could affect the availability of copper ores, including Bornite. In this case, prices could rise due to restricted supply.Request for customization atImportant target segments driving the demand for Bornite (Copper Sulfide) MarketBornite (Copper Sulfide), a key copper-bearing mineral, plays a crucial role in the global copper market.

            "content": "While SUVs are taking India\u2019s mainstream automotive market by storm, luxury segment still seems to be favouring saloon cars. Aimed at carving a bigger niche in the luxury executive sedan segment, BMW Group just launched the new 3 Series LWB, which will be positioned below the 5 Series LWB, launched a couple of months ago.\n\nBMW 3 Series LWB Launch\n\nTaking on the likes of Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4, BMW 3 Series LWB was just launched in India. Where pricing is concerned, BMW is offering their luxury executive sedan for a starting price of Rs 62,60,000 (Ex-sh) for 330Li M Sport variant, which is locally produced at company\u2019s facility in Chennai.\n\nThere are four colours on offer with 3 Series LWB \u2013 Mineral White, Skyscraper Grey, M Carbon Black and Arctic Race Blue. On the inside, 3 Series LWB is offered with leather Vernasca Cognac shade. As of now, only the Petrol 330Li M Sport variant is launched, while a Diesel engine-equipped variant will launch in the future.\n\nBecause this is a BMW, offering the \u2018Ultimate Driving Pleasure\u2019 in its segment, we have to get powertrain details and performance metrics out of the way. Powering this sporty sedan is a 2.0L 4-cylinder TwinPower Turbo Petrol engine, generating a peak power of 258 bhp and a peak torque of 400 Nm, mated to an 8-speed gearbox. This is enough to propel the 3 Series LWB from 0-100 km/h in just 6.2 seconds.\n\nSpecs & Features\n\nWhere design is concerned, 3 Series LWB gets BMW signature Kidney Grille and twin circular LED headlights. These are adaptive LED projector headlights. Dimensions-wise, 3 Series LWB measures 4,819 mm in length and has a 2,961 mm long wheelbase, making it the longest and roomiest in its segment.\n\nOn the inside, we can see high quality materials, precise build quality, well-designed layout and the Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite finish is a notable element. Curved widescreen, M leather steering wheel, large panorama sunroof, ambient lighting, new air vents, three-zone climate control, wireless smartphone connection, paddle shifters, surround view camera, iDrive OS 8.5, a spare wheel, 6 airbags and BMW Digital Key Plus are some of the notable features.\n\nStatement from BMW Group India\n\nMr. Vikram Pawah, President, BMW Group India said, \u201cThe new BMW 3 Series Long Wheelbase has set new standards in its segment with an elongated design, enhanced space, luxurious comfort and dynamic performance. Impressive in every way, it also possesses the most powerful engine in its class.\n\nWith the new update, the 3 LWB has increased its appeal even further by adding new striking design elements and driver assistance features. As always, it continues to deliver sheer driving pleasure with superlative luxury, making it a perfect choice for individuals as well as their families.\u201d",

We did change the oil filter and the oil at the otr site itself, but due to some overheating issue blew the head ghasket just as she reached lonavala. What baffles me is the garage person in Lonavala said the radiator was running on empty, where as my boys had topped up all fluids on saturday itself and the car was taken on sunday morning. We did not hit anywhere, that could cause a leak in the radiator.Thank you GTO.This was the second run of the Thar through water and she did the first one beautifuly under the hands of Devang, i am told.

Any particular reason for so many shafts breaking? Were there rocks on the water body bed?\n\nQuote: Originally Posted by mashmash (Post 2269089) Awesome rhymes and lovely pics... Any particular reason for so many shafts breaking? Were there rocks on the water body bed? The water bed was not rocky. However there was one dry section which was a bed of rocks. The two gypsy's which took hits went through that. The jeeps twisted shaft happened after towing the 550 which was towing the 540. No idea why it twisted like a pretzel though.\n\nIMHO, (dont take this badly) but it was a disaster. Any OTR with so many break downs cannot be fun at all. And by the looks of it it was not a trail that warranted all these break downs. That means that;\n\n\n\n1) You guys are not looking after your vehicles\n\n2) There looks to be no chain of comand here\n\n3) No one seems to be listening to anyone\n\n\n\nSorry and before you guys get upset, i have been barking like s dog again and again about the basic rules to be followed.\n\n\n\nSpeedy, sorry bro but your Thar had no business to break down and swallow water. This means one thing. You either got careless or you got too confident. Thar is not God that will overcome all obstacles and water is a very strong foe. I can imagine that there are always jokers etching you on to get in the water, i have seen it in the past being tried on me too. \"Aree darr mat, le le paani mein lele, Kucch nahi hoga:\" are some of the terms used. Then one goes in. The engine stalls and one makes the cardinal mistake of cranling the engine. Finished!! Your gasket is cooked. If you are still calous, pop goes your head.\n\n\n\nI agree with GTO that one must stay clear of water when it can be avoided, especially muddy, mucky water. Buffaloes and Hippos get into that kind of stuff and by no means any of our 4X4s fall into that group. Besides getting your electricals messed up and your radiator clogged.\n\n\n\nSecondly i have seen a lack of co ordination between the participants and the organizers. I dont know when people will learn that this is not some macho show off thing but a sport that needs to be enjoyed carefully, safely and without unnecessarily inviting break downs. Of course breakdowns may happen anytime but that does not mean one invites it.\n\n\n\nI have learnt a thing or two from my previous escapades which i will share here (not refering to this otr as i was not there)\n\n\n\nNever go in a large group, unless you know each and every driver well. No acquaintance stuff here, i mean really know them well and that is because the newer guys never follow instructions. So better not to attend than go with a bunch of unorganized hooligans.\n\n\n\nMake sure rules are followed.\n\n\n\nKeep the event strictly \"By invitation only\" that means no one can bring their vehicle randomly and join in. f there is a guest, he has to be a passenger.\n\n\n\nMake sure who are the spotters at the beginning of the event and make sure that no one inexperienced tries his hand at spotting.\n\n\n\nMake sure that all vehicles participating adhere to the minimum safety standards like Roll bar/cage and seat belts at the minimum.\n\n\n\nHave a proper trail charted out and make sure no one deviates. Especially when seeing water. o one will try a trail unless the lead vehicle goes through and determines it fit to travel for all. If the lead Vehicle says no, it means no. If then someone tries some stunt, let that vehicle be rescued after the trail is finished and let the driver travel as a passenger for the rest of the trail.\n\n\n\nI may have been harsh but this is going to get worse if these things are not imposed. If no one wants to follow, why come with us? Go find your own trail and have an OTR experience yourself. I have spoken!!",

A year later, the electric crossover made its debut in the European market. Now, the EV has been spotted testing on Indian roads.\n\nThe Smart #3 was recently spotted on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. However, before you get too excited, let me just clarify that it is mostly being used for component testing purposes.\n\nAs you can see, the test vehicle has a Valeo sticker at the back. It\u2019s an automotive supplier based in France. It seems the company is using the Smart #3 to test some of its products in Indian conditions.\n\nComing back to the Smart #3, the car uses a single electric motor that delivers 268 BHP and has a range of 455 km (WLTP cycle). Smart also offers a dual-motor version called the Smart #3 Brabus, which has 422 BHP and a range of 435 km.\n\nSource: @zigwheels",

FCX is currently trading at a forward price/earnings of 21.65X, a roughly 10% premium to the Zacks Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry average of 19.77X, and higher than its five-year median.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe FCX stock has seen a 15.7% decline in its share price over the past six months. The downside reflects the pullback in copper prices amid uncertainties over U.S. tariffs and concerns over its high production costs, which has led to a downward revision in FCX\u2019s earnings estimates. Freeport has underperformed the industry\u2019s 15.3% decline and the S&P 500\u2019s rise of 6.4%. Its peers, Southern Copper Corporation SCCO, BHP Group Limited BHP and Rio Tinto Group RIO, have lost 11.6%, 9.8% and 3.8%, respectively, over the same period.\n\nFreeport\u2019s 6-Month Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnical indicators show that FCX has been trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since Nov. 11, 2024. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day SMA. Following a death crossover on Dec. 3, 2024, the 50-day SMA continues to read lower than the 200-day SMA, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nFCX Stock Trades Below 50-Day SMA\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFCX\u2019s Falling Earnings Estimates Reflect Negative Sentiment\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 for FCX has been revised downward over the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for the first quarter of 2025 has also been revised down over the same time frame.\n\n\n\nFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe market appears to have priced FCX\u2019s shares higher despite its bleak earnings trajectory. FCX\u2019s premium valuation may not present a compelling value proposition at these levels. Let\u2019s take a look at the stock\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nFCX\u2019s Growth Actions to Expand Capacity & Drive Production\n\nFreeport is well-placed with high-quality copper assets and remains focused on strong execution and advancing its organic growth opportunities. At its Cerro Verde operation in Peru, a large-scale concentrator expansion provided incremental annual production of around 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum. It is evaluating a large-scale expansion at El Abra in Chile to define a large sulfide resource that could potentially support a major mill project similar to the large-scale concentrator at Cerro Verde. FCX is also conducting pre-feasibility studies (expected to be completed by mid-2026) in the Safford/Lone Star operations in Arizona to define a significant sulfide expansion opportunity. It also has expansion opportunities at Bagdad in Arizona to more than double the concentrator capacity of the operation.\n\n\n\nAlso, PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) substantially completed the construction of the new greenfield smelter in Eastern Java during 2024, with an expected start-up in mid-2025 followed by a full ramp-up by the end of 2025. PT-FI is also developing the Kucing Liar ore body within the Grasberg district with a targeted commencement of production by 2030. Gold production also commenced at the new precious metals refinery in late 2024. Plans are in place to transition PT-FI\u2019s existing energy source from coal to natural gas, which is expected to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Grasberg.",

The agreement was signed in Bras\u00edlia in October 2024 and provides reparation for the impacts of Samarco\u2019s Fund\u00e3o dam failure in November 2015 and builds on the existing remediation and compensation work already performed by the Renova Foundation in Brazil. The total agreement value is R$ 170 billion1 (US$ 31.7 billion2) which incorporates amounts already invested to date plus future payments and obligations3.\n\nIn addition to providing funding to the federal and state governments to continue ongoing environmental recovery, Samarco is also responsible for continuing the Renova Foundation's sustainability projects\n\nReached between public authorities and the companies (Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale) in October 2024, the new agreement expands socioenvironmental remediation efforts following Samarco's Fund\u00e3o dam failure, allocating over R$16 billion to government entities, in addition to Samarco's direct reparation obligations.\n\nThe federal government will receive R$8.1 billion, while the states of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo will both receive R$3 billion for environmental improvement projects. An additional R$1 billion has been allocated for each state for flood prevention measures.\n\nIn assuming responsibility for activities previously managed by the Renova Foundation, Samarco will continue restoring springs and Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs). The company\u2019s obligation is to restore 5,000 springs and 43,000 hectares of APPs in Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, with R$ 1.7 billion allocated for reforestation.\n\nThe agreement also provides support for the creation of the Doce River Mouth Environmental Protection Area and the consolidation of federal conservation units, under the responsibility of the federal government. The recovery of the Doce River, the water quality of which has already returned to pre-dam failure levels, remains a focus. Water quality monitoring will continue at 84 points in the basin.\n\nTo enable universal sanitation in the basin that addresses issues beyond the impacts of the dam failure, Samarco will allocate R$11 billion to the state governments, with R$7.54 billion for Minas Gerais and R$3.46 billion for Esp\u00edrito Santo. These funds will be used for water supply projects, solid waste management and large-scale drainage, focusing on structuring concessions and Public-Private Partnerships, as well as public works to expand sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe removal of tailings in the Risoleta Neves Hydroelectric Plant (Candonga) reservoir and the Dique S4 dam is also stipulated as Samarco's responsibility. At Candonga, the requirement is to dredge up to 9.15 million cubic meters of tailings. At Dique S4, there will be partial decommissioning, with lowering of the impoundment and recovery of the degraded area. Studies will be conducted to assess the toxicity of the remaining tailings at Dique S4 and to propose mitigation measures if necessary, but without additional dredging or total decommissioning.\n\nAs a shareholder in the Samarco non-operated joint venture, BHP Brasil remains committed to supporting Samarco as it works to deliver on its obligations as part of the new agreement and finalize definitive support for those affected by the dam failure.\n\n1 All financial obligations are presented on a real, undiscounted basis and will accrue inflation at IPCA inflation rate. Payments will be made in Brazilian Reais.\n\n2 All USD amounts throughout are calculated based on actual transactional (historical) exchange rates related to funding provided to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova (Renova Foundation) for investment to date and future spend is calculated using 28 June 2024 BRL/USD exchange rate of 5.56.\n\n3 Under the Settlement Agreement, Samarco is the primary obligor for the settlement obligations and BHP Brasil and Vale are each secondary obligors of any obligation that Samarco cannot fund or perform in proportion to their shareholding at the time of the dam failure, which is 50% each.",

The company is also a prominent producer in Chile through its Escondida and Pampa Norte operations and is looking to kickstart more growth in the country.\n\n\u201cIn Chile, projects like an expansion of the Laguna Seca concentrator and a new concentrator at Escondida are expected to support annual copper production of 1.4 million tonnes, on average, through the 2030s,\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s half a million tonnes per year more than if we did not invest.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, BHP\u2019s Copper South Australia business is expected to double its output from the early to mid-2030s, adding approximately 300,000 tonnes of annual production.\n\nWith these investments, the company envisions an \u201caspirational pathway\u201d to over two million tonnes of copper production per year.\n\nBeyond organic growth, BHP is also expanding through strategic partnerships.\n\nBHP is exploring new jurisdictions, including through the new Vicu\u00f1a joint venture (JV) with Lundin Mining in Argentina. Henry said Vicu\u00f1a could become one of the top 10 copper producers globally through the Filo del Sol and Josemaria projects.\n\nThe companies completed the acquisition of Filo Corp, who owns Filo del Sol, in January 2025. BHP paid Lundin Mining $US690 million to form a 50:50 arrangement at the Josemaria project.",

I seriously wish there were pure old school MT sedans with those 2.0Liter engines.\n\nBHPian sunilch recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nAre there any Modern (2021 or later) Premium Sedans that offer MT gearbox?\n\nI have always had used cars purely from a VFM perspective and over a period been able to drive/experience multiple makes/models with both MT and AT gearboxes.\n\nWhat I have realized personally is that I enjoy MT more than AT. I have a 2.0 TDI Laura with DSG. Now, that DSG is wonderful and enjoyable when I am zipping in the City when I get the chance. But out on the highway or on some curves/twists, I miss the old school MT gearbox.\n\nI also have a BR-V MT now and had 3rd Gen MT Honda City earlier. I somehow enjoy the BR-V/City more than the Laura when I am driving on an open Highway. Or when I am headed to Igatpuri, or Pune/Lonavala for Sunday rides.\n\nIn the past, we had premium cars with MT - Octavia, Laura, Jetta - all came with MT gearboxes. But today when I search, the only good options in the premium segments with MT are large SUVs/MUVs such as the Crysta, Fortuner, XUV700, Compass, Hector, etc.\n\nI seriously wish there were pure old school MT sedans with those 2.0Liter engines. I don't have the budget or the inclination for the BMW M2 that recently came out with MT gearbox. I know we have the VW/Skoda twins (Slavia or Virtus) but I am looking for some options with higher capacity engines.\n\nIs there anything that may help me in getting a good recent used sedan that has MT gearbox?\n\nIf nothing comes in, I might get forced to get the MUV/SUV as my next car. Not that those are bad, I would personally prefer to have a sedan and relegate the family duties to a workhorse such as BR-V or Ertiga. And I don't like those paddleshifters. I hardly ever used those on the Civic. Even on the Laura, I hardly use the manual mode since it doesn't require any leg work.\n\nHere's what BHPian kadanaJ had to say in this matter:\n\nThere are barely any premium sedans left in the market, let alone having choice of gearbox. The Corolla Altis, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra all disappeared by end 2020 or early 2021. The Skoda Octavia I believe stayed around till 2023. The Superb and the Camry are the only 2 premium sedan options left. A used Corolla is possibly your best bet, as it had the option of the 1.8L petrol with a manual gearbox. The Civic 1.8L petrol came only with a CVT, and the diesel engine which had a manual was a terrible engine. The Elantra had a 2.0L petrol and 1.6L diesel with manual gearboxes. The Octavia IIRC had a 1.4L turbo-petrol manual and a 2.0L diesel with a manual gearbox. Out of the above, keeping long term reliability and spare parts availability in mind, I would recommend the Corolla Altis. Avoid the Elantra as it was a massive sales flop and spare parts may be an issue. These 2 (Slavia or Virtus) are your best options. Get the 1.5L turbo-petrol manual. It has as much power as the 2.0L NA engines of yesteryear.\n\nMeanwhile, here's BHPian sharmanova reply:\n\nMost of the D-segment sedans post 2010s had only the option of an AT gearbox. Some cars like the Honda Civic i-DTEC, Skoda Octavia TDi had the option of a manual gearbox along with the AT. If you're looking for a 2021 or later MT sedan that option seems impossible! Maybe you need to compromise with Octavia/Superb DSG or downgrade to something like Slavia/Verna MT. Happy Shopping!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

This strategic move is largely driven by the increased demand associated with the global energy transition. However, the company faces the challenge of a shortage of high-quality copper deposits.\n\nCopper has become a significant focus for BHP, now accounting for half of its capital expenditure. This is a sharp increase from less than a quarter over the past five years. As part of its strategy, BHP emphasizes operating in stable jurisdictions. Its areas of focus include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States. This approach differentiates BHP from its competitors like Glencore and Rio Tinto, which may not have the same preference for geopolitical stability.\n\nIn a move to bolster its copper holdings, BHP completed a $2 billion transaction to secure a 50% stake in Argentina\u2019s Filo del Sol copper project. This decision was partly influenced by pro-mining policies introduced under President Javier Milei. Furthermore, there is speculation that BHP might consider acquiring Freeport-McMoRan, a major player in the copper market and the largest copper producer globally. Such a deal could significantly boost BHP\u2019s copper output.\n\nDespite these acquisition considerations, BHP\u2019s CEO, Mike Henry, has expressed a preference for expanding existing operations rather than pursuing significant acquisitions. He argues that organic growth could offer better returns for the company. BHP is aiming for substantial production targets, with plans to produce 1.4 million tonnes of copper annually from Chile by the 2030s. Similarly, in South Australia, potential production increases could lead to outputs ranging from 500,000 to 650,000 tonnes per annum in the mid-2030s.\n\nAcquiring Freeport\u2019s assets, such as the Grasberg mine, comes with its challenges. The mine is notorious for issues related to separatist violence and environmental management, though Freeport has made improvements in its operations and corporate reputation. Additionally, the risk of nationalization at Grasberg has decreased after a state-owned company acquired a majority stake.\n\nDon\u2019t Buy Just Yet\n\nYou will want to see this before you make any decisions.\n\nBefore you decide which shares to add to your portfolio you might want to take a look at this special report we recently published.\n\nOur experts picked out The 5 best ASX shares to buy in 2024.\n\nWe\u2019re giving away this valuable research for FREE.\n\nClick below to secure your copy",

            "content": "Carzman Newbie\n\n\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2023 Location: Kozhikkode Posts: 12 Thanked: 98 Times\n\nFiat Avventura Review | Car #13 | The Italian Stallion\n\nSo as the title indicates, this is a story of a wild Italian Horse we came across 8 years ago. And why start from #13 and not from #1? Well, even I was struggling with the same question. We were blessed to experience different cars beginning in 1998. The majority of them are pre-worshipped. And now we have reached the Number 20 milestone. But still, our beloved No.13 is with us. Since this car is still part of the family, I decided to start my writing with our beloved Avventura.\n\nPrelude:\n\nIn 2015, we had a Tata Nano twist (2014 model) and a Toyota Corolla(2004) 1.8E. Well, the Corolla is one reliable model and built to last decades. My uncle bought a pre-owned one a year back and loved every bit of it. The idea to get one also got instantly approved by the family. I do not want to make this about the Corolla as I plan to write a separate post about it later. Long story short, the car had multiple issues and even after spending a decent amount of time-solving it, it did not feel complete, like something was missing. We had another Corolla to compare with hence this car was not getting up to the mark. So the itch for change started pretty soon afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where my brother, dad, and I are at the happiest. Because the hunt for a new car is always interesting. Especially in the pre-owned market. Initially, you set a budget, then start with a couple of models, test drive some of them, and then out of the blue, new players come into the scene. In short, we love the car hunt part more than ever. But this time, Mom had a strict order we got to buy a new car!. Let's take a break from pre-owned ones and buy a new one. Well, can't blame her. Sometimes she hates the fact that some of the cars required frequent visits to the workshop. On the other hand, the three of us love it because there is a whole lot of possibility to learn more about your car. The basic drop and pick up for the regular service center of a new car does not provide a lot of information. But with a pre-worshipped car, you have endless possibilities. I learned about a lot of systems in the car due to this.\n\nSince Mom's decision was clear, everyone agreed to it. Pre-owned or new, the elevating fact is that we are getting a new car. We used to go for test drives at different car dealers whenever a new model was released. It was a basic short-duration drive without giving much attention to detail. But this time it kind of became a test drive to buy. The budget was set to be under 10 lakhs including the price we would get for Corolla. So the hunt begins!\n\nThe hunt:\n\nMe and my brother have been calling this process \"The Hunt\" for a couple of years. He even takes his time every six months to prepare a presentation of available cars and shows them to my parents, even if we are not going to buy one. What if one of these cars in any of these presentations got approved, right?\n\nI don't remember the month exactly but, we began the test drive series ft'2015 with the newest Ford twin in town: Figo Aspire. Aspire was the first car of the test drive series. It had models within our budget. The interiors were nice, with adequate space inside. Steering was light and easy to maneuver. Compared with the Corolla it really felt smaller. We drove the petrol manual variant and it was okay. Being the first car in the test drives, it was kept on hold in the list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosport:\n\nEcosports base variants started at the higher end of our budget so we kind of put that on hold as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaleno:\n\nThe new Baleno was launched around that time. It also marked the beginning of Nexa. Nexa showrooms were a class apart from others. The usual Maruthi showrooms were the worst because they would be least interested in selling. No test drive vehicles are available at any time. So we were skeptical when we went to check out the Baleno. Once we entered the showroom it all changed. It was days after the launch and there were a decent amount of people came to check out the car. They have nicely displayed different variants and colors, the staff were properly trained. The dealership experience was really good. On seeing the crowd we kind of concluded that it was impossible to get a test drive. Anyway, we just enquired about the test drive and the response was yes it can be done. We thought to wait for a while and leave. But in under 10 minutes, the test drive car was allotted and all of us hopped in. What a car. It sure was beautiful inside out. A lot of space inside. Three of us could easily sit on the back. It picks up speed pretty fast, easy to maneuver. Had ABS Airbag standard and Android auto/apple car play system. Except for the projector headlamps, all other features could be accessorized even from the base model. It was the petrol manual. Later on from one more Nexa showroom, we got to test drive all the variants viz., Diesel manual, petrol AMT, Petrol CVT. We kind of liked the car very much. But the major factor that drove us away from this was the waiting period. It was 8 months! We are definitely not that patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyundai Elite i20/i20 Active :\n\nWe test drove the i20 diesel with manual gearbox. It was pretty responsive. Its 6th gear ensured a relaxed cruising over 90 kmph. It was a well-behaved car. The i20 Activ the cross over version of the Elite i20 just looked like minor cosmetic changes to the standard i20 with higher premium. So basically did not feel an difference between the two. The driving experience of i20 was indeed good. But, here also the waiting period killed off the interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNissan Micra CVT: The smoothest CVT driving experience. Also, it was the first automatic I have driven. The car was good but we felt it was a bit overpriced for its price.\n\n\n\nHonda Jazz:\n\nThe Jazz facelift was launched around that time. It came with 'magic seats' in the rear. Lots of space inside. The diesel variant offered high FE whereas the petrol CVt offered a nimble driving experience. The test drives were enjoyable but the rear seat thigh support felt shorter. The base variant of the city was also in the budget but we decided not to consider it.\n\n\n\nMahindra KUV: Another new car in the market. It had attractive 3+3 seating with the front middle seat which could be folded as a chunky handrest. The joystick-like gear shifter was nice. Both the petrol and diesel variants were test-driven. The biggest drawback was the side profile(personal opinion.)\n\n\n\nMahindra TUV: Also newly launched. Attractive since came with a diesel AMT version. The big car stance surely was a plus. But during the test drive, felt excessive body roll. Hence got ticked off.\n\n\n\nTata Zest Quadrajet AMT: If my memory serves right, this was the first Diesel AMT combo introduced in India. Zest was the beginning of modern era TATA cars and was far ahead in interior quality and driving dynamics. The Quadrajet engine mated to AMT was a sweet combo as the engine had enough torque to match with the AMT box unlike the relatively low powered petrol engines. The only down side was that it neither had the hill hold nor the creep function. The car moves only if you press the accelerator, unlike the creep movement you get while releasing the brake pedal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiat comes into the picture again:\n\nSince we were visiting all the dealers for this crazy test drive spree, we did not leave out Fiat as well. So, when we called and enquired about a fiat dealership, they had a Linea classic on discount in comparison with the facelift one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne other dealer said they have a Punto EVO fully accessorized with Alloy wheels, a music system, racing decals, etc. Went to the dealer with the Linea offering first. Upon entering the showroom, the first thing we noticed was this Orange colored Avventura. I still remember the first time we saw the advertisement on TV. The one with the \"Empire of the Sun song: Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive \", song in the background. The ad was really attractive and tried to establish the character of the car well. This was the first time we came up close and personal with one. So walked over opened the driver's door on sat on the driver's seat. The beautiful and unconventional dashboard, Plush steering wheel, attractive analogue meter console, and .cramped space around the pedals!. That was a shock. The pedals seemed little and the deadpedal looked like it was ready to resist your left foot when trying to depress the clutch pedal. Well it sure looked like a set back compared with the Palio. And on opening the rear door, also felt the space was not that much available as compared with the size of the car. So, yeah we closed the doors and climbed the stairs to the top to see Linea thinking this ain't our cup of tea. Who knew we would end up with the same car days later? The Linea is a beautiful car. But its sheer length was the number one factor that prevented us from considering it. Another thing was the limiting headroom in the rear. I am 6 ft tall and when I am not driving, I would sit in the back. Usually in all cars, I sit behind Mom so that she can push her seat to the front. But still, the roof liner would touch my head so decided to skip Linea. Did not take the test drive and left.\n\nEnter Avventura: Life always has some interesting twists and turns that completely break your plan and present a new path that you have not even considered before. After the visit to the first Fiat dealer, we decided to go and check out the one that had the kitted Punto EVO. It was a small dealer since its main office was in another district and this one is just a franchise of the former. The car of interest was parked inside the building. Punto was always a good-looking hatch. And it sure looked better than Palio. For test drive, they said they had parked an Avventura in their yard (erstwhile their front parking) and since basically Avventura is a beefed-up Punto, we said why not.\n\nThe first drive: Dad took the wheel first. Mom, brother and me sat on the rear seat. The space seemed all right as we travelled. As the car moved, we felt that dad was driving slow. But as I looked to the speedometer it was moving well beyond 60 kmph. This sense of speed masking was really impressive and it was completely opposite to other cars especially if you compare with Baleno. And there was no body roll. The initial passenger experience was good. Then it was my turn to drive. The clutch pedal was light but it had long travel compared to previous cars. The steering had the appropriate size and thickness with nice contours to hold. Depressed the clutch, slotted the gear into first, released the clutch and , the car just jumped forward. I did release the pedal hastily as in the case of short throw clutch pedals. The torque was not properly balanced and the car moved forward like an untamed horse. So unlike the other test drives, it felt short of enjoying the drive. The physical appearance of Avventura was really noticeable compared to normal Punto and since we drove one, thought of considering it as well. The drive was soon over and we returned home. So, we had Tata ZEST AMT, Suzuki Baleno and a Fiat Punto/Avventura as finalists. All the variants considered was in the same price range and now it was deep research time. The earlier test drive reports came in various mediums and of course, tem bhp reviews were one of the most top preferred one. Next factor was the exchange value for the Corolla. We were getting pretty low values from most of the dealers. Usually listing on olx would be a nice way to bag a better deal, but that would some time take more time for a deal to happen so we decided to exchange with whichever car we are buying.\n\n\n\nThe decision: For the final decision, we thought of going for a final test drive of these finalists. At the same time, as I was reading more reviews, I got more interested in Avventura. It was not like other cladding added cross overs like Etios liva cross or Polo cross. There was a completely new suspension setup compared to Punto, the increased ground clearance of 205mm, The unique spare wheel mechanism, the tilt meters and compass to the centre console completely gave it an appealing factor. And in one of the review, some one mentioned how to slowly and smoothly release the clutch pedal on first gear so as to balance the torque and for a smooth pick up. So this time I was prepared to drive properly. Perhaps this was the one thing that had different with most of the other cars. We can drive any car in any way we ant. But each car has an optimum way in which it can offer its supreme performance, comfort and efficiency. So with proper planning, this test drive was really enjoyable. With the proper gearshift manners, the car moved effortlessly and behaved like a tamed horse this time. And the drive did put a smile on our faces. The time for the final decision came. The exchange offers were lower from Tata and MS. The Fiat already had lower sales so for competitive edge, they offered best exchange prices. But apart from that we really got connected to the car in each test drives. Like their variant name \"Emotion\", the car really felt like it has emotion. Now the variant selection. Avventura came with all wheels including the spare wheel as full sized Alloys. And all of them had the tilt meters and compass in the center console. The higher variants had ABS, 2 airbags, rear wiper, auto AC, built in music system, front foglamps, 60:40 split rear seats, and a slightly larger center info display screen. Most of these features are coming as basic in majority of the cars nowadays. But with the price point, we felt the base variant itself was totally value for money. Even the braking felt superb like ABS equipped cars so it did not bother much. (Touchwood, even after 8 years, the car never made us nervous during breaking under several critical conditions). So it was decided: Avventura Active 1.3 Multijet in Exotica Red colour. The car got launched in the Orange colour, but it looked beautiful in the red colour personally. And the Adventure begins..\n\nDelivery : The dealer was located around 30 kms away from our home. Our Corolla was already taken away by the sales team to initiate the down payment and delivery process. Initially we thought of catching a bus, then I told that we could take the Nano and during return, I will drive the Nano. Well eventually everyone agreed and we took the Nano. The car was all prepped up and ready to welcome us in front of the dealer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mandatory key handover, sweet box, etc took place. Clicked some pictures. Yeah, we all wore red to match with the car!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow time for heading home with the newest member of the family. My brother insisted on coming with me to keep me company but I insisted back so that he could go in the new car. Finally, he agreed. So, Dad, Mom and bro drove away in the Avventura while I tailed them in the Nano. The rear tail lamps had an attractive LED park lamp which still looks better than the present cars. Even though I missed out the first drive, I sure was enjoying seeing the car being driven in front. After all its coming home!\n\nFeatures:\n\nEngine : The national engine of India 1.3 Multijet Diesel. It had 93 BHP max power in this tune and 201 Nm Torque. It is powered by a VGT turbo\n\n\n\n\n\nin comparison with the Fixed Geometry turbo of the 75hp counterparts. The 5-speed manual gearbox which is usually complained by everyone that it lacks slick shift. But I loved and still loves (maybe got used to it after all these years, but from the start itself I didn\u0092t mind) the rubbery shift. One should not hurry to shift, need to shift gently.\n\n\n\nThe third gear requires a special mention. In slow moving traffic and cities and even on narrow roads with traffic, the third gear transforms the car into an automatic mode. It\u0092s pretty well manageable within the 20-50 kmph range in 3rd gear unless the car slows down too much. This indeed has helped in lower number of gearshifts. Another complaint I have heard about is the long travel of clutch pedal.\n\n\n\nThis factor also has helped very much in smooth gear changes and hill starts, reversing, etc. I kind of hate the short throw pedals now! Most of the people who have used 75hp variants have said that 90hp lacks that initial pull. Since I have not driven any 75hp variant to this date, I cannot comment well. But personally, did not felt short of power except one or two times. The sweet way to extract it, you start slow and as the temperature builds up to optimum, you can extract the most power by going above 1750 rpm. The turbo works its magic well above 2000 rpm. And I have heard experience from other owners saying the car just pulls and pulls away in 5th gear at 2000 rpm and 80kmph effortlessly towards 140-150 kmph. Although never got to try that safely, so restrained from doing it. There is lag if you try to jump it from the start. One need to build the speed and temperature first and then this horse is ready to charge effortlessly.\n\nSafety Equipments : No ABS or airbags. Being the Active model, when compared to the present day cars one would feel it lacks the basic safety equipment. But driving wise, the car is always planted on road no matter how fast (safer speeds) it is going. We never feel the inertia of accelerating/braking to a large extent. The rear bench has a solid steel plate attached at the back for the extra support and speed masking.\n\nLong stretches of highways or the curvy ghat rods, the car never drifts out of your hands making the driver nervous. This assurance you get from the car every time you drive is the biggest plus point. It also encourages one to drive safe as well.\n\n\n\nSteering : The steering requires a special mention since it makes the fell of the car top notch. This is one of the last breeds of Hydraulic power steering and one of the best too. It is not the lightest, but the feedback you get from the road is unparalleled. You can feel how smooth or tough the road is, the depth of potholes, the shape of stones or the curve of the road. This feedback further reinforces the confidence of the driver. There are no steering control buttons in our variant. But it is cool to hold and steer. Tilt adjustment is provided. Also, the cherry on top is the active return to center. Yup it smoothly turns back to center after every turn so you just have to loosen the grip for a second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll good things apart, Fiats are notorious for the left side pulling. Ours also is not an exception. But luckily after so many trials and errors found a very good technician who is an expert on wheel alignment which reduced the issue. Since then, been performing alignment from him.\n\n\n\nThe instrument cluster: The orange backlight is matching with the meters light. The meters are classic analogue meters with pretty cool fonts. I would say it had aged well and will look fine even after years to come. The information display size is smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the top variant this screen is as big as the outer border of this screen as you can see in the picture. One can choose the required information to view on the display from the following list: ODO, Trip distance, FE of current trip, Real time FE, DTE. It also shows headlight alignment level as well. The menus are accessed via the 'TRIP' button on wiper stoke and 'SET' button on the control button group under the right AC vent.\n\n\n\nThe stalks: The indicator/Headlight stalk in the left and the wiper control on the right is entirely opposite to the common Indian cars.\n\n\n\nThe stokes are like joystick controller. This really helps during lane changes. You don't have to completely slot it into the right or left position, just push it gently towards up or down and once you remove your finger, it goes back to initial position, really handy for that 2-3 second blinks while changing lanes. The park lights and headlamps can be turned on by rotating the tip of the stoke anti clock wise. To activate high beam the stoke has to be pushed towards back and left. Repeat this movement again to turn off high beam. One thing to take care while doing this is to not hold on the tip of the stoke while doing this. Because the lights might get turned off since its really a soft touch control. Instead a little towards the center of the stoke, there is a hard surface where you can reach the fingers and easily control the high beam. Many people have complained about the former scenario, and I think, using it this way is the best solution. The wiper controls are activated in the similar manner by turning the tip of the right stoke clockwise. The usual INT,LO and HIGH modes are there.\n\nWipers : The car comes with 27\" wiper blade on the diver side and 15\" on the passenger side. The stock wipers resemble the type of luxury cars and it provides a greater wipe over the screen. As I can recollect, the original blades lasted 3 years!. After which the rubber got torn and replaced using aftermarket ones. The aftermarket ones which cost around 450- 500 rs for a pair is only good enough for merely one rainy season. The OE one costs 900rs for a single one, but I bet it will last at least twice ass the aftermarket ones. Hence if you do the math, the cost almost remains the same.\n\nLights: The Reindeer headlamps give a unique and aggressive front look. The throw is adequate and we never had to align or change the bulbs for better performance. The turn indicators are placed on the edge near the grille. The all-black grille suits well to the persona of the rest of the car. The same goes for the black colored door handle and matte black ORVM mirror covers. These black themes match well with the black cladding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe door pads: Hard plastics nothing fancy around these bits.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment: A single DIN basic music system by Pioneer was fixed from the dealer. It had the direct OEM Coupler so that no wiring modification had to be done. This was one of part which were good in Baleno. We also bought JBL speakers for all the doors, the same got installed from the dealer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther cool features: The dashboard design still looks fresh to us. The combination of light gray soft material and black plastic theme really lights up the mood. The high mounted tilt meters and compass(High Terrain gauges) completes the design and provides a unique feel to the cabin and the car.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seat are a combination of leather and fabric. Personally, this colour scheme looks better than the one in top variant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rear seats can be folded with the two little levers on the back on both sies. Also the metal back plating on rear seats are visible when folded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boot: That's definitely one of the thing that sets apart Avventura. The designers added a new spare wheel mechanism that was similar to old M-class. The spare wheel is mounted on a high strength steel bar and is latched on to the tail gate. To access the boot, first press the boot release button on the dashboard/key fob, then the initial unlocking is done. Then you need to press the button on the spare wheel carrier and pull it outward until it reaches a lock-in position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the spare wheel mount will not move further. And the tail gate can be pulled upwards. People always complained about this 2 step operation but it never bothered us much. An addional backup for opening boot is provided on top of rear left wheel arch if the cable gets stuck.\n\n\n\nFiat introduced the Urban cross by removing this part, but personally this plays an important part in the car's character and sets it apart. It's been a few months since I got to be a part of this awesome community. Although I have been avidly following the forum for over a decade, I finally decided to send out my application last October. And since then I have been planning to pen down the experience with at least one of the cars we had in the stable. And finally, here it is. As every newbie mentions in their first post, I must request all my fellow bhp'ians to excuse any mistakes.So as the title indicates, this is a story of a wild Italian Horse we came across 8 years ago. And why start from #13 and not from #1? Well, even I was struggling with the same question. We were blessed to experience different cars beginning in 1998. The majority of them are pre-worshipped. And now we have reached the Number 20 milestone. But still, our beloved No.13 is with us. Since this car is still part of the family, I decided to start my writing with our beloved Avventura.Prelude:In 2015, we had a Tata Nano twist (2014 model) and a Toyota Corolla(2004) 1.8E. Well, the Corolla is one reliable model and built to last decades. My uncle bought a pre-owned one a year back and loved every bit of it. The idea to get one also got instantly approved by the family. I do not want to make this about the Corolla as I plan to write a separate post about it later. Long story short, the car had multiple issues and even after spending a decent amount of time-solving it, it did not feel complete, like something was missing. We had another Corolla to compare with hence this car was not getting up to the mark. So the itch for change started pretty soon afterwards.This is where my brother, dad, and I are at the happiest. Because the hunt for a new car is always interesting. Especially in the pre-owned market. Initially, you set a budget, then start with a couple of models, test drive some of them, and then out of the blue, new players come into the scene. In short, we love the car hunt part more than ever. But this time, Mom had a strict order we got to buy a new car!. Let's take a break from pre-owned ones and buy a new one. Well, can't blame her. Sometimes she hates the fact that some of the cars required frequent visits to the workshop. On the other hand, the three of us love it because there is a whole lot of possibility to learn more about your car. The basic drop and pick up for the regular service center of a new car does not provide a lot of information. But with a pre-worshipped car, you have endless possibilities. I learned about a lot of systems in the car due to this.Since Mom's decision was clear, everyone agreed to it. Pre-owned or new, the elevating fact is that we are getting a new car. We used to go for test drives at different car dealers whenever a new model was released. It was a basic short-duration drive without giving much attention to detail. But this time it kind of became a test drive to buy. The budget was set to be under 10 lakhs including the price we would get for Corolla. So the hunt begins!The hunt:Me and my brother have been calling this process \"The Hunt\" for a couple of years. He even takes his time every six months to prepare a presentation of available cars and shows them to my parents, even if we are not going to buy one. What if one of these cars in any of these presentations got approved, right?I don't remember the month exactly but, we began the test drive series ft'2015 with the newest Ford twin in town: Figo Aspire. Aspire was the first car of the test drive series. It had models within our budget. The interiors were nice, with adequate space inside. Steering was light and easy to maneuver. Compared with the Corolla it really felt smaller. We drove the petrol manual variant and it was okay. Being the first car in the test drives, it was kept on hold in the list:Ecosport:Ecosports base variants started at the higher end of our budget so we kind of put that on hold as well.Baleno:The new Baleno was launched around that time. It also marked the beginning of Nexa. Nexa showrooms were a class apart from others. The usual Maruthi showrooms were the worst because they would be least interested in selling. No test drive vehicles are available at any time. So we were skeptical when we went to check out the Baleno. Once we entered the showroom it all changed. It was days after the launch and there were a decent amount of people came to check out the car. They have nicely displayed different variants and colors, the staff were properly trained. The dealership experience was really good. On seeing the crowd we kind of concluded that it was impossible to get a test drive. Anyway, we just enquired about the test drive and the response was yes it can be done. We thought to wait for a while and leave. But in under 10 minutes, the test drive car was allotted and all of us hopped in. What a car. It sure was beautiful inside out. A lot of space inside. Three of us could easily sit on the back. It picks up speed pretty fast, easy to maneuver. Had ABS Airbag standard and Android auto/apple car play system. Except for the projector headlamps, all other features could be accessorized even from the base model. It was the petrol manual. Later on from one more Nexa showroom, we got to test drive all the variants viz., Diesel manual, petrol AMT, Petrol CVT. We kind of liked the car very much. But the major factor that drove us away from this was the waiting period. It was 8 months! We are definitely not that patient.Hyundai Elite i20/i20 Active :We test drove the i20 diesel with manual gearbox. It was pretty responsive. Its 6th gear ensured a relaxed cruising over 90 kmph. It was a well-behaved car. The i20 Activ the cross over version of the Elite i20 just looked like minor cosmetic changes to the standard i20 with higher premium. So basically did not feel an difference between the two. The driving experience of i20 was indeed good. But, here also the waiting period killed off the interest.Nissan Micra CVT: The smoothest CVT driving experience. Also, it was the first automatic I have driven. The car was good but we felt it was a bit overpriced for its price.Honda Jazz:The Jazz facelift was launched around that time. It came with 'magic seats' in the rear. Lots of space inside. The diesel variant offered high FE whereas the petrol CVt offered a nimble driving experience. The test drives were enjoyable but the rear seat thigh support felt shorter. The base variant of the city was also in the budget but we decided not to consider it.Mahindra KUV: Another new car in the market. It had attractive 3+3 seating with the front middle seat which could be folded as a chunky handrest. The joystick-like gear shifter was nice. Both the petrol and diesel variants were test-driven. The biggest drawback was the side profile(personal opinion.)Mahindra TUV: Also newly launched. Attractive since came with a diesel AMT version. The big car stance surely was a plus. But during the test drive, felt excessive body roll. Hence got ticked off.Tata Zest Quadrajet AMT: If my memory serves right, this was the first Diesel AMT combo introduced in India. Zest was the beginning of modern era TATA cars and was far ahead in interior quality and driving dynamics. The Quadrajet engine mated to AMT was a sweet combo as the engine had enough torque to match with the AMT box unlike the relatively low powered petrol engines. The only down side was that it neither had the hill hold nor the creep function. The car moves only if you press the accelerator, unlike the creep movement you get while releasing the brake pedal.Fiat comes into the picture again:Since we were visiting all the dealers for this crazy test drive spree, we did not leave out Fiat as well. So, when we called and enquired about a fiat dealership, they had a Linea classic on discount in comparison with the facelift one.One other dealer said they have a Punto EVO fully accessorized with Alloy wheels, a music system, racing decals, etc. Went to the dealer with the Linea offering first. Upon entering the showroom, the first thing we noticed was this Orange colored Avventura. I still remember the first time we saw the advertisement on TV. The one with the \"Empire of the Sun song: Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive \", song in the background. The ad was really attractive and tried to establish the character of the car well. This was the first time we came up close and personal with one. So walked over opened the driver's door on sat on the driver's seat. The beautiful and unconventional dashboard, Plush steering wheel, attractive analogue meter console, and .cramped space around the pedals!. That was a shock. The pedals seemed little and the deadpedal looked like it was ready to resist your left foot when trying to depress the clutch pedal. Well it sure looked like a set back compared with the Palio. And on opening the rear door, also felt the space was not that much available as compared with the size of the car. So, yeah we closed the doors and climbed the stairs to the top to see Linea thinking this ain't our cup of tea. Who knew we would end up with the same car days later? The Linea is a beautiful car. But its sheer length was the number one factor that prevented us from considering it. Another thing was the limiting headroom in the rear. I am 6 ft tall and when I am not driving, I would sit in the back. Usually in all cars, I sit behind Mom so that she can push her seat to the front. But still, the roof liner would touch my head so decided to skip Linea. Did not take the test drive and left.Enter Avventura: Life always has some interesting twists and turns that completely break your plan and present a new path that you have not even considered before. After the visit to the first Fiat dealer, we decided to go and check out the one that had the kitted Punto EVO. It was a small dealer since its main office was in another district and this one is just a franchise of the former. The car of interest was parked inside the building. Punto was always a good-looking hatch. And it sure looked better than Palio. For test drive, they said they had parked an Avventura in their yard (erstwhile their front parking) and since basically Avventura is a beefed-up Punto, we said why not.The first drive: Dad took the wheel first. Mom, brother and me sat on the rear seat. The space seemed all right as we travelled. As the car moved, we felt that dad was driving slow. But as I looked to the speedometer it was moving well beyond 60 kmph. This sense of speed masking was really impressive and it was completely opposite to other cars especially if you compare with Baleno. And there was no body roll. The initial passenger experience was good. Then it was my turn to drive. The clutch pedal was light but it had long travel compared to previous cars. The steering had the appropriate size and thickness with nice contours to hold. Depressed the clutch, slotted the gear into first, released the clutch and , the car just jumped forward. I did release the pedal hastily as in the case of short throw clutch pedals. The torque was not properly balanced and the car moved forward like an untamed horse. So unlike the other test drives, it felt short of enjoying the drive. The physical appearance of Avventura was really noticeable compared to normal Punto and since we drove one, thought of considering it as well. The drive was soon over and we returned home. So, we had Tata ZEST AMT, Suzuki Baleno and a Fiat Punto/Avventura as finalists. All the variants considered was in the same price range and now it was deep research time. The earlier test drive reports came in various mediums and of course, tem bhp reviews were one of the most top preferred one. Next factor was the exchange value for the Corolla. We were getting pretty low values from most of the dealers. Usually listing on olx would be a nice way to bag a better deal, but that would some time take more time for a deal to happen so we decided to exchange with whichever car we are buying.The decision: For the final decision, we thought of going for a final test drive of these finalists. At the same time, as I was reading more reviews, I got more interested in Avventura. It was not like other cladding added cross overs like Etios liva cross or Polo cross. There was a completely new suspension setup compared to Punto, the increased ground clearance of 205mm, The unique spare wheel mechanism, the tilt meters and compass to the centre console completely gave it an appealing factor. And in one of the review, some one mentioned how to slowly and smoothly release the clutch pedal on first gear so as to balance the torque and for a smooth pick up. So this time I was prepared to drive properly. Perhaps this was the one thing that had different with most of the other cars. We can drive any car in any way we ant. But each car has an optimum way in which it can offer its supreme performance, comfort and efficiency. So with proper planning, this test drive was really enjoyable. With the proper gearshift manners, the car moved effortlessly and behaved like a tamed horse this time. And the drive did put a smile on our faces. The time for the final decision came. The exchange offers were lower from Tata and MS. The Fiat already had lower sales so for competitive edge, they offered best exchange prices. But apart from that we really got connected to the car in each test drives. Like their variant name \"Emotion\", the car really felt like it has emotion. Now the variant selection. Avventura came with all wheels including the spare wheel as full sized Alloys. And all of them had the tilt meters and compass in the center console. The higher variants had ABS, 2 airbags, rear wiper, auto AC, built in music system, front foglamps, 60:40 split rear seats, and a slightly larger center info display screen. Most of these features are coming as basic in majority of the cars nowadays. But with the price point, we felt the base variant itself was totally value for money. Even the braking felt superb like ABS equipped cars so it did not bother much. (Touchwood, even after 8 years, the car never made us nervous during breaking under several critical conditions). So it was decided: Avventura Active 1.3 Multijet in Exotica Red colour. The car got launched in the Orange colour, but it looked beautiful in the red colour personally. And the Adventure begins..Delivery : The dealer was located around 30 kms away from our home. Our Corolla was already taken away by the sales team to initiate the down payment and delivery process. Initially we thought of catching a bus, then I told that we could take the Nano and during return, I will drive the Nano. Well eventually everyone agreed and we took the Nano. The car was all prepped up and ready to welcome us in front of the dealer.The mandatory key handover, sweet box, etc took place. Clicked some pictures. Yeah, we all wore red to match with the car!Now time for heading home with the newest member of the family. My brother insisted on coming with me to keep me company but I insisted back so that he could go in the new car. Finally, he agreed. So, Dad, Mom and bro drove away in the Avventura while I tailed them in the Nano. The rear tail lamps had an attractive LED park lamp which still looks better than the present cars. Even though I missed out the first drive, I sure was enjoying seeing the car being driven in front. After all its coming home!Features:Engine : The national engine of India 1.3 Multijet Diesel.

            "content": "Asian stock are trading mostly lower on Friday, following the broadly negative cues from Wall Street overnight, with markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Indonesia tumbling as traders react to US President Donald Trump's confirmation that tariffs on Mexico and Canada would proceed next week, along with an additional 10 percent tariff on China. Asian markets ended mixed on Thursday.\n\nTrump clarified that previously paused 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4. He said an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from China will also be imposed on that date, on top of the 10% tariff also introduced earlier this month.\n\nHe claimed drugs are pouring into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada and that a large percentage of these drugs are supplied by China.\n\nThe president also said in a Truth Social post that the April 2 date for reciprocal tariffs on other U.S. trade partners will \"remain in full force and effect.\"\n\nThe Australian stock market is significantly lower on Friday, reversing the gains in the previous session, following the broadly negative cues from Wall Street overnight.

That was shy of expectations for a decline of 1.0 percent following the 0.2 percent loss in December. On a yearly basis, industrial production was up 2.6 percent.\n\nThe METI also said that the value of retail sales in Japan was up a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent on month in January, coming in at 13.623 billion yen.

The German DAX Index slumped by 1.1 percent and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.5 percent, although the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index bucked the downtrend and increased by 0.3 percent.\n\nCrude oil prices climbed higher on Thursday as the U.S. decision to revoke Chevron Corporation's license to operate in Venezuela raised supply concerns. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for April closed higher by $1.73 or 2.52 percent at $70.35 a barrel.\n\nby RTTNews Staff Writer\n\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com",

            "content": "It will be interesting to see if it comes with a body-on-frame layout or a monocoque.\n\nThe G-Class is one of the icons of Mercedes-Benz's history and is still going strong to this day. The boxy stance and distinct character are loved by enthusiasts the world over, and it is still a hot seller for the brand. There have also been limited production run variants like the Maybach G650 Landaulet, 4x4 Squared, and 6x6. These have all sold out in a short period.\n\nMercedes is now working on a smaller and more affordable version of the G-Class. It will be part of the manufacturer\u2019s biggest product launch offensive, which was announced recently. In a new teaser, the g (written in lowercase) appears to be covered up at the bottom of the G-Class pyramid. Mercedes had also shown a design sketch of a \u2018little G\u2019 in September 2023 at the IAA Munich show. During the event, CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius called it the \"son or daughter of the iconic Big G.\"\n\nMercedes has not revealed much about the little G-Class and it remains to be seen how much it will share with its bigger sibling. It will be interesting to see if it comes with a body-on-frame layout or a monocoque. But there is no doubt that it will excel in off-roading. Size-wise, it could be similar to the Suzuki Jimny and could come in three and five-door versions.\n\nTwo years ago, the German business paper Handelsblatt reported that the little G-Class would share mechanical similarities with the next-gen CLA that will break cover shortly. If this is true, the baby G could get a plug-in hybrid with a 1.5 litre four-cylinder petrol engine. An EV version can also be expected.\n\nConsidering how popular the G-Class is in India, especially with G63, this 'little g' will surely be a hit with buyers here.\n\nOther models lined up as part of the three-pointed star\u2019s product offensive include electric versions of the GLC, C-Class and E-Class. The S-Class is also getting a major refresh for 2026.\n\nSource: Motor1.com",

We were so impressed that we finalized our booking on the spot\n\nBHPian GearShiftGuru recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nHad an amazing experience checking out the Mahindra XEV 9e at Hare Krishna Mahindra with my family. The first thing that caught our attention was the stunning red avatar, which looked absolutely gorgeous in person. I couldn\u2019t believe that Mahindra had crafted such a stunning and well-designed vehicle. We spent some time exploring the exterior, interior, boot space and frunk and I must say, the overall fit and finish were impressive. The seats were very comfortable and everything felt well put together.\n\nSince we're planning to move from diesel vehicle to an EV, I had been waiting for an SUV with a real-world range of 450-500 km, so I was quite excited to check this one out. The showroom was packed and it was clear that the XEV 9e and BE.6 were grabbing a lot of attention.\n\nWhen I asked the Sales Executive about a test drive, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they had four XEV 9e test drive vehicles available. After a short 15-minute wait, we got to test a 79kWh White XEV. The ride quality was simply amazing and super quiet, smooth and effortless compared to my Innova Crysta 2.8 ZX. The ADAS system was responsive, the moon-roof was a visual treat and the sound system was on another level, it felt like sitting in a studio. My family loved the rear seat comfort and thigh support and the AC was efficient even with total 5 passengers.\n\nWe were so impressed that we finalized our booking on the spot. Since range was my biggest concern, I requested a long test drive on a weekday and the sales executive was happy to arrange it.\n\nThis time, we got a Forest Green XEV. We reset all the trip meters before starting and the battery was at 95%. The sales executive walked us through all the features on the touchscreen and everything worked flawlessly. Once we were done checking out the tech, we set the AC to 24\u00b0C, switched to Range Mode and hit the road.\n\nFirst, we drove about 7-8 km through city traffic, with regen level set to 2. After covering 2 km, the battery dropped from 95% to 94%, so I started calculations from 94%. The regen worked beautifully, making city driving smooth and efficient.\n\nThen, we hit the highway. There was some moving traffic, but I could maintain a steady speed of 60-70 km/h. The ADAS system kept the car in lane and the blindspot indicators worked perfectly. We drove a total of 23.3 km, with the battery dropping from 95% to 91%. For accurate calculations, I took 21.3 km from 94% to 91%, which means the XEV covered 21.3 km in about 4% battery. That translates to a real-world range of over 520 km, with an efficiency of 11.7 km/kWh. I know it is a very short distance to prove the range but atleast it was satisfying.\n\nThis test gave me huge confidence that we made the right choice. Mahindra has absolutely nailed it with the XEV 9e. Hats off to them for delivering such an impressive futuristic EV.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

The company is also a prominent producer in Chile through its Escondida and Pampa Norte operations.\n\nThe company\u2019s Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) business boasts 30 billion tonnes of iron ore, with 95 per cent of that within 50km of existing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThat allows us to use fewer processing hubs than our competitors, which simplifies operations and lowers sustaining capital requirements,\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in us being the world\u2019s lowest cost major iron ore producer for a fifth year in a row.\n\n\u201cOur combination of low capital intensity and superior cost performance results in better free cash flow generation for every tonne we produce.\u201d\n\nBHP is increasing its focus on copper in new jurisdictions, including through the new Vicu\u00f1a joint venture (JV) with Lundin Mining in Argentina. Henry said Vicu\u00f1a could become one of the top 10 copper producers globally through the Filo del Sol and Josemaria projects.\n\nHenry highlighted BHP\u2019s cash generative capacity, with the company delivering a net operating cash flow of $8 billion in the first half of the 2024\u201325 financial year.\n\n\u201cOn a run-rate basis, we\u2019ve generated more than $15 billion per year in all bar one of the past 15 years,\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cThe resources industry is of course cyclical, so this stability in our cash flows is a significant differentiator for BHP.\n\n\u201cIt highlights the enduring quality of our portfolio, and how our focus on operational excellence supports our ability to consistently deliver strong financial performance.\u201d\n\nWith strong financials, expansion in key minerals, and continued focus on sustainability, BHP remains positioned for long-term growth.",

            "content": "The Celica is expected to use the same G20E engine but mounted up front and feature four-wheel drive.\n\nToyota is all set to launch a big assault in the sports car market by reviving the iconic MR2 and Celica nameplates. These names send a tingle down the spine of every car enthusiast, Additionally, the carmaker is also working on a flagship model under its Lexus arm, the successor to the mega LFA supercar.\n\nThe new models will fill the gaps left by the GR Supra, which is at the end of its production lifecycle, and the GR86, which is no longer on sale in Europe due to EU safety regulations.\n\nThe Celica and MR2 are expected to be powered by a new turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine. Codenamed the G20E, reports say the motor can put out 400 BHP in the road-going spec and 600 BHP in motorsport applications. The G20E engine made its public debut in a heavily modified GR Yaris, called the M Concept, where it was mounted not upfront but behind the rear seats.\n\nSpeaking about the M concept at the Tokyo Auto Salon, Tomoya Takahashi, president of the GR (Gazoo Racing) division, said the company would \u201cfind a place to introduce it\u201d. The new MR2 could be the production version because of its mid-engine layout. The new MR2 could arrive in production form in 2028, but Toyota could introduce it earlier due to upcoming restrictions on the sale of pure-petrol cars in key markets such as the UK.\n\nThe Celica is expected to use the same G20E engine but mounted up front and feature four-wheel drive. Japanese publication Best Car has said that the GT-Four name that was used for homologation of special versions of the Celica for the World Rally Championship in the 1980s and 1990s could be revived. This hints to the Celica returning to the World Rally Championship as well.\n\nComing to the Lexus, it will be powered by a full-blown V8 engine with two turbochargers. It is likely to develop 500-600 BHP in racing applications and weigh not more than 1300 kg. The road car is expected to come with some hybrid tech. Autocar\u2019s spy photographers have reported that prototypes that have been spotted move ahead silently from a standstill with the engine firing up a few metres later. The car has been spotted in race and road-going trim at circuits like Spa-Francorchamps and the N\u00fcrburgring and should be ready by 2026.\n\nNo name has been finalized but Lexus has trademarked \u2018LFR\u2019 which by default hints that the new car will be positioned as an LFA successor.\n\nSource: Autocar UK",

            "content": "BHP (ASX:BHP) is positioning itself for a significant shift in its operations, transitioning from a focus on iron ore to copper as the demand for the metal continues to rise due to the global energy transition. The company, which previously derived up to 85 percent of its earnings from iron ore, is now shifting its capital expenditure strategy, planning to allocate roughly half of its budget to copper projects in the coming years.\n\nDespite this strategic pivot, finding high-quality copper deposits remains a challenge. Many promising deposits are located in jurisdictions that present operational and reputational risks. Unlike its competitors, BHP has historically maintained a conservative approach, avoiding riskier locations where political instability, regulatory uncertainty, and governance issues are prevalent. Companies like Glencore and Rio Tinto have engaged in projects in countries such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while BHP has focused its investments in more stable regions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States.\n\nBHP\u2019s cautious approach was evident in its failed $79 billion bid for Anglo American in 2023, which was structured to exclude assets in South Africa. However, with major mergers and acquisitions in the mining sector gaining momentum, the company may need to reconsider its stance. Recent discussions between Glencore and Rio Tinto regarding a potential deal underscore the increasing consolidation in the industry. This trend raises the possibility of BHP pursuing a long-speculated acquisition of Freeport-McMoRan, the world\u2019s largest copper miner.\n\nA potential acquisition of Freeport-McMoRan would significantly bolster BHP\u2019s copper production, doubling its output overnight and securing control of four of the five largest copper mines. Even with such an expansion, the combined entity would hold less than 20 percent of the global copper supply, which is unlikely to raise antitrust concerns.\n\nDespite the strategic advantages, one of the main deterrents to acquiring Freeport-McMoRan has been governance concerns surrounding its largest asset, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Situated in a remote and politically sensitive region, Grasberg has historically been associated with security challenges, environmental controversies, and disputes over ownership. Mining waste management at the site has also drawn criticism, which could pose reputational risks for BHP, given its past environmental issues at the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea and the Samarco iron ore project in Brazil.\n\nHowever, recent developments have reduced some of these risks. In 2018, an agreement was reached between Freeport-McMoRan and the Indonesian government, granting a state-owned enterprise a majority stake in Grasberg. Additionally, incidents of separatist violence in the region have declined in recent years. Freeport-McMoRan has also made strides in improving its corporate governance and environmental practices. The company has been recognized by the World Benchmarking Alliance for its human rights performance, ranking higher than BHP in this area. In 2023, it received the Copper Mark certification, an industry standard for responsible copper production, including approval of its waste disposal methods.\n\nGiven the scarcity of high-quality copper assets, BHP may find that the opportunity to acquire a company like Freeport-McMoRan is a once-in-a-generation event. With the increasing demand for copper driven by the energy transition and major mining consolidation on the horizon, the conditions may be aligning for BHP to make a decisive move in securing its future in the copper industry.\n\nThe above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

The BE 6 for driving pleasure, and the 9e for comfort.\n\n- The engine power is too much too handle. If not gentle with the throttle, it literally feels like an aircraft taking off. I am seriously worried if these cars will increase road rage - especially the BE 6 pushes you to drive fast. The car definitely needs a mode below \"Range\", probably named as \"Responsible\" with lower speeds and acceleration.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "BHP is exploring AI and machine learning to boost copper recovery at Escondida. (Image courtesy of Microsoft | BHP.\n\nBHP (ASX: BHP) continues its global search for copper to meet soaring demand driven by the energy transition, but a shortage of high-quality deposits\u2014 particularly in stable jurisdictions \u2014remains a challenge.\n\nOver the past five years, the world\u2019s largest miner has shifted its focus. In 2020, iron ore dominated its earnings and investment, but today it accounts for less than a quarter. In contrast, copper now receives half of BHP\u2019s capital expenditure.\n\nA barrier for BHP is its cautious approach that favours stability over high-risk, high-reward ventures. Competitors such as Glencore (LON: GLEN) and Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) have embraced volatile regions\u2014Kazakhstan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mongolia, and Guinea. BHP instead has traditionally stuck to safer ground: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States. Even its failed $49 billion bid for Anglo American (LON: AAL) last year was carefully structured to exclude South African assets.\n\nThere are benefits to this caution, Bloomberg Opinion columnist David Fickling writes. Political instability poses operational and reputational risks. Rio Tinto\u2019s 28-year struggle with its Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea resulted in executive shake-ups and costly bribery settlements. Glencore has also faced challenges, paying over $1 billion in fines for bribery and market manipulation.\n\nYet, mineral-rich regions rarely align with political stability, compelling even BHP to step outside its usual comfort zone.\n\nLast year, it completed a $2 billion deal for a 50% stake in Argentina\u2019s Filo del Sol copper project alongside Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN). Argentina, long avoided by major miners due to its volatile political and legal environment, has become more attractive under libertarian President Javier Milei\u2019s pro-mining policies. Still, Argentina\u2019s track record of policy instability makes the investment a calculated risk.\n\nWith large-scale mergers and acquisitions reshaping the mining industry \u2014 Glencore and Rio Tinto reportedly discussed a potential blockbuster deal \u2014 the timing could be right for BHP to pursue a long-rumoured target: Freeport-McMoRan, the world\u2019s top copper producer.\n\nSuch a deal would immediately double BHP\u2019s copper output and secure control over four of the five largest copper mines. Even with such a deal, BHP\u2019s market share in global copper production would remain under 20%, staying within limits unlikely to trigger antitrust scrutiny.\n\nExpansions over acquisitions\n\nChief executive Mike Henry has expressed a preference for expanding existing operations rather than pursuing major acquisitions, particularly after the Anglo American bid fell through. Speaking at the BMO Global Metals, Mining & Critical Minerals Conference that kicked off on Sunday, he presented data arguing that organic growth offers better returns than takeovers.\n\nHenry highlighted the company\u2019s emphasis on growing and optimizing its Chilean assets. BHP is targeting annual production in Chile of 1.4 million tonnes per annum in the 2030s. The upgrades include a new concentrator at Escondida and the expansion of an existing concentrator, with total Chilean copper growth at a planned capex intensity of $23k/t.\n\nIts South Australia copper business, which combines Olympic Dam, Prominent Hill, Carrapateena, and the Oak Dam projects, has the potential to increase production towards 500,000-650,000 tonnes per annum from the mid-2030s.\n\n\u201cWhile attractive from a value accretion basis, organic production growth in copper will take a decade to come through given the long-term nature of copper mine developments,\u201d Maurizio Carulli, energy and materials analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that BHP would consider M&A opportunities in the future and given the company\u2019s size, it would likely be a predator rather than prey,\u201d Carulli noted.\n\nA key obstacle to a Freeport deal is the giant Grasberg copper-gold mine \u2014 Freeport\u2019s flagship and a historically problematic asset. The operation sits in a region that has seen separatist violence and security concerns.\n\nEnvironmental woes also pose a challenge. Grasberg\u2019s practice of dumping mine waste into nearby rivers is at odds with BHP\u2019s efforts to distance itself from past tailings disasters, such as those at Papua New Guinea\u2019s Ok Tedi mine and Brazil\u2019s Samarco iron ore project.\n\nGrasberg\u2019s risks have diminished in the past five years. A 2018 agreement between Freeport and the Indonesian government resulted in a state-owned entity taking a majority stake, reducing the likelihood of nationalization. Separatist violence in the mine\u2019s operational zone \u2014 an area slightly smaller than Canada\u2019s Ottawa \u2014 has significantly declined in recent years.\n\nFreeport has also improved its corporate reputation. It now ranks higher than BHP in the World Benchmarking Alliance\u2019s human rights index and earned the Copper Mark in 2023, an industry certification for responsibly sourced metal\u2014including Grasberg\u2019s waste management practices.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s greatest mineral deposits last for generations, but opportunities to acquire them are rare. For BHP, that moment may have arrived. Henry would do well to strike while the copper is hot,\u201d Fickling concluded.\n\n(With files from Bloomberg)",

Learn More\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) shares have had an interesting week.\n\nInvestors initially punished this ASX 200 mining share when it delivered its latest earnings on Tuesday, February 18.\n\nAs we covered at the time, although these earnings came in ahead of expectations, there were still some painful metrics to digest. For the six months to 31 December, BHP reported an 8% drop in revenues to US$25.2 billion and an 11% fall in underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to US$12.4 billion.\n\nThis prompted BHP to slash its interim dividend by 30.5% to 50 US cents per share.\n\nOn the day these earnings were announced, BHP shares tanked by 2.03%. Today, though, the miner's shares have clawed back some ground and remain down 0.98% compared to before these earnings were made public.\n\nBHP is now sitting on a year-to-date gain of 1.8% for 2025 so far. That's despite today's 1.4% loss (at the time of writing). The 'Big Australian' is also nursing a 7.45% loss over the past 12 months.\n\nBut more than one BHP insider seems to think the current BHP share price represents a big buying opportunity.\n\nBHP insiders snap up shares\n\nAccording to three separate ASX filings, no fewer than three BHP insiders have been buying up shares following the miner's earnings announcement.\n\nFirst up is BHP director and board member Christine O'Reilly. On 19 February, O'Reilly indirectly bought 1,200 BHP shares through a superannuation fund for $41.03 per share, for a total purchase value of $29,236. This purchase, the first O'Reilly has made since 2021, brings her position up to 10,200 shares.\n\nNext up we have BHP board member and director Dion Weisler. A filing shows that Weisler bought up 2,500 BHP shares for an average price of $40.48 on 19 February as well. That gives this buy a value of $101,197.75. As with O'Reilly, this was also an indirect purchase, made through a private investment entity.\n\nThis takes Weisler's total position in BHP to 10,044 shares.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we have BHP's new chair, Ross McEwan, to discuss. An ASX filing reveals that McEwan bought 25,000 BHP shares on 18 February for an average cost of $40.53 per share, or $1,013,250 in total. Again, this was an indirect purchase.\n\nIt brings McEwan's total position in BHP up to 35,000 shares.\n\nFoolish takeaway\n\nIt is significant that two of these BHP insiders have bought up shares for the first time since 2021. With the miner now around 20% cheaper than it was at its last all-time high of over $50 a share in late 2023, perhaps these management figures are seeing value.\n\nBut only time will tell whether these buys have been made at opportune levels.",

Learn More\n\nIt was another busy week for Australia's top brokers. This has led to the release of a number of broker notes.\n\nThree broker buy ratings that you might want to know more about are summarised below. Here's why brokers think these ASX shares are in the buy zone:\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)\n\nAccording to a note out of Goldman Sachs, its analysts have retained their buy rating on this mining giant's shares with a slightly improved price target of $47.40. This follows the release of a half year result that was in-line with expectations last week. Goldman Sachs notes that it was particularly pleased with the performance of BHP's copper operations, which delivered EBITDA ~6% above expectations. This was thanks partly to a cost beat at Escondida, Spence and South Australia. In light of this solid first half, the broker remains very positive on BHP and sees value in its shares at current levels. It highlights that they are currently trading at ~0.8x NAV and ~6x forward EBITDA, which are comfortably below 25-year averages. The BHP share price ended the week at $41.26.\n\nPilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS)\n\nA note out of Bell Potter reveals that its analysts have retained their buy rating and $3.00 price target on this lithium miner's shares. This follows the release of Pilbara Minerals' half year results last week. Bell Potter points out that the company revealed a sizeable cash burn during the six months due to weak lithium prices and significant capex. However, it believes this is the peak of the current capex cycle for its large-scale approved development pipeline. As a result, it believes the company will return to positive free cash flow generation in FY 2026. Particularly given its belief that potential supply shortfalls could boost lithium prices in the near future. The Pilbara Minerals share price was fetching $2.08 at Friday's close.\n\nTemple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX: TPW)\n\nAnalysts at Citi have retained their buy rating on this online furniture and homewares retailer's shares with an increased price target of $21.10. According to the note, Citi was impressed with Temple & Webster's performance during the first half of FY 2025 and believes there's more to come. This is especially the case given that its margin guidance provides room to accelerate marketing efforts that could arise from improving consumer sentiment from interest rates cuts. In addition, Citi is feeling confident that operating leverage and AI-driven consumer interaction can support margin expansion over the long term, leaving it well placed to achieve its medium term EBITDA margin target of 15%. The Temple & Webster share price ended the week at $17.96.",

The reason for this is the adoption of a new platform developed by the BMW Group.

            "content": "This project may seem like a very simple and easy task to carry out, but finding the right part that would fit the HyCross was an Herculean task!!\n\nBHPian CEF_Beasts recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nQuote from BHPian CEF_Beasts:\n\nIlluminated Power Window Switches Will source the Camry parts from a TASC next time I\u2019m in Mumbai, to fit in the HyCross, if they do agree to let me buy them.\n\nUPDATE TIME - Illuminated Power Window Switches\n\nIf many will remember I had mentioned in my ownership review while publishing last year that I wanted to source the Illuminated Master Window Switches from the Camry for the HyCross, it would\u2019ve been a direct fit and I would be sourcing the parts from a TASC.\n\nCan\u2019t believe I could\u2019ve been so wrong!!\n\nToyota is no VAG in India, where there are multiple folks running businesses selling VAG parts for the cars sold in India and making huge profits.\n\nThis project may seem like a very simple and easy task to carry out, but finding the right part that would fit the HyCross was an Herculean task!!\n\nToyota Globally hasn\u2019t made it any simpler, they have multiple permutations and combinations of these switches for their line-up of cars. Also post Nov/Dec 2022 Toyota globally shifted from cool blue backlit buttons to white buttons for all their cars, which made matters even more difficult.\n\nLike I mentioned I would be getting the Post-Facelift Camry Master Window Switches from a TASC in Mumbai, I got a contact through a Fortuner Owner of the Parts Manager at Lakozy, called him and mentioned I need the master window switch panel of the Camry, to which he mentioned there are 7 different part numbers and he can\u2019t confirm if it\u2019ll work with the HyCross or not. But then I started seeing more night time videos of the Camry in India to understand if I was correct and realised all the buttons were backlit in blue.\n\nI was back on the drawing board!\n\nI had given up on the project, but then suddenly something inside me woke up and I was back in action again.\n\nThere are many sellers on AliExpress and a website called CarTrimsHome that sell these white backlit Master Window Switches but all are for LHD Toyota models.\n\nThis LHD and RHD orientation with Blue and White Backlit buttons would\u2019ve driven anyone nuts! The difference in the LHD and RHD master switch panel is that the placement of the lock/unlock button and window lock button is reversed, also if you install the LHD panel in a RHD car, the driver window switch will open the passenger window and passenger window switch on the master window panel will open the driver\u2019s window.\n\nThen I started my search exclusively in RHD markets like the UK, Australia and Japan. UK had them available but all were Blue Backlit buttons from cars like the Corolla, Australia I could find no conclusive part numbers, their parts websites would lead me no where. Then came Japan the home country of Toyota and this is where I came across a website called amayama.com where for multiple brands proper detailed parts list with diagrams was available.\n\nThe first car I started with was the Camry, but the 2025 Camry which has all buttons backlit in White didn\u2019t have its parts list ready yet anywhere in the world, so this was out. The same was mentioned to me by the Lakozy Parts Manager as well.\n\nNext came up the Corolla Cross available in Japan, I zeroed in on a part no. 84040-30330, but had no clarity whether the part was backlit in White or Blue. This part was shortlisted though.\n\nCars like the Land Cruiser Prado and Grand Highlander get a different design of master window switches, so that was anyways out.\n\nNext car I saw was the newly launched Toyota Crown, first saw a few videos of the car in the LHD markets and confirmed all buttons were illuminated in White. Then saw a few videos of the car in the Japanese market and could just make out that the buttons were backlit in white.\n\nOn amayama.com the Master Window Switch panel for a RHD Crown had the part no. 84040-42150, which if entered on Google would lead me to RAV4s. What I still needed was a confirmation though. I don\u2019t know how but I got led to a Japanese Forum called Minkara.carview.co.jp which had multiple people share pictures of this Part No. and the night time picture showed White Backlit Buttons\n\nThat was it, I was sure this is the part I needed, but still needed to figure out how to source it. First I asked the Owner of a Toyota Dealership down south, if this part is available with them or not, he was very amused to find out that I needed such an upgrade on an Innova and my attention on detail for such things, considering a regular Joe won\u2019t care about such a small thing . I sent him the part no. and he mentioned it isn\u2019t available in India since it belongs to a RAV4.\n\nOn amayama.com Part No. 84040-30330 was available for around 190 AUD including shipping, but 84040-42150 wasn\u2019t available.\n\nThe Japanese Corolla Cross video, where the person has changed his Master Window Switches Panel to Part No. 84040-42150 which belongs to a Toyota RAV-4 https://youtu.be/UMfe3uC6mPA?feature=shared\n\nIn the comment section of this video, after translating to English, I found out that someone with a Corolla Cross in Japan has changed to Part No.: 84040-30330 as well and both will work with the HyCross as well!\n\nI shared my predicament with my friend, from Gurgaon, who is more like a brother now, who recently got his 2nd HyCross after his first HyCross was lost in a fire. He found out a website in Japan called YoshiParts.com having stock of the Part No. 84040-42150 we wanted. He ordered it first for his car since it was a gamble we were playing on, just in case the part doesn\u2019t come out right. It costed around ~13-14k INR including shipping.\n\nSo Ladies and Gentlemen, I present you India\u2019s First HyCross (my friend\u2019s) with OEM Toyota Japan Illuminated Master Window Switches! Will be carrying out the same on my car soon.\n\nThe Panel which houses the Master Window Switches is very easy to open. There are two couplers inside, a small one for the Electric Mirror Adjuster and Electric Window Fold/Unfold. The 2nd Large coupler is for the Master Window Switches, Lock/Unlock Button and Window Lock Button, it has a 20-pin setup which fits inside the coupler.\n\nThe Master Window Switches, Lock/Unlock Button and Window Lock Button panel is held by 3 screws which need to be removed after unplugging the coupler to remove this panel and replace it with your new 84040-42150 Panel. Follow the same procedure of putting back the 3 screws, both the couplers and you\u2019re good to go! A net-net 10-15 Minutes job\u2026 Just remember to tighten the screws too much since at the end of the day they\u2019re holding plastic which will start creaking and groaning in no time if tightened too much.\n\nThe Stock OEM Part No is 84040-VT010 in case anyone wants to get the stock one.\n\n\n\nThe Part 84040-42150 shipped by YoshiParts from Toyota Japan\n\n\n\nThe Master Window Switches Panel in flesh\n\n\n\nThe 2 Couplers I mentioned earlier, the smaller one for the Mirror Adjustment & Auto Fold/Unfold and the larger 20 Pin one for the Power Window Switches, Lock/Unlock and Window Lock Button\n\n\n\nThe 3 screws that need to be removed to change the panel with the new one\n\n\n\nOn the Left; Part No: 84040-42150 which has all buttons illuminated in White with Chrome Tips, meanwhile On the Right; the Stock part with only the Driver Window Switches illuminated in White\n\n\n\nPart No.: 84040-42150 Installed side-by-side with the cheap stock one\n\n\n\nPart No.: 84040-42150\n\n\n\nThe Stock Master Window Switches Panel that comes with the HyCross from Factory; Part No: 84040-VT010\n\nThe Next Update will be for the other Individual Window Switches on the Passenger Doors along with some night time pictures.\n\nAnd heartfelt gratitude to my friend without whom executing this task would\u2019ve not been possible!!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAfrican Rainbow Minerals Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Non-Executive Director, Jan Steenkamp, sold R3.9m worth of shares at a price of R195 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is R162. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Jan Steenkamp was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.\n\nThe chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of African Rainbow Minerals\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that African Rainbow Minerals insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about R221m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The African Rainbow Minerals Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded African Rainbow Minerals shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of African Rainbow Minerals, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Built on a revolutionary Topological Core architecture, this chip harnesses topoconductors - a material capable of stabilising and controlling Majorana particles. Quote: Quantum computing is a new way of processing information using the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike regular computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time due to superposition. Quote: They also use entanglement, where qubits are linked and affect each other instantly, making calculations much faster. This allows quantum computers to solve complex problems in minutes that would take traditional computers years. They have potential in areas like cybersecurity, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nQuote: Majorana 1 is the world's first quantum chip using Topological Core architecture. It introduces topoconductors, a new class of materials that can observe and control Majorana particles - exotic quantum particles that allow for stable and error-resistant quantum operations. Microsoft compares this advancement to the invention of semiconductors, which paved the way for modern electronics. Quote: Microsoft's approach aims to build quantum computers with a million qubits - a threshold necessary for solving real-world industrial and scientific challenges. Current supercomputers, even if combined, cannot perform the calculations that a one-million-qubit quantum computer could. Quote: \"We took a step back and said 'OK, let's invent the transistor for the quantum age. What properties does it need to have?'\" said Chetan Nayak, Microsoft technical fellow. \"And that's really how we got here - it's the particular combination, the quality and the important details in our new materials stack that have enabled a new kind of qubit and ultimately our entire architecture.\n\n\n\nQuote: Quantum computers operate using qubits, which can process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. This shift could bring breakthroughs in multiple fields:\n\n\n\nHealthcare and Medicine: Quantum computing can help design new drugs by simulating molecular interactions, leading to faster cures for diseases and better-personalised treatments.\n\nEnvironment and Sustainability: It could create self-healing materials for infrastructure, reducing the need for repairs. It could also help develop new catalysts to break down plastic waste and combat pollution.\n\nAgriculture and Food Security: Quantum simulations of enzyme behaviours could lead to improved fertilisers, helping farmers increase crop yields and fight global hunger.\n\nEngineering and Manufacturing: Companies could design materials perfectly from the start, eliminating years of trial and error in product development. Quote: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he believes \"this breakthrough\" will allow them to create a \"truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years\". \"This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe. It's not about hyping tech; it's about building technology that truly serves the world,\" he said. What experts say\n\n\n\nQuote: While the latest quantum computing breakthrough has generated excitement, experts told the BBC that more data is needed to fully assess its impact. The significance of the research - and its potential effect on quantum computing - remains uncertain.\n\n\n\nQuote: Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said in January that \"useful\" quantum computing was still 20 years away. Quote: Mr Nayak suggests the new advancements could challenge traditional timelines. \"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\" Quote: Travis Humble, director of the Quantum Science Centre at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, acknowledged Microsoft's progress but pointed to the need for further development. \"The long-term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\nImage 1, Image 2, Image 3 Still, the reach to the masses might take some time. But, now we know the direction to head and again it is thanks to Microsoft. Will it replicate the success of Windows Software in this era? Is this the next level in AI computing and operating systems? Share your thoughts below.",

            "content": "The engine's versatility shines on the open roads. 100 km/h in sixth gear comes at a relaxed 5,000 rpm and the Tuono 457 can cruise at these speeds all day long\n\nLike most of the motorcycle, the engine is also a straight lift from the RS 457. The 457cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin puts out 47 BHP @ 9,400 rpm and 43.5 Nm @ 6,700 rpm, making it the most powerful and torquiest engine in its class. The only difference here is the shorter final drive, courtesy of one extra tooth on the rear sprocket.\n\nThe highlight of the powertrain is its strong low-end performance. Almost 80 percent of the peak torque kicks in at 3,000 rpm and the motor continues to pull cleanly to 9,000 rpm. Thanks to the shorter gearing, the Tuono 457 is quick to shoot off the line. The other advantage of having strong low-end performance is tractability. To test how good it is, I completely rolled off the throttle before a steep hairpin, let speeds go as low as 7-8 km/h in second gear and yet the engine would pull ahead without an ounce of resistance. Out on the open roads, the engine pulls cleanly from as low as 50 km/h in sixth gear. While we didn't get to ride it in city conditions, it is safe to assume that the motorcycle can easily chug around in third gear all day long.\n\nThe three riding modes alter the throttle response. Eco mode offers a soft response that is well suited for city conditions and relaxed touring on open roads. Sport mode spices things up with a significantly sharper throttle response. It seems like Aprilia wants you to use this mode the most given the motorcycle starts in Sport mode by default. But, be careful with your throttle input, especially when getting out of corners, or the rush of torque can catch you by surprise. Rain mode is best reserved for when the road conditions are wet.\n\nThe engine's versatility shines on the open roads. 100 km/h in sixth gear comes at a relaxed 5,000 rpm and the Tuono 457 can cruise at these speeds all day long. Also, there is more than enough power in reserve to make a quick overtake. The clutch is light to operate and gearshifts are precise for the most part. Given the overall characteristic of the motorcycle, emptying your wallet a little more for the quickshifter wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\nThe Tuono 457's engine is rev-friendly, but the motor is happier in the mid-range than it is closer to its 10,500 rpm redline. Redlining the Tuono 457 doesn't feel as rewarding as its Austrian or Japanese rivals.\n\nRefinement & NVH\n\nThe Tuono 457 remains smooth and vibe-free throughout its rev range, except near its redline. A slight buzz kicks in through the pegs post 8,500 rpm; nothing that would make it a dealbreaker. The 270-degree crank gives the Aprilia a characterful exhaust note. It sure grabs a lot of attention. That being said, the subtle pops and bangs of the Yamaha MT-03's exhaust sounded more pleasing to my ears. That's just personal preference, though.\n\nSuspension & Handling\n\nThe suspension hardware on the Tuono 457 is the same as the RS 457, with 41 mm USD and a mono-shock. Given the upright sitting posture, there is now more weight towards the rear. Hence, the rear suspension of the Tuono 457 gets a slightly softer setup compared to its faired sibling. The suspension travel remains the same with 120 mm and 130 mm travel at the front and back, respectively. Our test route mostly comprised of good quality roads, hence it is difficult to comment on the ride comfort over bad roads.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that there is no compromise on the handling front. The wider handlebar helps make quick direction changes in corners and the motorcycle remains stable at lean angles. The Tuono 457, just like the RS 457 is forgiving and amateur friendly. At the same time, it can be quite a fun tool in the hands of an experienced rider.\n\nBraking\n\nBraking hardware on the Tuono 457 is supplied by ByBre, Brembo's budget brand, and comprises a 320 mm front disc and 220 mm rear disc. The initial bite and stopping power from the brakes is fairly strong. There were multiple reports of the front brake fading on the RS 457 after 3-4 laps at the Kari Motor Speedway during the first rides last year. The issue is difficult to replicate on normal driving roads, and we didn't face any during our time with the motorcycle. However, the overall performance of the brakes is average at best. They could've been better in terms of bite force and progressive feedback.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nIn our brief interaction with the Aprilia Tuono 457, it impressed us on multiple fronts. It is essentially the RS 457 in a more comfortable package; one that can be used for the daily commute, long-distance touring and spirited riding in the hills. The cherry on the top is that it is Rs. 25,000 cheaper than its faired sibling. That being said, its primary competitors boast a strong price advantage, so it's a tough pick in this segment.\n\nContinue reading the discussion of the Aprilia Tuono 457 on our forum.",

The miner\u2019s projects typically \u201cenhance the value of our business by reducing our exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices and higher carbon penalty costs,\u201d he added.\n\nHis comments come as firms from Walmart Inc. to the Coca-Cola Co. defer or abandon climate and environmental ambitions, arguing policy settings and slow advances in technology are making planned emissions cuts unfeasible. Clients and suppliers \u201chave faced some challenges\u201d in decarbonizing their operations, HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s CEO Georges Elhedery said on Wednesday as the bank delayed some of its green targets.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not straightforward,\u201d Rio\u2019s Stausholm said in the report. \u201cWe need to navigate a complex, rapidly evolving regulatory landscape \u2014 but we are making progress and maintaining financial discipline.\u201d\n\nStausholm outlined the producer\u2019s annual earnings on Wednesday during a visit to Washington to meet with US legislators and others to better understand the Trump administration\u2019s policy plans, which have included a sharp retreat from a global leadership role on climate action.\n\nThe miner\u2019s gross scope one and two \u2014 or direct \u2014 emissions fell in 2024 and are on track to meet a target to cut pollution by 15% from 2018 levels by this year. Scope 3 emissions, the majority of which are tied to customers processing the firm\u2019s iron ore, bauxite and alumina, rose slightly.\n\nRio\u2019s spending on decarbonization activities rose to $589 million last year from $425 million in 2023, it said in the report.\n\nRival BHP Group, the world\u2019s largest miner, last week reported a decline in operational emissions in the six months to Dec. 31 from the same period a year earlier.\n\nPhotograph: Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm; photo credit: Victor J.

            "content": "Iceland is a stunning and amazing country full of natural wonders . We saw many tourists, especially on the south coast around the Golden Circle.\n\nBHPian gk_Bng recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nWhy Iceland?\n\nIceland is often called the \u201cLand of Fire and Ice\u201d , is one of the sparsely populated country with approximately 3,70,000 inhabitants and is a nature\u2019s paradise. One can explore the hot springs, glaciers , lava fields , water falls , fjords . As we heard of the Volcano eruptions late December 2023 close to Reykjavik Airport , we were skeptical if we should commit for travel or postpone.. at the same excited if we could watch a rare live Lava eruptions .\n\nWith a largely un-spoilt and exquisite landscape, it's no wonder that it has inspired travellers and photographers from around the world.\n\nAfter our epic drive across Norway in 2023, Iceland was the next logical option to explore !\n\nLink to the Norway Travelogue:\n\nhttps://www.team-bhp.com/forum/trave...th-norway.html\n\nWe believed we could also take some of those pictures which often come as Google Backgrounds ..\n\nHere are some teaser photos across Iceland ..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere in Iceland ?\n\nAs we all know Iceland is an island and most tourists do the Golden Circle with short trips to the southern part. There are some who drive along the The Ring which is roughly 1300 km . The Ring Road circles the complete Iceland . One can start either clockwise or anti-clockwise from Reykjavik and return to the same place. It take roughly 7-8days or one can stretch by few days and comfortably do it in 10 days.\n\nThere are still some who go beyond the golden circle and The Ring route and take some additional trips along the way . Then we wanted to come to Iceland and explore it.\n\nSo we did just close to 4300 KM which also included traveling to the Highlands --> The Landmanalauger where we spent 1.5 days and included a night stay and doing full day hiking .\n\nHow long ?\n\nAfter doing some research on the Iceland itinerary we realized that based on duration one spends in Iceland , we could cover the \u201cGolden Circle \u201c with extension to south Iceland in about 5-7 days, or one could do the complete Ring route in about 10-11 days . There are few who travel more than 15 days and those who visit only the \u201cGolden Circle\u201d in about 3-4 days.\n\nBased on our time and availability we decided for about 14 days . We decided also not to book rooms and hotels except for couple of them at the beginning.\n\nThis time too like our Norway trip, myself and my friend Prasad from UK planned for this Iceland Road Trip.\n\nWe chose the first 2 weeks of August and planned accordingly the bookings.\n\nPreparation\n\nThis was the most important part . With the feedback we received and seeing the prices of restaurant's Menu, hotel accommodations costs and exorbitant prices for rental cars and fuel especially for a 4X4 vehicle, we wanted to save costs wherever we could.\n\nWe carried lots of Wagh Bhakhri chai , coffee sachets, fresh Theplas with pickles , ready to make Soups, Upma, Poha , Pongal, Pulav and a Rice cooker .\n\nWe wanted to buy only Bread & Cheese, Yoghurt and essentials .\n\nWe also carried sleeping bags , tents for 2 of us and used these during our trip.\n\nNot visiting restaurants did help us save a lot as an average meal costs upwards of 80-100 USD for 2 persons.\n\nThen ultimately the execution of the plan which I will cover the most part of this travelogue\n\nContinue reading BHPian gk_Bng's travelogue for more insights and information.",

We will remain disciplined in the short, medium and long term, while paying attractive returns to shareholders.\"\n\nii round-up:\n\nMining giant Rio Tinto Registered Shares (LSE:RIO) detailed a decline in annual profit, although the dividend cut was not as bad as expected.\n\nAn average 11% retreat in iron ore prices failed to counter price gains in other commodities and a more than 1% improvement in overall production, leaving adjusted profit (EBITDA) down 2% in 2024 at $23.3 billion. A final dividend of $2.25 per share exceeded City forecasts of $2.06 per share, although the total payment for the year is down 8% at $4.02. That\u2019s the ninth consecutive year that Rio has paid out 60% of earnings, the top of its dividend policy range.\n\nShares in the FTSE 100 company gave up initial gains in post results UK trading, but remain in positive territory having come into these latest results down around 6% over the last year. That\u2019s similar to fellow iron ore miner BHP Group Ltd (LSE:BHP) and in contrast to a 12% gain for the FTSE 100 index over that time.\n\nRegularly sold to China, Australian iron ore accounts for Rio\u2019s biggest chuck of profit at around 70%, with the balance largely split between copper and aluminium.\n\nAverage realised prices for copper and aluminium improved 8% from 2023. Rio maintained its prior guidance for full-year 2025 Australian Pilbara iron ore shipments of between 323 and 338 mt, although with a series of recent cyclones potentially impacting the outcome.\n\nGroup net debt climbed $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5.1 billion. In October, Rio agreed the $6.7 billion takeover of US listed lithium miner Arcadium to boost exposure to energy transition products. Lithium is used to make rechargeable batteries used in products from mobile phones to electric vehicles.\n\nOperational developments over the year included the commissioning of ventilation shafts at its Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in Mongolia, and a $2.5 billion approval of plans to expand its existing lithium Rincon project in Argentina.\n\nBroker Morgan Stanley reiterated its \u2018overweight\u2019 stance on the shares post the results. A first-quarter production update is scheduled for 16 April.\n\nii view:\n\nAnglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto employs over 55,000 across more 30 countries, with strong presences in Australia and North America. Headquartered in London, rivals include Anglo American (LSE:AAL), Glencore (LSE:GLEN), Antofagasta (LSE:ANTO) and BHP.\n\nFor investors, the weather can impact production, with recent Australian cyclones potentially reducing current 2025 iron ore shipments. There'll also be a resolution at Rio's next AGM in April requesting a review of its dual-listed structure - a potential move which Rio asks shareholders to reject given management\u2019s positive view of the benefits of the current listing. Potential US trade tariffs could hinder Canadian aluminium and subsequent sales to the US, while concerns about the economic health of the miner\u2019s biggest customer China, at around 60% of overall sales, persist.\n\nMore favourably, a focus on increasing production of energy transition commodities such as copper and lithium used in solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage systems, is ongoing. Rio considered its acquisition of Arcadium as counter-cyclical, with the price of lithium down more than 80% since its peak at the time of the bid approach. Efforts to improve its environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy continue, while a net gearing ratio of 9% continues to suggest a robust balance sheet.\n\nFor now, and despite ongoing risks, a consensus analyst fair value estimate above \u00a358 per share plus a forecast dividend yield of around 6% offer grounds for continued optimism over the long term.\n\nPositive\n\nSelection of different commodities mined\n\nAttractive dividend payment (not guaranteed)\n\nNegative\n\nUncertain global economic outlook\n\nThe weather can impact performance\n\nThe average rating of stock market analysts:\n\nBuy",

She was exiting a rotary and an Audi entered the rotary by jumping the stop sign and touched the rear end of my car. One of the entry into this rotary has a stop sign rather than a yield and the Audi driver ignored it. Looks like he was distracted as there is no chance of missing the giant stop sign at that intersection.\n\nMy wife called the cops who immediately showed up and the Audi driver admitted his mistake with them. The cop didn't ask for the dash cam footage as it was evident that the Audi driver didn't have the right of way and he had admitted jumping the stop sign. The cop prepared the report and handed over the Audi driver's insurance details to her. We got the online copy of the report from the Westborough Police Department website after 3 days.\n\nWe filed a claim with the Audi's insurance provider and the process was extremely seamless. They asked us to upload the photos and the police report in their app. They approved the claim in a week and also provided us with a rental car for the duration of the repair. I dropped the car at Westboro Toyota and they took a week to repair it. The rear diffuser was damaged and they replaced it along with repainting the bumper.\n\nFront Camera: http://youtu.be/IqCcJgOc8zI\n\nRear Camera: http://youtu.be/yBf_Dxhuu0A\n\nThe scratches on the rear bumper and the diffuser:\n\n\n\nAfter the repair:\n\n\n\nThe rental Camry with red seats.

While Commonwealth Bank ((CBA)) made earnings look easy, National Australia Bank ((NAB)), Westpac ((WBC)), and ANZ Group ((ANZ)) were swept up in the selling over margin and bad debt concerns.\n\n-The big miners, BHP Group ((BHP)) and Rio Tinto ((RIO)), managed weakness in core iron ore markets, with copper performing well, although management at both majors are tackling the growth versus dividend challenges.\n\n-The RBA delivered a mega-hawkish -25bps cut to the cash rate to 4.1%, leaving some experts questioning why after the latest labour market data the next day. The jobless rate grew to 4.1% in January as the participation rate rose to a record 67.3%, with 44k new jobs added.\n\n-The ASX adopted a risk-off tone, with companies missing on earnings being proverbially taken out to the wood-chipping shed, such as Mineral Resources ((MIN)).\n\n-The US Federal Reserve minutes flagged concerns over the President\u2019s tariffs and the need for more evidence of inflation easing before rate cuts restart.\n\n-Volatility has returned to both the domestic and US markets, even though the US major indices kissed all-time highs on Thursday. Judging by this week\u2019s tectonic geopolitical shifts and Japanese inflation reaching a two-year high of 4% in January, investors might want to remain alert but not alarmed.\n\n-As of February 20, the FNArena Corporate Results Monitor has logged 111 companies with the following ratios: 36.9% Beats, 31.5% In Line, and 31.5% Misses.\n\n-The earnings report deluge continues into the last week of February, and to stay up to date on the Beats, Misses and In-Line updates and commentary, refer to the daily updated Corporate Results Monitor https://fnarena.com/index.php/reporting_season/\n\nHave a great weekend from the FNArena Team\n\nCorporate news in the week that was:\n\n-AFR reports Private equity house Oaktree Capital Management is trying to buy out Star Entertainment\u2019s ((SGR)) lenders before administrators are expected to be called in\n\n-KKR has returned with an improved all-cash bid for Perpetual\u2019s ((PPT)) corporate trust and wealth units, offering over $8 per share\n\n-Macquarie Group ((MQG)) seen as potential buyer for Tyro Payments ((TYR))\n\n-Charter Hall ((CHC)) and Hostplus will fully acquire Hotel Property Investments ((HPI)) after surpassing 90% ownership\n\n-Westgold Resources ((WGX)) sells Lakewood Mill after $2.5bn Karora Resources merger\n\n-Bupa is reportedly interested in operating about half of Healthscope\u2019s hospitals as part of a takeover bid led by HMC Capital ((HMC))\n\n-Goodman Group ((GMG)) has announced a $4bn equity capital raise to accelerate growth in its data centre operations\n\n-Light & Wonder ((LNW)) acquires Grover Gaming assets for -$1.34bn\n\n-Mitsui buys 40% of Rio Tinto\u2019s ((RIO)) Rhodes Ridge\n\n-Mosaic Brands\u2019 ((MOZ)) collapse leaves creditors with a -$242m shortfall\n\n-Clarity Pharmaceuticals ((CU6)) gained a third FDA fast track for its prostate cancer diagnostic\n\n-NRW Holdings ((NWH)) has halted ASX trading pending an update on its SIMEC contract in South Australia\n\n-US property firm CoStar purchased 7.5% stake in Domain Holdings Australia ((DHG)), launching offer for full take-over\n\n-HMC Capital ((HMC)) is exploring a private equity-led rescue plan for struggling hospital operator Healthscope, with Ramsay Health Care ((RHC)) and St John of God Health Care emerging as potential partners\n\n-Clive Palmer is reportedly exploring a purchase of Star Entertainment\u2019s ((SGR)) Queensland assets, following interest from Bruce Mathieson\n\n-Having sold Plarium, Aristocrat Leisure ((ALL)) will repay debt, launch a share buyback, and explore acquisitions\n\nCorporate Calendar\n\nFor a calendar of earnings result releases and a summary of earnings results to date, refer to FNArena\u2019s Corporate Results Monitor(https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/reporting_season/)\n\nFind out why FNArena subscribers like the service so much: \u201cYour Feedback (Thank You)\u201d \u2013 Warning this story contains unashamedly positive feedback on the service provided.\n\nFNArena is proud about its track record and past achievements: Ten Years On\n\nTo share this story on social media platforms, click on the symbols below.\n\nClick to view our Glossary of Financial Terms",

At each stage, Brambles earns daily hire fees for its pallets and crates.\n\nBHP shares\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nBXB & BHP share price valuation\n\nWe would consider BXB to be a \u2018mature\u2019 or \u2018blue-chip\u2019 business, so some of the metrics that could be worth considering include the debt/equity ratio, average yield, and return on equity, or ROE. These measures give us a sense of the company\u2019s debt levels, their ability to generate returns from their assets, and their ability to consistently return profits to shareholders.\n\nFor FY24, Brambles Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 81.8%, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nOver the last 5 years, BXB has delivered an average dividend yield of 2.7% per year. This is important to note if you\u2019re looking for income from your investments.\n\nFinally, in FY24, BXB reported an ROE of 25.6%. For a mature business you generally want to see an ROE of more than 10%, so BXB clears this hurdle.\n\nBHP Group Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 45.3% in FY24, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nAs for dividends, since 2019 BHP has achieved an average dividend yield of 6.9% per year, and in FY24 reported an ROE of 19.7%\n\nKeep in mind that these are only a small selection of metrics.

            "content": "We were three medium build folks in the back with a toddler too. The tall boy design keeps it so airy, we couldn't feel any sign of congestion\n\nBHPian Rman88 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI drove the 1.0ltr MT turbo today around the showroom in mild traffic conditions and I tried the driver seat as well as the passenger seat. I must say that Kia has packaged this car with utmost comfort as priority for the passengers in the rear seats. My brother of 6'2 had no issues in the driver seat and he had pushed the seat all the way back, still leaving acres of spaces for my mother in law who sat behind. We were three medium build folks in the back with a toddler too. The tall boy design keeps it so airy and we couldn't feel any sign of congestion. The suspension felt a far cry from the first gen seltos that my father owns and this felt only a tad bit firm. It never crashes on potholes and bad roads and felt comfortable in city conditions which is key for the urban families.\n\nNext I moved to the driver seat and took the wheel for a brief distance. The clutch seems to be soft though not as soft as the marutis but still light enough for average traffic conditions. The refinement on this engine is supreme and is silent at idle. Kia has masked the low end turbo lag to an extent though you still feel it a bit below 2K rpm. The mid range is quite strong and feel quite peppy when revved, and I feel this engine will be calm at speeds of 90-100 providing a lot of pep for overtakes and high speeds. Kia has done a good job here by providing this engine for the Syros and the overall package makes for a solid sensible choice for urban families who prioritize space and comfort barring the unavailable safety rating.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Here is a breakdown of the information Bhp Group presented to its investors.\n\nBHP Group, a leading global resources company, is engaged in the extraction and production of key commodities such as iron ore, copper, and coal, with a strong focus on sustainable practices and operational excellence.\n\nBHP Group has reported a strong financial performance for the half-year ending December 2024, characterized by solid operational efficiency, robust cash flow, and strategic investments despite the impacts of lower commodity prices. The company has declared an interim dividend of 50 US cents per share, totaling US$2.5 billion, showcasing its commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nKey highlights from the report include a notable 10% increase in group copper production, driven by outstanding performances at Escondida and WAIO. The company\u2019s attributable profit surged to US$4.4 billion, while underlying attributable profit saw a decline due to reduced prices in the iron ore and coal segments. BHP has also invested heavily in future-facing commodities like potash and copper, with a capital expenditure of US$5.2 billion.\n\nLooking forward, BHP remains optimistic about its growth trajectory, bolstered by a strong balance sheet and strategic projects such as the Vicu\u00f1a joint venture in Argentina. The company expects to maintain resilience against global economic uncertainties, leveraging its operational capabilities and sustainable business practices.\n\nOverall, BHP\u2019s strategic investments and operational efficiencies position it well to navigate future challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global resources sector.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "BHP reported strong financial results for the half-year ending December 31, 2024. Demand for copper is rising due to renewables and electric vehicles (EVs). Thus, the company is focused on boosting copper production. Notably, BHP aims for sustainable mining that balances growth with environmental care and low emissions.\n\nBHP Reports Strong Half-Year Financial Results\n\nThe financial report showcased strong margins and steady cash flow led to an interim dividend of 50 US cents per share, totaling $2.5 billion.\n\nBHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry explained,\n\n\u201cBHP reported a strong financial performance for the half-year, underpinned by safe and reliable operations and rigorous cost control. The Group\u2019s industry-leading margins and robust cash flow enabled the Board to determine an interim dividend of 50 US cents per share \u2013 a total of US$2.5 billion. The strength of the result demonstrates BHP\u2019s operational resilience and its ability to perform through the cycle, with standout production performances in the half from Escondida, WAIO and BMA. WAIO has maintained its lead as the lowest-cost iron ore producer globally, a testament to our ongoing work to drive productivity at our operations.\u201d\n\nProduction Performance: Escondida, Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), and BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) achieved high outputs. WAIO remains the world\u2019s lowest-cost iron ore producer.\n\nGrowth Investments: BHP invested $3.2 billion in potash and copper. It completed a $2.0 billion joint venture with Lundin Mining in Argentina.\n\nFinancial Strength: Attributable profit reached $4.4 billion. Copper production rose by 10%. Revenue dropped by $2.0 billion due to lower iron ore and steelmaking coal prices.\n\nCapital and Exploration: Total spending reached $5.2 billion. This aimed at potash and copper for medium-term growth.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nGlobal commodity demand is strong despite economic uncertainties. China shows early signs of recovery, while the US and India continue to drive growth. BHP expects demand to grow due to several factors. These include population growth, urbanization, and the energy transition. Also, more AI and data center projects will boost demand for copper.\n\nGlobal seaborne demand for iron ore fell slightly. China\u2019s steel production stayed steady due to infrastructure and energy projects. This increased supply has raised stocks at Chinese ports.\n\nCommodity Analysis\n\nCopper\n\nProduction increased by 10% to 987 kt. The mean achieved rates rose by 9%. The market is tight due to supply issues. BHP expects annual copper demand to grow from 32 Mtpa to over 50 Mtpa by 2050. This growth is driven by infrastructure, renewable energy, and digital expansion.\n\nAttractive internal options to grow in copper for value: organic projects benchmark well vs. current market valuations of listed copper producers\n\nIron Ore\n\nProduced 131 Mt of while WAIO\u2019s output remained strong at 128 Mt. The company retains its position as the lowest-cost major producer. Developing regions that are increasing steel production will drive long-term demand, requiring more investment to maintain supply.\n\n2025 Strategy\n\nBHP focuses on disciplined capital allocation and sustainable growth. Capital expenditure is set at $10 billion for FY25, rising to $11 billion annually in the medium term. Key growth projects include Jansen, Escondida, Copper South Australia, and WAIO.\n\nCapital spent by commodity: Increasing growth spend with continued flexibility to adjust spend for value\n\nBHP\u2019s Roadmap to Cutting Carbon Emissions and Achieving Net Zero\n\nThe company has always aimed for better efficiency and invests in important commodities for the future. It also aims to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and has a clear strategy forward. Let\u2019s see what its sustainability report reveals about its net zero plans.\n\nEmissions Reductions\n\nAims to cut Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from the 2020 baseline and become net zero by 2050.\n\nIn 2024, operational emissions dropped by 32%, reaching 9.2 MtCO\u2082-e from the 2020 baseline. However, Scope 3 emissions, mainly from customer product use, were 377.0 MtCO\u2082-e.\n\nNon-Reliance on Carbon Credits\n\nBHP has a clear plan to cut emissions by 2030. They aim for real reductions instead of relying on carbon credits. The company commits to reducing operational GHG emissions through direct actions. Voluntary credits may be used for unexpected shortfalls.\n\nThey prioritize low-carbon infrastructure to cut emissions like new facilities and projects with cleaner technologies. The company also reviews acquisitions for their environmental impact, ensuring they stay on track with carbon reduction goals and long-term sustainability plans. Furthermore, they have a strict carbon budget for emissions reductions.\n\nRoadmap to Net Zero by 2050\n\nBeyond 2030, BHP\u2019s net zero strategy includes:\n\nElectrifying Mining Equipment: Diesel-powered vehicles will be replaced with electric alternatives.\n\nExpanding Renewable Energy : The company plans to switch all grid-connected sites to 100% renewable electricity by FY2030, if possible.\n\nCutting Methane Emissions: This involves better monitoring and new gas drainage tech for coal mines.\n\nAddressing Scope 3 Emissions\n\nBHP knows that Scope 3 emissions come from suppliers and customers. This makes them harder to manage. However, the company works with partners to reduce these emissions. In steelmaking, BHP supports technologies that lower carbon output. It encourages suppliers to follow net zero plans.\n\nBHP supports cleaner shipping options. This includes using fuels with lower GHG emissions and enhancing vessel efficiency. These steps help lower transport emissions. The goal is to create a more sustainable industry.\n\nAdvancing Carbon Capture in Steel Production\n\nA major step toward reducing steel industry emissions is the installation of a carbon capture unit at the Ghent blast furnace. In collaboration with ArcelorMittal, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Development, this initiative marks progress toward carbon-free steel production.\n\nBHP aims to lead in sustainable mining. It sets clear targets, invests wisely, and forms industry partnerships. Additionally, they are prepared to face market challenges and promote long-term growth in a low-carbon future.",

CEO Mike Henry touted his company\u2019s recent dealmaking in Canada, pointing to a joint venture with Lundin Mining Corp. to acquire Toronto-listed miner Filo Corp.\u2019s copper assets in South America.\n\n\u201cWe are in path of growing copper production by 24 per cent over three years,\u201d said Henry, a Canadian with over three decades of experience in the mining industry.\n\nAustralia-based BHP has also tapped Canada for its potash. The $14 billion Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan is expected to become one of the world\u2019s largest potash mines once production begins at the end of 2026.\n\n\u201cCanada is a great place to invest, and I can\u2019t speak highly enough of the effort of the Saskatchewan government,\u201d Henry said. \u201cShareholders in the company will benefit from our investment in potash for decades to come.\u201d\n\nDividend cut on China weakness\n\nHenry\u2019s comments came after BHP announced it was trimming its interim dividend to an eight-year low as weakened iron ore demand out of China ate into the company\u2019s first-half profits.\n\nBut Henry said he expects Chinese demand for iron ore, mainly used to produce steel, to peak this decade.\n\n\u201cEvery major economy as it develops goes through a steel intensive phase of economic development,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn due course you will see a peak in steel demand in China\u2026 as a result of that you will face shrinking iron ore demand long-term.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Henry said BHP is focusing on the \u201cnext place to be,\u201d which he said is copper, adding that as China enters its next economic development phase and the world moves towards the clean energy transition, demand for the metal will increase.",

Analyst James Redfern from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a A$47.50 price target.\n\nJames Redfern has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors including BHP Group Ltd\u2019s solid financial performance and stable future guidance. The company reported its 1H FY25 results with an underlying EBITDA of $12.4 billion, which was in line with market expectations. Additionally, BHP\u2019s interim dividend of 50 US cents per share was slightly ahead of consensus, reflecting a strong commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nMoreover, BHP\u2019s financial health is underscored by its net debt position of $11.8 billion, which falls within the targeted range, demonstrating effective debt management. Despite anticipated increases in net debt due to specific transactions and settlements, the company\u2019s cost, production, and capital expenditure guidance remain unchanged, indicating stability in its operations. Consequently, Redfern maintains a price objective of 47.50 AUD per share, highlighting a substantial potential total shareholder return of 20%.\n\nIn another report released today, Macquarie also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a A$42.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "On Tuesday, BHP BHP reported half-year earnings (concluding on December 31, 2024) of $5.08 billion, down 23% from the year earlier. The result is unsurprising, as the iron ore market has been going through a challenging period.\n\nStill, CEO Mike Henry acknowledged the firm's strength in this part of the market cycle.\n\n\"The strength of the result demonstrates BHP's operational resilience and its ability to perform through the cycle,\" he said in a press release. Despite the downturn in iron ore prices, Henry highlighted strong performances at Escondida, Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), and BMA.\n\nIron ore EBITDA fell notably, from $9.7 billion in the first half of 2024 to $7.2 billion, as average realized prices declined by 22% to $81.11 per wet metric ton. While production increased by 1% to 131 million metric tons on an equity basis, the price slump led to an overall revenue drop of 7.5% to $25.176 billion.\n\nFollowing these results, the board declared an interim dividend of $0.50 per share, down from $0.72 per share last year. The new dividend is the lowest payout since 2017.\n\nBHP maintained its position as the world's lowest-cost iron ore producer, with unit costs at $18.19 per ton. However, the impact of Tropical Cyclone Zelia, which caused temporary shutdowns at Port Hedland and heavy rainfall across the Pilbara region, means that full-year WAIO output is now expected to fall towards the lower end of its guidance range of 282-294 million tons.\n\nChina's economic situation is the primary driving force behind the iron ore market. While early signs of recovery have emerged, demand remains uncertain due to the country's real estate struggles and slower industrial output.\n\nStill, BHP remains confident about the long-term demand for iron ore as global urbanization and infrastructure growth continue, particularly in India, where economic expansion drives higher steel consumption.\n\nMeanwhile, BHP has continued investing in its growth, spending $3.2 on the potash and copper project. After a failed bid for Anglo-American, the firm formed a $2 billion joint venture with Lundin Mining to develop the Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects, strengthening its output for the metal, which is growing in significance for electrification and renewable energy.\n\nHenry also reflected on future M&A, clarifying the management's stance. \"In the current market, it is increasingly challenging to do large global M&A for shareholder value, and that's what BHP is about at the end of the day,\" he noted.\n\nDespite diversifying into other minerals, BHP remains committed to running a world-class iron ore business. The company aims to maintain WAIO production levels and potentially expand output to 305 million tons per year in the medium term, with an aspirational target of 330 million tons annually if market conditions permit.\n\nMeanwhile, a remark from the U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright could open doors for new collaborations. \"I would love to see Australia get in the game of supplying uranium,\" Wright said Monday at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship event, per Reuters.\n\nBHP owns Olympic Dam, the world's largest known uranium deposit. However, Australia's uranium industry has stagnated, with production banned in Western Australia and Queensland. Only three mines remain operational on the continent, and output has declined in recent years.\n\nStill, the center-right Liberal Party has expressed support for nuclear energy as a solution to Australia's electric power struggles. If they win the upcoming May elections, uranium production could receive a policy boost, helping BHP expand into this growing market.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock",

Bloomberg highlighted that the world's largest public miner's underlying attributable profit for the six months ending December 31 was $5.08 billion, below analyst expectations of $5.39 billion. As a consequence, BHP reduced its interim dividend to 50 cents per share from the previous 72 cents, representing the lowest payout since 2017 for this period.\n\nDespite the financial downturn, CEO Mike Henry remains optimistic about the ongoing demand for BHP products, noting early signs of China's economic recovery alongside robust growth in India and steady US performance. The economic challenges have seen benchmark prices for iron ore and copper decrease by 5% and 9% respectively during the reporting period.\n\nAustralia's iron ore export value reached $83.7 billion in 2024, a decline from $90.3 billion in 2023, as per data from IndexBox. China remains the largest importer, accounting for $72.8 billion of Australia's iron ore exports in 2024, down from $76.1 billion in the previous year. Other significant importers include Japan with $6 billion and South Korea with $5.2 billion in 2024.\n\nBHP's iron ore operations in Western Australia faced challenges due to Tropical Cyclone Zelia. The company has maintained its annual production forecast from the region between 282 million tons and 294 million tons, but now anticipates production to fall in the lower half of the range due to the cyclone's impact.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "BHP BHP boss Mike Henry is a little bit too keen to express his preference for organic growth over M&A. Granted, on the surface results for the six months to the end of December show the $130 billion miner achieving on its own one of the key goals of last year's failed attempt to buy Anglo American AAL: reducing its dependence on iron ore. But that success is not as simple as it looks.\n\nThat's not to dismiss what Henry has achieved. In the second half of last year, copper accounted for almost 40% of the Australian company's EBITDA, up from 25% in the same period the previous year. In part that's thanks to the red metal's output increasing by a tenth over that time frame - and by more than double that since 2022. Production costs at its key Escondida mine in Chile also fell 12% in a year.\n\nBut relative price moves played a big role, too. BHP on average got 10% more for the copper it dug up compared to the second half of 2023. It raked in more than a fifth less, though, for its iron ore.\n\nThat was driven by concerns over the economy in China, which buys most of the steelmaking ingredient that BHP mines. Henry's team is relatively bullish about the People's Republic and expects Beijing's efforts to boost domestic consumption will keep GDP growth in the world's second-largest economy in the 4.5% to 5% range. If they're right, the iron ore price ought to recover, bolstering its share of the company's profit.\n\nA deal, whether for a copper giant like Anglo or a standalone player like Freeport-McMoRan FCX, would quickly supercharge BHP's diversification. Trouble is, its stock has dropped some 11% in the past year, while that of Anglo is 40% higher. The resulting widening valuation gap makes it virtually impossible for Henry, who has held fast to his pledge not to overpay for assets, to start a new merger dance.\n\nThomson ReutersBHP has underperformed potential copper M&A targets\n\nAt least he and his shareholders have some organic growth to fall back on - even if that's a slower path to realising BHP's copper dreams.\n\nFollow @AntonyMCurrie on X\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nBHP on February 18 reported net profit of $4.4 billion for the six months to the end of December. Results included $700 million in provisions for its settlement over a 2015 dam failure in Brazil and its decision last year to suspend its nickel operations in Western Australia.\n\nThe mining company said it would pay a dividend for the six months of 50 cents a share. At $2.5 billion, it equates to a 50% payout of underlying earnings, the minimum amount BHP has pledged to pay.\n\nShares were up slightly in midday trading on the ASX, while the broader market was down 0.6%.",

            "content": "No one should have been surprised, five years ago, when Mike Henry rose to the top of the Australian mining giant BHP. When it comes to mining, Canadians have some game, and the University of British Columbia alum had built a 30-year career touching every aspect of the industry, from marketing to technology to operations.\n\nWhat might have opened some eyes is how decisively the understated Henry, who\u2019d been at BHP since 2003, moved to change things up. He eliminated BHP\u2019s complicated dual listing on the London and Sydney exchanges, boosting the company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions. He improved operations, spun off BHP\u2019s oil and gas business, sold its thermal coal assets and focused the company on the minerals of the future: copper in South America and Australia, potash in Canada. In January, as the world\u2019s biggest mining company was gearing up for the 2026 start of that potash project in Jansen, Sask.\u2014the biggest bet in the company\u2019s history\u2014Henry spoke to us from his office in Melbourne.\n\nBesides its vast size, what separates BHP? What makes it different in the industry?\n\nA portfolio of commodities that are leveraged to the big mega-trends under way in the world around us. That is the single biggest determinant of value in a company like ours. Within those commodities\u2014copper, potash, iron ore and the best of the steelmaking coals\u2014we seek to have the best possible assets. That means large, long-life, sitting at the low end of the cost curve. We then seek to operate them exceptionally well, through the way that we develop talent internally and the way we harness their capabilities in the BHP operating system.\n\nI\u2019ve heard it said that under your watch, BHP has been less aggressive in pursuit of growth than rivals like Rio Tinto. What are you prioritizing instead of growth?\n\nWe\u2019re prioritizing valuable growth. The single biggest growth driver for a company like us is productivity, and we\u2019ve enhanced that markedly. I think what you\u2019ll hear people referencing is the time frame of the growth we\u2019re unlocking. We had a relatively bare cupboard in terms of growth opportunities. We\u2019ve developed significant growth optionality in copper and, of course, we\u2019ve triggered $15 billion of investment in potash growth. But what people will be flagging is that this growth comes on at the end of this decade, rather than in the near term, notwithstanding the fact that we\u2019ve grown in copper by more than any company in the world over the past few years.\n\nChina accounted for about 60% of your sales last year. How much dependence on one market is too much?\n\nChina is such a driving force of commodity markets globally that even when companies aren\u2019t selling directly into China, they\u2019re exposed to dynamics in China. That high proportion of sales into China is driven predominantly by the fact that we\u2019ve got this big, very high-performing iron ore business\u2014the lowest-cost, best-performing iron ore business in the world. That drives a significant share of market into China.\n\nBut Chinese demand is falling, and some experts think that will continue, given that China has stopped building so much, and its population is shrinking.\n\nWell, it is. At BHP, we make very long-term bets. About a decade ago, we said that, based on all the fundamental analysis we do, Chinese steel demand would peak in the mid-2020s and then move into decline. That\u2019s the pattern for every major economy as it develops. As that happened in China, it would mean iron ore demand would peak and then move into decline, as well. That informed our strategy to become the lowest-cost supplier of iron ore in the world, because we knew competition was going to heat up. The same thinking informs how we want to grow in commodities like potash and copper, because even though Chinese demand for iron ore will shrink, its demand for other commodities will continue to grow.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Mike Henry rose to the top of the Australian mining giant BHP five years ago. Since then, he's improved operations, spun off BHP\u2019s oil and gas business, sold its thermal coal assets and focused the company on the minerals of the future.\n\nYou\u2019ve made it clear that in the energy transition, you see more opportunity in copper than in lithium. Why?\n\nWe\u2019ve said that copper is more attractive than lithium for BHP.\u00b9 Copper demand is not solely dependent upon the energy transition. And copper resources are relatively scarce in the Earth\u2019s crust, with greater differentiation between the quality of the deposits. So if you find the right deposit, low on the cost curve, you can generate better long-run margins than we\u2019d be able to generate in lithium. And lithium will be more dependent on the energy transition as a sole determinant of demand.\n\nIn 2021, you estimated that demand for copper would increase 70% by 2050. Is that still true?\n\nYes, and here\u2019s the other interesting dynamic. In the case of copper deposits, production declines as you produce, because grade\u2014the amount of copper per tonne of ore\u2014declines over time. So, just to stand still, people have to develop new mines or develop more production capacity at existing mines, and then you\u2019ve got the 70% growth in demand on top of that. So that\u2019s one of the reasons we see the dynamics for copper as being just so attractive, because there\u2019s going to be a lot of capital that needs to be invested in the industry that will mean sustained higher prices than a market that had slower demand growth or declining demand growth.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the Jansen project. When it\u2019s fully operational, how much of BHP\u2019s revenue will it account for?\n\nAfter the first two stages are developed, it\u2019ll be about 8.5 million tonnes of production.\u00b2 How much of the revenue base it forms is going to be dependent upon what\u2019s happening with prices. This is going to be a material part of BHP\u2019s long-term business and very attractive, because this will be at the low end of the cost curve, certainly among Western-world potash producers. And it requires relatively little sustaining capital. Of the capital we generate, not that much needs to be reinvested to keep the business going, unlike some other businesses. So it will create really attractive cash flow for BHP and its shareholders.\n\nBesides cash flow, what\u2019s driving your interest in potash?\n\nPotash demand is very resilient, because it\u2019s needed for agricultural production globally. It\u2019s not a substitutable thing, at the end of the day. Against the backdrop of a growing global population; rising living standards, which tend to lead to a more calorie-intensive diet; and the need to get more agricultural production off a constrained arable land footprint, that\u2019s going to require more fertilizer. On the supply side, there\u2019s only two big potash basins in the world. One is in Russia and Belarus, where the assets are a little bit older and obviously subject to some geopolitical disruption, and then it\u2019s Canada. So Canada is the place to be in potash. We\u2019ve got the best undeveloped green-field resource. It\u2019s right within our sweet spot when it comes to capabilities. And finally, we like Canada as an investment destination. And the way that we\u2019re going about investing in that business is going to be good for other stakeholders like Saskatchewan, Canada more broadly, First Nations in Canada, and so on.\u00b3\n\nThe former CEO of Nutrien, for one, has questioned the idea of building a single mine for potash, because it makes you vulnerable to events and disruption. What do you say?\n\nWe\u2019ve got a strong focus on operational excellence, which makes us less subject to unexpected disruptions. And in the case of potash, some of what others have faced over time is water ingress into the shaft, for example. We\u2019ve been very deliberate about our shaft construction. It\u2019s steel-lined, which is a differentiator for us.\n\nWhat\u2019s the likelihood that potash will get caught up in the tariff fight with the United States? In January, the federal energy and natural resources minister specifically mentioned potash from the Jansen mine being part of negotiations.\n\nIt\u2019s very early days. BHP is a global company, of course, so we don\u2019t look at just one market. The U.S. is one market for potash, but we would be shipping globally. Whether potash becomes subject to tariffs or not will be a matter, I assume, for negotiation between the incoming administration in the U.S. and the government in Canada, post the next election. In the event that tariffs are implemented, because of the way commodities will re-order globally, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to have a material impact on BHP sales for potash. But we continue to watch things closely.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Led by Mr. Henry, BHP is gearing up for the 2026 start of a potash project in Jansen, Sask.\u2014 the biggest bet in the company\u2019s history.\n\nYou mentioned liking Canada as an investment destination, and you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re bullish on Canada. Why?\n\nCanada is blessed. Canada is resource rich, and there\u2019s a lot of areas that remain under-explored. So we expect there\u2019s going to be even more of these attractive resources found in Canada. Canada has a highly capable work force when it comes to mining. We\u2019ve been the beneficiary of that, not just in Jansen, of course. I\u2019m Canadian, the chair of BHP is Canadian, about half my management team are either Canadian or have worked for extended periods in Canada. So it\u2019s got a ready-made workforce for a business like this. And while there\u2019s always things to be improved upon, we\u2019ve found our government engagements at the local, provincial and federal levels to be very positive.\n\nYou\u2019ve been critical of the permitting process in Canada, where it can take 15 years or more to get a mine into operation. What has to happen to change that?\n\nOver the past five years, the importance of metals and mining, and the importance of critical mineral supply chains, has exploded into the consciousness of policy makers globally. Some countries are responding by focusing on making it easier to invest in mining, in-country. In the U.S., there have been multiple efforts on both sides of the aisle to progress permitting reform. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that it already takes longer in Canada, and other countries aren\u2019t standing still. Canada has to keep that competitive dynamic in mind and look at how it can stay with the pack, or actually improve its relative position. A key area to do that is in permitting reform. That means removing duplication, speeding up the permitting process and giving rise to greater certainty around the permitting-process outcomes. In these big projects, time is money. By reducing permitting time frames, you improve the economics of the project, and by improving permitting certainty, you reduce the risk profile. Those are really the two things that will determine whether capital flows and investments get made or not.\n\nBesides the permitting issue, how well is Canada competing for mining investment?\n\nOn government responsiveness, willingness to engage, proactiveness to try to secure investment\u2014and this is seen through the experience we\u2019ve had around Jansen\u2014Canada is ranked right up there. When it comes to fiscal terms and fiscal certainty, that varies a little bit. In the case of potash, fiscal certainty and royalty certainty were very important. We had an example with steelmaking coal in Australia, where the government, in a very dramatic fashion, changed royalties. As a consequence, BHP can no longer invest in that state.\u2074 So this has been a positive differentiator for Canada. But there\u2019s opportunities to improve\u2014tax reform, subsidies like those provided through things like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Canada needs to recognize that other jurisdictions continue to evolve in a way that may attract more capital if there doesn\u2019t remain a focus on reform.\n\nThere\u2019s a thought out there that BHP\u2019s past is in Australia, while its future is in Chile and Canada.\n\nIn its 140-year history, BHP has reinvented itself multiple times. And that\u2019s part of what you see currently\u2014recognizing that we\u2019re moving to a different basket of commodities. And it\u2019s not just potash in Canada. We\u2019ve got investments in Brixton Metals, for example, a nascent copper company that\u2019s pursuing a copper resource in B.C. We\u2019re investing in tech companies in Canada. And through our Xplor effort, we\u2019re funding small companies that have innovative approaches to exploration, including in Canada. So, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of effort underway in Canada, and we relocated our global exploration headquarters to Toronto as a sign of our confidence in the country.\u2075\n\nYou tried several times to buy Anglo American. Why did you want it, and why did you fail?\n\nThis was one of those unique opportunities where there were some high-quality assets in its portfolio, where we thought there were synergies to be unlocked for shareholders. But as we saw, Anglo had its own priorities, which it\u2019s now in the process of executing.\u2076\n\nI have to ask: You\u2019re in a personal relationship with Tracy Robinson, the CEO of CN Rail, which you had to disclose to BHP\u2019s board.\n\nBoth Tracy and I recognize the importance of transparency. We personally, and the companies that we belong to, are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. And so we disclosed it on that basis for awareness. And there were proper checks and balances put in place to ensure there was no potential conflict in terms of how that business would be executed. By way of example, I\u2019m not involved at all, and have no line of sight on, anything to do with rail around Jansen.\u2077\n\nFor a while, you had a reputation for being cautious, but lately, you seem to be shaking that up. You also recently tried parachute jumping in Montreal. Was the reputation wrong, or are you deliberately trying to change it?\n\nWho knows what causes a reputation to rise? And I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s wrong or right. What I will say is that I\u2019m a deliberate person, and we\u2019re a deliberate company. We\u2019ve got a clear strategy, and we have been absolutely consistent on strategy since I took up the role in 2020. And we\u2019re very deliberate about executing on that strategy. And that permeates the company\u2019s DNA. When our ducks are lined up, we can do bold things, and we can do them quickly.\n\n1. BHP has also mothballed its nickel assets\u2014despite nickel being needed for the energy transition\u2014because China had increased production from Indonesia, lowering prices, and Henry decided the operation had become uneconomical.\n\n2. The Jansen project will be developed in four stages. Having already invested $4.6 billion in development, BHP will now invest $7.4 billion in Stage 1 and $6.4 billion in Stage 2 for a total of $18.5 billion.\n\n3. BHP\u2019s relationship with First Nations got off to a rocky start in 2012 when the company was sued for $10 billion by the George Gordon First Nation, which claimed it had not been consulted on BHP\u2019s purchase of land leases. The suit was dismissed in 2020.\n\n4. In 2022, the government of the Australian state of Queensland, with no warning, increased coal royalties to the highest rate in the world, resulting in an additional US$300 million in royalties paid in the first half of 2024 and an adjusted effective tax rate, including royalties, of 62%.\n\n5. As part of that move in 2021, BHP relocated about 100 geologists from Chile to Canada. Its Xplor Global Accelerator Program has invested up to $500,000 in two Canadian companies, Bronzite Exploration and Viridian Metals. Its BHP Ventures program has invested in three Canadian startups: Summit Nanotech (developing ways to extract lithium from brine); Eavor Technologies (geothermal solutions) and GeologicAI (developing advanced core-scanning tech).\n\n6. The deal would\u2019ve been worth US$49.1 billion.\n\n7. CN Rail is building a 47-kilometre rail spur that will allow BHP to transport potash from the mine to a port on the B.C. coast.",

Mike Henry, Chief Executive Officer, and Vandita Pant, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the Company's operating and financial performance.\n\nBHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n\"BHP reported a strong financial performance for the half-year, underpinned by safe and reliable operations and rigorous cost control. The Group\u2019s industry-leading margins and robust cash flow enabled the Board to determine an interim dividend of 50 US cents per share \u2013 a total of US$2.5 billion. The strength of the result demonstrates BHP\u2019s operational resilience and its ability to perform through the cycle, with standout production performances in the half from Escondida, WAIO and BMA. WAIO has maintained its lead as the lowest-cost iron ore producer globally, a testament to our ongoing work to drive productivity at our operations.\n\nWe continued to invest in growth, including US$3.2 billion in potash and copper, and have now also successfully completed the US$2.0 billion formation of Vicu\u00f1a Corp, a 50/50 joint venture with Lundin Mining to develop the combined Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects in an exciting prospective region in Argentina.\n\nIn Brazil, the signing of a comprehensive settlement agreement during the half will deliver expanded programs for the environment and communities, while also providing greater clarity on future cash flows related to the tragedy.\n\nThe demand for BHP products remains strong despite global economic and trade uncertainties, with early signs of recovery in China, resilient economic performance in the US and strong growth in India. The trajectory of the world population growing from eight billion today to 10 billion in 2050, with more people living in cities, together with the energy transition and the growth of data centres and AI, will compound the need for more metals and minerals. Against this backdrop, BHP is well-positioned, with the ability to leverage our strong balance sheet, technical know-how and sustainable business practices to deliver growth and resilient shareholder returns.\n\nRoss McEwan will succeed Ken MacKenzie as Chair on 31 March 2025. We thank Ken for the instrumental role he has played in shaping BHP and look forward to Ross' leadership as Chair of BHP.\"",

            "content": "BHP Group (BHP, Financial), the world's largest publicly traded mining company, reported a 23% drop in profits for the first half of the fiscal year due to decreased demand for key commodities like iron ore and copper. The company's net profit attributable to shareholders for the six months ending December 31 was $5.08 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $5.39 billion, marking the lowest level in six years for the same period.\n\nBHP also cut its interim dividend to $0.50 per share from $0.72, the lowest since 2017. This decline in profit continues a trend since June 2022, when BHP recorded an annual profit of $33.1 billion, thanks to a surge in iron ore demand. Since then, annual profits have more than halved, with increased capital expenditure and declining returns impacting its stock price.\n\nDespite these challenges, CEO Mike Henry remains optimistic, citing strong demand for BHP's products amidst global economic uncertainties. Early signs of recovery in China, solid U.S. economic performance, and robust growth in India were highlighted as positive factors.\n\nDuring the reporting period, benchmark iron ore prices fell by 5%, while copper prices dropped by 9%. However, operating profit from the copper segment surged by 44% to $5 billion, driven by solid fundamentals, Chinese stimulus measures, and U.S. interest rate cuts. In contrast, iron ore earnings declined by 26% to $7.2 billion.\n\nRecently, BHP's iron ore operations in Western Australia's Pilbara region were impacted by Tropical Cyclone Zelia. Although BHP maintained its forecast for iron ore production between 282 million to 294 million tons for the fiscal year ending June 30, the output is not expected to reach the upper end of this range due to the storm.",

            "content": "BHPian shankar.balan recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nHere are some blistering first impressions of my 45 minute interaction with the Mahindra BE 6 today. I am a bit adrenaline filled after the drive hence do forgive the relative incoherence.\n\nWhen I reached home today, I got a call saying the Sireesh guys were in my vicinity and upon my confirmation, they were good enough to come to my place and give me a doorstep test drive. The vehicle is really something else!\n\nI first sat in the back with their executive driving. Because I was concerned about rear headroom.\n\nBut Im glad to report plainly that my fears were unfounded - there is no problem with headroom at the rear and at the front despite my 6ft 2 inches height. Yes at rear maybe there is 3/4th inch between the top of my head and the roofline.\n\nThe Rear seat under thigh support though, is definitely lacking. Needs 3 inches more on the squab for sure. Front seats too, if they had increased under thigh support by just 2 inches it would have been heaven. But the support given by the seats is very good. I found them really comfortable and snug. Excellent for long distances. Lower back and shoulder support too seems adequate. I found the headrests cool and functional for my height. The vehicle offers plenty of legroom and one is very relaxed driving it. Driving comfort is further enhanced with the tilt and telescopic steering adjust which makes it just right.\n\nIts a very good looking vehicle when viewed in person. Performance is really very good. Rear wheel drive so no torque steer. Excellent power delivery. Frankly the performance in \u2018Everyday\u2019 mode is more than adequate for normal folks.\n\nThe regen feels nice but is not as aggressive as in my Kona. Yes the Kona\u2019s Torque from the get go is way more. That is absolutely clear the moment one presses the accelerator. But this BE6 is impressive all the same. Looks like the range is very worthy at 580kms. (Real world maybe 500) Can do Bangalore Madurai on one charge I think, which says a lot.\n\nGround clearance at approx 200mm is more than adequate for India. The giant 19 inch wheels make it look a bit \u2018Hotwheels\u2019. There is an option to go 20 inches too! Big 245 size tyres with tall sidewalls make the wheel wells look very well filled indeed.\n\nRide and handling are excellent. Takes curves fearlessly. Chassis tuning is really good - dare I invoke the hallowed name of \u2018Lotus\u2019? It eats the Bangalore bumps and sharp speed breakers with aplomb. Suspension tuning is really good.\n\nYes it\u2019s a bit wide and large for our narrow streets and crowded areas. But if one can drive an MG Windsor, then one can drive this one too. I think it may eat the tyres up rather quickly because the natural tendency in this car is to \u2018send it\u2019 across all sorts of surfaces. But incidentally I didn't \u2018chirrup\u2019 the rear tyres despite stomping on the throttle a bit.\n\nBraking effect is linear and well controlled. ABS kicks in quick. Pedal firmness is comforting. No sponginess.\n\nBe a bit careful around these city streets and parking lots because the A Pillar is real thick. So it\u2019s a good idea to turn on the 360 degree camera always. I personally don\u2019t like the heads up display on the windscreen so I prefer to switch it off.\n\nInside design may be polarising. I personally liked the cockpit styling inside. I rather like the separator from the passenger. But leaving aside the disco lighting gimmickry which I wont comment about, the sound system is wonderful. I was blasting some lovely Blues music and the audio effect is immersive! There are 2 screens and while on the move the driver and the passenger cannot watch things like videos and all. (Thank Heaven!)\n\nThe XEV9 on the other hand has three screens and the left most one in front of the passenger allows videos etc but is blacked out from the drivers view. (This is what the executive said)\n\nThere is a lot of piano black inside and many shiny surfaces which show fingerprints. The seat upholstery is of a sufficiently dark colour to reduce the dirt but it does show up on the test car all the same.\n\nThe pull tabs on the doors are a cool touch. The centre console is a cool thing. The steering control wheel is a bit like a plane. Very cool. Feels soft but also feels a little flimsy for some reason. There is definitely a \u2018quality\u2019 tactile feel to all the switchgear like indicators and all. On the test car there was no \u2018play\u2019 in the centre joystick - I had watched the MotorInc Video in which they commented about that but didnt experience it myself. The central circular control knob felt a bit plasticky though. Not as premium as BYD for example. The AC is adequately comfortable. The big moon roof gives one an impression of space and airiness. The boot is very large. With the rear seats folded down full one can literally sleep inside! One can carry 3 golf bags lying flat, horizontally placed.\n\nWhile there was a little concern about the piano black on the outside, I think after some time one simply wont care.\n\nThe auto park facility is really very impressive as is the remote controlled forward and rearward drive movement. This will work when the person is within 4 feet of the car I believe so one can walk alongside while remote controlling the car! I made the executive demonstrate these two features for me - the auto park when I was sitting inside with him and the remote controlled movement when both he and I were standing outside the car.\n\nThis is actually a great value Sports Coupe SUV for anyone who likes a high performance, great handling, good looking and eye-catching vehicle which also has solid range and is well priced to boot. As many have said it is like a concept car come to life. And its price is at 32 lacs, a pretty decent deal.\n\nThere may be some initial niggles and all. And there is the question of servicing and service centre competence. But I think all of this will settle over the next 12 to 18 months. Mahindra has hit this one also straight out of the park, yet again.\n\nMy Kona looks and feels nice and I love it, but the BE6 is very tempting indeed. I think this is a very worthy car and deserves active consideration from anyone who is actively in the market at the moment.\n\nHad I not bought my Kona last year, I\u2019d certainly have considered this car. And as Tushar the big built gent from ZigWheels himself says he \u2018can live with it\u2019, I too can very easily do so, were I in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Driving the BYD Sealion 7 Performance\n\nUnder the bonnet is a 58-litre frunk without a cover:\n\nThe Sealion 7 uses BYD's e-Platform 3.0 which is shared with the Seal sedan. As it is an EV-specific platform, the batteries and powertrain have been designed with the EV-specific requirements in mind. This platform comes with cell-to-body technology which integrates the battery and the vehicle body floor together making the battery's sandwich structure evolve into a sandwich structure for the complete vehicle.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Sealion 7 comes with an 82.56 kWh BYD Blade battery pack. Additionally, the car gets a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) low-voltage battery instead of a lead acid battery. BYD claims that this battery is up to 6 times lighter than a conventional low-voltage battery. It has 5 times better self-discharge consumption and a lifespan of 15 years.\n\nWe got to drive the Performance variant which gets all-wheel drive and an electric motor that develops 523 BHP and 690 Nm. It has a motor speed of 23,000 rpm. With your foot on the brake pedal, hit the Start/Stop button to bring the electric motor to life. Shift to \u2018D\u2019 mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the car gets off the line in a very smooth manner.\n\nIn the city, you will appreciate the Sealion\u2019s smoothness. The power delivery till part throttle is linear and predictable. No jerks from gearshifts and no engine sound means it is an extremely refined experience. Floor the A pedal and you will be greeted with instant acceleration. Performance is strong with power available right from the get-go. BYD claims a 0-100 km/h time of 4.5 seconds, which, despite the car's 2,340 kg kerb weight, is easily believable. You\u2019ll dart ahead of most cars when the signal turns green.\n\nOut on the highway, the Sealion 7 is a very strong performer. It can get up to triple-digit speeds and maintain them without effort. Overtaking slower vehicles is very easy. Just floor the accelerator pedal and you will zoom past the car ahead. You'll hit silly speeds effortlessly and not even realize it due to the lack of drama (engine noise, etc.). BYD claims that the Sealion 7 can touch a top speed of 215 km/h. However, if you drive hard, the range will drop faster.\n\nThere are 3 driving modes to choose from and unlike some other cars, these aren't gimmicky. They're mapped specifically for different driving styles and also change the steering weight.\n\nNormal Mode: This is the default mode to drive in and works well in the city as well as on the highway. It is a good balance of power and economy. The steering is light in this driving mode.\n\nEco Mode: When you want to extract maximum range, this is the mode to engage. The throttle response is dumbed down which results in a smoother drive. However, you never feel that the car is lacking power. There\u2019s still enough power on tap to keep up with the traffic and make those quick overtakes. We found this mode to be the best for driving in the city. The difference in steering weight from normal mode is very small. It almost makes the Normal mode redundant.\n\nSport Mode: The throttle response is sharpened, but power is still delivered linearly. It doesn't feel jerky for day-to-day city driving. Push hard and it provides tremendous acceleration. One thing to note is that driving in Sport mode eats up battery faster. So it's best to use this mode on the highways when you want to have some fun while driving. The steering is firmed up in this mode. The brakes feel a little sharper too.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a snow mode for better traction in snowy conditions.\n\nInsulation sheet under the bonnet:\n\nWindshield washer fluid reservoir is placed on the left:\n\nRegenerative Braking\n\nBYD has kept it simple with regenerative braking. There are only 2 levels \u2013 Standard and High. The Standard level is barely noticeable and if you have the car in this mode, you might end up using the brakes a lot. The High level very much resembles engine braking in IC engine cars. It\u2019s not very intrusive and you won\u2019t be getting a head nod every time you lift off the accelerator. It\u2019s great for driving around in the city as well as on the highways. People wishing to do hypermiling will wish for stronger regeneration from the motor.\n\nNoise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)\n\nAs is the case with EVs, the Sealion 7 is also super quiet. There\u2019s no engine or gearbox to make any noise, so the overall driving experience is silent. The windshield and front windows feature soundproof double-glazed glass making the car cabin extremely quiet.\n\nAt highway speeds, the wind noise is well controlled and the tyre noise is par for the course. The motor spins silently at high speeds and the whine is very well controlled.\n\nRange\n\nThe Premium and Performance variants come with a claimed range of 567 km and 542 km, respectively. That is however the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) range which is an indicated number. In real-world driving conditions, you can expect lower figures. We were not able to perform a real-world range test in the short time that we had with the car. We\u2019ll wait for some ownership reviews for a clearer picture of the car's real-world range.\n\nCharging\n\nWhen you buy a BYD Sealion, you get a complimentary 7 kW home charger along with free installation. BYD has not shared the charging time though. If you ever run out of battery, you can always contact BYD\u2019s roadside assistance.\n\nThe car has an AC charging port - Type 2 (11kW) as well as a DC Charging Port - CCS 2 (150kW). You also get a 3kW portable charger that can be plugged into any 15 Amp socket (the larger 3-pin sockets used for ACs and fridges), but that would take a very long time to charge from 0-100%.\n\nSuspension\n\nRide Comfort\n\nThe Sealion gets a double wishbone suspension at the front and multi-link suspension at the rear. It comes with frequency selective damping shock absorbers. The Performance variant rides on 20-inch wheels shod with 245/45 section tyres. The low-speed ride is firm and all the cracks and bumps on the road are felt inside the cabin. What's nice is that the suspension works silently. The recommended tyre pressure is a rather high 42 psi and at this pressure, you do feel a lot of the road. Dropping the pressure while driving in the city might make the ride more comfortable.\n\nAt higher speeds, the ride does improve, but big potholes will register themselves inside and you will have to be careful while tackling them.\n\nThe Premium variant runs on 19-inch wheels slightly taller rubber. It might have a better ride.\n\nHandling & Dynamics\n\nIn a straight line, the Sealion 7 feels very stable. It doesn\u2019t feel nervous and maintains its composure at high speeds. The stiff suspension keeps the car planted while going over some undulations or expansion joints.\n\nComing to handling, the body roll is very well controlled and the Sealion 7 changes direction easily without any unnerving incidents. The Michelin Pilot Sport tyres that our test car was shod with provided excellent grip at all speeds. Even on hard cornering, the Sealion 7 never felt nervous.\n\nSteering\n\nThe Sealion 7 comes with an electric power steering. This is a nice unit and easy to operate as well. It is very light at city speeds which makes it very user-friendly. The steering weighs up fairly well on the highways. It is accurate but relays little feedback.\n\nBraking\n\nThe Sealion 7 has ventilated and drilled discs at the front and ventilated discs at the rear. The Performance variant gets red calipers. The car has good stopping power and emergency braking situations are handled well too. On the flip side, the brake pedal lacks feel and takes some time to get used to.\n\nContinue reading the discussion on the BYD Sealion 7 on our forum.",

            "content": "The State of Markets: \u201cS&P500: (still) Rangebound? Or Breakout Ahead?\u201d\n\nUS equities were pushed around by a number of key events and data releases last week. On Wednesday, for example, risk assets sold off on the hotter than expected US CPI data. They then retraced those losses on Thursday, on news that Trump had once again delayed imposing tariffs (at least until early April). With that, though, the S&P500 has remained within its range (i.e. just below its highs from early December and late January, see chart below). Elsewhere the price action in European equities has become frothy/complacent, while certain liquidity barometers have moved sharply higher (e.g. gold and silver).\n\nThe key question, therefore, is: Will US equities break out to the upside in coming weeks? Or will they roll over? We outline our views on those questions in recent research (which is available below for subscribers).\n\nNext week\u2019s US macro data has a strong housing theme, with updates on the NAHB home builders index on Tuesday, housing starts and permits (Wednesday), and existing home sales (Friday). Elsewhere the Conference Board Leading Index is due on Thursday and S&P manufacturing & service sector PMIs (February first estimates) are on Friday. The Fed minutes from the January meeting are due on Wednesday and there are speeches/comments from several key FOMC members during the week.

That is, while gold has squeezed higher, (i) Fed rate cuts have been priced out; (ii) the US dollar has strengthened; (iii) investment demand (e.g. for gold ETFs) has trended down; (iv) central bank demand has been weak; and (v) \u2018excess supply\u2019 in the physical market has increased (for detail see below for an extract of last week\u2019s Longview on Friday).\n\nEvents: Speeches by the Fed\u2019s Harker on the Economic Outlook (2:30pm) & Bowman to American Bankers Association (3:20pm); market holiday in the US on account of Washington\u2019s Birthday & in Canada on account of Family Day (Mon).\n\nData: Canadian housing starts (Jan, 1:15pm).\n\nEarnings: N/A\n\nEvents: Speech by the Fed\u2019s Daly to American Bankers Association (Tues, 3:20pm).\n\nData: US Empire manufacturing (Jan, 1:30pm); Canadian core CPI (Jan, 1:30pm); Canadian existing home sales (Jan, 2pm).

            "content": "BHPian ashis89 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nShort errands, month-long cold storage, a couple of airport runs, a joy ride to a nearby dam and a cracked tail light - that's the summary of the last 3 months.\n\nIt took me 84 days to use a tankful of diesel. Still returned 16 kmpl over the 775kms covered\n\nHad gone to a family event near HSR. As I was reversing out of the parking, I heard a thud. I couldn't understand - I had my eyes on the ONE-way road via the reverse camera and either of the ORVMs as I was reversing back onto the road, a couple of inches at a time. What I didn't see was an all too eager man on an Activa zooming from the wrong side almost next to the footpath and banging into my car. Only damage was the tail light cracked after contact with his brake lever. His scooter had a big dent (on the metal engine cover) but I can't find anything on my car. He knew his mistake and he went away quietly. Getting a new light goes onto my to-do list.\n\nAfter a couple of failed plans and wasted bookings due to a long bout of viral fever, we finally decided to step out with a baby step. On a late Saturday afternoon, took the STRR and then joined the Hyderabad highway. After that, deliberated between Sabanahalli Lake and Dandiganahalli dam, with the latter winning eventually.\n\nMayura Bakery and its egg puffs have always been a weakness for both of us. When I saw a new bakery just after leaving the highway, we had to stop. Cuppa chai and with a parcel of puffs and some cake, we proceeded to the dam.\n\nIt had been more than 4 years since my last visit to the dam and the roads are mostly good throughout. The dam has been surrounded by a metal fence which does spoil some of the experience but one can still go near the water. A couple of families with a bunch of kids were wrapping up their lunch picnic. Another group arrived prepared to camp for the night near the water. Another was already in the water. And some just spent time near the water. We enjoyed a nice sunset, shared our puff and cake with a 4 legged friend before driving back.\n\nA family had got a set of foldable tables and chairs to settle near the water. I have been thinking of getting a set myself.\n\nMeanwhile, we were comfortable in the boot watching the water\n\nSeriously lacking care for the last few months. Last water wash was probably 4-5 months ago. Josapu has been saving the day since then.\n\nAfter a dinner halt at Nahusa, took the STRR again (road towards KIA was still crowded) and reached home by 10.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

The Dampier and Cape Lambert ports ship iron ore from Rio Tinto, which said on Sunday its port, rail and mine operations had resumed in the region on Saturday.\n\nFortescue said on Saturday it was assessing its operational sites such as roads, villages and mines but advised that the cyclone had done minimal damage.\n\nBHP, which on Thursday paused its Port Hedland operations for safety, said on Saturday that the cyclone had not caused any major damage at its sites.\n\nAustralia's weather forecaster said late on Saturday that Zelia was weakening in the south of the Pilbara, a region twice the size of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"The immediate threat of severe weather has passed,\" the forecaster said on its website.

            "content": "Similarly, cobalt, another key battery raw material, is suffering from decreasing prices due to oversupply in the market, especially from China. However, its long-term prospects are strong as the global cobalt market is projected to grow from $10.8 billion in 2023 to $24.9 billion by 2030. This potential growth is tied to increasing demand for energy storage solutions and tighter supply chain regulations.\n\nLithium experienced a challenging 2024, as its prices fell by 22% in 2024 due to oversupply and weakened demand, as discussed in our recent article . As production cuts are made, and the market stabilizes, analysts project lithium\u2019s surplus decreasing from 84,000 metric tons in 2024 to 33,000 metric tons in 2025. Nevertheless, the lithium market\u2019s long-term growth prospects are still bright and clear with analysts projecting it to grow and reach $134.02 billion by 2032 at a CAGR of 22.1%.\n\nOn the other hand, rising investor and industrial demand have pushed gold and silver prices to record highs in 2024, a year that marked a 9% increase in the United States gold production, according to the USGS.Gov. Gold prices have risen by 19.7% over the past six months, reaching $2,888.3 on February 6, 2025. Moreover, silver prices have increased by 25% in 2024 due to an increased demand for solar panels and electronics. Furthermore, continued central bank purchases and inflationary concerns mean gold and silver prices will be on an upward trend in 2025 as well.\n\nThe U.S. mineral market, which generated $106 billion worth of mineral production in 2024, is experiencing stable demand for industrial minerals such as crushed stone, sand, and cement, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. These industrial minerals accounted for 68% of the total production of minerals in the U.S. in 2024, while crushed stone accounted for 24% of the total production, indicating a high demand for the category. Recycling activity was also strong, with $48 billion worth of metals and minerals recycled, signaling an increasing focus on sustainability.\n\nAt the heart of industrial growth lies the global mineral market, as there is a strong demand for essential metals in technology, clean energy, and infrastructure. The global mineral market is projected to grow from $2,260 billion in 2024 to $2,402 billion in 2025, demonstrating a CAGR of 6.2%, according to The Business Research Company. Lithium, cobalt, and copper are leading the market with their essential roles in battery storage and electrification, while gold and silver, on the other hand, remain key assets for hedging against inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Mineral Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) stands against other best mineral stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother key component of the mineral market is copper, which is a highly sought-after metal in the renewable energy sector. The metal\u2019s demand is attributed to rising adoption of renewables across the globe. In the U.S., the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports could affect copper prices in the U.S., and could also increase investment in the exploration sector.\n\nThus, 2025 is expected to be an eventful year for the copper market as well as the mining sector overall, according to analysts. China controls over 90% of global rare earth metals, putting the U.S. in a vulnerable state, especially as China imposes export controls on 25 metal products. Instead of relying on China, the U.S. is turning toward alternative sources like Ukraine, which has access to 22 out of 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S., including graphite, lithium, and Uranium. In exchange for offering military support, the U.S. is seeking Ukraine\u2019s mineral deposits to strengthen the U.S. mineral supply landscape. Thus, this deal has a tremendous potential to benefit local miners in the U.S. in accelerating the growth of critical minerals like graphite and lithium in the future.\n\nAs discussed, the minerals sector is at the heart of the global economy. Thus, we must shed light on the top players in the mineral sector. With this, let\u2019s now move on to our list of the 10 Best Mineral Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 10 Best Mineral Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used the Yahoo Finance stock screener. Using the screener we compiled a list of mineral stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter 2024 database.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs BHP Group (BHP) the Best Mineral Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nAn aerial view of a mining operation in action, with large trucks and yellow diggers.\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nBHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is a leading global miner that operates within the segments of iron ore, copper, steelmaking coal, energy coal, and nickel. The company maintains leadership in iron ore whilst strategically expanding into commodities like copper. This strategy perfectly aligns with BHP Group\u2019s plan for long-term success. It is one of the best material stocks on our list.\n\nFor the year ending June 30, 2024, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) reported an impressive revenue of $55.7 billion. This was a 3% increase from last year\u2019s revenue of $53.8 billion. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to high prices of iron ore and copper. However, lower energy coal and nickel prices led to a massive decline in profits. Accordingly, attributable profit dropped sharply by almost 39%, from $12.9 billion in 2023 to $7.9 billion in 2024.\n\nAs for the first half of 2025, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) has experienced busy operations. Copper production increased by 10% year-over-year and iron ore production improved by 2% quarter-over-quarter. Higher production of iron ore was aided by enhanced supply chain management; however, weaker demand from China remains a prominent concern. In contrast to improved copper and iron ore production, production for nickel took a hit due to the temporary suspension of operations. This temporary suspension was a result of an oversupply of nickel in the market.\n\nDespite a few temporary setbacks, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is poised for continued growth. The company\u2019s copper operations, especially the Vicu\u00f1a Corp project, are gaining momentum. This will help the company establish a strong presence in the growing and high-demand sector. Moreover, the Jansen Stage 1 potash project is expected to begin production in late 2026. This will further help BHP unlock significant long-term value. Despite a major hit to the company\u2019s profits, BHP\u2019s stock has climbed 6.14% year-to-date. Analysts expect a further increase of 2.6% with a 12-month target price of $53.2.\n\nOverall, BHP ranks 10th on our list of best mineral stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of BHP, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BHP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "mrugu BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2019 Location: Pune Posts: 28 Thanked: 221 Times\n\nPre-worshipped Porsche Taycan 4S Cross Tourismo - Initial ownership review\n\n\n\nThe disappointment of the ridiculous pain of converting BH to MH and the financial losses incurred in doing that as well as selling my beloved M340i meant that I had no intention of putting money in a car in a new country.\n\n\n\nSo for quite a bit, I was happy and contended with my Kia K8. It was a loaded car - one of the top end Kia's you can get in South Korea and got the job done well. But then given how cheap cars are and how well kept they are (seriously - a taxi with 300k kms is very common in Korea and it is kept way better than a taxi with 30000 kms in India!). Korean discipline and cheaper cost meant the desire to get a car remained. But it had to wait until life and everything else settled smoothly in Seoul.\n\n\n\nDecision Process\n\n\n\nThe itch was ongoing. Option 1 was to get a 911 or a 718 Cayman. As a second car. I rented and drove the 911 in the summer over a long weekend. Then over winter in mid January, a Macan GTS was rented and driven for close to a week. Beautiful car. The family was convinced and aligned. Getting a Macan GTS became a real option after the experience.\n\n\n\nBut a practical problem presented itself. With Porsche electrifying their fleet, Macan GTS was discontinued since 2024 in Korea. Getting a used GTS was difficult since I was clear it has to be Porsche approved if it is preworshipped. A second challenge was getting the right color. You see - Korean love their cars in white, black and all shades of grey in between. Drive on a highway in Seoul and you will see fifty shades of grey (quite literally)! The only Macan GTS available was a Crayon exterior and all black interior. That was ruled out even before we saw it. Plus there was the doubt about \"Do you really get a Porsche SUV if you get a Porsche?\"\n\n\n\nDo we consider the Cayenne? The Cayenne was never an option - too big. Too bulky, not nimble enough and just not a proper Porsche in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nThats what led to more research and it really came down to Panamera or an electric Porsche.\n\n\n\nHow I arrived at the Taycan\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch led to doubts about the Taycan. Reviews of the car in terms of how \"Porsche\" it was were amazing. But so was the depreciation - Taycans had really shed more value than my dog sheds hair when he grows a new coat every year! But getting a used one which had less than 20k kms and was less than 2 years old was about 30%-35% cheaper than getting a brand new one. And more research suggested that while the depreciation existed, it was predominantly in Years 1-3.\n\n\n\nSo off we went. To a Porsche Center in the famous \"Gangnam\" district of Seoul to check the Taycan out. The dealership had the sedan on display. And while an amazing car, it felt small and insufficient in the rear, especially the headroom. More research and the Gran Turismo presented itself. That felt ample!\n\n\n\nSo off we went again. This time to test drive a Gran Turismo. Test drove the GTS version and it did not disappoint. Electric car aside, it handled and felt just like a 911. And way better than the Macan GTS. My decision was made.\n\n\n\nNext Step - start looking for Porsche Approved cars that fit the bill. A Carmine Red 4S Gran Turismo with 18K kms first registered in July 2023 was available with a dealership. It looked perfect and it had all the configurations (plus some more) that I was looking for. The car was inspected, necessary paperwork done and 3 days later we were bringing it home! The icing on the cake was that because the tires had some wear, the dealership installed 4 brand new summer tires.\n\n\n\nFor reference, the cost was under 100K USD. Yes - the same car in India would probably be more than 3X if bought new.\n\n\n\nExterior\n\n\n\nI will let the pictures do the talking! But the car had the 21 inch gloss black alloys as against the stock alloys. There was a black sports trim package. And the PDSL headlight package as well as several other little black accent additions. I dont have much to say about the looks or a baseline to compare against. It stands in a league of its own!\n\n\n\nFront\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother side profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carmine Red really brings out the sportiness in the car. Everything from the headlights to the rear logo in black feels sporty and just oozes class. Not much to really comment or say honestly!\n\n\n\nInteriors\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the traditional Porsche choice would be the Bordeaux Red, I liked the Chalk/Black combo on the car. Red interiors on a Carmine Red exterior would be a little too much red and not enough contrast. The other thing that is growing on me is the Neodymium package which gives Neodymium door handles and trims including the steering wheel. The other superstar is the all glass panoramic roof. The center console and the tactile feedback of it. The Bordeaux Red seatbelts. The Porsche Crest on the headrest. The finesse and the finishing. The quality of materials. The 18 way adaptive sports seats\n\n\n\nWhen I had the BMW, I used to wonder if something can have more finesse than it but step into the Porsche interior and one realizes what further finesse is. Everything is just so well thought of and executed. I can go on and on, but again some pictures to do the talking.\n\n\n\nLastly, while I do not have pictures, the trunk is ample. About 450L in the rear. And another 70-80L in the front. The front is large enough to easily accommodate a carry on.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteriors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures and Options\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the drawbacks I have found with Porsche is that the standard equipment is often fairly basic for a car with the Porsche price tag. While they allow you to configure pretty much everything, doing so easily adds 20-40% to an already high price tag. When I went shopping, I was clear that the minimum config I want is -\n\n\n\n1. Sports Seat\n\n2. Sports Chrono Package\n\n3. Adaptive Air Suspension (luckily this is standard on a Tourismo)\n\n4. PDLS (The default Bi Xenon headlights are just outdated on a car with the advent of LED)\n\n5. Bose Sound System at the least. Default sound would not cut it for me\n\n6. Performance Plus Battery (again standard on a Tourismo)\n\n\n\nThe car had this and more on it. A detailed spec sheet for the more curious reader is below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe little bonuses that I got and like are again the Neodymium finish, the black alloys and the passenger screen.\n\n\n\nEnough about the features. Lets get to the main course. The drive.\n\n\n\nDriving and Handling\n\n\n\n\n\nOne drawback I am still dealing with is that the car came with brand new summer tires. And Korean winters are harsh. It has still been around freezing temperature since I got the car. Summer tires do not deal well with that weather. And hence have not been able to push the car as much. For obvious safety reasons. The tires are hard as rock and will not provide the necessary traction!\n\n\n\nBut here are is a quick summary.\n\n\n\n1) The torque on this thing is just INSANE. For context, the comfort mode pulls as well as the sports plus in the M340i. Instant. Effortless.\n\n2) In sports plus, the car hits 100 in just over 3 seconds. And you can actually feel and experience it. Given the 4S is a 4WD, the wheel spin is relatively lower and it just bolts. INSANE.\n\n3) The car masks its weight (This is a car more than 2 tons) very very well. You do not really feel it\n\n4) The handling. If there is one thing that has grown on me, it is the handling. Even more than the torque. The way that steering weighs up. And how precise it is. The way the car hugs the road even with the misfit summer tires on a freezing tarmac! As I said earlier, I have leased and driven a 911 and I will safely say that in my experience there is hardly any difference, if at all, in how the Taycan handles versus how the 911 handles. To make an electric car do that is just incredible engineering from Porsche.\n\n5) Ride Quality - the beauty here is that you get exactly what you choose. The suspension has 3 modes. It also has 3 heights. So you can mix and match to an extent. And the comfort mode will actually give you a really plush compliant ride masking all undulations on the road. Switch to the sports plus tune, put the chassis height as \"low\" and you are in Go-Kart territory!\n\n\n\nAgain - I am no expert and honestly have yet to take the car out for a long winding drive. That will have to wait until late March or April when it is 18-20C and the summer tires can start doing what they are supposed to do!\n\n\n\nRange and Charging\n\n\n\nThe car comes with a 93 KWH (I think I got that right) battery pack which has given me about 390 kms in the winter. I expect that output to be around 20% better in the summer - so about 450km+ should be fairly doable.\n\n\n\nThe public charging network is amazing - there's 45 chargers in my apartment complex parking lot. All pay as you go. Another 10 in my office parking lot. A 100+ super chargers between Hyundai and Tesla in Seoul. And for the road trips, there's fast chargers every 40-50kms on the highways. The car can go from 15% to 80% in under 20 minutes which is sufficient. Korea is not a huge country - the longest drive is Seoul to Busan which is 480kms and can be done with one charge on a Tesla supercharger during a coffee or even a bio break. So I am not too concerned about range or charging.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nI consider myself extremely fortunate to have the privilege of owning and driving a Porsche. It would never have been possible and frankly, even if financially possible, I just wouldn't do it in India. The roads and everything else as well as the insanely high cost makes it a really poor decision to own one.\n\n\n\nI know this is a relatively short ownership review lacking more details. But those details will follow as winter transitions into spring. And spring into summer !!! It all started when I moved from India to South Korea about 20 months back. I had somehow figured out how to convert BH to MH and managed to sell off my M340i because life took an unexpected turn and I ended up in South Korea.The disappointment of the ridiculous pain of converting BH to MH and the financial losses incurred in doing that as well as selling my beloved M340i meant that I had no intention of putting money in a car in a new country.So for quite a bit, I was happy and contended with my Kia K8.

The system will weaken as it moves inland, but will still have cyclone strength as it tracks through the major iron ore mining region of the Pilbara, which hosts global miners including Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group.\n\nIntense rainfall threatens to flood massive open-cut mines and swamp rail lines to ports, potentially disrupting shipments. Iron ore prices in Singapore spiked above $108 a ton on Friday to a four-month high, before easing.\n\nBureau of Meteorology, Australia\n\n@BOM_au\n\nSevere Tropical #CycloneZelia, a category 4 system, is now moving to the south over the inland eastern Pilbara.\n\n#PortHedland is experiencing severe winds but has avoided the very destructive core of the cyclone.\n\nLatest: bom.gov.au/cyclone/\n\nSent via Hootsuite Inc..\n\nView original tweet.\n\n\u201cCategory 5 is top of the scale, it does not get any worse than that,\u201d said Angus Hines, a meteorologist at the bureau. \u201cExtremely damaging and destructive winds, widespread rain, flooding and storm surge are all expected.\u201d\n\nWhile the Pilbara region is a sparsely populated area, the coastal town of Port Hedland has around 16,000 residents. The harbor was shuttered earlier this week along with other regional ports, which also export natural gas.\n\nWestern Australia\u2019s state emergency organizer said on Friday that the storm was creating a threat to lives and homes, urging residents to shelter indoors and warning it was too late to leave buildings.\n\nAustralia is the biggest shipper of iron ore, with the steelmaking material accounting for 21% of total goods and services exports in the year to June 2024, worth A$138 billion ($87.2 billion). Zelia is the first Category 5 cyclone to cross near Port Hedland since George in 2007, according to the bureau.\n\nWhile export ports have been lashed by heavy rain this year from a series of storms, this is the first cyclone of the season to make landfall and threaten mining operations and their rail links. Cyclone Sean damaged a port facility owned by Rio last month, but the storm stayed offshore.\n\nFortescue Ltd. has shut its Iron Bridge mine 145 kilometers south of Port Hedland, according to a spokesperson. The operation produces a high-grade, wet concentrate product that\u2019s sent via pipeline to the harbor for export.\n\nPorts Reopen\n\nBHP and Rio said Thursday they were putting their cyclone preparations in place, which includes suspending non-essential travel. Liquefied natural gas export terminals are also located throughout the region, mainly operated by Woodside Energy Group Ltd. and Chevron Corp.\n\nDampier \u2014 which exports iron ore and LNG \u2014 and Varanus Island have been reopened after inspections of channels and berths, according to Pilbara Ports. Assets operated by Woodside are returning to normal, a spokesperson said.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

And goes without saying it is very sought after by collectors. Affording one is a different story altogether. So what do you do?\n\n\n\nWell, the guys at NH\u1ebeT TV YouTube channel just decided to build one. The whole project took a year to complete and without the use of any high-tech equipment. And that makes it impressive. The entire build took place in Vietnam.\n\n\n\nIt started with a skeleton frame mocked up to create the Jesko's body, which is covered in clay and sculpted like what you would see in an OEM car design studio. Individual fibreglass body panels were made from that, then combined to create a single fiberglass body shell.\n\n\n\nA steel chassis was then fabricated and this included bushings, suspension arms, mounts, and speciality fasteners needed to bolt all the parts together. The frame uses a sophisticated inboard suspension setup, which was tested in a very unsophisticated 10-foot drop from a wrecker.\n\n\n\nA Toyota Camry with a four-cylinder engine was bought for just 100 USD and that along with a manual gearbox powers this replica. The original Jesko has a 5.0 litre twin turbo V8 putting out 1280 hp and 1000 Nm of torque.\n\n\n\nThe replica also uses the Camry's steering and brake system. The car gets only brakes at the rear since the engine and transmission were mounted at the back for this project. This meant the front brakes were installed behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFibreglass was used to craft out the interior, and the best part is that the doors also open in true Koenigsegg style. There is also a body kit and spoiler made from fibreglass.

            "content": "BHP Group Limited is a leading natural resources company based in Melbourne, Australia, with a long and successful history in the mining industry dating back to 1851. BHP is one of the largest companies in Australia, and BHP operates in countries around the world.\n\nThe company is engaged in various mineral exploration, mining and processing activities, including zinc, copper, silver, uranium, molybdenum, gold, iron ore and coal. BHP also has a presence in refining and smelting nickel and potash. They are also engaged in development activities that revolve around the mining industry. The company provides towing, freight, marketing support, finance, marketing and trading, administrative and other services. With a global workforce of over 80,000 people, BHP is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nBHP is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth and demand for commodities. BHP operates in critical growth markets, providing innovation and sustainability. This operating principle has helped BHP become one of the largest mining companies in the world.\n\nBHP has roots in Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP), incorporated in 1885. The first consignment of Broken Hill ore was smelted in Spotswood, Victoria, in June of 1885. In 1915, BHP diversified into steel manufacturing, building a manufacturing facility in Newcastle, New South Wales. In 2001, BHP merged with Billiton, a mining company founded in the 1860s in the Netherlands, becoming BHP Billiton.\n\nIn August 2016, BHP Billiton recorded the worst annual loss in its history, at $6.4 billion. In 2017, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP and announced plans to sell its U.S. shale oil and gas business. In July 2018, BHP Billiton completed the sale of its Fayetteville Onshore U.S. gas assets to a wholly owned subsidiary of Merit Energy Company. In August 2021, BHP announced plans to exit the oil and gas industry by merging its hydrocarbon business with Woodside Petroleum.\n\nBHP has been part of several controversies, such as the Ok Tedi environmental disaster, Bento Rodrigues tailings dam collapse and allegations of drawing waters above the granted limit from aquifers. In response to a sexual harassment and assault investigation in 2021, the company terminated or removed 48 workers from multiple sites.\n\nBHP is constantly striving to ensure responsible and ethical mining activities while also working toward reducing its environmental impact. As a significant player in the natural resources industry, BHP is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for commodities worldwide while continuing to be a leader and innovator in the mining sector.",

Finally sharing the details of our unforgettable Iceland Ring Road trip from August to September 2023. We had initially planned to explore Scandinavia, but life had other plans, and Iceland became our dream destination instead. With busy work schedules, we only managed to book the essentials like tickets, car rental, and visas well in advance. The itinerary? That came together just a week before departure. We watched a few YouTube videos and read some articles at the last moment and decided to explore the rest after reaching there. We just had a rough plan and a few things to do.\n\n\n\nThe Plan\n\n\n\nOur goal was to complete Iceland\u0092s famous Ring Road, starting west, heading south, moving east, and finally up north in a counterclockwise direction. Late summer (Aug-Sep) seemed ideal for fewer crowds and relatively mild weather. Packing two big trolleys of warm clothes, Indian masalas, and ready-to-eat MTR packs, we set off. We opted for Lufthansa premium economy, extra legroom, minimum layover time, and the same operator for both flights; it was worth the splurge.\n\n\n\nCar Booking - The Sad Story\n\n\n\nEven though I was excited about exploring the beautiful landscapes of Iceland, I was even more excited about driving in that terrain; so picking the right car was key for me. Since Iceland is a friendly country for camping, we decided not to book hotels separately and started exploring the camper van options to begin with. The most common ones are two-seaters with a bed instead of rear seats, like Renault Kangoo, Dacia Dokker, etc. These are available both in automatic and manual transmissions. However, they are only front-wheel drive (FWD), except a few VW and only one Pajero, which have beds in the rear and also 4X4. I wasn\u0092t too keen on driving those small vans and wanted to try out some 4X4. The VW was more like a Van and missed the Pajero only by a day. Since it was the end of summer, we got some exciting offers for GLE, Defender, and Land Cruisers from Hertz, but without rooftop tents well within my budget.\n\nWe found out that there are a lot of options to rent the camping gear separately, like beds, and I wanted to check if it\u0092s possible to fold the rear seats and make a flatbed in these cars. I was quite sure it would be convenient, but I still wanted to check if Hertz would allow me to camp inside the car. So, I wrote an email. Their reply was, \u0093It\u0092s ok with us, however, some campsites will have rules against sleeping inside the car\u0094 which we later realized wasn\u0092t true, at least not in Iceland. Disappointed after seeing the reply, I started exploring more options with rooftop tents and found the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV on\n\n\n\nIt\u0092s a plug-in hybrid vehicle with a pure electric range of 40 km, twin-motor 4WD system with Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC). It comes with a 2.0 Ltr 4-Cylinder engine with 2 electric motors, one at each axle. It also has heated seats and steering, which are very useful in Icelandic weather conditions. A super easy, no-nonsense car to live with, it gave no trouble throughout the trip. I was recommended to use 95 octane fuel, but not to worry, every fuel station in Iceland only has 95 octane gas. Fuel prices were approximately 180-190 INR per litre.\n\n\n\nThe Travel\n\n\n\nWe picked our flight from Chennai to Reykjav\u00edk via Frankfurt. Our preferred carrier for domestic was, as always, Indigo (mostly on time). We traveled from Coimbatore to Chennai, made sure we had a backup flight in case of any cancellation, so we reached Chennai airport well in advance. We went out and had dinner at Murugan Idli Shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: 29/8/23 Grindavik \u0096 The Start\n\n\n\nUpon arrival, the car rental guy picked us up at the Reykjav\u00edk Airport in a Mercedes Vito Tourer, their office very close to the Airport. We got our Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV equipped with a pop-up tent, sleeping bags, a foldable table, chairs, a stove, an ice cooler, utensils, and Wi-Fi. He was so friendly and we started making a good conversation, that\u0092s when I realized there is no such rule not to sleep inside the car. He rightly pointed out that all the small campers are typically offering the same. I was cursing my luck for missing out on driving a Defender, which is one of my dream SUVs to own.\n\nAfter a safety briefing (and a heads-up about upcoming rain and wind alerts), he also introduced us to the website vedur.is to keep an eye on the weather, especially wind. He warned us about a windy day ahead next week and asked us not to take any chances using the rooftop tent. He suggested we either sleep inside the car (by folding the second row) or book a hotel room. We grabbed a quick lunch at a burger joint, stocked up on groceries, and reached Grindavik for our first camp night. The place lived up to its great reviews, a lively spot where travelers exchange tips and even leave behind extra supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner was a comforting Muttai Kolambu (egg curry - with our own masala, which really lit up a lot of fellow campers). A friendly couple from the Netherlands couldn\u0092t resist the smell, tasted our curry, and fell in love with it. Afterward, we started working on a detailed itinerary, keeping an eye on the weather using vedur, and decided to revise our travel plan due to the weather alerts. Instead of going counterclockwise, we pivoted to clockwise to experience the north before the heavy rain hit.\n\n\n\nCampsite image from Google:\n\n\n\n\n\nPopup Tent - How to close - Please watch it in 3X speed:\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s4fTSL9Js6g\n\nDay 2: 30/8/23 West Iceland Highlights\n\n\n\nB\u00fa\u00f0akirkja: A quaint black church surrounded by lava fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nGatklettur: A stunning rock arch by the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nSv\u00f6rtuloft Lighthouse and Ingjaldsh\u00f3lskirkja: Picturesque spots perfect for photography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngjaldsh\u00f3lskirkja: Beautiful road with a church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirkjufell: The iconic \"Windows screensaver\" mountain (the most photographed mountain in Iceland).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ended the day at the Grundarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur camp, conveniently located near a swimming pool.

But now, data shows that in many parts of the world\u2014especially in wealthier nations like Japan, much of Europe, and North America\u2014population decline has already begun. In Japan, for example, the country is losing about 100 people every hour. Countries are witnessing fertility rates drop well below replacement levels as societies transition from agrarian to industrial and service-based economies. Women now have more choices regarding education and careers, which means fewer children per family.\n\n\n\nWhy It\u2019s Surprising\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that some experts predicted our global numbers could reach 12.3 billion.

Less human activity could mean reduced overall resource consumption and lower pressure on natural ecosystems. But the reality isn\u2019t so straightforward. While the headcount may drop, the per capita consumption in wealthier countries is sky-high. In fact, individuals in developed nations tend to have a much larger carbon footprint than those in poorer regions. Also, as populations age, older adults sometimes end up consuming more energy (think larger, less energy-efficient homes and increased healthcare demands).\n\n\n\nEconomic and Social Implications\n\n\n\nBeyond the environmental debate, there are significant economic challenges. A shrinking workforce can lead to labor shortages, increased pressure on social support systems, and more intense competition for skilled workers. Migration policies might shift as countries scramble to balance their demographic scales, which could further complicate environmental and economic landscapes. This I think is the biggest worry of the likes of Musk.\n\n\n\nSo, Is a Falling Population a Good Thing?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag. On one hand, a smaller population could ease some environmental pressures if we also change consumption habits and decouple economic growth from environmental damage. On the other hand, without reforms in energy use, infrastructure, and global migration, the benefits might be offset by increased per capita emissions and the economic strains of an aging society.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\n\nGlobal population growth is slowing, with some regions already experiencing declines. While fewer people might lessen our overall impact on the environment, high per capita consumption and an aging population introduce new challenges.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think? Could this demographic transition lead to a more sustainable future, or are there hidden pitfalls we need to prepare for?\n\n\n\nI personally believe in the power of nature. With the exploding economies and globalization, climate change is one phenomenon that is indirectly linked to over population and if we have a steady decline in population going forward, it could mean a breather for mother earth to heal itself from the ill effects of over consumption, industrialization and emissions. I see the declining population growth as Nature's way of healing iself.\n\n\n\nOfcourse its not as black and white it seems, but for me this is a positive overall Development, irrespective of what Elon Musk thinks\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts! \u201cPopulation collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.

            "content": "Amby955 Newbie\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2023 Location: United Kingdom Posts: 11 Thanked: 130 Times\n\nMy Suzuki Alto (A-Star) in the UK My Suzuki Alto (A-Star in India) in the UK\n\n\n\nThis is while doing Masters in England, circa 2021-2024. Being a guy with liking to cars, the first thing I did after settling in was apply for a UK driver\u0092s license as soon as I became eligible (six months after arrival). It took another six months to clear the tests (in first try with zero faults ), thanks to the long waiting periods. Main purpose of getting a drivers license was to continue renting cars, which I did earlier with my international license and which is valid only for a year. However, my urge for driving wouldn\u0092t let me stop at rentals\u0097I needed my own car.\n\n\n\nI always had access to cars/bikes in India, and living without one was not easy, this obviously increased the urge of buying one. Although the smart idea was to continue renting cars as needed, my heart thought different. Anyway, as fate would have it, I went with my heart and decided to buy a car, but on a strict student budget, I needed something affordable and practical that wouldn\u0092t become a financial burden.\n\n\n\nSo I created a checklist to help me narrow down my options:\n\n1. Small engine: Ideally around 1,000cc to stay in the lowest tax bracket.\n\n2. Two-door car: Lower insurance costs compared to full size cars.\n\n3. Fresh MOT: To avoid immediate maintenance.\n\n4. ULEZ compliance: No extra spends other than the necessary expenses.\n\n5. Brands considered: Toyota, Ford, Suzuki, Citro\u00ebn, and Peugeot for their affordability and low running costs. Toyota, Citro\u00ebn, and Peugeot had the same car under different badges called the Aygo/C1/107.\n\n\n\nThe car hunt began with no fixed timeline. If the right car came along, I\u0092d buy it\u0097otherwise, I\u0092d manage without one. I enjoyed the process of searching cars more than the actual buying. Most options considered with the above checklist were disappointing: high-mileage examples with over 100,000 miles on the odometer, often in poor condition. I was okay with the high mileages but often these older cars were not cared for in the UK, provided the extremely cheap used prices for these vehicles. Beyond my check list, I did not have any demands in terms of features of the car, any bare minimum car was fine for me.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I do not have pictures of all the cars I test drove or looked at.\n\n\n\nUltimately, I found a 2011 Suzuki Alto with only 30,000 miles at a price that seemed too good to be true. And as expected the car was an insurance write off from an accident with a CAT S category, meaning it had structural damages from the crash. It was freshly repaired at a garage specialized in buying and repairing insurance write-offs. It had a replaced passenger-side door and a dent on the running board, this running board damage made the made it CAT S, but this did not raise any major red flags for me as long as it was repaid correctly. Did a short test ride and the car felt good, something similar from Marutis back in India and I felt confident with the car. Did find some minor issues including a bad alignment, bearing noise and no service history. But car seemed good and it had a fresh MOT, and they worked on the brakes before the MOT, car also had a good MOT history and the car was rust free. So, I shook hands and purchased the car on Valentine\u0092s Day, of all days! Today is yet another valentines Day, 2 years since.\n\n\n\nAfter sorting the ownership transfer and arranging insurance, I took delivery of the car in a couple of days with some of my friends. A quick stop for fuel and a short drive later, it was off to the garage for wheel bearing work, minor brake adjustments, and fixing a leaky windshield washer reservoir. Once these were sorted, I had a perfectly functional Suzuki Alto at my disposal.\n\n\n\nLiving with the Alto\n\nOwning this car turned out to be an incredible experience. I drove nearly 30,000 miles in a year, which is my personal best in any of the vehicles I have owned. The car felt familiar, and performed very well for its size, even cruising comfortably at 70 mph (max speeds in UK motorways) with a full load. It has travelled the breadth and length of England, in the short time I owned it.\n\n\n\nOwnership was a care free experience with just oil and filter changes every 5000 miles. For me the crash damage did not bother much and as expected the accident history did not give any issues. One thing I never fixed was the AC, it never worked on the car and I did not bother to fix as the climate was mostly cool expect for just a few weeks of unbearable heat every year and heater worked just fine.\n\n\n\nAs a decade old car and the kind of miles it was doing, I always carried some spares like a couple of bulbs, fuses, a set of wipers, bit of fluids and a decent tool set along with an emergency kit to stay warm if stuck somewhere. Fortunately, I only had to use some bulbs and wipers as the replacement.\n\nI always made sure the car was maintained perfectly on the mechanical end of things, and on the other hand I did not bother on the cosmetic end on things. To be fair the car looked decent cosmetically expect for a few dents from banging doors while parked, thanks to small parking bays. I could live with that, also never bothered to wash my car, I have done a total of 3 washes during the time, 2 of them after some really cold weather and the other for MOT. Just before selling the car, bought a \u00a32 dent removal tool over temu and pulled them back and the car looked just fine with another proper wash for the new owner.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nI always took my car to this garage that was run by an older gentleman, he took great care of the car. After doing the first 1000 miles, I gave the car for a service to change all the fluids, sparkplugs, filters and gave it an overall checkup. This was done due to the lack of service history. From then on, I did general oil and filter changes every 5000 miles.\n\n\n\nApart from routine general service, here\u0092s what I did:\n\n1. Replaced all four tires, 3 of them for wear and tear and the 4th one tore while maneuvering to get on a footpath for parking, common way of parking in the UK.\n\n2. Replaced some fused bulbs occasionally (expected for an older car).\n\n3. Replaced a broken blower resistor.\n\n4. Changed wipers a few times.\n\n5. Never bothered to fix the AC as the heater worked fine. And the climate did not demand AC.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, although the car was made in India (A-Star), some parts were different. For example, I brought a gearbox drain plug and fuel filter from India, only to find they didn\u0092t fit this model.\n\n\n\nOne other interesting fact, the car had JK spare tire.\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\nI opted for third-party insurance to keep costs low and the value of the car did not matter much to justify a comprehensive insurance, any small claim would total the car. I had to adjust my mileage limit multiple times as my driving increased. A dashcam was also installed\u0097not for insurance purposes, but just for safety. Of all the costs with the car, insurance was the most expensive.\n\n\n\nThings I Loved About the Alto\n\n1. Fantastic value for money\u0097the main reason I bought it.\n\n2. Surprisingly capable on highways, handling 70 mph with ease.\n\n3. Fuel efficiency: the best I got was 14 miles per liter on motorways.\n\n4. Minimal maintenance costs and low annual tax (\u00a320).\n\n5. ULEZ compliance meant no extra fees in major cities.\n\n\n\nThe Farewell\n\nAs fate would have it, my time in the UK have come to an end after completing my Masters and securing a job back in India. That meant, it was time to bid farewell to that beautiful country, great friends and of course NU11 HMH (Alto). But the memories of this car and the drives me and my friends had on that car will always stay alive as good ol memories!! Anyway, after this 30,000+ miles of joyful ownership, I sold the car to a friend of mine for almost the same price I paid\u0097great value, I would say. That checklist really did work out, I guess. Despite moving back to India, I still cherish the memories I made with this Alto. I still use the NU11 HMH (Alto) keychain on my new ride here in India, a small reminder of a car that gave me so much joy (Pic Attached).\n\n\n\nNow, back in India, instead of taking the conventional route and buying a car, I decided it was now or never for experiencing a motorcycle. So now I own a RE Hunter 350. The experience to this day has been great with the bike but there are changes, I had a blast driving in the UK with friends, it was filled with jokes, laughs, trolls, songs and what not. But today I ride alone, enjoying the peace, road and the machine for hours on end, that\u0092s pure joy too.\n\n\n\nYou can read a brief about the bike journey here:\n\n\n\nBelow are pictures to pleasure your eyes (Me flexing on TBHP t-shirt with Alto reg on):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly thing left of the Alto\n\n\n\nThis is while doing Masters in England, circa 2021-2024.

And as expected the car was an insurance write off from an accident with a CAT S category, meaning it had structural damages from the crash. It was freshly repaired at a garage specialized in buying and repairing insurance write-offs. It had a replaced passenger-side door and a dent on the running board, this running board damage made the made it CAT S, but this did not raise any major red flags for me as long as it was repaid correctly. Did a short test ride and the car felt good, something similar from Marutis back in India and I felt confident with the car. Did find some minor issues including a bad alignment, bearing noise and no service history. But car seemed good and it had a fresh MOT, and they worked on the brakes before the MOT, car also had a good MOT history and the car was rust free. So, I shook hands and purchased the car on Valentine\u0092s Day, of all days! Today is yet another valentines Day, 2 years since.After sorting the ownership transfer and arranging insurance, I took delivery of the car in a couple of days with some of my friends. A quick stop for fuel and a short drive later, it was off to the garage for wheel bearing work, minor brake adjustments, and fixing a leaky windshield washer reservoir. Once these were sorted, I had a perfectly functional Suzuki Alto at my disposal.Owning this car turned out to be an incredible experience. I drove nearly 30,000 miles in a year, which is my personal best in any of the vehicles I have owned. The car felt familiar, and performed very well for its size, even cruising comfortably at 70 mph (max speeds in UK motorways) with a full load. It has travelled the breadth and length of England, in the short time I owned it.Ownership was a care free experience with just oil and filter changes every 5000 miles. For me the crash damage did not bother much and as expected the accident history did not give any issues. One thing I never fixed was the AC, it never worked on the car and I did not bother to fix as the climate was mostly cool expect for just a few weeks of unbearable heat every year and heater worked just fine.As a decade old car and the kind of miles it was doing, I always carried some spares like a couple of bulbs, fuses, a set of wipers, bit of fluids and a decent tool set along with an emergency kit to stay warm if stuck somewhere. Fortunately, I only had to use some bulbs and wipers as the replacement.I always made sure the car was maintained perfectly on the mechanical end of things, and on the other hand I did not bother on the cosmetic end on things. To be fair the car looked decent cosmetically expect for a few dents from banging doors while parked, thanks to small parking bays. I could live with that, also never bothered to wash my car, I have done a total of 3 washes during the time, 2 of them after some really cold weather and the other for MOT. Just before selling the car, bought a \u00a32 dent removal tool over temu and pulled them back and the car looked just fine with another proper wash for the new owner.I always took my car to this garage that was run by an older gentleman, he took great care of the car. After doing the first 1000 miles, I gave the car for a service to change all the fluids, sparkplugs, filters and gave it an overall checkup. This was done due to the lack of service history. From then on, I did general oil and filter changes every 5000 miles.Apart from routine general service, here\u0092s what I did:1. Replaced all four tires, 3 of them for wear and tear and the 4th one tore while maneuvering to get on a footpath for parking, common way of parking in the UK.2. Replaced some fused bulbs occasionally (expected for an older car).3. Replaced a broken blower resistor.4. Changed wipers a few times.5. Never bothered to fix the AC as the heater worked fine. And the climate did not demand AC.Interestingly, although the car was made in India (A-Star), some parts were different. For example, I brought a gearbox drain plug and fuel filter from India, only to find they didn\u0092t fit this model.One other interesting fact, the car had JK spare tire.I opted for third-party insurance to keep costs low and the value of the car did not matter much to justify a comprehensive insurance, any small claim would total the car. I had to adjust my mileage limit multiple times as my driving increased. A dashcam was also installed\u0097not for insurance purposes, but just for safety. Of all the costs with the car, insurance was the most expensive.Things I Loved About the Alto1. Fantastic value for money\u0097the main reason I bought it.2. Surprisingly capable on highways, handling 70 mph with ease.3. Fuel efficiency: the best I got was 14 miles per liter on motorways.4. Minimal maintenance costs and low annual tax (\u00a320).5. ULEZ compliance meant no extra fees in major cities.As fate would have it, my time in the UK have come to an end after completing my Masters and securing a job back in India. That meant, it was time to bid farewell to that beautiful country, great friends and of course NU11 HMH (Alto). But the memories of this car and the drives me and my friends had on that car will always stay alive as good ol memories!! Anyway, after this 30,000+ miles of joyful ownership, I sold the car to a friend of mine for almost the same price I paid\u0097great value, I would say. That checklist really did work out, I guess. Despite moving back to India, I still cherish the memories I made with this Alto. I still use the NU11 HMH (Alto) keychain on my new ride here in India, a small reminder of a car that gave me so much joy (Pic Attached).Now, back in India, instead of taking the conventional route and buying a car, I decided it was now or never for experiencing a motorcycle. So now I own a RE Hunter 350. The experience to this day has been great with the bike but there are changes, I had a blast driving in the UK with friends, it was filled with jokes, laughs, trolls, songs and what not. But today I ride alone, enjoying the peace, road and the machine for hours on end, that\u0092s pure joy too.You can read a brief about the bike journey here: https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/motor...ml#post5914775 (Royal Enfield Hunter 350 ownership review) Below are pictures to pleasure your eyes (Me flexing on TBHP t-shirt with Alto reg on):Only thing left of the Alto",

The cyclone has strengthened to a Category 2 and is likely to develop into a Category 3 before landfall.\n\nPort Hedland, Australia\u2019s biggest iron ore export harbor that\u2019s utilized by BHP Group and Fortescue Ltd., will close at 6 p.m. local time on Wednesday.

Fortescue said the company was following the directive from the port, without elaborating further.\n\nA series of cyclones have dumped heavy rain across the Pilbara region this year and disrupted iron ore operations, even damaging a port facility operated by mining heavyweight Rio Tinto Group. Further downpours on already saturated ground could lead to flash flooding and put vital rail links to ports at risk.\n\nRio, which ships iron ore from terminals to the southwest of Port Hedland, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nZelia is set to be the first cyclone to cross the Australian coast this season, which runs from November through to the end of April. It will be the latest landfall during a season since Tropical Cyclone Blanche in March 2017.\n\nPhotograph: An autonomous haul truck dumps a load of rock in the mine pit at Rio Tinto\u2019s Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, on Thursday, 19th Oct , 2023.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against the other long term ASX stocks.\n\nVanguard believes that Australia's economy remains well-placed to recover gradually in 2025 after the broader economy witnessed its slowest growth in 32 years in 2024 amid sticky inflation and higher interest rates. The investment firm expects modest improvement in economic momentum, courtesy of higher real household incomes as inflation subsides. Furthermore, a rebounding housing market and expectations of rate cuts might also provide some support.\n\nKey Indicators Likely to Shape Australia's Economy in 2025\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept the policy rate target unchanged at 4.35% on December 10. However, the bank noted that it continues to see signs of inflation moving sustainably towards the target. That being said, Vanguard expects that RBA will remain patient and that a tight labor market is expected to keep RBA from initiating rate cuts until Q2 2025. Furthermore, stagnant labor productivity has been contributing to higher inflation.\n\nThe employment-to-population ratio of 64.5%, and the labor force participation rate of 67.1% both were at record levels in December 2024. With the broader economy remaining close to full capacity, businesses are required to hire, which can keep the labor market tight and unit labor costs at elevated levels, opines Vanguard. Notably, the unemployment rate increased to a seasonally adjusted 4.0% in December, reflecting a rise from 3.9% in November. The investment firm anticipates that the unemployment rate can rise to ~4.6% in 2025 due to tightened financial conditions amidst higher interest rates.\n\nOutlook on Australian Equities\n\nAs per Paul Taylor, Portfolio Manager at Fidelity International, the long-term prospects for Australian equities are promising thanks to numerous structural tailwinds. Notably, population growth fueled by immigration and the associated increase in consumption offer a robust foundation for economic expansion. The persistent service sector inflation is expected to be a critical indicator for RBA to monitor. If the service inflation begins to ease, it can hint at the potential for rate cuts, providing relief for younger Australians witnessing higher mortgage costs and higher living costs.\n\nFurthermore, Taylor believes that the relationship between China and the Trump administration is expected to be critical. If China responds through fiscal stimulus measures to aid the domestic economy, Australian materials companies might benefit. This is due to strong linkages between China's economy and the broader Australian materials sector.",

He has a deep understanding of organisational transformation and brings a very strong focus on the customer and technology as a driver of change.\n\nRoss is currently the Lead Independent Director of Reece Limited and a Non-executive Director on the Board of QinetiQ Group Plc.\n\nRoss McEwan said, \u201cIt is an honour and privilege to succeed Ken MacKenzie as Chair of BHP.

Ken will be remembered for his strategic decision-making, active institutional and retail shareholder engagement and outstanding capacity to see value, whether that\u2019s in strategy, portfolio, operational excellence or capital allocation.\n\nAs incoming Chair, I am committed to generating long-term value for all our shareholders and will work tirelessly with the Board and management to achieve this.\n\nI look forward to continuing to take this great company forward.\u201d",

            "content": "Driving the BMW iX1 LWB eDrive 20\n\nBMW has moved from the dual motor setup of the outgoing iX1 to a single-motor front-wheel drive setup for the 2025 iX1 LWB. The motor makes 201 BHP and 250 Nm and the car's claimed 0-100 km/h time is 8.6 seconds. The battery capacity remains the same at 66.4 kWh and the car has a claimed range of 531 km. Now that the specifications are out of the way, let\u2019s get to the driving part. Right from the get-go, you will appreciate the smoothness of the motor. That is not unexpected as EVs, in general, are known to provide a very smooth driving experience. The calibration of the accelerator is also nice which makes the car pretty easy to drive. Your morning commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic should be comfortable.\n\nThe iX1 gets drive modes which can be accessed by pressing a button on the center console. However, this button only opens up the drive mode selector on the touchscreen. You now have to shift to the screen to select the desired drive mode. I found this to be cumbersome. Once you are in the menu, you can select the efficient mode which is perfect for the city. It dulls the accelerator response and hence, makes the driving experience smoother. There\u2019s still enough punch in the motor to tackle the city traffic and make quick overtakes.\n\nOut on the highway is where you can flex your right foot and get to feel some of that instant torque from the electric motor. Of course, it is not as fast as the outgoing iX1 as it doesn\u2019t have the dual motor setup anymore, but it\u2019s still quick. When in D, tap the transmission selector down one more time to activate B mode. This is where you get the maximum power from the motor and can feel the full potential. Yes, it drains the battery that much faster, but by selecting Sport mode from the screen and B mode on the selector, you got yourself a quick car. You even hear the motor in the cabin deploying all that power to the front wheels. Highway overtakes are handled with ease and you don\u2019t have to think twice. Compared to some of the other cars in the segment, the iX1 isn\u2019t as quick, but it still has enough power for Indian roads.\n\nRegenerative Braking\n\nYou can adjust the regenerative braking in the iX1, but it\u2019s not easily accessible like a button on the centre console or paddle shifters. You have to do it through the touchscreen which can get annoying while driving. There are 4 modes of regenerative braking to choose from \u2013 Low, Moderate, High and Adaptive. In the adaptive setting, the car decides the amount of regeneration needed as per the throttle inputs. I didn\u2019t find this mode to be very intuitive and preferred having the car in low regeneration mode. In the B mode, one-pedal driving is activated.\n\nNoise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)\n\nAs expected of an EV, the cabin is super quiet. The only noise you will hear in the cabin is the motor noise when you press down the accelerator. There\u2019s also a silent mode (in the drive modes) which, as the name suggests, makes everything go silent. You can hear a bit of tyre noise when driving at 100 km/h, but it\u2019s not excessive.\n\nBonnet gets insulation underneath:\n\nRange\n\nBMW claims an MIDC range of 531 km, but in a real-world scenario, you can expect a range of 400-450km, which is fair. Within the efficient mode, there\u2019s an option of maximizing the range which can be used when you\u2019re running low on battery. In this mode, the maximum speed is limited to 90 km/h and the air conditioner's performance is also reduced. In case you run out of charge, BMW has an RSA service that will rescue you with a portable fast charger.\n\nCharging\n\nTo charge the 66.4 kWh battery pack, there are AC and DC charging options. It takes 6 hours and 30 minutes to charge the battery from 0-100% with a 11 kW AC charger. When it comes to DC fast charging, the iX1 can use a 130 kW charger, which takes 29 minutes to charge the battery from 10-80%. With a 50 kW DC fast charger, you will be able to get a 100 km range in about 19 minutes.\n\nThrough the My BMW app, you can plan your charging spots on your road trip route. BMW has set up about 300 chargers at various resorts and corporate parks around India. Apart from these, there are about 5,000 3rd party chargers that have been verified by BMW which will show up on the app as well. You can even pre-book your charger through the app. The payment is to be made through the app and if you\u2019re not very tech-savvy, customer care allows you to pay through a link.\n\nCharging port is located in the same location as the fuel filler of the ICE version:\n\nSuspension\n\nRide Comfort\n\nWhen we drove the X1 diesel, we found its suspension to be compliant. It was on the stiffer side, but comfortable enough. In most cases, when the electric vehicle is based on the IC engine platform, the suspension is stiffened up to account for the heavy battery placed in the floor. This makes the ride quality pretty stiff and you feel everything on the road. This is the case with the iX1 as well. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it which is why you feel a lot of the road. While driving around in the city, small to medium-sized potholes are handled fairly well, but you still feel them in the cabin. There is also noticeable body movement when going over bad roads. Build up some speed and like most European cars, the ride gets better. However, you still feel the expansion joints and undulations. The 18-inch wheels with 225/55 section tyres aren\u2019t that big of a contributor to the stiffness. The chassis itself is firm which contributes to the stiff ride.\n\nHandling & Dynamics\n\nStraight line stability is great and the car feels solid while doing highway speeds. The car masks speed with ease and you can cruise at triple-digit speeds till the charge runs out. You do need to be mindful of the expansion joints and sudden dips on the highways as you feel them in the cabin. The iX1 with its long wheelbase and only a front wheel drive configuration is obviously not as sporty as the outgoing car which had a shorter wheelbase and an all-wheel-drive configuration. However, in its own right, the iX1 handles well. The front end is sharp and eager to turn in. On high-speed curves, the car holds its line well and doesn\u2019t lose composure. The 225/55 R18 Bridgestone Turanza tyres provide enough grip for the power on tap. The iX1, however, doesn\u2019t feel like a car you would want to go pushing hard around corners. It is big and not as engaging to drive as some of the other BMWs.\n\nSteering\n\nThe electric power steering of the iX1 is super light which makes it a breeze to use in the city. Most people will appreciate the light steering with the electric motor as you get a very smooth driving experience. The steering weighs up on the highway and you can stiffen it up even more by switching to Sport mode. It doesn\u2019t feel nervous while cruising on the highways. While the steering is accurate and fairly direct, it feels light even in Sport mode and lacks feedback. As mentioned earlier, this is a car you wouldn\u2019t want to drive very hard.\n\nBraking\n\nLike most EVs, the brake pedal has a spongy feel to it and doesn't feel very progressive. However, the all-wheel disc brake setup provides good braking performance. Even under hard braking, the car comes to a halt without any drama.\n\nContinue reading the discussion on the BMW iX1 LWB on our forum.",

            "content": "BHPian wheelspinner recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI'm at that stage in my career where the dream of owning a luxury car is starting to feel a little less distant, but the reality of EMIs and general life responsibilities is definitely keeping me grounded. Like many others, I'm juggling the desire for a little automotive indulgence with the need for financial prudence.\n\nWe've all heard the saying, \"owning a luxury car is like raising an elephant.\" (haathi paalna). The costs, both upfront and ongoing, are significantly higher than your average hatchback. You see folks driving around in humble Altos while probably having enough wealth to own and maintain several supercars, and then you see others stretching themselves thin just to keep up appearances. I'm aiming for a sweet spot in between \u2013 a luxury car that enhances my life without emptying my bank account.\n\nSo, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of the BHPian community \u2013 those who have already taken the plunge into the world of luxury car ownership. I'd love to hear your experiences and insights, particularly on the following:\n\nFinancial Planning: How did you approach the financial planning process for buying your luxury car? What were the key considerations you factored in (e.g., depreciation, insurance, maintenance)?\n\nIncome Threshold: What would you consider a comfortable income level to comfortably own and maintain a luxury car in India? (This is, of course, subjective and depends on lifestyle, but a ballpark figure would be helpful).\n\nCareer/Business Strategy: What do you do for a living? (Feel free to be vague if you prefer). What career moves or business strategies helped you reach a point where luxury car ownership was attainable?\n\nGeneral Advice: What's your overall advice to younger professionals who are working hard and aspiring to own a luxury car someday? Are there any common pitfalls to avoid? Should they even be considering it at this stage of their lives?\n\nI understand this is a personal topic, but I believe your shared experiences can provide invaluable guidance to those of us still on the journey. Your insights could potentially make a huge difference in how we approach our financial goals and automotive aspirations.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your perspectives!\n\nCheers,\n\nwheelspinner\n\n\n\nHere's what GTO had to say on the matter:\n\nNever, ever overspend or over-stretch. Enjoy your cars, but spend on them well within your means. When I could afford a Mercedes, I bought a City. When I could afford a BMW, I bought a Civic. When I could afford a new S-Class, I bought a used 5-Series.\n\n\n\nLuxury car EMIs should NEVER affect your lifestyle (the way you live, the way your house is run, education, shopping, entertainment, holidays). Give me a \"loaded\" lifestyle over a \"loaded\" car any which day. A luxury car is the ultimate discretionary purchase and trust me, I've had the best times of my life (whether at the age of 21 or 47) in a 4-lakh rupee Jeep and 7-lakh rupee City Vtec as much as I have in a 530d or C220d or an M5. For petrolheads, the car we own is everything, but that doesn't mean we should only find pleasure in fast luxury cars. I love my 20-lakh rupee Thar as much as the BMW. In the recent past, I've truly enjoyed cars like the C3 Turbo, Curvv EV and so on. My best road-trips were in the Safari Facelift, 5-door Gurkha and Thar Roxx (admittedly, the recent fun one was in a Range Rover).\n\n\n\nThere is no such rule that the more money you'll spend on a car, the more fun you'll have with it.\n\n\n\nLuxury cars provide one with a lot of driving pleasure, pride of ownership & admiration of the build, interior quality etc. They indeed are a class apart. On the other hand, when you own a luxury car in India, you officially become part of the \"rip off\" club. Everything is expensive! Big, fast 6-cylinder sedans & SUVs require new tyres costing Rs 70,000 every 20,000 - 25,000 km. Headlights cost 50k in the aftermarket and 1-lakh at the dealer. Once your E-Class or 5-Series is out of warranty coverage, you will be spending anywhere between 1 - 2 lakhs on it every year.\n\nI prefer buying pre-owned luxury cars only as their depreciation falls off a cliff at the 3 year mark, and I have frequently seen \"almost new\" used cars for 50% of the MRP. These cars also age very well & slowly. Many of us BHPians own 8 - 10 year old German cars that still drive fantastic. Getting a 3 - 5 year old luxury car that's well maintained and with the km reading <40,000 or 50,000 km is ideal.\n\nHere's what BHPian Axe77 had to say on the matter:\n\nIf you have to think about whether or not to purchase a luxury car very very carefully, it\u2019s likely premature and ill advised. I like what Ankur\u2019s video above said (saw a few snippets of it) and also agree with most of what GTO said above. I have bought luxury cars outright as well as on loan for different reasons. Personally, I bought my first luxury car (BMW 3GT) at age 38 or so, without a loan. I had just bought my current house back then on a loan just about a year or so prior but at that time didn\u2019t want yet another loan for a car. Its only in the last few years, (Meridian 2022; GLC 2024 and 1300GS 2025) that I have taken a little bit of loan for these vehicles) but that is mostly because I can get some tax benefit on the interest paid on vehicle loans and for liquidity and investment management. Given my age, I have limited these loan tenors to 3 years instead of the more common 4-5 years. I hate the idea of these 7 year loans etc for something like a car. If you genuinely require such a long tenor to be able to fund the purchase, you should likely downgrade the ticket size. A few general pointers on luxury car ownership IMHO: They should only be made basis a solid financial bedrock. They are amongst the last lines of splurging. I always say, stretch a little more than you can afford if buying a home and buy a little lower than you can afford when buying a car.\n\nAny extraordinary expense on the vehicle (not inconceivable with these high end cars) should not upset your finances or cause you to unduly sweat.\n\nEarly years of earning should be heavily biased towards prudent investments as they will reap you rewards via compounding in later years.\n\nIf anything turns for the unexpected (job loss, decision to stop earning, any similar change of circumstance), you should have enough liquid investments to be able to simply cut a cheque and retire the loan or continue servicing the EMIs without it compromising your lifestyle on other essentials.\n\nVehicles should not comprise more than 10% of your net worth if you are younger (say sub 40) and not more than 5% of your net worth if you\u2019re above 40. In saying 5 or 10%, I mean the MRP of the car not the down payment you\u2019re making.\n\nEven if you are an enthusiast there are enough and more ways to enjoy a great vehicle without breaking the bank. There can be great enthusiast cars that can be had at fantastic prices - a VW Polo GT TSI, a Thar, a Vento .. and so many others. Sure none of these are an M340i or a Defender or a Mini Cooper but they can provide plenty fun in their own right. The occasional experience of a German can be had via rentals either here or abroad. You don\u2019t necessarily need to plonk permanent big money into one if you\u2019re not ready for it yet.\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "shankar.balan Senior - BHPian\n\n\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2008 Location: Bangalore Posts: 11,654 Thanked: 26,143 Times\n\nView My Garage\n\n\n\nInfractions: 0/1 (4)\n\nRe: Mahindra BE 6 Review Here are some blistering first impressions of my 45 minute interaction with the Mahindra BE 6 today.\n\n\n\nI am a bit adrenaline filled after the drive hence do forgive the relative incoherence.\n\n\n\nWhen I reached home today, I got a call saying the Sireesh guys were in my vicinity and upon my confirmation, they were good enough to come to my place and give me a doorstep test drive.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle is really something else!\n\n\n\nI first sat in the back with their executive driving. Because I was concerned about rear headroom.\n\nBut Im glad to report plainly that my fears were unfounded - there is no problem with headroom at the rear and at the front despite my 6ft 2 inches height. Yes at rear maybe there is 3/4th inch between the top of my head and the roofline.\n\n\n\nThe Rear seat under thigh support though, is definitely lacking. Needs 3 inches more on the squab for sure. Front seats too, if they had increased under thigh support by just 2 inches it would have been heaven. But the support given by the seats is very good. I found them really comfortable and snug. Excellent for long distances. Lower back and shoulder support too seems adequate. I found the headrests cool and functional for my height.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle offers plenty of legroom and one is very relaxed driving it. Driving comfort is further enhanced with the tilt and telescopic steering adjust which makes it just right.\n\n\n\nIts a very good looking vehicle when viewed in person. Performance is really very good. Rear wheel drive so no torque steer. Excellent power delivery. Frankly the performance in \u0091Everyday\u0092 mode is more than adequate for normal folks.\n\n\n\nThe regen feels nice but is not as aggressive as in my Kona. Yes the Kona\u0092s Torque from the get go is way more. That is absolutely clear the moment one presses the accelerator. But this BE6 is impressive all the same.\n\n\n\nLooks like the range is very worthy at 580kms. (Real world maybe 500) Can do Bangalore Madurai on one charge I think, which says a lot.\n\n\n\nGround clearance at approx 200mm is more than adequate for India. The giant 19 inch wheels make it look a bit \u0091Hotwheels\u0092. There is an option to go 20 inches too! Big 245 size tyres with tall sidewalls make the wheel wells look very well filled indeed.\n\n\n\nRide and handling are excellent. Takes curves fearlessly. Chassis tuning is really good - dare I invoke the hallowed name of \u0091Lotus\u0092?\n\n\n\nIt eats the Bangalore bumps and sharp speed breakers with aplomb. Suspension tuning is really good.\n\n\n\nYes it\u0092s a bit wide and large for our narrow streets and crowded areas. But if one can drive an MG Windsor, then one can drive this one too. I think it may eat the tyres up rather quickly because the natural tendency in this car is to \u0091send it\u0092 across all sorts of surfaces. But incidentally I didn't \u0091chirrup\u0092 the rear tyres despite stomping on the throttle a bit.\n\n\n\nBraking effect is linear and well controlled. ABS kicks in quick. Pedal firmness is comforting. No sponginess.\n\nBe a bit careful around these city streets and parking lots because the A Pillar is real thick. So it\u0092s a good idea to turn on the 360 degree camera always. I personally don\u0092t like the heads up display on the windscreen so I prefer to switch it off.\n\n\n\nInside design may be polarising. I personally liked the cockpit styling inside. I rather like the separator from the passenger.\n\n\n\nBut leaving aside the disco lighting gimmickry which I wont comment about, the sound system is wonderful. I was blasting some lovely Blues music and the audio effect is immersive! There are 2 screens and while on the move the driver and the passenger cannot watch things like videos and all. (Thank Heaven!)\n\n\n\nThe XEV9 on the other hand has three screens and the left most one in front of the passenger allows videos etc but is blacked out from the drivers view. (This is what the executive said)\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of piano black inside and many shiny surfaces which show fingerprints.\n\n\n\nThe seat upholstery is of a sufficiently dark colour to reduce the dirt but it does show up on the test car all the same.\n\n\n\nThe pull tabs on the doors are a cool touch. The centre console is a cool thing. The steering control wheel is a bit like a plane. Very cool. Feels soft but also feels a little flimsy for some reason. There is definitely a \u0091quality\u0092 tactile feel to all the switchgear like indicators and all. On the test car there was no \u0091play\u0092 in the centre joystick - I had watched the MotorInc Video in which they commented about that but didnt experience it myself. The central circular control knob felt a bit plasticky though. Not as premium as BYD for example. The AC is adequately comfortable. The big moon roof gives one an impression of space and airiness. The boot is very large. With the rear seats folded down full one can literally sleep inside! One can carry 3 golf bags lying flat, horizontally placed.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a little concern about the piano black on the outside, I think after some time one simply wont care.\n\n\n\nThe auto park facility is really very impressive as is the remote controlled forward and rearward drive movement. This will work when the person is within 4 feet of the car I believe so one can walk alongside while remote controlling the car! I made the executive demonstrate these two features for me - the auto park when I was sitting inside with him and the remote controlled movement when both he and I were standing outside the car.\n\n\n\nThis is actually a great value Sports Coupe SUV for anyone who likes a high performance, great handling, good looking and eye-catching vehicle which also has solid range and is well priced to boot.\n\n\n\nAs many have said it is like a concept car come to life. And its price is at 32 lacs, a pretty decent deal.\n\n\n\nThere may be some initial niggles and all. And there is the question of servicing and service centre competence. But I think all of this will settle over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\n\n\nMahindra has hit this one also straight out of the park, yet again.\n\n\n\nMy Kona looks and feels nice and I love it, but the BE6 is very tempting indeed. I think this is a very worthy car and deserves active consideration from anyone who is actively in the market at the moment.\n\n\n\nHad I not bought my Kona last year, I\u0092d certainly have considered this car. And as Tushar the big built gent from ZigWheels himself says he \u0091can live with it\u0092, I too can very easily do so, were I in the market.

            "content": "Langen Motorcycles last made waves back in 2023 with the Lightspeed, a limited edition naked capable of a face-melting 185 bhp. It's now set to take things up a notch by turbocharging the heart of that beast to summon 300 thundering horses \u2013 with a view to make it the 'world's fastest production motorcycle.'\n\nCiting turbo-equipped legends from the 80s like the 100-hp Honda CX650 and 112-hp Kawasaki GPZ750 as inspiration, the Manchester-based bike maker noted that \"the Lightspeed already has the credentials to be a class-leading motorcycle, but the strength of the powerplant and overall design mean it can now be taken a step further.\"\n\nThe company says that its LS12 Lightspeed Turbo has been engineered to overcome the challenges associated with those bikes, including turbo lag that caused unpredictable power delivery, and difficulty managing heat and gas flow owing to the packaging the turbo units and intercooler systems.\n\nThe Lightspeed Turbo will likely get carbon fiber bodywork, Ohlins suspension, and Hel brake gear like the original Langen Motorcycles\n\nThat's thanks to ride-by-throttle, as well as a custom Electronic Control Unit and physical control system on the upcoming bike. Langen has already begun testing it on the dyno and recording output of 250 bhp. The team believes this machine is capable of hitting 300 bhp in 'full power mode.'\n\nIf Langen gets this right, the LS12 Lightspeed Turbo's power-to-weight ratio will be off the charts. The original Lightspeed already comes in at 0.454 bhp/lb (1 bhp/kg). I'm no expert, so please pardon my back-of-the-napkin calculations of what the turbo model might work out to.\n\nIf we assume the new components add some 34 lb (15 kg) \u2013 you'll arrive at a blasphemous power-to-weight ratio of 0.681 bhp/lb (1.5 bhp/kg). That's close to two of the fastest bikes you can buy on the planet: the supercharged Kawasaki Ninja H2/R manages 0.719 bhp/lb (1.585 bhp/kg) and the extremely light, rotary engine-equipped Crighton CR700W comes in at 0.77 bhp/lb (1.698 bhp/kg).\n\nIt would handsomely outdo the Ducati Panigale V4 R's 0.625 bhp/lb (1.378 bhp/kg). So if my math is remotely correct, this one will simply fly off the line.\n\nThe Lightspeed Turbo will undoubtedly be plenty expensive, given that the original is priced at just over $46,000 Langen Motorcycles\n\nLangen is confident that it will be able to bring the Turbo to the Santa Pod Raceway's drag strip by the fourth quarter of this year. The company plans to make and sell only a limited run of Turbos, and I expect they'll cost a pretty penny. For reference, the Lightspeed costs just over US$46,000. Still, don't be surprised to see the Turbos get snapped up real quick.\n\nSource: Langen Motorcycles",

            "content": "Omkar Team-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2016 Location: Mumbai Posts: 2,815 Thanked: 28,728 Times\n\nDriving the BMW iX1 LWB eDrive 20\n\n\n\nBMW has moved from the dual motor setup of the outgoing iX1 to a single-motor front-wheel drive setup for the 2025 iX1 LWB. The motor makes 201 BHP and 250 Nm and the car's claimed 0-100 km/h time is 8.6 seconds. The battery capacity remains the same at 66.4 kWh and the car has a claimed range of 531 km. Now that the specifications are out of the way, let\u0092s get to the driving part. Right from the get-go, you will appreciate the smoothness of the motor. That is not unexpected as EVs, in general, are known to provide a very smooth driving experience. The calibration of the accelerator is also nice which makes the car pretty easy to drive. Your morning commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic should be comfortable.\n\n\n\nThe iX1 gets drive modes which can be accessed by pressing a button on the center console. However, this button only opens up the drive mode selector on the touchscreen. You now have to shift to the screen to select the desired drive mode. I found this to be cumbersome. Once you are in the menu, you can select the efficient mode which is perfect for the city. It dulls the accelerator response and hence, makes the driving experience smoother. There\u0092s still enough punch in the motor to tackle the city traffic and make quick overtakes.\n\n\n\nOut on the highway is where you can flex your right foot and get to feel some of that instant torque from the electric motor. Of course, it is not as fast as the outgoing iX1 as it doesn\u0092t have the dual motor setup anymore, but it\u0092s still quick. When in D, tap the transmission selector down one more time to activate B mode. This is where you get the maximum power from the motor and can feel the full potential. Yes, it drains the battery that much faster, but by selecting Sport mode from the screen and B mode on the selector, you got yourself a quick car. You even hear the motor in the cabin deploying all that power to the front wheels. Highway overtakes are handled with ease and you don\u0092t have to think twice. Compared to some of the other cars in the segment, the iX1 isn\u0092t as quick, but it still has enough power for Indian roads.\n\n\n\nRegenerative Braking\n\n\n\nYou can adjust the regenerative braking in the iX1, but it\u0092s not easily accessible like a button on the centre console or paddle shifters. You have to do it through the touchscreen which can get annoying while driving. There are 4 modes of regenerative braking to choose from \u0096 Low, Moderate, High and Adaptive. In the adaptive setting, the car decides the amount of regeneration needed as per the throttle inputs. I didn\u0092t find this mode to be very intuitive and preferred having the car in low regeneration mode. In the B mode, one-pedal driving is activated.\n\n\n\nNoise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)\n\n\n\nAs expected of an EV, the cabin is super quiet. The only noise you will hear in the cabin is the motor noise when you press down the accelerator. There\u0092s also a silent mode (in the drive modes) which, as the name suggests, makes everything go silent. You can hear a bit of tyre noise when driving at 100 km/h, but it\u0092s not excessive.\n\n\n\nBonnet gets insulation underneath:\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\n\nBMW claims an MIDC range of 531 km, but in a real-world scenario, you can expect a range of 400-450km, which is fair. Within the efficient mode, there\u0092s an option of maximizing the range which can be used when you\u0092re running low on battery. In this mode, the maximum speed is limited to 90 km/h and the air conditioner's performance is also reduced. In case you run out of charge, BMW has an RSA service that will rescue you with a portable fast charger.\n\n\n\nCharging\n\n\n\nTo charge the 66.4 kWh battery pack, there are AC and DC charging options. It takes 6 hours and 30 minutes to charge the battery from 0-100% with a 11 kW AC charger. When it comes to DC fast charging, the iX1 can use a 130 kW charger, which takes 29 minutes to charge the battery from 10-80%. With a 50 kW DC fast charger, you will be able to get a 100 km range in about 19 minutes.\n\n\n\nThrough the My BMW app, you can plan your charging spots on your road trip route. BMW has set up about 300 chargers at various resorts and corporate parks around India. Apart from these, there are about 5,000 3rd party chargers that have been verified by BMW which will show up on the app as well. You can even pre-book your charger through the app. The payment is to be made through the app and if you\u0092re not very tech-savvy, customer care allows you to pay through a link.\n\n\n\nCharging port is located in the same location as the fuel filler of the ICE version:\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspension\n\n\n\nRide Comfort\n\n\n\nWhen we drove the X1 diesel, we found its suspension to be compliant. It was on the stiffer side, but comfortable enough. In most cases, when the electric vehicle is based on the IC engine platform, the suspension is stiffened up to account for the heavy battery placed in the floor. This makes the ride quality pretty stiff and you feel everything on the road. This is the case with the iX1 as well. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it which is why you feel a lot of the road. While driving around in the city, small to medium-sized potholes are handled fairly well, but you still feel them in the cabin. There is also noticeable body movement when going over bad roads. Build up some speed and like most European cars, the ride gets better. However, you still feel the expansion joints and undulations. The 18-inch wheels with 225/55 section tyres aren\u0092t that big of a contributor to the stiffness. The chassis itself is firm which contributes to the stiff ride.\n\n\n\nHandling & Dynamics\n\n\n\nStraight line stability is great and the car feels solid while doing highway speeds. The car masks speed with ease and you can cruise at triple-digit speeds till the charge runs out. You do need to be mindful of the expansion joints and sudden dips on the highways as you feel them in the cabin. The iX1 with its long wheelbase and only a front wheel drive configuration is obviously not as sporty as the outgoing car which had a shorter wheelbase and an all-wheel-drive configuration. However, in its own right, the iX1 handles well. The front end is sharp and eager to turn in. On high-speed curves, the car holds its line well and doesn\u0092t lose composure. The 225/55 R18 Bridgestone Turanza tyres provide enough grip for the power on tap. The iX1, however, doesn\u0092t feel like a car you would want to go pushing hard around corners. It is big and not as engaging to drive as some of the other BMWs.\n\n\n\nSteering\n\n\n\nThe electric power steering of the iX1 is super light which makes it a breeze to use in the city. Most people will appreciate the light steering with the electric motor as you get a very smooth driving experience. The steering weighs up on the highway and you can stiffen it up even more by switching to Sport mode. It doesn\u0092t feel nervous while cruising on the highways. While the steering is accurate and fairly direct, it feels light even in Sport mode and lacks feedback. As mentioned earlier, this is a car you wouldn\u0092t want to drive very hard.\n\n\n\nBraking\n\n\n\nLike most EVs, the brake pedal has a spongy feel to it and doesn't feel very progressive. However, the all-wheel disc brake setup provides good braking performance. Even under hard braking, the car comes to a halt without any drama. BMW has moved from the dual motor setup of the outgoing iX1 to a single-motor front-wheel drive setup for the 2025 iX1 LWB. The motor makes 201 BHP and 250 Nm and the car's claimed 0-100 km/h time is 8.6 seconds. The battery capacity remains the same at 66.4 kWh and the car has a claimed range of 531 km. Now that the specifications are out of the way, let\u0092s get to the driving part. Right from the get-go, you will appreciate the smoothness of the motor. That is not unexpected as EVs, in general, are known to provide a very smooth driving experience. The calibration of the accelerator is also nice which makes the car pretty easy to drive. Your morning commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic should be comfortable.The iX1 gets drive modes which can be accessed by pressing a button on the center console. However, this button only opens up the drive mode selector on the touchscreen. You now have to shift to the screen to select the desired drive mode. I found this to be cumbersome. Once you are in the menu, you can select the efficient mode which is perfect for the city. It dulls the accelerator response and hence, makes the driving experience smoother. There\u0092s still enough punch in the motor to tackle the city traffic and make quick overtakes.Out on the highway is where you can flex your right foot and get to feel some of that instant torque from the electric motor. Of course, it is not as fast as the outgoing iX1 as it doesn\u0092t have the dual motor setup anymore, but it\u0092s still quick. When in D, tap the transmission selector down one more time to activate B mode. This is where you get the maximum power from the motor and can feel the full potential. Yes, it drains the battery that much faster, but by selecting Sport mode from the screen and B mode on the selector, you got yourself a quick car. You even hear the motor in the cabin deploying all that power to the front wheels. Highway overtakes are handled with ease and you don\u0092t have to think twice. Compared to some of the other cars in the segment, the iX1 isn\u0092t as quick, but it still has enough power for Indian roads.You can adjust the regenerative braking in the iX1, but it\u0092s not easily accessible like a button on the centre console or paddle shifters. You have to do it through the touchscreen which can get annoying while driving. There are 4 modes of regenerative braking to choose from \u0096 Low, Moderate, High and Adaptive. In the adaptive setting, the car decides the amount of regeneration needed as per the throttle inputs. I didn\u0092t find this mode to be very intuitive and preferred having the car in low regeneration mode. In the B mode, one-pedal driving is activated.As expected of an EV, the cabin is super quiet. The only noise you will hear in the cabin is the motor noise when you press down the accelerator. There\u0092s also a silent mode (in the drive modes) which, as the name suggests, makes everything go silent. You can hear a bit of tyre noise when driving at 100 km/h, but it\u0092s not excessive.Bonnet gets insulation underneath:BMW claims an MIDC range of 531 km, but in a real-world scenario, you can expect a range of 400-450km, which is fair. Within the efficient mode, there\u0092s an option of maximizing the range which can be used when you\u0092re running low on battery. In this mode, the maximum speed is limited to 90 km/h and the air conditioner's performance is also reduced. In case you run out of charge, BMW has an RSA service that will rescue you with a portable fast charger.To charge the 66.4 kWh battery pack, there are AC and DC charging options. It takes 6 hours and 30 minutes to charge the battery from 0-100% with a 11 kW AC charger. When it comes to DC fast charging, the iX1 can use a 130 kW charger, which takes 29 minutes to charge the battery from 10-80%. With a 50 kW DC fast charger, you will be able to get a 100 km range in about 19 minutes.Through the My BMW app, you can plan your charging spots on your road trip route. BMW has set up about 300 chargers at various resorts and corporate parks around India. Apart from these, there are about 5,000 3rd party chargers that have been verified by BMW which will show up on the app as well. You can even pre-book your charger through the app. The payment is to be made through the app and if you\u0092re not very tech-savvy, customer care allows you to pay through a link.Charging port is located in the same location as the fuel filler of the ICE version:When we drove the X1 diesel, we found its suspension to be compliant. It was on the stiffer side, but comfortable enough. In most cases, when the electric vehicle is based on the IC engine platform, the suspension is stiffened up to account for the heavy battery placed in the floor. This makes the ride quality pretty stiff and you feel everything on the road. This is the case with the iX1 as well. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it which is why you feel a lot of the road. While driving around in the city, small to medium-sized potholes are handled fairly well, but you still feel them in the cabin. There is also noticeable body movement when going over bad roads. Build up some speed and like most European cars, the ride gets better. However, you still feel the expansion joints and undulations. The 18-inch wheels with 225/55 section tyres aren\u0092t that big of a contributor to the stiffness. The chassis itself is firm which contributes to the stiff ride.Straight line stability is great and the car feels solid while doing highway speeds. The car masks speed with ease and you can cruise at triple-digit speeds till the charge runs out. You do need to be mindful of the expansion joints and sudden dips on the highways as you feel them in the cabin. The iX1 with its long wheelbase and only a front wheel drive configuration is obviously not as sporty as the outgoing car which had a shorter wheelbase and an all-wheel-drive configuration. However, in its own right, the iX1 handles well. The front end is sharp and eager to turn in. On high-speed curves, the car holds its line well and doesn\u0092t lose composure. The 225/55 R18 Bridgestone Turanza tyres provide enough grip for the power on tap. The iX1, however, doesn\u0092t feel like a car you would want to go pushing hard around corners. It is big and not as engaging to drive as some of the other BMWs.The electric power steering of the iX1 is super light which makes it a breeze to use in the city. Most people will appreciate the light steering with the electric motor as you get a very smooth driving experience. The steering weighs up on the highway and you can stiffen it up even more by switching to Sport mode. It doesn\u0092t feel nervous while cruising on the highways. While the steering is accurate and fairly direct, it feels light even in Sport mode and lacks feedback. As mentioned earlier, this is a car you wouldn\u0092t want to drive very hard.Like most EVs, the brake pedal has a spongy feel to it and doesn't feel very progressive. However, the all-wheel disc brake setup provides good braking performance. Even under hard braking, the car comes to a halt without any drama.",

Learn More\n\nSome Australian investors may be worried about what Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries could mean for global economic growth in the short term. I think certain ASX shares could be suitable defensive choices for those concerned investors.\n\nMore pain for the Chinese economy caused by the United States president's tariffs could be problematic for Australia because China is one of our most important trading partners.\n\nFor starters, the Asian superpower buys huge quantities of resources from companies like BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO), and Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG). Less demand would hit the overall share market. The Australian federal budget also gets a fair chunk of revenue from resources.\n\nA weaker Australian (or Chinese) economy could be bad news for some ASX shares that are exposed to resource prices or discretionary spending. With that in mind, I'm going to mention three businesses that could offer defensive earnings in the coming years.\n\nCharter Hall Long WALE REIT (ASX: CLW)\n\nThis real estate investment trust (REIT) owns various types of commercial property, including telecommunications exchanges, service stations, pubs and bottle shops, industrial buildings, and so on.\n\nOne of the most attractive things about this business is its long weighted average lease expiry (WALE). This means the tenants are signed on for a long time, giving income visibility and stability. At the end of December 2024, the CLW REIT had a WALE of 9.7 years.\n\nThe business's annual rental growth is either fixed or linked to inflation, providing steady growth for its overall rental profitability. In the FY25 first-half result, it achieved 3.5% like-for-like net property income (NPI) growth.\n\nRegardless of tariffs, companies still need to occupy buildings for their operations, and this REIT provides appealing property diversification.\n\nIt's expecting to pay a distribution of 25 cents per unit in FY25, which currently translates into a distribution yield of 6.5%.\n\nSonic Healthcare Ltd (ASX: SHL)\n\nSonic Healthcare provides pathology services in several countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and the US.\n\nI think this ASX healthcare share is attractive because healthcare has very consistent demand each year \u2013 people don't choose when they're going to be sick or require pathology services.\n\nThe company's FY25 update showed how resilient it is amid challenging economic conditions. In the first four months to October 2024, it reported total revenue growth of 10%, with organic revenue growth of more than 5% and operating profit (EBITDA) growth of more than 10%. I'm not expecting this business to be affected by Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe company expects to grow its EBITDA by at least 10% in FY25, which could help fund yet another dividend increase. It has increased its dividend each year in the past decade and has a trailing dividend yield of 3.75%.\n\nTelstra Group Ltd (ASX: TLS)\n\nTelstra is Australia's largest telecommunications business, with the biggest subscriber base and widest network coverage.\n\nThe steady addition of new subscribers to its mobile division is helping increase margins because it spreads the network's fixed costs across more users.\n\nThe ASX telco share could continue growing in importance to the Australian economy as the country becomes increasingly digitalised.\n\nI believe demand for the company's service will remain resilient even if the economy becomes more challenged. An internet connection seems like an essential utility for households and businesses.\n\nThe business currently has a grossed-up dividend yield of 6.5%, including franking credits, which I believe is likely to be a resilient payout.",

            "content": "BHPian rajeevmysore recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nMy interest primarily revolves around nature, wildlife and heritage temples and monuments. Had a perfect ending to 2024 having a 2 week trip of madhya pradesh.\n\nApprox route:\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/YmC5JpLgc4vG1Ess6\n\nDay-0: Got down from train at morena railway station.\n\nStay at rest house,Eco Park Deori, Morena was booked (through https://mpforest.gov.in/ecotourism/e...stination.aspx.) We thought, being a forest dept eco center, it would be a safe and comfortable stay. However the experience of staying there was very unpleasant. We reached there around 10 pm. The problem starts - security at the gate would not let us in, telling his boss hasnt told him anything about the booking. There is no phone number on the booked receipt. No one picks the number mentioned in google maps and the security guard refuses to call his boss or share the number with us\n\nLuckily, we had some contact with CCF and we told him we would need to speak to CCF if he did not allow us inside and we persuaded him to let us talk to his officer. The officer asked us for a soft copy and finally we were let in. The next stage: of the two rooms, one room had a broken cot ! Luckily the bed spreads were clean enough and we went for a good night's sleep. The next morning when we woke up - there is no power, so no geyser and no hot water\n\nIn future we shall avoid all such eco parks in MP at least after this experience. I wonder why forest dept rest houses cannot work with the efficiency of tourism dept hotels !\n\nDay-1: Around gwalior:\n\nAnyways, after freshening up, we went to the safari an chambal river, just below the bridge. The ticket issuing officer had still not arrived. He came at around 10:30 and off we went for a 2 hour boat ride. (per hour ride costs about Rs 1400 for a 6-seater). This was a worthy ride. Crocs - muggers and gharials, stilts, tortoise, cormorants, brahminy ducks, herons were sighted.\n\n\n\nWe then proceeded to visit Kakanmath, built by the Kachchhapaghata ruler Kirttiraja. It is amazing to see the structure is still standing and looks like it might fall down anytime. However, our guide explained that it looks crude only because the outer cladding stones have fallen down and no more existing. The basic structure within a temple would be like this and they take students to study the architecture to know how to temples are built before they clad with icons etc.\n\nThe first look at the entrance:\n\n\n\nA closer look:\n\n\n\n\n\nA few sample claddings that would have covered the entire temple in its original form:\n\n\n\nWe then proceeded towards the mitaoli chaushat yogini temple.\n\nAt the entrance of the walkway, we find a monolithic bull that scholars date to kushan era. Was very happy to see a 2000 year old bull !\n\nThe actual temple is at top of the hill, which is a 10 min climb from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the yogini statues themselves are missing from this temple, long smuggled (and maybe in some museums abroad)\n\nThe next stop was Padavali.\n\nIt was converted later to a fort and hence the entrance looks majestic\n\n\n\nThe actual temple is only a small part in the fort now.\n\n\n\nBut the mandapa is the most important one to see here: its ceilings are exquisitely carved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last stop was Batesvar group of temples. To give a context, the video of talk of its resurrection by Padmasri Mohammad is a valuable resource.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaNPeCzbSpM\n\nThe pathways are well laid\n\n\n\nA group of more than 100 temples are present here, though it was a bit lonely. Except us, no one else were there at the site and no ticket counter too! Toilets are indeed present though I did not venture to verify its hygiene.\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautiful kalyana-sundara murti is still waiting to be placed back in its original place.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust opposite of the entrance gate to this site is another temple, named after Nirbhay Singh Gurjar, a decoit of his times, on a very high platform.\n\nThis temple also has an exquisite ceiling.\n\n\n\nThat ended day 1 as we came down to gwalior and stayed at royal orchid hotel.\n\nTo be continued..\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

With a 247BHP turbo charged engine under the hood, butter smooth automatic, and < 10,000 miles on the odometer, it was a dream weekend getaway car.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing from India, it takes me some time to wrap my mind around the fact that you can travel X miles in the US in Y mins, where Y < X.

Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreets of San Francisco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome traffic on Van Ness Ave\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the SO at the Golden Grate Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\nJust the Bridge.

After having been to many countries, I still think this bridge, combined with the beautiful location, is one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. The bridge connects San Francisco to Marin County and the northern California coastline.\n\nAs always, it was cold and foggy, but the sun did eventually chase the fog away. We shivered our way up and down the walking path, while locals merrily jogged past us in vests and shorts. We read (and photographed for your reading pleasure) some nice information boards around the bridge (which is included in the next section) then picked up a couple of souvenirs before heading back to the car.\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge from Closer up\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=--oFSEp98Yk?\n\nVistas of the San Francisco Bay as seen from the bridge. You can see the island of Alcatraz with the eponymous (now defunct) prison, the Bay Bridge in the distance and the San Francisco skyline. Bellissimo, or as we say in Devanagiri: \u0905\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0941\u0902\u0926\u0930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking on the bridge. It is always FREEZING here.\n\nMark Twain is supposed to have said: \"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of walking trails around the bridge in the Golden Gate Recreation Area. There is an old army base called the Presidio, which is also lovely to walk around in.\n\n\n\nA change for the (much) worse since the 2000s were the signs posted every few meters everywhere around parking areas of the bridge, and elsewhere in the city as well, warning people to not leave anything valuable in their vehicles, especially not where it could be seen. Smash and grab robberies have become depressingly frequent in California, possibly due to the lax enforcement of laws against petty crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was now onwards to our next destination; the tourist trap of Pier 39, also known as the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. It is an extremely kitschy but fun place with overpriced souvenir stores, seafood restaurants and places selling candy of various kinds. As the SO was a first time visitor to CA, it was a must-see. We grabbed a very forgettable lunch there and then walked around the pier and marina, saying hello to the sea lions that are permanent residents of the place, and will hopefully not be deported by Trump. A ton of yachts are parked there, a testament to the wealth in America and in this city.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are, at Pier 39 on the Wharf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shop sells hot sauces of all kinds. We did not dare to sample or buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea lions enjoying the winter sun. Do you Sea them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marina. Can imagine real life soap operas happening in these yachts.\n\nThe 2nd iconic San Francisco Bay Bridge can be seen in the distance. It had collapsed in 1989 during a big earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarina with a view of the Coit Tower (in brown) and the Transamerica building in the distance.\n\nWe couldn't see the Coit tower as there was no parking available anywhere around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe notorious prison of Alcatraz can be seen behind the yacht. The tight security, cold waters and strong currents of the bay around it made it supposedly un-escapable.\n\nIt was closed shortly after 3 inmates successfully escaped and supposedly survived. The story of their escape was made into a movie starring California's own Clint Eastwood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi Gull hai Paaji?\n\n\n\nAfter driving around on the side streets of the city and ogling at the beautiful houses (see below for examples) we headed to Lombard Street aka the Crookedest Street in the world. It is an EXTREMELY steep uphill drive, following which you cross Hyde Street and then descend extremely slowly down the Crookedest Street part. Again a very touristy thing to do, but also a must-do, and the houses with their flower pots and architecture are beautiful, not to mention the amazing city and Bay views all around.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic San Francisco trams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely house near the pier.

I like to think that I take back a small part of the city with me whenever I visit. God willing, can do a few more such trips as long as work (and my ability to take that loooong flight) allows. The Significant Other (SO) was nice enough to fly over to the Bay Area in the middle of the week. As it drew to a close, our holiday plans kicked in. A day tour of San Francisco followed by a weekend getaway in the beautiful town of Carmel-by-the-Sea, the latter being around 140km south of Silicon Valley, and then a couple days in Tucson, Arizona.After returning the Bronco, we picked up a Volvo S60 sedan and zoomed off towards the city by the Bay.

The ASX:BHP ) share price is about 5.7% above its 52-week low.\n\nBrambles manages the world\u2019s largest pool of reusable pallets, crates, and containers, providing a service central to most supply chains globally.\n\nThe company is better known by its main brand CHEP, which has operations across the Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions.\n\nBrambles makes money through a hiring model. For example, a manufacturer will make a product, then transfer the product to a retailer on CHEP pallets. Those pallets are then transferred back to CHEP or to another manufacturer or retailer in the supply chain. At each step, Brambles collects daily hire fees on its pallets and crates.\n\nBHP shares\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nBXB & BHP share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018fast read\u2019 of where the BXB share price is could be to study something like dividend yield over time. This can give us a sense of the stability of the company and whether they can consistently pay out a percentage of profits.\n\nRemember, the dividend yield is basically the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, Brambles Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.62%, compared to its 5-year average of 2.66%. In other words, BXB shares are trading lower than their historical average dividend yield. Be careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing, or both. In the case of BXB, the annual report shows last year\u2019s dividend was greater than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been growing.\n\nBHP is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.40%, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.86%. This is just one of many ways you could put a value on BHP shares. The Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining valuation methods like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets which can help you learn how to value a company like BXB or BHP.",

These are the shares that it believes \"offer attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\"\n\nIts analysts also \"consider the current macro-economic backdrop and investment environment, focusing on quality companies with proven track records, strong management teams and competitive advantages.\"\n\nLet's see what the broker is recommending in February:\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)\n\nBell Potter thinks that BHP could be an ASX 200 share to buy this month.\n\nBHP is of course one of the world's largest miners. It produces copper for renewable energy, iron ore and metallurgical coal for steel for new infrastructure, and potash to support more sustainable farming.\n\nThe broker is positive on BHP due largely to its exposure to copper. It also sees potential for the miner to benefit greatly from further Chinese stimulus measures in 2025. Bell Potter said:\n\nBHP presents an attractive investment proposition, providing exposure to both copper and the potential upside from further Chinese stimulus measures. BHP is one of the top three global producers of copper and has the largest copper endowment of any company globally. BHP operates the Escondida mine in Chile, where they have a 57.5% ownership stake.\n\nColes Group Ltd (ASX: COL)\n\nAnother ASX 200 share that could be a buy this month according to analysts at Bell Potter is Coles.\n\nIt is of course one of the big two supermarket operators in Australia. In addition, the company has operations in liquor and financial services, as well as a 50% ownership interest in Flybuys.\n\nBell Potter is feeling positive about the company's outlook. This is due to lowering costs, higher immigration, and the modernisation of its supply chain. It expects the latter to help Coles close the gap on rivals when it comes to online and digital shopping.

It feels really great being behind the wheel, you are always in control and the car can go fast if you decide to push it. The power delivery is very smooth, and I couldn't feel any kind of jerks when the shifts happened or even a very sudden surge in power when flooring the gas pedal which leads to a downshift. It is all very predictable and super nice.\n\nIt might feel like I am just repeating what the others have said, but the car drives just as maturely as you would expect out of a Skoda-VW.

That one has a very obvious problem with creep, which causes the car to suddenly lunge as soon as you leave the brakes when on a standstill.

The Kylaq meanwhile, doesn't seem to have this issue at all, which is great! Steering: I found the steering to be very light and easy at slower speeds, and it gains weight as you go faster. It is precise throughout and is quite easily maneuverable, giving you a lot of confidence. Some people pointed that they would have liked more heft at higher speeds, but I didn't particularly dislike the amount of heft it gained while driving at speeds of 80-100. For context, I have driven the 2 generations older Creta extensively, and I absolutely hate how light and lacking its steering feels. In comparison to the Kylaq, our Polo's steering is very heavy, the Sonet's is soulless but does the job and the 3XO's is not as confidence inspiring.\n\nI found the steering to be very light and easy at slower speeds, and it gains weight as you go faster.

The broken sections on the highway (of which there were plenty) were quite effortlessly managed by the Kylaq and the ride was very comfortable. At speeds of even around 100 km/hr, the car felt extremely well planted. No body roll on long-ish curves at these speeds either. On service roads which were basically not even tarmac, you can feel the bumps. The car absorbs quite a bit, but when you are on the rear seat, you can feel the undulations. I drove the Prestige with 17\" wheels, and expect this to be a little lesser with the 16\".\n\nThe suspension tuning is brilliant.

I drove the Prestige with 17\" wheels, and expect this to be a little lesser with the 16\". AT Gearbox: There is a very noticeable 1-1.5 second lag that the automatic gearbox has. Even when in sports mode, if you suddenly try to push the car and press the gas pedal hard, it takes a solid second to realize and downshift and then gives you the power. Manual shifting does make this slightly better, but there is still a lag. Once it does give you the power though, it absolutely gets going. It is something that can be lived with for sure, and is not noticeable at all in regular driving. This lag when pushing is probably more noticeable also because the turbo doesn't kick in until ~2000 RPM, but the gearbox itself is not a fast one by any stretch of imagination.\n\nThere is a very noticeable 1-1.5 second lag that the automatic gearbox has.

Overall: If I were to ignore the gearbox lag, the car is really great to drive, and I absolutely loved it! I have test driven the 3XO, Sonet, Brezza, Nexon and the Kushaq previously and only the Kushaq comes close which is no surprise. Coming from our Polo, the Kylaq does not quite push you back in your seat as much, but it comes the closest. I guess it has to do with the fact that the Polo has the same amount of torque owing to it's diesel engine. The ride comes together very well overall, is very mature, and thus really enjoyable, which I can't appreciate enough given the competition. It is easy, reasonably fast and very confident. Interiors:\n\nFront row: Really good interiors if you are sitting in the driver's seat. The steering and the digital driver's console feel very premium. The center display is super high quality, bright, and has a very fluid UI. AC controls are not bad. I personally loved the seats (I'm relatively thinner and shorter than average), and like people have mentioned previously, you really do sit in them and not on them! My friend who accompanied me is of a larger build and he didn't quite fit in well in the seats so didn't like it as much so YMMV. Very natural and lovely riding position, it is not trying to give you a superficial feeling of being 'high and commanding'. Armrests are positioned well. Overall, very comfortable and natural, feels familiar and like home coming from the Polo, while also being a decent upgrade. Only complaints are with the plastics, more on which later.\n\nReally good interiors if you are sitting in the driver's seat. The steering and the digital driver's console feel very premium.

Rear row: Not as 'premium feeling' as the front is the only way I can describe it. There is not a lot wrong with it, the seats have a good position and are comfortable unless you are sitting in the middle, and there is enough knee and head room. It is good overall, but the 3XO for example feel luxurious in comparison, and the Sonet feels great. The feeling you get in the Kylaq is that of mediocrity. Not the most airy cabin, and the black interiors don't help. You notice the hard plastics. If you are slightly of a bigger build, one of your arms would be resting out of the seat and on the plastic part between the door and the seat which doesn't feel good. It is however very comfortable and spacious. Overall, it is not unacceptable but the competition leaves much to be desired, and I haven't even checked out the Syros yet.\n\nNot as 'premium feeling' as the front is the only way I can describe it.

Plastics and other materials: I dislike them. They may be sturdy sure, but also feel really cheap. Especially the recycled dark green plastic on the doors - they are terrible. The test drive vehicle already had multiple scratches and it has only been a week. It will surely not age well, and brands should really rethink this stupid marketing ploy of 'sustainability' by using 4-5 pieces of recycled plastic around the car. The AC vents are also cheap plastic and do not feel good either, I doubt if these will age well either. Our 13 year old Polo has better quality vents. The roof liner is cheap too, and there is a lot of flex in it. Another thing that our Polo did better. The other plastics though are good, like those on the dash, door (apart from the green one) and center console.\n\nI dislike them. They may be sturdy sure, but also feel really cheap.

AC seemed fine, nothing too great or too bad. The temperatures outside were ~36 already so there's that. Sound system quality is quite good. Door close thud is good, though not as good as the Polo's was in its prime, and ever so slightly worse than the Kushaq. Final thoughts\n\n\n\nAll in all, I think we are going to keep our booking of the Signature+ AT Kylaq. The dealership says we can expect delivery towards the end of March. What stood out the most was the ride and how the car feels overall. Seems like a good upgrade from the Polo. I hate the fact that even the second from top model doesn't get projector headlamps and rear wipers. I also hate how the green recycled plastic bits inside the car scuff up. But I guess we will have to live with it because it more than makes up for it in the way it drives and how practical and comfortable it is overall, at the price point.\n\n\n\nTLDR; Love the way it drives, very mature, confidence inspiring and fun. Slight lag when pushing and questionable material choices wrt some plastics take away from the experience. Overall though, I'm ready to live with the slight compromises, as it is a car that I really like all things considered.

Overall though, I'm ready to live with the slight compromises, as it is a car that I really like all things considered. I got to take a test drive of the Kylaq AT yesterday from Trinity Skoda in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The drive was 80% (mostly) crowded highways and 20% service roads. For context, my family is thinking of upgrading our ageing Polo 1.2 Diesel of 13 years with a car that feels familiar while being better.

            "content": "This is a 5.2 liter Ford Voodoo V8 that was sourced from a 2017 Ford Shelby GT350 with 19,000 miles on the clock. The Voodoo was introduced in 2015 with the S550 Shelby GT350 and it was based on the Coyote V8.\n\nThe Voodoo V8 featured a wide range of upgrades, including a lightweight flat-plane crankshaft that allows it to rev faster, and to higher rpms. The engine is lighter than the Coyote 5.0 liter despite having a larger displacement, and it produces 526 bhp at 7,500 rpm and 429 lb ft of torque at 4,750 rpm.\n\nFord\u2019s Voodoo V8 was developed specifically to be one of the most advanced versions of the pre-existing Coyote, which in turn was a member of the Ford Modular V8 family that dates back to the early 1990s. The Modular V8 was more advanced than many (if not most) American V8s when it was introduced as it had an aluminum block and heads, as well as overhead cams rather than pushrods.\n\nThe Voodoo V8 features double overhead cams per banks and four valves per cylinder, for 32 valves in total. The block and heads are aluminum, and the heads have been modified for optimized flow in and out of the cylinder.\n\nThe use of a flat plane crank is unusual for an American V8, as they mostly use cross-plane crankshafts, and the sound of the flat plane crank is often likened to the sound of a Ferrari V8, as they also use this crank architecture.\n\nEach Voodoo V8 was handbuilt, it\u2019s a naturally-aspirated engine with an almost square bore x stroke of 94mm x 93mm. It has a compression ratio of 12.0:1, hollow steel intake valves and sodium-filled exhaust valves, an 87 millimeter throttle body, a polycarbonate intake manifold with long intake runners, and 4-into-2-into-1 exhaust headers with high-flow catalytic converters and mufflers.\n\nUpon its release in 2015, the Voodoo V8 was lauded by motoring publications across the USA for its incredible exhaust note, particularly at high rpms, and its prodigious output. Perhaps unsurprisingly a number of Shelby GT350s that were fitted with the car were crashed or otherwise damaged \u2013 but the engines never go to waste, as there is a strong secondhand market for them.\n\nThe engine you see here was taken out of a 2017 Ford Shelby GT350 with 19,000 miles on the odometer, as noted in the introduction, and it\u2019s now being offered for sale along with its Tremec 3160 6-speed manual transmission which is still attached to the engine.\n\nIt also comes with a throttle pedal, an ECU, exhaust manifolds, and the engine wiring harness. It has been crated up for simpler shipping and it\u2019s being offered for sale out of Hamtramck, Michigan on Bring a Trailer. If you\u2019d like to read more or place a bid you can visit the listing here.\n\nImages courtesy of Bring a Trailer",

Let\u2019s take a look at why investors might be interested in BHP shares.\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nThe appeal of ASX Materials shares\n\nThe S&P/ASX200 Materials Index (ASX: XMJ) has averaged 4.18% per year in capital growth over the last 5 years. That compares to the ASX 200 index which has returned 3.97% per year over the same period. Let\u2019s take a look at why you might want a materials company like BHP in your portfolio.\n\nBig dividends\n\nWhile there are periods of capital growth, it\u2019s the dividends that most investors are interested in when assessing materials shares. After all, it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been known for for many years. Over the last 5 years the BHP dividend yield has averaged 6.86% per year.\n\nAussie materials companies like BHP have developed a good reputation of being reliable dividend payers. However, these are still commodity-driven businesses so the dividends (like the share price) can fluctuate quite a bit.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nMining is one of the backbones of our modern economy and the demand for things like iron ore, copper, and lithium is not going away any time soon.\n\nIn fact, the demand for a lot of precious metals is rapidly growing as the economy transitions to renewable energy. A lot of these materials are needed for things like electric car batteries and solar panels. Companies like BHP and Rio Tinto are investing a lot of money to put themselves at the forefront of this oncoming wave of demand.\n\nBHP share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018fast read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is would be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.43%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.\n\nBe careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing. In the case of BHP, last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) shares and other ASX iron ore shares could be impacted significantly by what happens next with the iron ore price.\n\nThere are a number of changes happening around the world, such as the US imposing tariffs on China when the country was already going through difficult conditions with its construction industry.\n\nThe iron ore price is key for the profitability of businesses like BHP, Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO), and Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG). Their production costs generally don't change much from month to month or even year to year. Therefore, a change to the iron ore price and revenue is largely an addition or subtraction flowing straight to profit.\n\nSo, what could happen next with the iron ore price? Let's have a look at what a leading expert thinks.\n\nGoldman Sachs' view on iron ore\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review, Goldman Sachs commodities analyst Aurelia Waltham thinks the outlook for iron ore may be improving.\n\nWaltham is slightly more optimistic about the iron ore price for the next few months, and she believes the downward pressure on iron ore prices has eased thanks to the US tariff increase on Chinese exports, which was lower than expected. In theory, that might be positive for BHP shares. Waltham said:\n\nAs a result, we are raising our near-term iron ore price forecast, now expecting the second-month [Singapore Exchange] contract to average $US100/tonne over the first half of this year, before dropping to just below $US90/tonne by the end of the year. Our 2025 average price forecast remains $US95/tonne. The 10 per cent additional tariff on China that took effect on February 4 is below the base case of 20 per cent that was previously factored into our Q1 iron ore price forecast. Although we continue to expect tariffs on imports from China to rise further, the staggered implementation could support Chinese steel demand for longer than we previously expected.\n\nThe AFR reported that Goldman Sachs' base case remains that the yuan depreciates towards 7.50, though the investment bank's foreign currency experts see \"merit\" in the Chinese central bank's preference to keep the exchange rate stable in the near term.\n\nDue to that, Goldman Sachs decided to increase its forecast for the iron ore price in the first quarter of 2025. A falling yuan is seen as the main drag on iron ore prices in 2025.\n\nWaltham also pointed out that the iron ore price is being supported by disruptions to Australian iron ore supply, and iron ore consumption has reportedly returned to an \"uptrend\".\n\nHowever, looking further ahead than this quarter, Goldman Sachs is less optimistic. Waltham said:\n\nWhile we believe these factors could keep iron ore prices supported at about $US100/tonne in the near term, we remain bearish from mid-2025 onward as a structural decline in Chinese domestic steel demand and new low-cost supply result in a significant build up in iron ore stocks.\n\nBHP share price snapshot\n\nSince the start of 2025, BHP shares have risen just over 1%, Rio Tinto shares have gone up just over 2%, and the Fortescue share price has climbed more than 4%.",

VW has said that it needs to 'catch up' and is drawing a plan to get competitive once again. They call the plan Triple A: Accelerate, Attack and Achieve.\n\nVolkswagen plans to introduce 9 new cars by 2027, two of which will be all-electric. The ID.2 will launch in 2026 followed by the recently teased ID.One. VW will also be launching the second generation T-Roc, which they say will be the final car with a combustion engine.\n\nDuring a meeting with employees at the Wolfsburg plant this week, CEO Thomas Sch\u00e4fer assured everyone that the German site still has a bright future. He said this even though production of the Golf hatch will move to Mexico in 2027. The all-electric Golf will however be built in Germany on VW Group's upcoming Scalable Systems Platform (SSP).\n\nHowever, the electric Golf and the all-electric T-Roc won't be coming soon as both these EVs are part of VW's long-term expansion plans.

            "content": "BHPian agambhandari recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nVisited my Skoda dealer here in Ludhiana (Krishna Auto) to test drive the Kylaq AT. I was curious how it compares to Kushaq and to my current daily driver, Polo GT DSG.\n\n\n\nIn the dealer parking, Polo next to a TD Slavia. One can also see the BMW dealer(of the same group) right across the road.\n\nWas able to check out the display car in the showroom while they got the TD car ready.\n\n\n\nIt looks great in the metal, even better than it does on photos. Exterior build, fit and finish seems top notch and typical skoda/VW. Interiors are well appointed and the top end Prestige feels high quality with ventilated and electric seats, twin screens and dash of color across the dashboard. Front seats are comfortable and one gets great visibility out of the driver seat. I liked that the range of movement of both the steering and seat height is quite large and you can get the driving position just right, as you want. The space up front seems the same as kushaq but I think the dashboard is shorter and you sit a tiny bit closer to the windscreen, you may not notice it unless you compare them back to back.\n\nThe backseat is decent overall, the legroom is adequate and seat height is perfect to give a relaxed seating position. The leatherette seats feel high quality. I felt the space behind my driving position was about the same as other cars in the segment like Sonet/Venue. Kushaq has noticeably better legroom at the back (as expected)\n\n\n\nTest drive unit was a Signature+ AT variant in Carbon steel. The first thing I noticed was that the DRLs look different with lights off(compared to prestige), but once the DRLs are lit up, its hard to differentiate them.\n\nSetting off, I noticed the stupidly strong creep of Polo 1.0 AT and Slavia/Kushaq AT is now fixed and it moves much smoother from a standstill. The steering is light and easy to use at city speeds (My wife would love this). The power is more than adequate to get up to 80kmph in no time and the gearbox is buttery smooth, you will almost never notice the gearshifts unless you are flat out. Out on the highway, its almost hard to keep the car below 90 kmph(was the speed limit), so tried out cruise control (similar arrangement as my polo, with the controls on the left stalk).\n\nThe NVH at cruising at 100 kmph is impressive and you can not tell its a 3 cylinder, no vibrations, no unsettling noise and quite silent overall. But when you revv it out, say past 3500 rpm, you can hear the engine and its a typical 3 cylinder thrum, which personally I dont find that sporty( the 1.2 TSI in my polo sounds lovely at these same revvs)\n\nThe Ride quality is great over bad patches, on highway and on potholes in the city too. This is where a crossover beat a hatch hands down thanks to the better wheel articulation. Handling is pretty good and never once did i feel there was any excessive body roll(something that i felt in a kushaq I had driven previously). Skoda has indeed tuned the car to drive very much like a European car should, appreciate them for it.\n\nTL;DR, I'm very impressed with the car overall, the looks, powertrain, interiors, Ride and handling are all spot on. The only 2 cons I felt are the 3 cylinder noise when revved out and the high price for the top end variant.\n\nI understand that the 1.0 3 cylinder is the limitation due to the tax bracket (and is honestly the most refined option in the segment). But given that it misses some features vs its competitors (360 cam +ADAS), I had expected the top Prestige to undercut its rivals, but it is priced squarely same as the Top end Sonet and Mahindra 3XO.\n\nSeeing the price list, I feel the Signature AT is a true VFM option and gets all the essentials at a decent price.\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "BHPian Kelly66 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nHello Friends,\n\nWe bid adieu to our 320d and welcomed Grey Hulk - BMW 330Li M Sport Pro on 30/9/24 to our family.\n\nPreface\n\nWhy the switch from BMW 320d to 330Li?\n\nSome of you may have read my F30 320d review. Even though I had a 7 year itch to switch, once I got a clean chit after my 7th year service I thought I will retain my 320d for a few more years.\n\nBut the decision to upgrade happened real quick and quite unexpectedly within a week. Glad that the 320d is in the safe hands of a fellow bhpian, whose gentle nudge on Sep 16th re-kindled my 7 year itch and on Sep 23rd we struck a Win-Win deal. This was quite similar to the speed with which I switched from Chevy Cruze to the 320d in 2017.\n\nOn Sep 22nd, I got a mouth-watering deal from KUN BMW on the 330Li M Sport Pro, which couldn\u2019t be turned down. From Sep 23rd, all BMW dealers would come to an agreement not to undercut each other on discounts. They would have a uniform discount policy like Merc. So the lowest price they could go to for the M Sport Pro is Rs.74L, is what I had been told. OTR price was Rs.81.33 L before discounts.\n\nWe were initially considering the Portimao Blue colour but when we saw the Skyscraper Grey in flesh there was no looking back.\n\nShortlisting & Buying experience:\n\nMy first objective was to get a good buyback offer for my 320d since we have only 1 parking slot in our apartment. So, these test drives were taken starting Sep 18th and the buyback evaluation was done in parallel.\n\nToyota Camry\n\nI was seriously considering a hybrid car as my next daily driver. Took the Camry for a short drive and found it smooth to drive and the seating in the front and rear were comfortable. It gave a mileage of 11.9 kmpl in city traffic. The car has reached EOL and the next-gen was expected in 2025 in India. So it was a No Go. Best offer was 53L OTR. Buyback offer was not acceptable and was nowhere near my sale price.\n\nLexus NX350h Overtrail\n\nContinuing with hybrids I decided to try the Lexus SUV. Again took the same route as the Camry. Even though the car had all the gizmos like 360 camera, electrical tilt/telescopic steering wheel with memory function, ADAS, etc. the suspension was stiff. The interior 14\" display had an asymmetric shape. The hybrid car was starting in petrol mode because the battery was not charged enough, which was a bit hard to believe. It gave a mileage of 11.1 kmpl for the same route. It was 86L OTR after a minuscule 2L discount. Also, the buyback offer was nowhere near my sale price.\n\nBMW X3 20d M Sport AWD\n\nOn Sep 21st we went to the KUN used car mela to get a good offer for our 320d. Initially, I was considering a pre-owned car but my wife & son were against it. That\u2019s when the sales guy told me about the discount standardisation from Sep 23rd and that they can give good discounts till 22nd.\n\nSince it was EOL for X3, only a demo car was available for sale with around 3500 kms on the ODO. Took a test drive, but since the engine was the same 188 bhp diesel, we were not very serious about it but wanted to get the feel of it. The drive was much better than the Lexus NX and the SUV stance was appealing. The X3 had the HUD and 360 camera but no ADAS & no connected drive. And the discount offered on the demo car was only 5.5L making the OTR price Rs.80.5L. When I checked in a Team BHP thread the advice I got was not to go for the demo car considering that the discount was also nothing great. Dropped it!\n\nBMW X1 Electric\n\nX1 EV was incredibly silent and smooth to drive. It is priced at around 80L OTR after the recent road tax increase. I remember it was around 73L in Nov 23. Anyway, this was just a filler since we were waiting for the buyback price for the 320d.\n\nBMW 320Ld M Sport\n\nDiesel Pro was not available since it was launched only in Sep'24 and was priced at Rs.83.25L OTR. I test drove the non-Pro. It was the same 320d engine but was more refined and smoother. We were not keen on diesel anyway. Still waiting for the buyback offer.\n\nEnter, BMW 330Li M Sport Pro\n\nIt was love at first drive. The black colour demo car didn't do justice to the black accents. Interiors were awesome, drive was super smooth, dash was sexy and the Pro had all the gizmos, except HUD, making it future-proof. Although I would be taking a hit on the mileage front (coming from a frugal 320d), it was a conscious decision to go for a Petrol as my next daily driver. You never know when a diesel ban like Delhi would be imposed in Bangalore.\n\nWhen I got back from the test drive, I was shocked to hear the buyback offer. It was much better than other offers but still way off from my sale price and we almost dropped our purchase plans and walked out because the discount on the 330Li was not great either. Late in the evening, the sales guy said they would give a better offer on Sep 22nd. Since we liked 330Li very much I asked him to come with a better discount and for another test drive the next day. I also touched base with the VP at DM for 330Li pricing and he agreed to give a good deal on 22nd, since I have known him since 2017.\n\nOn Sep 22nd, I took a long test drive to Airport facility of KUN (same route that I took for my 320d in 2017 when it was Navnit) and found that the 330 Li M Sport Pro model was absolutely smooth sailing like an electric car, took the bumps with ease and the seating was also very comfortable in front and rear. Got a thumbs up from my wife too. Clocked an up/down mileage of 11.8 kmpl (64 km) since the return journey was chock-a-block. The same route delivered 16.8 kmpl on the 320d test drive car with lesser traffic on the return leg. We were a little unsure about the colour - Portimao Blue or Skyscraper Grey. He said they have a Skyscraper Grey on display and can talk to his VP and give a good discount if we go to the showroom. After this long test drive, we went straight to KUN and finalised the deal as detailed in my 320d thread. They agreed to get a new car from the Chennai plant and deliver before Sep 30th.\n\n@sunikkat was kind enough to send me the PDF version of the owner's manual even before delivery and I managed to go through some key chapters since I was planning a long drive to CBE on Oct 2nd.\n\nPDI and Delivery Experience:\n\nPDI at stockyard: (28/9/24)\n\nWhen I reached, the car had just arrived from Chennai and the battery (80 Ah AGM) was being charged. The car had some rainwater marks on the roof and bonnet but I was told it would be cleaned and polished the next day after their internal PDI.\n\nMarks visible on the bonnet and roof\n\nODO reading showed 7 km and the production date was 23/7/24\n\nGlad it came with Michelin RFTs but with a staggered set-up:\n\nFront: 225/45 R18; Mfg dates: FL:09/24 & FR:09/24\n\nRear: 255/40 R18; Mfg dates: RL:08/24 & RR:12/24\n\nTread thickness was FL:6.49mm; FR:6.49mm; RL:6.53mm; RR:6.50mm. New tyres generally have 7mm depth?\n\nAnd these treads are not symmetric (left end and right end are different)!\n\nNew brake pad thickness was FL:12mm; FR:12mm; RL:11mm; RR:11mm. New brake pad thickness is usually 13mm? More on this later\u2026\n\nOnly front seats had covers:\n\nRear diffuser should have been deep black colour like the front grill. This one is greyish black.\n\nGot hold of BMW's 85-page PDI report. Here's a summary:\n\nDelivery day (30/9/24):\n\nWhen we came to take delivery at KUN BMW Lavelle Road, those water drop kind of marks on the bonnet were still visible from angles and noticed some swirl marks on the boot lid and roof area. When I showed it to the senior sales guy he accepted they had not done a thorough polishing and can get the same done again on Oct 1st at the showroom.\n\nSince 30th was a good day for delivery, we got the showroom pooja done and took delivery on paper but left the car for the polishing job. Anyway, the number plate was also expected only on Oct 1st.\n\nOn Oct 1st evening, we found the car was neatly polished and ready.\n\nAll smiles\u2026\n\nShowroom ODO reading was 35 Km and car had around 13.36 Lit of petrol showing a range of 211 km.\n\nDrove to the nearest IOC pump and filled RON 91 since KUN guys said normal petrol is fine. Did a tank full by filling 45.64 litres. First tank full (59 Lit) showed a range of 776 km => 13.15 kmpl. From next tank fill I have switched to XP95 after reading some Team BHP threads.\n\nVaahan pooja for Grey Hulk at Ganapathy temple, Tippasandra - This side angular profile is my favourite - looks amazing.\n\nContinue reading Kelly66's ownership review for BHPian comments, insights and more information.",

            "content": "BHPian 14000rpm recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nIt was 2008. I was in Birmingham, Alabama for a month to start a new project together with a Leeds, AL based customer. I was there only for a month which meant every weekend had to have something to keep me from boredom. One such activity I booked was Sky Diving. I have had Vertigo all my life and I was told Sky Diving is one way to get rid of it. I wasn't still very keen but I still mustered the courage to book a ride for one of the weekends. For some reason, my sky Diving session was canceled. Was it an Instructor issue, technical fault? don't seem to recollect why.\n\nNevertheless, I got my money back. With money and time at hand, I chose the next best place to take it - Down the road. Literally.\n\nI'd been reading about Talladega and NASCAR since it is quite famous. It was made famous furthermore by the movie - Talladega nights.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ku4rbxnxr5Q?si=Oj6U79Bsi9eqa6os\n\nThought I'd go and visit the International motorsports hall of fame just outside Talladega race track.\n\nFurther research pointed me to a company that was offering a Pay and Drive session on NASCAR racecars! How can I say no to Speed?\n\nBackground of Talladega and NASCAR:\n\nTalladega Superspeedway has the record for the fastest recorded time by a NASCAR stock car in a closed oval course, with the record of 216.309 mph set by Rusty Wallace on June 9, 2004. Buddy Baker was the first driver to qualify at a speed over 200 mph, with a 200.447 mph lap during testing on March 24, 1970. Baker\u2019s record was set while driving the #88 Chrysler Engineering Charger Daytona.\n\nIn May 1987 Bobby Allison experienced a tire failure while going through the tri-oval portion of the track, which sent his car airborne. His car tore out a portion of the frontstretch catch fence, nearly entering the crowd. NASCAR imposed rule changes to slow the cars after the incident, with a 1988 rule requiring cars running there and at Daytona to use restrictor plates. The most often cited reason is a fear that the increasing speeds were exceeding the capabilities of the tires available at the time, as high-speed tire failure had led to some gruesome crashes at slightly lower speeds. The plates limit the amount of air and fuel entering the intake manifolds of the engine, greatly reducing the power of the cars and hence their speed. This has led to the style of racing held at Talladega and Daytona to be somewhat different from that at other superspeedways and to be referred to by NASCAR fans as \u201crestrictor-plate racing\u201d. The Talladega Jinx\n\nThe high numbers of crashes over the years, along with other factors, have led to rumors of Talladega Superspeedway being cursed. Stories of the origin of the curse vary. Some claim that a local Native American tribe held horse races in the valley where the track currently resides and a chief was killed when he was thrown from his horse. Others say that the site of the superspeedway was once an Indian burial ground. Still another version says that after the local tribe was driven out by the Creek nation for their collaborating with the forces of Andrew Jackson, a shaman put a curse on the valley.\n\nSince the construction of the track, many strange happenings and untimely deaths have fueled the rumors of a curse. In 1973, Bobby Isaac left his car during the race on lap 90 because of voices he claimed to have heard which told him to park his car and get out. Earlier on lap 14 in the same race, young driver Larry Smith died in a seemingly minor wreck.\n\nTo some, Bobby Allison\u2019s 1987 wreck described above was yet another reminder of the curse. In 1993, Bobby\u2019s son, Davey Allison, died in a helicopter crash in the infield of Talladega.\n\nSource : Wikipedia.\n\nNASCAR is a race with 4 left turns taken at a very high rate of speed. That's it.\n\nNASCAR used to be a 'Race on Sunday, Sell on Monday' tactic for most auto-makers and hence most manufacturers that sell in US have a team out there. Directly or Indirectly via professional racing teams.\n\nSource of pix: Google images\n\nContinue reading BHPian 14000rpm post for more insights and information.",

            "content": "With its stock down 6.7% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard BHP Group (ASX:BHP). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for BHP Group is:\n\n20% = US$9.6b \u00f7 US$49b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.20.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of BHP Group's Earnings Growth And 20% ROE\n\nTo begin with, BHP Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. Probably as a result of this, BHP Group was able to see a decent growth of 6.2% over the last five years.\n\nWe then compared BHP Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 21% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for BHP? You can find out in\n\nIs BHP Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nWhile BHP Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 94% (which means it retains 6.3% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.\n\nAdditionally, BHP Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 55% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like BHP Group has some positive aspects to its business. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, probably due to its high returns. However, it does reinvest little to almost none of its profits, so we wonder what effect this could have on its future growth prospects. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

The contract supports the proposed expansion of BHP's copper smelter and refinery facilities in South Australia, a step towards company's ambitious plan to boost copper production.\n\nThe contract, valued at over AUD 40 million for its initial phase, will be executed in stages, aligning with BHP's progress towards a final investment decision (FID) on the smelter and refinery expansion, currently anticipated in the first half of FY27. The initial stage focuses on strategic planning and development during the project's study phases. Subsequent stages will cover detailed engineering, procurement, and construction management as the project advances.\n\nBHP's move is driven by the rapidly growing global demand for copper, projected to increase by approximately 70% by 2050. This surge is fueled by traditional applications, the global shift to electric vehicles and renewable energy, and the expanding need for data centers.\n\nBHP has outlined a clear roadmap to significantly increase copper production in South Australia. The company aims to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of refined copper cathode annually by the early 2030s and potentially reach 650,000 tonnes by the mid-2030s, a substantial increase from approximately 322,000 tonnes in the last financial year.\n\nPhase one of the expansion involves a significant upgrade to the existing smelter and refinery at Olympic Dam. This includes a transition to a two-stage smelter and an extension of refinery facilities, ultimately boosting capacity to over 500,000 tonnes per year. The FID for this crucial first phase is slated for the first half of FY27.\n\nRashpal Bhatti, Group Procurement Officer at BHP, emphasized the importance of the partnership with Fluor and Hatch. \"Fluor and Hatch are experienced global EPCM partners with significant shared experience in delivering mega projects,\" Bhatti stated. \"They bring the right level of scale and expertise to help BHP progress its copper growth plans in South Australia.\" He also highlighted the importance of prudent spending and the collaborative contract structure designed to achieve BHP's vision for copper production growth in the region.\n\nHarish Jammula, President of Mining & Metals at Fluor, said, \"We are excited to support BHP on their growth plans to increase production of refined copper cathode in South Australia.\" He also noted the increasing importance of downstream processing to secure local supply and drive sustainable production.\n\nTina Armstrong, Global Managing Director \u2013 Metals at Hatch, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"Hatch is delighted to be partnering with BHP to support its Copper South Australia growth plans. Together with Fluor, we look forward to working closely and collaboratively with the Copper South Australia team.\"",

That is the benefit of having such an oddball design.\n\nThe base model also seems to be loaded and does not feel barebones at all. I saw the base model in person and it's more of a mid variant than a base. You get stuff like alloys (diesel), projector lights, sunroof (diesel) etc, and the only thing giving away the fact that it's a base variant is the absence of rear wash and wipe. This ensures the Syros is pretty much desirable for even someone with a limited budget.\n\nApart from that, the Syros has the usual Kia traits of a high-quality interior, a laundry list of equipment and a user-friendly nature. I see no reason why its oddball design could dent its sales figure, given that there was similar negativity spread about the design when cars like the 2nd-Gen Creta and Kia Carens were launched. People said it would flop but became a blockbuster hit. I expect pretty much the same with Syros. Also, having a CRDi that too with an AT option is a BIG advantage for Syros, IMO.\n\nAll the best to Kia for their Syros.

            "content": "Our complex and dynamic mining value chains face ever-increasing challenges. The decisions we make today will impact us for decades to come. Learn how BHP is working to help future-proof strategic decision-making using a \u2018digital twin\u2019 approach combined with GenAI technologies.\n\n\n\nLeveraging the latest tools and technologies to seek to quantify the impact of our strategic decision-making is essential to meet the growing demand for commodities critical to global trends such as the world\u2019s growing and urbanising population and the global energy transition.\n\nThis article explores how the use of \u2018digital twins\u2019 combined with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies is better enabling us to make the best strategic decisions possible.\n\nGenerative AI, can be thought of as the next generation of artificial intelligence. It's a form of AI that can create something new by learning from vast amounts of data. Unlike traditional AI, which follows fixed rules to analyse and process information, GenAI can generate insights, predict outcomes and suggest solutions \u2013 making decision-making faster, smarter and more adaptive.\n\nDigital twins of our mining value chains\n\nA digital twin of a mining value chain is a virtual replica of the entire operation, from the mine to the port. Through this virtual world, we are able to test different scenarios and see their impact before making real-world changes. This helps us make smarter, data-driven decisions while reducing risks and improving efficiency.\n\nExample of the continuous data exchange between a physical asset and the digital twin.\n\nMining operations are highly complex, often involving multiple mines, hubs, railways, ports, conveyors, loaders and trains - all working together. With so many moving parts, it\u2019s impossible for humans alone to optimise every decision. By combining digital twins with GenAI, we can process vast amounts of data to make better decisions to improve our productivity, reduce our costs and environmental impact, and make our operations safer.\n\nMaximising future production outcomes\n\nWhen we know what combinations of variables are required to deliver our production targets, we can focus our efforts on these things that matter most. Previously this was not always the case, as it can be difficult to quantify the production uplift from an improvement initiative, especially when there are many interdependent initiatives underway.\n\n\n\nThrough a digital twin and GenAI we can analyse our extensive historical data and current mine plans and operating context to predict realistic production outcomes. If these predictions identify production risks, we can take swift action to mitigate them. For example, a digital twin can identify the location of a bottleneck and help us decide how to address the root causes. Testing \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios within the digital twin saves time and cost and is safer as we require fewer on-site trials.\n\nWe are using digital twins at BMA, Copper South Australia and Escondida to predict future production outcomes and identify key performance drivers, risks and opportunities. Through these digital twins we have found new opportunities including to optimise mine haulage, address ore fragmentation and material handling challenges, and debottleneck surface operations.\n\n\n\nEmpowering decision making at the front line\n\nOur Integrated Remote Operations Centre operators must make quick decisions, but our operations are complex, and it is not always easy to determine the best decision at any given moment. For example, where should we send the truck? How many loading units should we operate? How should the dump be configured?\n\nThe BMA Autonomous Haulage Excellence Program has developed proprietary tools and in-house capabilities that uses AI, advanced analytics and digital twin modelling to predict operational performance. This allows us to act early before a problem arises. It is defining new ways to optimise and maintain our operations.\n\n\n\nAlthough autonomous sites are highly complex and dynamic with lots of moving parts, they also present great opportunities to collect and use the vast amounts of data and information that was not available in the past. We can now supply tens of millions of data points to a machine learning model that does the heavy lifting with identifying the key drivers correlated with good performance and then mapping over time to predict variability across the mining system, as we flex operating conditions. This allows us to maximise performance by optimising our equipment strategies and driving rapid improvement back into the system. In a very recent example, it facilitated an increase in productive movement by 10% per annum at one of BMA\u2019s autonomous operations.\n\nImproving mine planning using probabilistic methods\n\nTraditionally, our mine planners have used deterministic methods to create mine plans, where the output is fully determined by the inputs. But the world is full of variability, and we need to plan for this variability if we are to stabilise our mine plans and successfully execute them. We make thousands of decisions daily in operations. Each decision we make either increases or decreases the variability in the system. Which decisions are good decisions, and which are bad decisions? How do we choose? What are the impacts? How do we manage the impact of variability?\n\n\n\nA key BHP strategic ambition is to transform mine planning to create more robust, stable and achievable mine plans. By incorporating probabilistic methods and ranges into mine planning we can better understand the impacts of value chain variability. To support this transformation, we are leveraging our digital twin and GenAI to test and mitigate the impact of variability on our operations. Our digital twin at BMA has uplifted decision-making confidence across the business.\n\n\n\nSatisfying future global copper demand, despite supply challenges\n\nWe expect future global copper demand will grow, with looming global copper supply challenges. To increase copper production at Escondida, we use advanced analytics to understand the impacts of different ore characteristics and granulometry on semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill performance. A digital twin of the Escondida value chain and GenAI models inform ore blasting and blending strategies, identify mine areas with challenging ore characteristics, and support the implementation of SAG mill model predictive control. By mitigating the impacts of varying mineral characteristics, we have reduced monthly production losses due to granulometry by an average 70 per cent.\n\n\n\nWe are providing the same data-driven informed decision making across the business to support copper production, including at Copper South Australia and Spence.\n\nExample of the Escondida Digital Twin Model\n\n\n\nEnhancing digital twin insights creation using GenAI\n\nIntegrating GenAI with our digital twin models has resulted in faster insights generation, uncovered better opportunities and democratised access, allowing non-technical users to design and perform scenario analysis in natural language for improved business decisions.\u201d \u2013 Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, Vice President Value Engineering\n\nOur digital twin models have hundreds of input variables and produce thousands of output statistics. Each statistic is captured every minute and leads to millions of data points. How do we design the what-if scenarios? Which input variables should we test? How can we make sense of millions of output data points and compare the multitude of scenarios? Typically, designing the scenarios and extracting insights from the digital twin model requires specialised skills due to the large volumes of data, model complexities and numerous permutations and combinations of scenarios. Integrating GenAI with our digital twin models has resulted in faster insights generation, uncovered better opportunities and democratised access, allowing non-technical users to design and perform scenario analysis in natural language for improved business decisions.\n\n\n\nIntegrating GenAI with our value chain digital twin models empowers our people to make informed, data-driven decisions, which results in faster and more accurate planning. We are also able to predict the results from unexpected scenarios and prepare for a wider range of potential conditions. By applying knowledge and insight across all the assets we operate, we can optimise performance across the business.\n\n\n\nWe recently applied GenAI to our digital twin at BMA. Using natural language, the non-technical user can ask a variety of questions. For example, what are the realistic production ranges over the next five years? How does the value chain bottleneck shift and what are the key performance drivers causing the bottleneck? What levers can we pull to increase production? Can you suggest and run new scenarios to increase production? Through GenAI, future performance can be predicted with ease and hidden performance improvement opportunities can be uncovered.\n\n\n\nDigital innovation and sustainability practices\n\nA new age of digital innovation is dawning. New tools and technologies can synthesise vast quantities of complex data, better predict future outcomes and improve decision-making. As an industry, we need to find better, more sustainable ways to produce the metals and minerals required for the energy transition. The opportunities to use digital twins and AI to deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness is huge \u2013 for example, we can optimise energy and water consumption to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and broader environmental impact. Importantly, it will enable our work environments to be safer and more productive.\n\n",

We are Ophthalmologists and the routine working hours in these hospitals were limited to weekdays only. So as soon as we got this planned, we made sure to get a Schengen visa as well to give us the option to explore the neighboring states of Europe when time allows.

Reached Geneva and checked into the hotel close to the airport.\n\nNext morning, started out too early to visit the city centre. Decided to climb the Tower of the St. Pierre Cathedral and we were greeted with magnificent views of the city.\n\nThis part of Switzerland speaks French and the writing on top of the tower showed that\n\nThe climb of around 160 steps to the top of tower was exhausting, but the descent down was anxiety inducing\n\nGeneva has some of the best luxury shopping options and it was easy to spot some classy cars like these.\n\nTook the tram to get around to the Flower Clock\n\nAnd to get closer to the Iconic Jet d'Eau.

            "content": "BHPian Turbojc recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\n17 Oct \u201824 was an evening to remember. I ended my year-long hiatus from motorcycling by bringing home one of my dream motorcycles \u2013 a Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 with tubeless spoke wheels. Here\u2019s a brief account about my history on two wheels, what prompted me to buy a new motorcycle, and why I ended up buying the Himalayan over all the other options in the burgeoning 400 - 500cc class.\n\n\n\nKinetic Kick-off:\n\nI started my journey on two wheels in 2008 on a hand me down Kinetic Honda DX. It belonged to my sister, and it was a rattle trap. But it was a hoot to scoot around the city on, and I experienced some of my most memorable moments aboard it. As troublesome as it was, it holds a special place in my heart.\n\n\n\nActiva Activities:\n\nNext up came my Honda Activa 2G in 2009, which was officially my first new two-wheeler. I was in college then, and my parents were vehemently against getting me a motorcycle, so I had to settle for this instead. While it wasn\u2019t the most exciting thing to ride, it was practical, it got me around town quickly, and it was so much more reliable than the Kinetic. The Activa saw me through my four years in college, and was along with me for some of the best times of my life.\n\nOf course, being an automotive enthusiast, the itch to own a motorcycle only got stronger every passing year. I spent four years scratching it by riding my friends\u2019 motorcycles and going out on test rides. Finally, just before my graduation, I was able to convince my parents to get me one. And what a motorcycle it was - the KTM Duke 200.\n\n\n\nKTM Chaos:\n\nBack then, KTM was a hallowed brand among enthusiasts, known for their mad designs and equally bonkers performance. And when I got wind that we\u2019d get to experience a slice of that insanity at a relatively affordable price, I immediately grabbed that opportunity. A bright orange Austrian came home on June 7th, 2012.\n\nThe Duke 200 was a revelation. I got to experience exhilarating performance, telepathic handling, and top-notch build quality for the first time. It put into perspective all the adjectives penned by motoring journalists in all the auto magazines I had consumed till then.\n\nI had a ball owning the Duke 200. I thoroughly enjoyed the addictive rush of acceleration, the even torque spread which meant you could cruise at 40 in 6th gear, and the brakes that helped you shed speed in a jiffy. The Duke helped me learn a lot about the basics of motorcycling, all while having a ton of fun. I went on numerous rides on it with my friends, making memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Being from among first batches of production, the Duke was constantly plagued by numerous electrical gremlins. Moreover, I found the suspension to be way too stiff for me for everyday use. So in 2016, after four years of ownership, I passed the Duke on to a friend.\n\n\n\nAccess granted with Gusto:\n\nTwo scooters came home in 2016 \u2013 a Suzuki Access 125, and a Mahindra Gusto. We bought the Access for use in Coimbatore when I moved there for my Master\u2019s, and I won the Gusto (2nd place in the 2015 Mahindra AQ ).\n\nBoth were sweethearts \u2013 the Access was quite fast and fun for a scooter, whereas the Gusto was butter smooth to ride around in the city. However, that itch to ride a motorcycle remained. I kicked myself for selling the Duke while being in a city like Coimbatore, which boasts of some wonderful roads and destinations to ride to less than half a day away. But there wasn\u2019t much I could do. I had to wait till I could get a job and save up for my next motorcycle.\n\n\n\nAlmost Intercepted:\n\nCut to Nov 2019. I was back in Chennai. I had settled into a job and saved up some cash. Among the choices back then, the Interceptor 650 stood out with its fantastic power-to-price ratio. Multiple test-rides later, the heady rush of torque and the glorious parallel-twin growl convinced me that it was my next motorcycle, so I booked one. However, the fact that a 47 bhp motorcycle capable of speeds in excess of 150 kmph had tube tyres lingered in the back of my head. While tube tyre punctures are a nightmare to deal with, my main concern was the rapid loss of air, and consequently control of the motorcycle. I already had one bad experience on my Kinetic Honda, where I almost dropped the scooter when the rear tyre deflated suddenly at speed. I didn\u2019t want a redux of that on a much faster motorcycle. And so, I promptly cancelled my booking for the Interceptor 650, with the intention of getting one in case they offered tubeless alloy wheels. That of course never materialized until much later.\n\nAnd then COVID-19 struck, putting all my motorcycle plans on hold.\n\n\n\nThe Royal H\u2019ness:\n\nIn late 2020, as things were inching back into the new normal, Honda pulled a cat out of the bag in the form of the H\u2019ness CB350. At that point, I just wanted a comfortable commuter motorcycle with enough power and torque to cruise at highway speeds effortlessly, and the CB350 seemed to fit the bill. So, in March 2021, I bought one.\n\nI was back on a motorcycle after nearly five years, so I was revelling in its all its positive aspects. The CB350 was reasonably quick. It had a featherlight clutch which was a boon in city traffic. It offered a plush ride, yet it felt stable at highway speeds. It sounded great too. I used it for my daily commute to work, as well as the occasional early morning ride and late-night runs in and around the city to clear my mind. Thanks to its minimalist clean slate design, I also thoroughly enjoyed accessorizing the CB to my taste.\n\nHowever, as I piled on the kilometres, a few things became very evident. The CB350 felt\u2026 boring. It looked appealing, but it never really excited me while riding. Of course, it wasn\u2019t meant to set speed records, but it didn\u2019t feel special, like how my Duke 200 did. The motor had a narrow powerband, and the terribly spaced gears only made matters worse. It was neither conducive to calm low-speed cruising or for spirited riding. At that point, I had shifted homes, which lengthened my daily commute. I was more comfortable covering that distance by car, so the CB was hardly being ridden. I then decided to part with it, and I sold it to a gentleman in November 2023. I had no plan to replace it. In fact, I was under the intention that I was pretty much done with motorcycles.\n\nOr so I thought. Oh, how wrong I was.\n\n\n\nFOMO Strikes, Hard:\n\nMotorcycling isn\u2019t all as glamourous as it is usually portrayed. In fact, it is a sweaty and arduous ordeal, especially in a hot and dusty climate like ours. However, as cliched as it may sound, once you get a taste of that fun, freedom, and fraternity that motorcycling enables, you\u2019ll always keep longing for more. Gearing up and setting out for a ride at the crack of dawn. Being enveloped by the cold wind while riding on winter morning. Cruising along a twisty back road lined by greenery. That hot shower followed by a sumptuous dinner after a long, gruelling ride. I started to miss these addictive experiences. I still regret not riding as much as I could have in my 20s. I didn't want to hold the same regret in my 40s as well.\n\nMy craving to be back on two wheels began to resurface, and it kept getting stronger every passing day. My wife bore the brunt of my constant chatter about getting a new motorcycle. Finally, she caved in one day and gave me the green light to buy one. And so, the hunt began !\n\nZeroing in on my next steed:\n\nI started the hunt for my next motorcycle in March 2024. I considered practically every option in the sub \u20b96 lakhs price bracket. However, only a few bikes appealed to me. This included the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, the Triumph Scrambler 400X, the BMW G310 GS, the Aprilia RS457, and the Royal Enfield Continental GT 650. As much as I wanted to pick a sport bike, I needed to choose something with more dimension, given that it would be the only motorcycle in the garage. A Swiss knife of sorts. So, the RS457 and the Continental GT were out of contention faster than their respective 0-100 times. As for the 310 GS, the price tag simply didn't make sense for the performance on offer, so it was dropped as well. This left me with the Himalayan 450 and the Scrambler 400X.\n\n\n\nThe Triumph Scrambler 400X:\n\nI test rode both bikes back-to-back. The exceptional level of fit-and-finish on the Scrambler 400X was quite the draw. And it looked handsome to boot! The tall seat height made it feel like a bigger bike than the Speed 400. The 400X felt light and sprightly on the go. While the gearbox felt a tad notchy, the engine made up for it with its punchy performance. The ride quality felt plush, and the suspension soaked up bad patches admirably. The brakes were disappointing though, with insufficient feel and bite to stop the bike on a dime. I didn\u2019t like the instrument cluster either \u2013 an analogue speedo with a digital tacho made it difficult to gauge both the speed and the revs at a glance. It would have been much better the other way around. Overall, the Scrambler 400X came across as a pretty capable machine, but somehow it didn't tug at my heartstrings.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Enfield Himalayan 450:\n\nI\u2019ve always harboured a soft spot for motorcycles with a purposeful, mechanical design, such as the erstwhile Himalayan 411, so I was really looking forward to ride the all-new 450. The first things that stood out as I straddled the bike were its tall seat height and spacious ergonomics. The Himalayan 450 looked and felt like a proper big bike! It comfortably accommodated my hefty 5\u201911\u201d frame. I also loved how the ergos seated the rider in a commanding stance that towered over the traffic.\n\nWhile the weight made its presence felt at standstill, the Himalayan masked it well on the go. The bike felt lithe and agile, and was easy to manoeuvre through city traffic. The liquid-cooled Sherpa 452cc single effortlessly picked up speed as I wound the throttle open, while letting out a gruff, throaty roar. There was abundant performance in reserve right from 3000rpm. The gear ratios were well-matched to suit the engine\u2019s character. I could cruise at as low as 40kmph in 4th gear yet have access to energetic acceleration should I choose to overtake.\n\nThe next thing that impressed me was the brilliant suspension. The Showa shocks simply devoured every pothole, bump, and undulation thrown its way with finesse and aplomb. I hardly had to slow down for bad patches or speed breakers. Yet, it maintained its composure at speed and under braking, never feeling soft or bouncy. The brakes were a delight too, offering more than sufficient stopping power without feeling grabby.\n\nNow, on to the negatives. While fit and finish levels were good, the Himalayan 450 lacked refinement. The bike exuded a raw, mechanical feel when ridden. Vibrations were evident, especially under acceleration. The tubeless tyres that RE announced at launch were also nowhere in sight. Nevertheless, I was thoroughly impressed with what the overall package had to offer.\n\n\n\nThe tube vs tubeless conundrum:\n\nOne big bugbear I had with advs and enduros is that most of them came with tube tyres, which I detest. I\u2019m a strong believer that, in this day and age, all motorcycles should come equipped with tubeless wheels, be it alloys or wire-spokes. So, when Royal Enfield announced the all-new Himalayan 450 with tubeless spoke wheels, I was over the moon. Here was a capable adventure motorcycle that I can ride minus the worry of being stranded due to a flat tyre. However, the wheels would take time to arrive pending certification for local use. Nobody knew exactly how long that would be, and so, I put the Himalayan 450 on the backburner.\n\n\n\nThe left-field option \u2013 Royal Enfield Bear 650:\n\nIt was around this time that images of the Bear 650 being tested surfaced. I was enamoured by the idea of an Interceptor with suspension components tweaked for rough road riding. In fact, I even saw one being ridden by a factory test rider in person, and it was quite appealing. However, I noticed that all test bikes were shod with tube-type wire spoke wheels, which was a downside for me. Still, I decided to wait and see if RE would launch the Bear with optional alloys or tubeless wire spoked wheels.\n\n\n\nThe Decision:\n\nAs the months rolled on, I became increasingly impatient. Both the Bear 650 and the tubeless rims for the Himalayan 450 were nowhere in sight. By August, I started to seriously consider getting the Scrambler 400X for the time being. However, news that some interesting announcements would be made at Royal Enfield\u2019s Motoverse in November quelled my restlessness. At that point, I made the decision \u2013 it would be either the Himalayan 450 with tubeless spoke rims, or the Bear 650, whichever came first.\n\n\n\n27 September 2024:\n\nI was casually browsing Team-BHP when I stumbled across the news \u2013 the tubeless spoke rims for the Himalayan 450 were finally launched ! In fact, I had to do a double take when I saw the price \u2013 they were being offered for just a \u20b911,000 hike over the standard bike! This was an absolute win. I immediately enquired the Brand Showroom close to my house, and they confirmed that they were taking orders.\n\nI wished to wait no longer, for a wise man once said, it would be better to spend time wisely rather than money. The very next day, I went to the showroom along with my wife. I took her out on a short test ride on the 450 to see if she felt comfortable on the pillion saddle, and then made my booking through their \u2018Make It Yours\u2019 programme at the showroom. I was told delivery would take between 30 \u2013 45 days, but I could get it earlier. Finally, I was just one step closer to getting an amazing motorcycle home!\n\nThe Himalayan 450, as I specced it on the MiY configurator:\n\n\n\nApart from the tubeless spoke wheels, I also opted for the touring mirrors and the beautifully-designed rally engine guard.\n\nI named my bike StormTrooper, after the Empire's fiercely loyal soldiers clad in white armour (I fell in love with Star Wars recently !)\n\nContinue reading BHPian Turbojc's post for more insights and information.",

            "content": "What do our analysts think about Morningstar Investor subscriber's top trades during January?\n\nSharesight is a portfolio tracker that is integrated into Morningstar Investor. Their data shows the top 20 trades by Morningstar users in January 2025.\n\nThe top trades were iShares S&P 500 ETF IVV, Woodside WDS and Vanguard MSCI International ETF VGS.\n\nFigure: Morningstar's top trades for January 2025. Source: Morningstar Investor/Sharesight\n\nHere is what our equity and manager research analysts think about our top buy trades.\n\nSource: Sharesight/Morningstar Investor, top trades in January 2025\n\nTop buy trade: iShares S&P 500 ETF IVV\n\nMorningstar Medalist rating: Gold\n\nMany passive Australian investors are anything but. They deviate from this strategy by making active decisions to be overweight in certain sectors, themes or geographies. It is no secret that Australian investors prefer and are heavily invested in domestic markets.\n\nHowever, Australian investors have started to double down on the US as well. This may be due to the US outperforming almost every other market since the GFC. It is no surprise that iShares S&P 500 ETF IVV tops the list, with investors showing they're bullish on the new Presidency.\n\nGiven the breadth of coverage and the cost efficiency, iShares S&P 500 ETF IVV is a fine choice for investors seeking US-specific equity exposure. Our manager research analysts think it is the best in class option for large cap investors. The strategy is expected to outperform its peers over the long term and remains the clear choice for investors to gain US exposure. It can be paired with other ex-US products to form a balanced global equity portfolio.\n\nThe underlying benchmark, the S&P 500, is a market-cap-weighted index of the largest 500 companies in the United States. Thus, it offers giant- to mid-cap exposure, covering about 80% of the free-float-adjusted market cap of the US equity market. This results in a well-diversified index at the stock and sector levels. As such, passive strategies that track the S&P 500 stand as above-average options in a market segment where active managers have generally struggled to outperform. Consisting of highly liquid stocks, material stock-specific valuation information is quickly incorporated into stock prices.\n\nFrom an Australian perspective, IVV gives exposure to a broad portfolio of some of the world\u2019s most noteworthy companies, including sectors that are underrepresented in Australia such as technology and healthcare. The S&P 500\u2019s correlation to Australian equities has come down in recent years, effectively adding to diversification for Australian equities exposure.\n\nAt an annual fee of 0.04%, the fund is priced attractively compared to active and passive peers.\n\nWhen we look to the index\u2019s exposure, 34% of the index is in the top 10 holdings, 7.04% of the index is in one holding \u2013 Apple AAPL, 6.41% in Microsoft MSFT and 5.92% in NVIDIA Corp NVDA. The index is highly concentrated in tech, with over 32% of the index in this sector (at 3 February 2025).\n\nTop buy trade: Woodside Energy WDS \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAs Australia's premier oil player, Woodside Petroleum's operations encompass liquid natural gas, natural gas, condensate and crude oil. However, LNG interests in the North West Shelf Joint Venture, or NWS/JV, and Pluto offshore Western Australia are the mainstay, and the low-cost advantage of these assets form the foundation for Woodside. Future LNG development, particularly relating to the Pluto project, encompasses a large percentage of this company's intrinsic value.\n\nWoodside is unique among Australian energy companies in that it has successfully managed the development of LNG projects for more than 25 years\u2014unparalleled domestic experience at a complicated and expensive task. Adding to Woodside's competitive advantages are the long-term 20-year off-take agreements with the who's who of Asia's blue chip energy utilities, such as Tokyo Electric, Kansai Electric, Chubu Electric, and Osaka Gas. These help ensure sufficient project financing during development and should bring stability to Woodside's cash flows once projects are complete.\n\nWoodside's development pipeline is deep, enabling it to leverage the tried and trusted project-delivery platform as a template for other world-class gas accumulations off the north-west coast of Australia. Woodside is well suited to the development challenge. With extensive experience, it remains a stand-out energy investment at the right price. It is currently a five star stock, trading at a meaningful 40% discount to fair value (at 3 February 2025).\n\nTop buy trade: Vanguard MSCI International ETF VGS\n\nOur manager research analysts believe that Vanguard MSCI International ETF VGS is an excellent choice for global exposure.\n\nIt provides Australian investors with an affordable and efficient gateway to the global equity markets. This exchange-traded fund (VGS) and its AUD-hedged version (VGAD) mirror the MSCI World ex Australia Index (and AUD Hedged version for the hedged class), incorporating net dividends reinvested, setting a challenging benchmark for active fund managers to surpass. With its low expense ratio and Vanguard's expanding scale, the strategy presents a formidable challenge for active managers to beat.\n\nThe underlying index has universal appeal for constructing a diversified portfolio that spans 22 developed economies represented by approximately 1,500 holdings. The index is skewed toward the United States (a common feature across most global indexes) but given the majority of its holdings are multinationals earning sizable revenue from international markets, concentration is not a notable risk here.\n\nIts cost efficiency, broad diversification across multiple developed markets, and solid performance record, especially in a competitive landscape with skilled active managers, highlight its appeal.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.",

            "content": "BHPian khan_sultan recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nTook the Volvo out for a well-deserved picnic\u2026 at Race Wars India! Because what\u2019s a better way to relax than some good old-fashioned tyre-screeching, engine-revving, speed-chasing mayhem? The event was held at Buddh Circuit, and I signed up for the 0-100m drag with unlimited runs -- basically, unlimited chances to embarrass myself in front of speed junkies who do this regularly.\n\nNow, this was my first-ever drag event. My past experience? Crawling over rocks and tackling slow-speed off-roading. So yeah, jumping into a drag race was like trading a calm yoga session for an intense HIIT workout -- big shift, much excitement, and lots of confusion.\n\nArrival: Early Bird Gets the\u2026 Empty Track?\n\nBeing the eager beaver I am, I reached before the organizers. Yep, first to arrive. Even the Volvo was like, \"Bro, are we too early?\" The winter morning drive was smooth, the car was happy, and I had a whole place to myself for a bit.\n\n\n\nOnce the organizers showed up, registration went smoothly.\n\n\n\nGot my bands, car access pass, and an entire sticker collection -- basically turned my Volvo into a moving billboard. Stickered up, feeling official!\n\n\n\nWith my car looking the part, I took a stroll and admired the tuner cars flexing their mods for the autotrack event.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the crew was busy setting up the drag equipment, testing the beams and computers.\n\n\n\nPrepping the viewing and the drift area, which later turned into a full-on smoke show.\n\n\n\nThen, the drag lineup opened. Cars started rolling in, and some of them were:\n\nBMW M340i \u2013 Fast, and the driver was nailing an avg of 0.4xx second reaction times with 0.2xx seconds on several runs!\n\n\n\nX4 M40 \u2013 Absolute rocket. This thing launched and kept on going and going and going till the end of the strip!!\n\n\n\nAudi TT 45TSI \u2013 Classy, sporty, and quick.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, yours truly in the Volvo, casually pulling up to the line.\n\n\n\nThe Drags: Reaction Time, what\u2019s that?\n\nMy runs? Let\u2019s just say the Volvo had the legs, but my reaction time needed some serious work. While other cars took off like fighter jets, I was out here contemplating life for an average of 0.9 seconds before hitting the throttle.\n\nThat said, once the Volvo got going, it did make up for the slow starts. Managed to outpace a BMW 330i and an Audi TT 45TSI, which was honestly unexpected with my skills. The real showstopper was a fully modded Skoda VRS in the OPEN Class -- that thing was lightning fast (and the fastest car of the day), but hey, I was only 0.917 seconds behind it. Not bad for a 13-year-old Volvo!\n\nKey Learnings from My Drag Racing Debut\n\n\n\nMaster the Christmas Tree Lights -- Staring at them like they owe me money isn\u2019t helping. Must react faster.\n\nImprove Launch Technique -- Apparently, launching at zero revs is not the way to go. Holding revs for 2-3 seconds makes a difference.\n\nFind the Perfect Transmission Mode -- Tried manual S1 & S2; felt weird. Found regular S mode worked best. More testing needed!\n\nVolvo = Sleeper Beast -- It recorded the 5th fastest time overall, across all categories/classes. Fellow racers were shocked at how quick it was, and several came to me after the runs to ask about the car. A 13-year-old Volvo giving modern cars a hard time? Priceless.\n\nDrift Action & Tyre Carnage\n\nBetween runs, I wandered over to the drift area -- because watching cars violently destroy their tyres is always entertaining.\n\n\n\nMore drifters waiting for their turn to burn some rubber\n\n\n\nRubber was burnt, tyres were shredded, and a pit crew was on standby to tend to the cars and do rapid tyre swaps. Absolute madness.\n\n\n\nDid few more runs and as the day wrapped up and the circuit lights came on, it was time to head home -- happy and loaded with new racing wisdom.\n\nFinal verdict? A Sunday well spent. The Volvo proved itself, I learned a ton, and next time, I\u2019ll come back sharper, faster, and hopefully, with better reaction times.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Just me, my car and my camera, and a good location. I love walking around for hours, searching for landscapes and exploring different angles and lights for photography.\n\n\n\nThis is what I did recently at Gandikota Fort in Andhra Pradesh, some 6 hours drive away from Bangalore.\n\n\n\nGandikota Fort is a popular tourist destination and is usually crowded with tourists. The fort has plenty of, but all very basic accommodation options ranging from basic lodges to tents, including one resort from the AP tourism department. Unfortunately, none of these options looked too appealing from the online reviews - most of these are not very clean. In fact, the entire areas has no good hotel to stay at. Finally, based on online reviews, booked one hotel called \"\n\n\n\nOf course, although I keep calling this a solo trip, my companion was my trusted \"Dusty\", my Thar 4x4. The small and basic hotel had no parking place as such, and Dusty was parked on the side of a small lane that the hotel is located on. Dusty makes no fuss about parking places and that small roadside spot was OK for a night's stay.\n\n\n\nI drove to Belum Caves first, before reaching Gandikota later that day. Belum Caves are large underground natural caves, with a nicely developed underground walking path through the caves that spans about 3km. I enjoyed walking underground and seeing the caves. However, the lighting in the caves was too bright and colorful for my liking, and it made the caves look artificial - sort of like a movie set or an amusement park setting - instead of getting the feel of seeing real natural wonder (which the caves really are). I was a bit of put off by these colorful lighting and did not care to do any photography as such in the caves. Just sharing a couple of photos below to show what I mean.\n\n\n\nThe nice underground walking path in Belum Caves:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, such colorful lighting makes the caves look artificial:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo colorful and bright for my liking:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping aside the colorful lighting part, the caves are indeed nice and quite big. The natural underground formations of various sizes and shapes are nice to see. There are lot of walking paths underground, some big and some small and narrow where one has to bend down and walk with very limited headroom.\n\n\n\nFrom the caves, I drove to the hotel. After a quick check-in and a lunch at a nearby restaurant in the town, I drove straight to Gandikota Fort for the evening photography session. My plan was to spend two sessions walking around on the fort. The evening session that day (around 4pm to 7pm) chasing the sunset, and then the next morning session (6am to 8am) chasing the sunrise. The weather is very hot there, and the whole area is open to the sun with no shade whatsoever, and therefore, only the morning and evening times are the right times to venture out there.\n\n\n\nThe fort is quite big, and there are plenty of locations and viewpoints to walk around. There is a large parking lot outside the fort (where mostly the buses parked), but one can even drive through the fort and park at another parking lot inside the fort too (where most of the cars drove to and parked). I parked in the inside parking lot and wandered around the fort with my camera in my hand.\n\n\n\nDusty in Gandikota Fort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was quite hot there, and walking around to various locations within the large fort was a good exercise. After checking out an ancient temple and an ancient mosque, all within the fort premises, I walked to the main attraction, the canyon view point. This fort is famous for the views of a canyon formed by Penna River cutting through the rocky landscapes.\n\n\n\nExternal walls of the fort, overlooking the canyon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fort offers breathtaking views all around, especially during sunset and sunrise, and has a lot of historical monuments too. However, unfortunately, it is in a very bad mess due to heavy tourism and crowds. There is trash and garbage (including broken glasses and bottles) everywhere, and it was really sad to see this mess. Car parking was also unregulated and poorly managed. Many cars were parked in haphazard manner causing problems to other cars moving around. This fort would be an amazing place if kept clean and if the tourist and vehicle movements are regulated and controlled.\n\n\n\nThere is a walking path to the end of the fort from where you see the canyon views. That viewpoint is essentially a small hill full of big rocks, and one can climb on the rocks to get various vantage points to see the canyon. Depending on one's fitness level and enthusiasm, one can climb to various heights to get a good view. With camera in my hand, I walked up and down the big rocks multiple times to get good views and angles of the canyon. It became a good workout session for me that day, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n\n\nViews of the canyon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast rays of the evening on the tip of the rocks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to see the views of the canyon at the dusk, and there was still some time for that. So I climbed down from those rocks and started exploring other parts of the fort in the meantime. The sunset would be in the other direction (the above view is the eastern view), and I thought I should check out sunset on the western side of the fort.\n\n\n\nWhile walking around, a large ancient temple in the middle of the fort looked amazing with the sun setting behind it. There was a group of tourists on top of that temple, and that setting formed a nice subject for some silhouette photography experiments.\n\n\n\nSilhouettes of the crowd watching sunset behind the temple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sun setting behind the temple and a distant hill:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a cue from those tourists, I found a way to climb to the top of that viewpoint, and found magnificent views on the other side from there.\n\n\n\nSunset on the west side of the fort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI came back to the canyon view point right at the time when sun went down the horizon, to check out the twilight glow there, and I was not disappointed by those views.\n\n\n\nThe canyon at dusk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe twilight time just after sunset was magical. The sky was lit up beautifully in blue and orange shades, and the ancient structures in the fort looked great against the backdrop of that sky.\n\n\n\nThe mosque in the colourful twilight:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautiful structure called \"Charminar in Gandikota Fort\", under that lovely evening sky:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautiful temple in the fort looked amazing under the evening sky:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the sunset and twilight hour wandering around, it was time to go back to the hotel. Dusty was parked in an open parking lot which was essentially just a vast open grassland. When I reached the parking spot at the end of the day, with that evening glow still lingering around in the sky, and headlights of other cars around giving a nice lighting effect, it gave me an idea to click this below photograph there.\n\n\n\nTime to pack up and call it a day:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy hotel was about 15km away from the fort, and the night drive to the hotel after that sunset session was very peaceful and serene. The road from Gandikota to that hotel is very nice. It is a nice two-lane road with good lane markings and reflectors, across the vast open desert lands and hills, with zero development on either side. In the night, it was pitch dark all around, zero light pollution, the sky was clear and lit up with a thousand stars, the reflectors in the lane markings looked fantastic under the headlights, and with zero traffic all around, it was a fantastic drive back! Most of the tourists on the fort stayed in one of those lodges or tents on the fort, and there was hardly anyone driving in and out of the fort at that time.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I started from the hotel at about 5:45am, and again had that beautiful drive back to the fort, still under pitch dark conditions, and with those reflectors looking lovely under the headlights. Absolutely loved those peaceful and quiet night drives across the desert lands, to and from my hotel to the fort.\n\n\n\nI parked the car and walked straight to the canyon view point for sunrise. It was still good 20 minutes before sunrise when I was walking to that point. I love this morning walks to see the sunrise. The anticipation of seeing the sunrise is as exciting as the sunrise itself. I walked briskly, climbed the rocks, found a good spot with clear views, and waited in anticipation to see the sun rising from straight behind the canyons. And in the next few minutes, I saw an absolutely breathtaking sunrise there which was the highlight of my trip.\n\n\n\nSunrise above the canyon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magic of the morning light:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the beautifully backlit rocks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing the sunrise I waled back to my car and drove to another point nearby for another view.\n\n\n\nWhile walking back, saw that ancient temple on the fort now bathing in the morning light:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDusty on the fort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning views of the canyon and the water from another point:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a parting shot of Dusty on that vast and open land surrounding the fort and the canyon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return drive to Bangalore was a brisk and uneventful drive. Overall it was a memorable short trip. The fort was beautiful, and the views from the fort, especially the sunrise views were absolutely breathtaking. I will surely remember that sunrise for a long long time.\n\n\n\nWell, that is all from this simple and short weekend drive. Thank you very much for reading!

I love walking around for hours, searching for landscapes and exploring different angles and lights for photography.This is what I did recently at Gandikota Fort in Andhra Pradesh, some 6 hours drive away from Bangalore.

Unfortunately, none of these options looked too appealing from the online reviews - most of these are not very clean. In fact, the entire areas has no good hotel to stay at. Finally, based on online reviews, booked one hotel called \" Royal Palace Residency \" in a small town some 15km away from the fort. This place is very basic too - just a roadside lodge with zero amenities or luxuries. However, the room was clean and comfortable, with spotless white sheets and towels, a good working AC (very important in that hot climate there) and again a basic but clean bathroom. That was enough for a solo one night stay for me. The hotel manager and staff there are extremely friendly and welcoming, and their hospitality was top class and worth mentioning here. Overall a good place to stay for a short visit to Gandikota. I was glad I found this place instead of staying on the fort itself (those accommodations did not look good at all when I saw them after reaching there).Of course, although I keep calling this a solo trip, my companion was my trusted \"Dusty\", my Thar 4x4. The small and basic hotel had no parking place as such, and Dusty was parked on the side of a small lane that the hotel is located on.

After test-driving them all, I finally brought home a 2024 BMW X5 40i in stunning black colour.\n\n\n\nJust hours after taking delivery, we set off on a 7,200 km adventure from Kerala to Kashmir and back. And oh boy, what a journey it was! The B58 engine never failed to put a grin on my face\u2014every growl, every pull, every downshift was pure joy.\n\n\n\nNow, about the back seat\u2014sure, it\u2019s not as plush as the GLE\u2019s, but it\u2019s far from uncomfortable. My three-year-old son slept peacefully through most of the trip, which says a lot. In fact, after covering such an insane distance, my wife and I hopped on our scooty for a quick ride minutes after reaching home. Not once did the trip feel exhausting.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that kept me on the edge was the low-profile run-flat tires. I was constantly worried about hitting a nasty pothole and damaging those beautiful alloys. But thankfully, the X5 held up like a champ.\n\n\n\nSo my recommendation would be, if you like driving and enjoy spending time behind the wheel, BMW X5 all the way. Alternatively, if you like being chauffeured and enjoy time at the back seat go for the GLE. You cant go wrong with both. Last edited by Turbanator : 5th February 2025 at 20:05 .

Trip distance 3900\n\n3. Did 2x 900kms days\n\n4. Spent the longest I\u2019ve ever done on the saddle without a break - 300kms\n\n5. One way distance SG-BKK is around 1850kms. Split that into 3 segments with 2 over night breaks as per - 900kms + 475kms + 475kms\n\n6. The final 300km journey back home was completely torrential rains which I\u2019ve never seen before in these parts. Low visibility coupled with completely wet roads (obviously !).\n\nThe bike performed flawlessly in terms of no mechanical or electrical glitches despite getting splashed around with water as well as solid grip. Usually during rains, I switch to the rain mode which slows down the throttle response a bit and brings in the rain ABS map - all of which work very well to avoid any loss of grip due to sudden water flow typical in such heavy rains or when one needs to do braking to slow down for traffic ahead or while making lane changes. One more feature that helped in these times of low visibility was the proximity radar alerts one gets in the rear view mirrors. This alerts you on vehicles adjacent to you as well as approaching you from behind. This really supplemented the physical checks one would do looking into the mirrors.\n\nBasically sharing these stats to highlight this bike\u2019s touring credentials. Average fuel efficiency for the trip was 21.2 kmpl thanks to the super smooth expressway in Malaysia and very good highways in Thailand.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Copper might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy, but it\u2019s one of the most crucial materials powering the shift to a cleaner future. From EV batteries and charging networks to solar panels and wind turbines, copper is everywhere, and demand for it is only getting stronger.\n\nWith the rising investment in electric vehicles and the government\u2019s incentives to lower carbon emissions, strong copper stocks like BHP Group Limited (BHP), Rio Tinto Group (RIO), and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) could benefit substantially.\n\nCopper prices rose more than 6% in the first six trading days of the year, fueled by China\u2019s economic stimulus and increasing investments in clean energy. According to S&P Global, global copper mine production is expected to peak at 23.5 million tons between 2025 and 2026 before declining, raising concerns about long-term supply constraints.\n\nThe red metal is widely used in electric vehicles, with each EV requiring nearly four times the amount of copper used in a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle. Beyond vehicles, the electrification of transportation networks, battery storage systems, and charging stations all heavily rely on copper. Meanwhile, the transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power further fuels copper demand.\n\nAnalysts estimate that copper demand from energy transition sectors will grow at a CAGR of 10.7%, with the EV sector alone driving a 14.3% increase, solar power 5.6%, and wind applications 9.3%. Overall, the demand for copper is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% through 2034.\n\nWith these strong tailwinds, let\u2019s analyze the fundamental aspects of the three Industrial \u2013 Metals picks, beginning with the third choice.\n\nStock #3: Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO)\n\nSCCO is an integrated producer of copper and valuable by-products. It operates mining, exploration, smelting, and refining facilities in Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador. Its operating segments include Peruvian operations, Mexican open-pit operations, and Mexican underground mining operations.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, backed by its strong financials, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share and a stock dividend of 0.0073 shares per share of common stock. This dividend is payable on February 27, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business.\n\nSCCO pays an annual dividend of $2.80, which translates to a yield of 3.06% at the prevailing price levels. Its four-year average dividend yield is 4.51%. The company\u2019s dividend payments have grown at a CAGR of 5.8% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock\u2019s trailing 12-month gross profit margin of 57.11% is 96.5% higher than the industry average of 29.06%. In addition, its trailing 12-month net income margin and ROCE of 27.67% and 36.34% are considerably above the industry averages of 4.74% and 5.72%, respectively.\n\nSCCO\u2019s sales for the third quarter (ended September 30, 2024) increased 17% year-over-year to $2.93 billion. The company reported an operating income of $1.45 billion, indicating a 35.6% growth from the prior-year quarter, while its adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.68 billion, up 30.5% year-over-year. SCCO\u2019s net income grew 44.7% and 43.8% from the prior-year quarter to $896.70 million or $1.15 per share, respectively.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $2.87 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter (ended December 2024) represents a 24.8% increase year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $1.01 for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 78.2% improvement year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history; it surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters.\n\nSCCO shares have surged 12.4% over the past year to close the last trading session at $91.62.\n\nSCCO\u2019s bright prospects are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of B, which translates to a Buy in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nIt has an A grade for Quality and a B for Stability. Among 32 stocks in the Industrial \u2013 Metals industry, it is ranked #8.

Its business also includes diamond mining, sorting and marketing, and lithium exploration.\n\nOn January 30, 2025, the company partnered with Hydro to explore carbon capture technologies for aluminum production. It will invest $45 million over five years to advance decarbonization efforts. This move aligns with RIO\u2019s broader sustainability goals and enhances its leadership in low-carbon metals.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, RIO approved a $2.5 billion expansion of its Rincon lithium project in Argentina. The project aims to produce 60,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually, with the first production expected in 2028. This investment solidifies the company\u2019s long-term commitment to the EV battery supply chain, positioning it as a major player in the global lithium market.\n\nThese strategic initiatives reinforce RIO\u2019s competitive edge, driving future growth while advancing environmental and energy transition goals.\n\nRIO\u2019s trailing 12-month EBITDA and levered FCF margins of 36.26% and 12.73% are 118.5% and 142.5% higher than their respective industry averages of 16.60% and 5.25%. Likewise, its 20.11% trailing-12-month ROCE compares to the 5.72% industry average.\n\nFor six months of fiscal 2024 that ended on June 30, 2024, RIO reported consolidated sales revenue of $26.80 billion, indicating a marginal year-over-year increase. The company\u2019s operating profit for the same period rose 14% from the year-ago value to $8.26 billion. In addition, profit after tax for the period and EPS came in at $5.89 billion and $3.56, up 19.1% and 13.3% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nStreet expects RIO\u2019s EPS and revenue for the fiscal year ending in December 2024 to come in at $6.76 and $53.19 billion, respectively. Over the past month, the stock has gained 1.9%, closing the last trading session at $60.41.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that RIO has an overall rating of B, equating to Buy in our POWR Ratings system. It also has a B grade for Value, Stability, and Quality. Within the same industry, RIO is ranked #5.\n\nBeyond what is stated above, we\u2019ve also rated RIO for Growth, Momentum, and Sentiment.

It operates through Petroleum; Copper; Iron Ore; and Coal segments.\n\nIn July last year, BHP and Lundin Mining Corporation agreed to jointly acquire Filo Corp. and its Filo del Sol copper project through a Canadian plan of arrangement. As part of the deal, both companies will form a 50/50 joint venture to manage the FDS and Josemaria projects in Argentina and Chile. BHP will contribute $2.1 billion to the transaction, which aligns with its strategy of acquiring early-stage copper assets and forming strategic partnerships for long-term growth.\n\nIn terms of the trailing-12-month gross profit margin, BHP\u2019s 82.28% is 183.1% higher than the 29.06% industry average. Likewise, its 17.68% trailing-12-month Return on Common Equity compares favorably to the 5.72% industry average.\n\nBHP had a strong start to FY 2025, with production rising across all major commodities. In its recent operational report for the quarter that ended on September 30, 2024, the company posted a 4% year-over-year increase in copper production to 476.3 kt, driven by improved feed grades at Escondida. Iron ore production at WAIO grew 2%, aided by the completion of the Port Debottlenecking Project and South Flank ramp-up, while energy coal production rose 2% to 3.7 Mt.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, BHP\u2019s revenues increased 3.5% year-over-year to $55.70 billion. Its underlying attributable profit grew 2.2% from the year-ago value to $13.70 billion, while its underlying EBITDA came in at $29 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year, with a margin of 54%. Also, the company\u2019s free cash flow increased to $11.90 billion from $5.60 billion recorded last year.\n\nAnalysts expect BHP\u2019s EPS for the current year (ending June 2025) to be $4.45 and grow by 3.5% year-over-year to $4.61 next year. Meanwhile, its revenue for the fiscal years 2024 and 2025 is forecasted to reach $50.77 billion and $50.36 billion, respectively.\n\nThe stock has gained marginally over the past month to close the last trading session at $49.15.\n\nBHP\u2019s strong fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of A, translating to a Strong Buy in our proprietary rating system.\n\nIt has a B grade for Value, Stability, and Quality.

            "content": "Fluor Corporation FLR has secured a significant joint venture contract with Hatch for BHP\u2019s Olympic Dam Smelter & Refinery Expansion Project in South Australia. The contract, focused on engineering, procurement, and construction management, marks a key opportunity for Fluor to strengthen its mining and metals business.\n\n\n\nThe project remains subject to a final investment decision by BHP, which is expected in the first half of 2027. Fluor will recognize its undisclosed share of the contract value in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nCopper Demand and Fluor\u2019s Growth Potential\n\nThe Olympic Dam expansion aligns with the increasing global demand for copper, driven by the energy transition and electrification trends. BHP\u2019s goal is to boost refined copper cathode production to over 500,000 tonnes by the early 2030s and potentially 650,000 tonnes by the mid-2030s.\n\n\n\nFluor\u2019s involvement in this long-term initiative positions the company to benefit from sustained mining infrastructure spending. As copper plays a critical role in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and grid expansion, Fluor\u2019s expertise in large-scale industrial projects gives it a competitive edge in securing future contracts.\n\n\n\nThis contract enhances Fluor\u2019s pipeline of high-value projects, reinforcing its role in the resource sector. If BHP proceeds with full-scale expansion, Fluor could see substantial revenue growth from this multi-phase project. Given the increasing importance of copper in a decarbonizing world, Fluor\u2019s strategic partnership with BHP may drive long-term shareholder value. Investors should watch for updates on BHP\u2019s investment decision and Fluor\u2019s continued execution in the mining sector.\n\nFluor\u2019s Share Price Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of FLR have gained 27.7% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry\u2019s 13.4% growth. The ongoing backlog strength, market diversity and Building a Better Future strategy are positioning the company well for an outperformance in the upcoming period.\n\n\n\nFluor has been witnessing business prospects and a demand uptrend in various sectors, including the chemicals sector, energy transition, fuel production, mining and metals, and big data. This growing trend is reflected in the solid uptick in new awards and backlog value.\n\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the company secured new awards worth $2.7 billion. At the end of Sept. 30, 2024, the consolidated backlog was $31.32 billion, up 20.5% from $26 billion a year ago. This substantial backlog underscores the continued strong demand for Fluor's services and the recognized value it brings to its clients. The company continues to witness strong demand for its services, pushing new award margins above its strategic segment margin range of 4-6%.\n\nFLR\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nFluor currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\n\n\nHere are some better-ranked stocks from the Construction sector.\n\n\n\nWeyerhaeuser Company WY currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

            "content": "Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO) and Glencore (LON:GLEN) , two of the world\u2019s largest mining companies, have been in discussions about a potential merger, according to sources familiar with the matter. If successful, the deal would reshape the global mining sector, creating a powerful competitor to industry leader BHP. However, the discussions remain preliminary, and there is no certainty that a deal will be reached.\n\nRio Tinto is the world\u2019s second most valuable mining company, with a market capitalization of $103 billion as of Thursday. It is one of only two miners, alongside its Melbourne-based counterpart BHP, to surpass the $100 billion valuation mark. Glencore, which is currently valued at $55 billion, has been active in mergers and acquisitions, notably making an unsuccessful bid for Canada\u2019s Teck Resources in 2023.\n\nA Rio Tinto-Glencore merger would create a mining giant with a combined market value exceeding $150 billion, surpassing BHP\u2019s current valuation of $125 billion. This would make the new entity the largest mining company in the world, reshaping competition at the top of the industry.\n\nThe primary driver behind the talks is copper, a metal essential for the global transition to renewable energy. Copper demand is expected to rise due to its role in electric vehicles, power grids, and renewable energy infrastructure. If combined, Rio Tinto and Glencore\u2019s copper production would rival BHP\u2019s output. Glencore\u2019s 2024 copper production guidance is around 1 million tonnes, while Rio Tinto is targeting up to 720 kilotonnes.\n\nA History of Mergers and Missed Opportunities\n\nThis is not the first time Glencore has pursued a high-profile merger. In 2014, the company, under then-CEO Ivan Glasenberg, attempted to merge with Rio Tinto, but the proposal was swiftly rejected. That move came just two years after Glencore\u2019s $90 billion acquisition of Xstrata, which transformed it from a trading-focused company into a mining powerhouse.\n\nGlencore itself became a major player in mining after Xstrata had earlier failed in its attempt to merge with Anglo American in 2009. The Anglo-Xstrata merger never materialized after Anglo rejected the deal outright.\n\nRio Tinto, meanwhile, has had its own struggles with major acquisitions. In 2007, it bought Canadian aluminum giant Alcan for $38 billion, paying a steep 65% premium to outbid competitors. However, as commodity prices declined, the deal turned into a financial disaster, leading to $25 billion in write-downs.\n\nBHP, the world\u2019s largest miner, has also faced regulatory and economic obstacles in its M&A history. In 2008, it attempted a $116 billion takeover of Rio Tinto, but regulators blocked the deal. The onset of the global financial crisis further undermined the feasibility of the acquisition.\n\nChallenges Facing the Mining Industry\n\nThe potential Rio Tinto-Glencore merger comes at a turbulent time for the mining industry. The five largest diversified mining companies\u2014BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Vale, and Anglo American\u2014have seen significant declines in their market values. In 2024, they collectively lost $119.7 billion, or 25.3% of their combined value, according to the MINING.COM Top 50 ranking.\n\nMuch of this decline is due to falling prices for key commodities such as copper and iron ore. A strong U.S. dollar in the final months of 2024 exacerbated these losses, particularly for miners operating in currencies that weakened against the dollar.\n\nVale has been the hardest hit, losing 44.9% of its market value in 2024. The Brazilian mining giant, which was worth more than $100 billion in 2022, has seen its market capitalization shrink to $37.7 billion. Indonesian miner Amman Mineral has now surpassed Vale in the global ranking.\n\nAnglo American, despite facing its own struggles, was the only one of the traditional \u201cBig 5\u201d miners to end 2024 in positive territory, gaining $5.5 billion, or 18.1%, in value. Some of that increase may have been driven by lingering effects from BHP\u2019s previous interest in acquiring the company.\n\nThe Role of Iron Ore in Mining\u2019s Boom and Bust Cycle\n\nUnlike its competitors, Glencore does not mine iron ore, which has historically been the primary driver of profits for the largest mining companies. China\u2019s infrastructure boom has been the backbone of iron ore demand, with the country consuming around 80% of seaborne iron ore shipments.\n\nDuring the peak of the commodity boom in 2011, iron ore generated record profits for the top miners. That year, BHP recorded a pre-tax profit of $24 billion from iron ore alone, while Vale earned $23 billion, Rio Tinto made $15 billion, and Anglo American secured $11 billion.\n\nHowever, the iron ore market has cooled significantly. Prices have fallen back to double-digit levels, and a combination of increased supply and China\u2019s prolonged construction slowdown has dampened hopes of a recovery.\n\nIf Rio Tinto and Glencore move forward with a merger, they will face regulatory scrutiny from multiple jurisdictions. Given the global significance of their operations, any deal would likely be reviewed by competition authorities in Australia, the UK, the European Union, and other key markets.\n\nThe above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

It was gifted to the 7 time World Champion when he joined the Ferrari team in 1996.\n\nThe car, a Ferrari F355 GTS is finished in Blu Le Mans with Pelle Crema leather. What's more special is that it features Michael's signature on the back of the driver's seat.\n\nAuction notes say that this particular car was built exactly to Schumacher's specification and was delivered to him in April 1996, a couple of days after his podium finish at the European F1 Grand Prix that year.\n\nThe car received Ferrari Classiche certification, verifying that it retains its original chassis, gearbox, bodywork, and factory-original colour combination. However, the certification also says that the original engine is no longer fitted on the car.\n\nThe engine was apparently upgraded before being delivered to Michael.\n\nIt is not known how long Schumacher drove the car, but it was eventually sold in May 2002 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAfter 23 years, this F355 GTS is being offered without a reserve price.\n\nThe Ferrari F355 was powered by a 3.5 litre naturally aspirated V8 engine putting out 375 horsepower. It initially came with a 6 speed manual gearbox. An F1 gearbox with paddle shifters was introduced in 1997.\n\nThe F355 was available in 3 body styles: Berlinetta (coupe), Spider & GTS (targa top)\n\nMichael Schumacher won 5 championships with Ferrari: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004.\n\nSource",

I was particularly interested in M4 or M4 Competition.\n\n\n\nHe got my testostrones up as he said, there is one available. He said\u201d I\u2019ll go look and come back with it\u201d. I was gleaming with joy as I knew this would be next level fun.\n\n\n\nHe came back with sad face and said\u201d It\u2019s not available\u201d but, he can arrange for it and if I can come back again. I said \u201c fine\u201d and then he saw my distraught face and said\u201d there is a 2022 X5 M50i for sale. Would I like to test drive it? I said \u201d Hell, yeah\u201d\n\n\n\nHe went in back again and came out driving the X5 M40i.\n\n\n\nIt was an amazing looking vehicle in grey matte finished color with blacked out wheels.\n\n\n\nI told him, same route of 30 miles? He smiled and said \u201c Sure, let\u2019s go\u201d. This time around he got confidence in me that I will not crash the car and let me do my thing. Last time around in X3 M50, he was unsure as I was driving in manual using the paddle shifters as I wanted to hear the X3 M50 note especially inside tunnels.\n\n\n\nWe started off in the X5 M50i yet again in the sports mode and yet again tried using manual mode for most of the drive. I immediately knew that I\u2019m going to enjoy this drive lot better than the X3 M50.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n\n\n- Classic BMW design. X5 was always a looker\n\n- 523 Horsepower, V8 Engine (A dying breed in BMW Stable)\n\n- Fantastic Exhaust note\n\n- Spacious interiors\n\n- Much higher build and material quality\n\n- ID8 (same as mine)\n\n\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t\n\n\n\n- Gas guzzler. It was rated for 18mpg all around. Meaning this will most likely give about 12-14mpg.\n\n- Handling feels little floaty due to the bigger size\n\n- Coming immediately from an X3 M50, the interior feels little dated (even though It\u2019s the BMW classic design)\n\n\n\nBrief Overall Driving Impression\n\n\n\nBMW\u2019s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 comes in several states of tune in the X5.\n\n\n\nM50i version has 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, which is slightly more than in the lesser xDrive50i but well short of the X5 M, which for 2020 flexes up to 617 horses in Competition trim. I\n\n\n\nHere is my sister\u2019s car which I enjoy driving whenever I\u2019m in Boston which is at least once or twice a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis performance model (X5 50i) was discontinued and has the same 4.4 liter V8 and comes with a 450 horsepower. Performance is lovely but, it is a darn gas guzzler. My sister drives nearly 40-50 miles every day and she loves the car and says I can never drive any other car (She does not even drive her kids BMW X2\u2026lol) but, the only issue is the alarmingly low gas mileage.\n\n\n\nHowever, in this tune of M50i, it delivers a whopping 525 horsepower from the same V8. When you start the engine, it starts with a lovely rumble and you know immediately that this is not a normal BMW but, a darn special one.\n\n\n\nThe sensory experience of this V-8, however, is even better than my sis\u2019s car and has the same famous ZZF gearbox and the shifts are lighting quick as it is with this beautiful gearbox.\n\n\n\nMy primary intention was to check the difference between the silky smooth B58 and this brutal V8 engine. Obviously, the power output is much more but, the primary difference is this is throaty, rumbling type of sound but, that feeling of \u201csilkiness\u201d that is there in B58 is not there. It\u2019s more raw and visceral.\n\n\n\nAnother difference between the B58 and V8 is there are no crackling, pops, bangs when you downshift or when you brake which is \u201ctrademark\u201d B58 sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=jXvmSeXHVjY\n\n\n\nBig difference is also the seating position as you feel like sitting on a high chair which is necessarily not something positive and compared to the smaller X3, it feels big and when you hustle in corners it has more body roll and doesn\u2019t feel \u201ctight\u201d like the X3.\n\n\n\nSo if you are doing some enthusiastic driving, the above point makes a big difference.\n\n\n\nLike the B58, the V8 effortlessly surges to highway speeds with just a gentle press of the throttle\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PmUPcoQKHCQ\n\n\n\nThe X5 does a lot of other things well. It feels more luxurious comfortable and spacious, and it offers loads of in-car tech. There are a few engines to pick from as well, from a fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid to a high-performance V8 and finally to the biggest brothers which is the X5M and X5 M Competition. Whew! It\u2019s hard to keep track of the various models within the same model as BMW runs a massive model fleet unlike any other of its competitors from an engine, model and tune perspective.\n\n\n\nBMW made some changes to X5 (LCI) for 2023 so this model is one LCI older. But, as we all know the LCI\u2019s are mostly cosmetic changes and nothing really on the engines and design changes.\n\n\n\nThough the BMW X5 was one of the original luxury SUVs, it now competes in an increasingly crowded segment. Some of its main competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLE, Audi Q7, Genesis GV80 and also the Volvo XC90. But, for driving enthusiasts the X5 still in my opinion is a perfect blend of performance, handling, luxury and comfort.\n\n\n\nThis was a $100K+ car and was on sale for $75K with some 20K miles on the clock. This is literally the same price preowned as the all-new BMW X3 M50. This would be a nice and proper upgrade compared to the X3 M50. Well, I\u2019m not so sure if I want to give up my gorgeous B58 engine for this 4.4 Liter V8 monster. What ya\u2019ll think???\n\n\n\nCheers and Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nGorgeous looking in this Matt black paint option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a stance? Sexy ain't it? This is what BMW dreams look like...X3 M50 in similar stance looks like an ugly frog...lol!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the wheels too. It was fully optioned model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple, traditional BMW design which never fails to impress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis center console looks lot better than the X3 M50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice thick steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet again this screen looks so much better than the new colorful one.\n\n\n\nThis test drive was done back to back after I completed theAfter we came back from the test drive, I asked if they have any M cars available for a test drive.

Very prompt and professional. I booked the old E220d back in February 2024, but then decided to wait for the new V214. They were constantly in touch with me over a period of 10 months. They kept offering me test drives of cars that I wasn\u0092t even considering like the EQE. I was invited to launch events. I test drove lots of cars over the last decade and Mercedes was the only one that never asked me to take a U-turn to head back to the showroom. They were genuinely interested in selling their product which has become a rarity these days. I haven\u0092t heard a NO from them irrespective of what I asked. I took 5 test drives of the E before writing the cheque. We considered the GLC and GLE as well, but the rear seat comfort of the E won us over.\n\n\n\nHere are some pictures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI drove around 1600 kms so far. Lot of positives and a couple of cons. A quick brief of what I liked and didn\u0092t. Will probably start my ownership thread after I drive a few thousand kms.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n1. The V214 is a looker. Classy, regal and elegant like how a Mercedes should be.\n\n\n\n2. Fantastic NVH levels. Inside and out. I was initially worried about the Nexen tires because I never heard of the brand and I was expecting Michelins from the factory. However, my SA told me there\u0092s MO (Mercedes Original) badge on the tire and that means they match the quality and standards set by Mercedes. True to his words, these tyres are silent on highways when cruising around 100-120 kmph. No issue with grip on wet and dry conditions. Wind noise is well controlled and you cannot hear the engine while you\u0092re cruising or overtaking. You have to cross 3000 rpm to hear the engine. Sometimes I wonder if I'm driving a petrol or a diesel.\n\n\n\n3. The engine is silky smooth with good torque. Not the quickest, but plenty enough for Indian roads.\n\n\n\n4. Burmester Audio is top notch. In MBUX, there\u0092s this function where you can truly personalise the sound and I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n5. German diesels are very fuel efficient. I got 950 kms out of the first full tank with an average of 15.6 kms per litre (50% highway and 50% city roads).\n\n\n\n6. Of course, the rear seats are a five star experience. The front two are great as well. I\u0092m 6\u00922 and I found a comfortable driving position quickly. The back rest is a bit firm when compared to the 5 series, yet I had no discomfort during my 450km drive.\n\n\n\n7. Ground clearance has been good with four on board. I did scrape it on two occasions, however, those two were on unscientific and ridiculously tall speed breakers.\n\n\n\n8. The superscreen paired with the ambient lighting definitely has a wow factor. Friends and relatives love it when they see it for the first time. It\u0092s not a giant screen on your face. Mercedes made sure the glass on top of the screen gives this subtle classy vibe.\n\n\n\n9. Suspension is neither too soft nor too stiff. Absorbs bumps well. Felt confident to take long sweeping curves on the highways. The only downside is it feels a bit bouncy on flyover expansion joints.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n1. Even though the spare wheel is placed beneath the boot floor, the boot space is still not large enough to accommodate two large suitcases.\n\n\n\n2. Everything is touch. From volume to air conditioning to steering controls.\n\n\n\n3. Although the 9-speed gearbox has good reviews, I\u0092m not a fan of it. It upshifts well and you barely notice it. However, it\u0092s the downshifts that I\u0092m not a fan of. I have two reasons. The first one is for example, you\u0092re approaching a red signal or a toll and you let go off the accelerator and you\u0092re coasting. The gearbox starts downshifting as the RPM reaches around 1200 (I don\u0092t remember the exact number). It is here that the gearbox jerks and you can feel this jerk prominently. Second being the gearbox gets confused while you\u0092re downshifting on the highways. It feels bogged down for a second and then it gets going. The ZF on the 520d is a tad quicker and picks the right gear.\n\n\n\n3. We\u0092ve had cars with beige seats before, but the one in the E seems to hate black jeans. After just 500 kms, the drivers seats base had black marks. I got it cleaned at a friends detailing shop. He told me Mercedes leather is more sensitive compared to BMW and Audi. He recommended putting a small white cloth on the base while driving for longer periods. But that would look soo out of place in a Mercedes.\n\n\n\n4. I\u0092ve noticed one panel alignment issue where the doors ambient lighting meets the dashboards ambient lighting. It\u0092s very evident. Surprised that Mercedes engineers did not catch this before they dispatched it from their factory.\n\n\n\nMajor concern:\n\n\n\nSqueaking noise from all doors even when driving on normal roads. I raised a complaint, and they visited my house to check. They acknowledged the problem and applied some spray all four doors. The sounds have reduced. It\u0092s been two weeks and the sounds are gradually picking up. Very disappointed with Mercedes QA and QC. If the sounds reappear, they said they\u0092ll change the door beading under warranty. I\u0092ll visit their workshop when I get the time.\n\n\n\nFirst long drive:\n\n\n\nDuring Sankranthi, we drove to our beautiful village in East Godavari, Rajahmundry. Had a lovely time on the highways. Punchy diesel engine that\u0092s very efficient. Overtaking is a breeze. I was initially very skeptical about the reflector headlights, but they did their job well. Not 10/10, but a strong 7/10. It\u0092s the efficiency that surprised me. 19kms per litre over 450kms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers!! Took delivery of the new E-class on Dec 11, 2024. Was quite busy with work and travel the past month to post an update. We were initially in a dilemma whether to get the old E220d or wait for the new E. My dad and I were a bit confused. I posted a poll here on the forum. Adding to our confusion, the votes were closely split between the two. We finally decided on splurging more now rather than regretting a couple of years down the road as I intend on holding the E for at least 7 years.Special mention to Silver Star Mercedes and my SA Lakshmi Prasad.

            "content": "BHPian GS300 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI wanted to check if we have EV owners who are exclusive fast charger users.\n\nIn other words, do we have people here who have EVs but do not have any way of slow charging at home?\n\nWe are in a situation where we were living in an independent house where we had the 7.2KW wall charger. But due to some work situation, we have to move to an apartment where there is no way to have a home charger. (It is a 20+ years old apartment - so installing a home charger is next to impossible due to many factors)\n\nWe have an MG ZS EV (2024). There are commercial chargers in the vicinity. So fast charging is not a problem.\n\nIs it harmful to battery life? Are there any observations that frequent fast charging creates problems for battery management systems? Any other observed problems?\n\nAny input from people who might be in a similar situation, or anyone who may have information about this, would be very helpful.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHere's what BHPian GTO replied:\n\nGoing against the tide. Today's EV batteries are extremely advanced and can take consistent fast-charging. EV manufacturers know that home / slow charging isn't possible for everyone. Not everyone can get a home charger installed, nor is the human race generally patient to slow charge at a public charger. Even with continuous fast-charging, you will probably tire of your EV and sell it off (for an upgrade) before anything goes wrong with the battery. Tata gives EV battery warranty for 8 years, while Mahindra is giving lifetime battery warranty (first owner only) on the latest XEV & BE. How many people are going to retain an EV past 8 years? Like smartphones, 3-year-old EVs are already outdated. Newer models are far superior. That being said, I STILL think home-charging is the best: Convenient. Fill up at home. Just charge it overnight once a week - that's enough for most people.\n\nFast charging is expensive, and will only get pricier with time. In many cities in USA & Europe, fast charging is either as expensive as petrol, or priced higher! Public EV chargers are going to be major profit centers. No one (government included) has installed them for charity. The cost of a fast charger runs into crores of rupees.\n\nEven if you can fast-charge your EV in 30 - 60 minutes, that still doesn't account for the time to drive to that public charger, the waiting period (if someone is in front of you etc.).\n\nSlow charging is better for your battery.\n\nIMHO, every EV owner just has to have home charging. Or extremely reliable fast charging in the vicinity, where the daily running doesn't stipulate charging more than once a week. Else, it becomes a headache.\n\nHere's what BHPian Sensible_Speed replied:\n\nIt is okay in the same way that it is okay to eat fried chicken at every meal. You can technically do it but to the detriment of your car battery's health and performance. Fast charging constantly will decrease your battery life very quickly. You will see at least a 20% drop in overall capacity within a year if you exclusively use DC fast charging. It is definitely not advisable. Look for AC chargers near your regular destinations, e.g., the office, a mall you frequent, or a weekend getaway, etc. Charging your car up while at work, or when shopping can save you time and precious battery health.\n\nHere's what BHPian antz.bin replied:\n\nZS EV, XUV 400, Creta EV, Ioniq 5, EV6 and practically anything else coming from Europe. All of them come with NMC batteries. These should be pretty much OK with only fast charging due to slightly more battery degradation than usual. It is the LFP warriors of India and China that need slow charging to preserve their battery health and warranty. But usually speaking, as per surveys, cars usually spend 90% of their life parked. If there is a fixed parking spot with a charger, that is the best way to charge, regardless of battery capacity or chemistry. My parents' place in Nashik is now a 20+ yr old building. They got PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana solar installed for 18/20 flats (with space remaining for the last 2). EVs will start pouring in now since everyone has over capacity compared to what they use. So it is not impossible.\n\nHere's what BHPian GoBabyGo replied:\n\nHi, don't do regular fast charging. The solution can be: ZS EV can give real world city range of around 270km before the recharge (100% to 15%).\n\nCalculate your daily run and see how many times you need to charge your ZS EV in a week.\n\nIf your running is such that you need to charge your ZS EV once a week then look for the day when you will have no problem in overnight charging (from 8pm to your office going time in the next morning). ZS EV takes a long time in 16Amp AC charging. Please ensure you give a minimum of 12 hrs. to 15 hrs. to charge your EV in AC charging.\n\nFind a local car service centre within walking distance from your apartment (or the nearest one), which has a secured parking space inside where you can charge your ZS EV overnight using a 16Amp charging socket. Talk to the owner and convince him to allow you to charge your ZS EV overnight once a week at a nominal charges (e.g. Rs. 10/- or Rs.12/- per unit, I don't know the Bangalore electricity charges). You can even look for an OYO hotel with a parking facility near your apartment.\n\nAlternatively, talk to your society maintenance agency. They must have an office inside the apartment building where they can allow you to charge using a 16Amp AC charging socket. They can allot you one power point and an extension cord. While I think this is not possible as my society maintenance agency refused EV owner this in Noida Extension. Try your luck.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

This article explains why it could be worth popping BHP and DOW shares on your watchlist.\n\nBHP Group, formerly known as BHP Billiton, is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885. It produces a wide range of commodities used in energy production and manufacturing, and is expanding into fertilisers.\n\nBHP\u2019s primary business revolves around mineral exploration and production, with its assets and operations divided into three key focus areas: copper and related minerals (such as gold, uranium, silver, and zinc), iron ore, and coal (both metallurgical and energy).\n\nBHP is widely regarded as a stable, dividend-paying investment and is a common component of ASX share portfolios. If you invest in a popular ETF, LIC, or through an Industry Super fund, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nDOW shares\n\nDowner is the leading provider of integrated infrastructure services across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in the construction, maintenance, and operation of transit systems, utility services, and public infrastructure.\n\nWhile the name might not instantly recognisable, their work is highly visible. For instance, Downer operates Melbourne\u2019s Yarra Trams and manufactures the passenger trains you see in most states.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations are divided into three primary segments: Transport, Utilities, and Facilities. The Transport division accounts for just over 50% of Downer\u2019s revenue, with Utilities and Facilities contributing approximately 20% and 30% respectively.\n\nBHP & DOW share price valuation\n\nWe would consider BHP to be a \u2018mature\u2019 or \u2018blue-chip\u2019 business, so some of the metrics that could be worth considering include the debt/equity ratio, average yield, and return on equity, or ROE. These measures give us a sense of the company\u2019s debt levels, their ability to generate returns from their assets, and their ability to consistently return profits to shareholders.\n\nFor FY24, BHP Group Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 45.3%, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nOver the last 5 years, BHP has delivered an average dividend yield of 6.9% per year. This is important to note if you\u2019re looking for income from your investments.\n\nFinally, in FY24, BHP reported an ROE of 19.7%. For a mature business you generally want to see an ROE of more than 10%, so BHP clears this hurdle.\n\n&Downer EDI Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 81.1% in FY24, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nAs for dividends, since 2019 DOW has achieved an average dividend yield of 3.7% per year, and in FY24 reported an ROE of 3.6%\n\nKeep in mind that these are only a small selection of metrics.

Nothing wrong with \"eVitara\", but I don't think they should have milked the Vitara brand further for a car that has nothing to do with that nameplate. Unrelated, but even Toyota are stretching their \"Urban Cruiser\" brand too with the Urban Cruiser EV, the eVitara's Toyota cousin.\n\n\n\n- The eVitara looks like nothing else out there. Chances of you mistaking this for another car - except its upcoming Toyota twin - are slim. This car has a good road presence, although I felt it looks slightly narrow when viewed from the front when compared to other cars in this size range. As for the design, I'm not sure I love it, but I can't not like it either! It looks funky in a subdued way to my eyes. The cuts and lines in the design make me giggle as the car seems to be designed using a ruler . There is no curviness in the design elements at all:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The wheelbase is pretty long at 2700mm and it shows. I quite like the side profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The rear section, just like the front, looks edgy and simple, yet funky:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Notice the gap between the actual taillight and the glass section. Weirdly cool!\n\n\n\n\n\n- A look at the boot space. The loading lip is flat and seems to be at a decent height. The boot is not very tall though. The seats have a 40:20:40 split configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The boot floor opens up to reveal a styrofoam case in which the charging port and other tools are kept:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Surprise surprise! You get a full-size spare tyre in the boot, and that too an alloy! Even the Honda City, which once stood out for offering a full-size spare alloy, doesn't offer it anymore after the June 2022 update. The tyre size is 225/55 R18:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The armrest on the rear door pads is draped in fabric. Come on Maruti!\n\n\n\n\n\n- Over to the rear bench. Please note that my only point of reference for backseat space among EVs is the Curvv.ev. The legroom and kneeroom are adequate, but I found the under-thigh support a little lacking. Also, I was sitting in a knees-up position thanks to the high floor. For a ~5'8\" person like me, the headroom is alright:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen compared to the other ICE crossovers of comparable size, this car is not very spacious. However, it is roomier than the Curvv.ev and even the Grand Vitara (if you ignore the knees-up position relative to the GV). Make no mistake though, the Creta ICE is far superior in terms of overall space.\n\n\n\n- The unimaginable has happened! Maruti FINALLY got rid of the ancient window switches which have been in production since 2005, literally before I was even born! A historic and revolutionary step indeed:\n\n\n\n\n\n- A look at the door pad design. Again, very simple yet edgy-looking:\n\n\n\n\n\n- There is ambient lighting too:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The middle part of the seats is fabric. I hope this is not a cost-cutting exercise:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The dashboard sure looks different from other Marutis on sale, but it isn't a huge step up in terms of quality. The perceived premiumness is thanks in part to the large screens. The tan brown trim on the dashboard is leatherette - at least that's what Maruti fooled you into believing, and that's what I believed too until I laid my hands on it, only to be then struck by a harsh jolt of realisation that it is actually a plastic trim albeit of good quality\n\n\n\n\n\n- I'm not a fan of this two-spoke steering wheel design:\n\n\n\n\n\n- A look at the centre console. The amount of fingerprints it attracts and reflections it throws is crazy. I don't like how the top part of the tan-brown insert isn't a straight line. It is not parallel to the touchscreen and this blows up my OCD:\n\n\n\n\n\n- There is a little space beneath the console. Many electric cars have a cubby space in this area. A comparison of the under-console space with the Creta Electric, which I also saw at the Auto Expo:\n\n\n\n\n\n- The glass roof is fixed, and that's perfectly alright.

I got the chance to participate in the Bharat Mobility Expo this year ( link to thread ) and had a close look at the new eVitara, Maruti's first electric car to be launched in India. Trust me, it is a different feeling to see and experience a car bang on the day it makes its public debut, more so when it has only been seen in pictures before! The on-paper specs and details of the car look fairly good, so I couldn't miss the opportunity to physically check out the car even if it meant waiting in line for 15 minutes. Do note that my observations may not be 100% accurate given the limited time of 10 minutes I spent with the car. With that out of the way, here are my thoughts and impressions:- Personally, I liked the \"eVX\" name better. Nothing wrong with \"eVitara\", but I don't think they should have milked the Vitara brand further for a car that has nothing to do with that nameplate. Unrelated, but even Toyota are stretching their \"Urban Cruiser\" brand too with the Urban Cruiser EV, the eVitara's Toyota cousin.- The eVitara looks like nothing else out there. Chances of you mistaking this for another car -- are slim. This car has a good road presence, although I felt it looks slightly narrow when viewed from the front when compared to other cars in this size range. As for the design, I'm not sure I love it, but I can'tlike it either! It looks funky in a subdued way to my eyes. The cuts and lines in the design make me giggle as the car seems to be designed using a ruler. There is no curviness in the design elements at all:- The wheelbase is pretty long at 2700mm and it shows. I quite like the side profile.- The rear section, just like the front, looks edgy and simple, yet funky:- Notice the gap between the actual taillight and the glass section. Weirdly cool!- A look at the boot space. The loading lip is flat and seems to be at a decent height. The boot is not very tall though. The seats have a 40:20:40 split configuration:- The boot floor opens up to reveal a styrofoam case in which the charging port and other tools are kept:- Surprise surprise! You get a full-size spare tyre in the boot, and that too an alloy! Even the Honda City, which once stood out for offering a full-size spare alloy, doesn't offer it anymore after the June 2022 update. The tyre size is 225/55 R18:- The armrest on the rear door pads is draped in fabric. Come on Maruti!- Over to the rear bench. Please note that my only point of reference for backseat space among EVs is the Curvv.ev. The legroom and kneeroom are adequate, but I found the under-thigh support a little lacking. Also, I was sitting in a knees-up position thanks to the high floor. For a ~5'8\" person like me, the headroom is alright:When compared to the other ICE crossovers of comparable size, this car is not very spacious. However, it is roomier than the Curvv.ev and even the Grand Vitara (if you ignore the knees-up position relative to the GV). Make no mistake though, the Creta ICE is far superior in terms of overall space.- The unimaginable has happened! Maruti FINALLY got rid of the ancient window switches which have been in production since 2005, literally before I was even born! A historic and revolutionary step indeed:- A look at the door pad design. Again, very simple yet edgy-looking:- There is ambient lighting too:- The middle part of the seats is fabric. I hope this is not a cost-cutting exercise:- The dashboard sure looks different from other Marutis on sale, but it isn't a huge step up in terms of quality. The perceived premiumness is thanks in part to the large screens. The tan brown trim on the dashboard is leatherette - at least that's what Maruti fooled you into believing, and that's what I believed too until I laid my hands on it, only to be then struck by a harsh jolt of realisation that it is actually a plastic trim albeit of good quality- I'm not a fan of this two-spoke steering wheel design:- A look at the centre console. The amount of fingerprints it attracts and reflections it throws is crazy. I don't like how the top part of the tan-brown insert isn't a straight line. It is not parallel to the touchscreen and this blows up my OCD:- There is a little space beneath the console. Many electric cars have a cubby space in this area. A comparison of the under-console space with the Creta Electric, which I also saw at the Auto Expo:- The glass roof is fixed, and that's perfectly alright. But why isn't it a panoramic unit? Moreover, the sunblind is manually operated, which is not okay considering the car's expected price and positioning:- The relatively small number of roof-mounted buttons makes this area look empty. Only a mic, cabin light controls and an SOS button (which has an aircraft-style cover) are present. Unfortunately, I don't recall if the cabin lights are halogens or LEDs, but the picture makes me believe they're halogen units.

            "content": "BHPian Sa!lor recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nBackground :\n\nI have always been a wildlife lover since I was a child, it all started with Jungle Book on Doordarshan in the 90's and with age the interest also started increasing as Jungle Book was replaced with National Geographic and Discovery. At one point I was seriously considering Zoology as a career option but with limited opportunities in the field went ahead with Marine Engineering.\n\nNow as I work on ships for 6 months and I am home for 4 to 5 months, I had enough time to rekindle with my wildlife interest which led me to my first Jungle Safari at Kanha National Park in 2017 with my family.\n\nThough we went to enjoy the forest and considered tiger sighting as an added bonus, the first tigress we saw in the wild at Kanha 7 years back got us all hooked to Safari's in such a way that now every year we go for at least 10 to 15 safari's and try to cover different forests every time.\n\nIntroduction :\n\nEven though we as a family have been doing safaris for 7 years now and we have covered 10 different National parks till now, this is the first time I am writing a travelogue on my experience.\n\nAs everyone in our family and friend circle knows our love of wildlife and safaris, one of my friends and his wife asked to accompany us to our next safari destination which was Panna National Park and Bandhavgarh National Park.\n\nI have been to Bandhavgarh once back in 2017 but this was my first time visiting Panna and while planning the route from Vadodara we got to know about Khajuraho so decided to add Khajuraho as a night stop so that we can visit the Khajuraho temples as well.\n\nWith destinations decided it was time to make route planning along with stay options and safari bookings. I took charge of safari bookings as I am well versed with the government official website for safari booking and my friend took charge of Hotel bookings, for route planning we took help from teambhp travelogues and route queries.\n\nBelow are the details of the trip :\n\n\n\nPeople travelling : 4 adults ( Me, my wife,my friend and his wife ) and 2 kids ( My friends two kids one is 2 years old and another is 5 years old )\n\nRoute decided : Vadodara - Thandla - NE4 - Ramganj Mandi - Jhansi - Khajuraho - Panna National Park.\n\nReturn route decided : Bandhavgarh National Park - Jabalpur - Bhopal - Indore - Vadodara.\n\nStay options finalised :\n\nHotel Khajuraho Inn, Khajuraho\n\nMPT Jungle Camp, Madla gate, Panna\n\nMPT white tiger resort, Tala gate, Bandhavgarh\n\nPlaysales by Playotel, Bhopal\n\nSafaris booked :\n\n2 safaris at Panna National Park - one evening and one morning.\n\n3 safaris at Bandhavgarh National Park - one evening and two morning safari.\n\nPhotography Equipment :\n\nBody :\n\nCanon EOS 1100D - My humble photography companion since 10 years, it's way behind in terms of technology but still captures very good photos with the right lens combination. As this year Canon told me they won't be servicing this camera anymore as parts are not available, I have planned to upgrade to Sony mirrorless and lens setup in coming months.\n\nLens :\n\nCanon 55-250mm telephoto - I have been using this lens for about 5 years and am very happy with the results, The only shortcoming is sometimes the 250mm range feels insufficient to capture animals at a distance.\n\nTamron 150-600mm telephoto - As I wanted a longer reach and already with plans to upgrade my equipment I wanted to get a feel of 150-600mm lens before buying it so went ahead with renting this lens at both Panna and Bandhavgarh National Park, luckily got contacts through Instagram so did not have to rent and carry it all the way from Vadodara which was getting costly due to increase in number of rental days.\n\nTravelogue :\n\nWith all the plans and bookings in place we all were waiting eagerly for the start of our trip, as we were travelling with 2 kids and considering winters in Madhya Pradesh can get really cold also doing safari in open gypsies during winter can expose us as well as kids to chilly winds, packing as many warm clothes as possible was the priority.\n\nInitially we were thinking of taking my Thar for the trip but with luggage of 2 kids and volume of warm clothes it was not possible to pack the bags in limited space available in Thar so we finalised my friends Dzire, he made sure the car was serviced, washed and ready for the road-trip.\n\nDay 1 ( 11th Jan 2025 ) : Vadodara to Khajuraho, Distance : 973 km\n\nWe had packed our bags and loaded them in Dzire on the previous night to avoid any delays to the start of our journey so on 11th Jan my friend came to my place at 4.30am and we were on our way by 4.45am, we decided for an early start so that maximum distance can be covered while the kids are still sleeping as this was their first long road-trip and we were not sure how will they react.\n\nThe roads from Vadodara till Thandla were very good, from Thandla we entered NE4 till Ramganj Mandi, the NE4 surface is very smooth in this section and you can easily cruise at 120kmph, the biggest concern on this route is cattle and stray animals. Villagers on the route have broken down barriers for their convenience from which all kinds of animals come on the road and pose a serious risk along with bikes coming on the wrong side so we had to be very watchful for the entire stretch.\n\nOnce we exited NE4 from Ramganj Mandi towards Shivpuri the roads deteriorated and cattle increased which tested our concentration as we had several close calls with cows and dogs, I have never seen so many dead animals on a route in my 12 years of doing road-trips.\n\nWe encountered a lot of traffic while crossing Jhansi but after Jhansi the roads to Khajuraho were excellent and we reached Khajuraho at 8.30pm, kids comfortable throughout the journey which helped us reach Khajuraho or else we had a backup plan to stay at Jhansi itself.\n\nAs we all were awake since early morning and tired because of concentrating so hard on roads avoiding animals and wrong side drivers, we had a quick dinner and called the day off early.\n\nHotel : Khajuraho Inn - Budget hotel for a night stay rooms were clean but property and rooms need refurbishment, better stay options are available nearby.\n\nDay 2 ( 12th Jan 2025 ) : Khajuraho to Panna National Park, Distance : 24km\n\n\n\nWe had an evening safari booked at Madla gate which starts as 3pm so we decided to have a late start to the morning, woke up by 9am got ready and visited Khajuraho temples at 10.30am, we planned to give about 2 hours to visit the temples but realised on reaching that we require atleast 2 days if we want to cover the history of all the temples in detail and so we just visited the main temples in Western group of temples with a promise made to ourselves that we will come again and spend atleast 2 days at Khajuraho.\n\nWith the temple visit done we left for Panna at 12.30pm and reached our resort at 2pm, the travel time is just 35 mins but the delay was due to me having to pick up a rental lens from a nearby resort for my photography needs.\n\nPhotos of Khajuraho :\n\nWe all had a quick lunch and freshened up getting ready for the safari, kids were excited to see the animals they have only seen on television and my friend and his wife were hopeful to catch a glimpse of the magnificent Tiger.\n\nOur resort made all the arrangements of validating our online permits to get us picked up from the resort on the gypsy, evening safari in Madhya Pradesh is from 3pm to 5.45pm and I personally felt the time very less to get a good sighting as speed limit of 20kmph is imposed inside the forest due to which gypsies are unable to travel much distance in such less time and concentrate only on the areas closer to the entry and exit gates.\n\nWe got some pugmarks and waited entire safari time in tigress P141's territory as she gives good sighting with cubs but we did not get any sighting though got to hear some alarm calls of deer, kids and my friend as well as his wife were just happy to enjoy the calm and tranquil forest and they did not regret the experience one bit even though we had no sighting they were very clear that they are here to enjoy the experience of forest, other than that everything is a bonus for them.\n\nPhotos of Panna's landscape :\n\nCame back to our resort and had a cake cutting ceremony as it was my friends 5 year old kids birthday after which we had dinner and went to sleep early as we had an early morning safari.\n\nDay 3 ( 13th Jan 2025 ) : Panna National park to Bandhavgarh National Park, Distance : 237km\n\nWe all woke up and got ready by 6.30am which was our pick-up time for the safari.\n\nThe resort had packed our breakfast and given us blankets for the safari as it was very cold and misty in the morning.\n\nWe started our safari exactly at 6.45am from Madla Gate, The morning safari is from 6.45am till 11.30am which I feel is perfect for enjoying the forest as well as exploring more areas to see animals.\n\nToday we met one of the most amazing Guide's I have ever met in my so many years of doing safari's and I would like to give him a special mention here, his name is Kishan ji and he has an experience of almost 32 years at Panna, he is one of the most experienced guides at Panna and has been working with forest department as well since 1992. You can clearly see his passion for wildlife with the way he talks about the animals, forest, trees etc.\n\nAs we entered the forest he greeted us and started explaining us about the forest and it's flora and fauna, we told him our evening safari was not as good as we expected due to less time and a new guide who had very limited knowledge, he instantly apologised to us for below par experience in previous safari even though it had nothing to do with him as he wasn't even our guide in the evening safari but that showed how much he valued our experience and promised us for the best he could do to give us some good sightings as well give us a good safari experience.\n\nAs we were all enjoying the beautiful landscape that Panna offers with forests and hills on one side and Ken river flowing on the other side, our guide told our driver to take the gypsy to the place where he thought we could see the tigress P141 and her cubs. He was spot on with his location and as we entered the area we saw about 5-6 gypsies lined up and there she came, P141 tigress walking on the road in all her glory and in my excitement to see the tigress I completely forgot about taking the photos, by the time I realised and picked up my camera she was already going inside the forest from the road but I still managed to click some photos. The forest had come alive with alarm calls from deer and langurs, I could see the happiness on the face of my friends family with what they had just witnessed not knowing we had a lot more in store for us waiting.\n\nWith tigress now not visible, our guide told the driver to turn the gypsy and take us on the top of the Hill towards Hinauta Plateau which is another part of the forest as he expected to find 3 male tigers, the sub-adult cubs of tigress P652 who are all adult now and about to get seperated from their mother, other gypsies decided to wait for the return of P141 as she had left her cubs in the grassland and was sure to return.\n\nPhoto of P141 tigress:\n\nThe guide left the final decision on us if we wanted to wait for P141 or try for the Male Tigers, We mutually decided to go and try for the Male cubs as the grasslands were getting overcrowded with gypsies waiting for P141's return to her cubs.\n\nThe decision to try for Male cubs turned out to be the best decision we made as we got the best sighting which we never even imagined and for me it was the best sighting in my 7 years of doing safari's.\n\nAs soon as we reached Hinauta Plateau, we saw few gypsies waiting near the bushes and just when we reached those gypsies we saw a big male tiger coming out from the bushes and he just sat down in crouching position as if he was planning to chase the gypsies, this is when our guide informed that this particular male tiger has killed a women by mistake when she was cutting the grass few weeks back and since than forest department has cautioned all the drivers and guides to maintain distance from him and his 2 brothers, we saw 3 forest department elephants with rangers as well nearby keeping a watch on the activities of this 3 male tigers.\n\nWith everyone maintaining enough distance from the male tiger he got relaxed and decided to walk around the gypsies and then just sitting near the bushes all this lasted for about 30-35 minutes and with more gypsies coming in everyone got sighting to their heart's content.\n\nAs a second male tiger out of the three brothers also came from the bushes our guide decided it was not safe to stay in that area as we had 2 kids with us, also we could see forest rangers with their elephants on the move as they wanted the tigers to move away from the tourists we decided to move away from that location and go back to try sighting P141 who might have returned by now to her cubs, took a breakfast stop at the dedicated point near forest rest house, it was already 10am by now and as we had to leave for Bandhavgarh we decided to move towards the exit happy and content with the sightings we had we ended the safari at 11am, packed our bags and checked-out from our resort at Panna.\n\nPhotos of P652 female's sub-adult cubs:\n\nI went to return the lens to the resort from where I had rented the lens and then we proceeded towards Bandhavgarh, we reached Bandhavgarh at 6pm, checked-in our resort and enjoyed the rest of the evening by bonfire.\n\nHotel : MPT Jungle Camp, Madla Gate, Panna - Excellent property right next to the Madla Gate with good food and hospitality, very convenient for safari.\n\nDay 4 ( 14th Jan 2025 ) : Bandhavgarh National Park.\n\n\n\nWe had a morning safari from the Tala gate which was just next to our resort, the resort had already done the formalities for us of verifying the online permit and got our gypsy ready for pickup at 6.30am, resort had already packed our breakfast and given us the blankets, we met our guide at the forest office and started our safari at 6.45am.\n\nAs soon as we entered the safari gate we knew it wasn't an ideal day for the safari due to heavy fog, visibility was zero, we could hardly see anything around our gypsy and guide clearly told us the fog is not going to let us see anything even if it is next to us so with our hopes down we were struggling to keep ourselves warm as temperature had dropped to single digit and open gypsy with wind was making it worse, though resort had given us blankets and we had prepared ourselves with jackets and winter wear still we could feel the chill.\n\nTala zone is the most beautiful zone of Bandhavgarh and we thought we would enjoy the beauty of the zone itself if not for any sightings but fog was so heavy we were not even able to see the forest, fog dispersed only after 10am by which time we had reached Sheshshaiya.\n\nSheshshaiya is a 35 foot Vishnu statue in a reclining pose which dates back to 10th Century, other than breakfast point this is the only place in forest where tourists are allowed to get down from the gypsy, idol is covered with moss and the greenery around the idol makes for a picturesque sight, we took some pictures and read the history about the place after which we started our return journey back to the exit gate.\n\nBy now the fog had also dispersed and we were just enjoying the forest and its landscape.\n\nWe ended our safari and reached the resort by 11.30am, took some rest and had our lunch after which we prepared for the evening safari.\n\nPhotos of Tala landscape and Sheshshaiya:\n\nEvening safari ( 3pm to 6.45pm ).\n\n\n\nWe had booked an evening safari at Khitauli gate which is considered to be the zone with the highest chances of sighting a tiger and we also wanted to cover different zones to see different landscapes, gypsy came at 2.30pm for pickup and we entered the forest at 3pm.\n\nOur driver was very experienced and he took great effort for us to get a sighting but we had to contend ourselves with Spotted deer and Sambar deer.\n\nAfter trying a lot and discussing with other gypsies got to know nobody got a sighting in afternoon safari in any of the zones of Bandhavgarh, we ended the safari and reached our resort by 6.15pm, had our high-tea and enjoyed rest of the evening by bonfire.\n\nPhotos at Khitauli zone:\n\nHotel : MPT White Tiger resort, Tala gate, Bandhavgarh - Beautiful property right next to Tala gate, hospitality was such by the staff it could easily compete with any privately owned resorts. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.\n\nDay 5 ( 15th Jan 2025 ) : Bandhavgarh to Bhopal, Distance : 486km\n\nAs it was the last day of our trip and we had a long way back home my friends family had decided during our planning stage only that they will be taking rest today and won't be doing morning safari as they did not want it to be hectic for the kids as well as themselves and my wife also said she needed some rest so it was only me doing the morning safari in a shared gypsy, I had 3 other people with me in the shared gypsy.\n\nAs it was a shared gypsy I had to reach the forest department office on my own and previous evening I had already got my online permit verified after which I was given the gypsy number so in morning after reaching the office I found my gypsy, paid the guide and gypsy charge at the counter and got ready for the last safari of this trip from Magadhi Gate.\n\nMagadhi Gate is the least famous for sightings but I wanted to explore this zone as well, we entered the forest at 6.50am, we got lot of pugmarks so tried our best to follow and track the pugmarks along with alarm calls from Spotted Deer but again like previous two safaris at Bandhavgarh the luck did not favour us and we did not get any sightings.\n\nI was hoping to see Gaur ( Indian Bison ) or Wild elephants that have recently come to Bandhavgarh from Chattisgarh but could not get to see anything else other than Spotted Deer.\n\nA forest department ranger with an elephant was passing nearby us so decided to click some pictures of the elephant.\n\nPhotos at Magadhi zone:\n\nStopped for breakfast at the center point and then proceeded towards the exit gate, while on the way towards the exit we heard a lot of alarm calls from Spotted Deer and while looking inside the forest I could spot a leopard or a tiger moving across the forest but it was so far it wasn't clearly visible and taking photos was not possible, we waited for sometime if it comes out on the road but it did not and once the deer alarm calls stopped we decided to end the safari and exit the gate, I reached our resort by 12pm.\n\nIn the meantime my wife and friend had already completed the check-out formalities, we loaded our luggage and started our return journey.\n\nDuring our initial planning we had decided to take a stop at Bhopal as we were leaving Bandhavgarh at noon time and to reach Vadodara directly would mean driving all night which was not preferable with kids hence we had booked a hotel on the highway itself at Bhopal, we reached Bhopal by 7.30pm, had dinner and called the day off early as next day again had to continue our journey back home.\n\nHotel : Playsales by Playotel, Bhopal - Decent budget option for short stay, basically a business hotel, clean and comfortable with huge spacious rooms conveniently located near the highway.\n\nDay 6 ( 16th Jan 2025 ) : Bhopal to Vadodara, Distance - 545 km\n\n\n\nAs we wanted to cover maximum distance while kids were asleep, we decided for an early morning start and checked-out of our hotel by 6.30am.\n\nWe took a breakfast stop on Bhopal - Indore highway as everyone wanted to try the famous Poha of Indore and Bhopal along with Jalebi or Imarti, it was a non-stop drive after breakfast till we reached Godhra where we took a quick lunch stop and reached home by 5pm.\n\nEntire stretch from Bandhavgarh via Bhopal till Vadodara was good with well laid roads, there were some patches of broken roads but again the biggest concern was cattle which we found everywhere on the highways in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nOverall it was an amazing experience for everyone and a great exposure of forest and animals for the kids at such young age.\n\nI feel if kids get exposure of wildlife, forests and nature at a young age it can help build their interest towards conservation and protection of our natural resources which is the need of the hour.\n\nWe enjoyed the forests of Panna so much, we have already planned for the next trip to Khajuraho, Panna National park and Sanjay Dubri National park again this year itself.\n\nI have tried to put my experience into words, though words are not enough to describe the feel one gets inside the forest and amongst the wildlife.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this travelogue as much as I have enjoyed writing it with all the details I could remember, if anyone has any queries I am happy to guide in whatever way I can.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against other best ASX stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAccording to a report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published on December 4, 2024, the Australian economy grew by 0.3% in the September quarter of 2024, which marked the twelfth consecutive quarter of growth. This growth, however, was the lowest rate since the December quarter of 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also noted that in nominal terms, GDP rose by 0.4%.\n\nIn terms of trade, a key indicator of the economy\u2019s international competitiveness fell by 2.5% in the quarter. This decline was primarily due to a 2.6% drop in export prices and was the third consecutive quarterly fall. The weakening in global bulk commodity demand, particularly from China, significantly affected the prices of metallurgical coal and iron ore. Import prices also fell slightly by 0.1%, aligning with lower global oil prices.\n\nHowever, public investment surged by 6.3% after three-quarters of decline, with government investment rising, driven by increased imports of defense equipment and investments in hospital and road projects. State and local public corporations also contributed to the rise, with increased activity on major road and renewable energy projects.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley\u2019s 2025 Outlook and Implications for Australian Investors, the outlook for Australian equities is optimistic, though it is expected to lag behind major developed markets, particularly the United States. Morgan Stanley has raised its year-end 2025 price target for the ASX 200 to 8500, reflecting a base case multiple of 17.0x and a forecasted 10% earnings per share growth over the next 12 months. Within the Australian market, Morgan Stanley favors sectors that are poised for strong performance, such as healthcare, technology, and consumer discretionary. These sectors are expected to benefit from secular growth trends and favorable macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn the energy sector, Morgan Stanley anticipates lower crude oil prices in 2025 due to rising supply from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, outpacing slowing demand growth. This could impact energy-related stocks and investments. Regarding metals, copper remains the top pick, driven by declining inventories and demand recovery at lower price levels. For gold, the outlook is more cautious, with limited upside expected despite potential tailwinds from rate cuts. According to the report, physical demand for gold is beginning to soften, which may dampen its appeal as a safe-haven asset.",

BHP is one of the largest companies in Australia, and BHP operates in countries around the world.\n\nThe company is engaged in various mineral exploration, mining and processing activities, including zinc, copper, silver, uranium, molybdenum, gold, iron ore and coal. BHP also has a presence in refining and smelting nickel and potash. They are also engaged in development activities that revolve around the mining industry. The company provides towing, freight, marketing support, finance, marketing and trading, administrative and other services. With a global workforce of over 80,000 people, BHP is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nBHP is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth and demand for commodities. BHP operates in critical growth markets, providing innovation and sustainability. This operating principle has helped BHP become one of the largest mining companies in the world.\n\nBHP has roots in Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP), incorporated in 1885. The first consignment of Broken Hill ore was smelted in Spotswood, Victoria, in June of 1885. In 1915, BHP diversified into steel manufacturing, building a manufacturing facility in Newcastle, New South Wales. In 2001, BHP merged with Billiton, a mining company founded in the 1860s in the Netherlands, becoming BHP Billiton.\n\nIn August 2016, BHP Billiton recorded the worst annual loss in its history, at $6.4 billion. In 2017, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP and announced plans to sell its U.S. shale oil and gas business. In July 2018, BHP Billiton completed the sale of its Fayetteville Onshore U.S. gas assets to a wholly owned subsidiary of Merit Energy Company. In August 2021, BHP announced plans to exit the oil and gas industry by merging its hydrocarbon business with Woodside Petroleum.\n\nBHP has been part of several controversies, such as the Ok Tedi environmental disaster, Bento Rodrigues tailings dam collapse and allegations of drawing waters above the granted limit from aquifers. In response to a sexual harassment and assault investigation in 2021, the company terminated or removed 48 workers from multiple sites.\n\nBHP is constantly striving to ensure responsible and ethical mining activities while also working toward reducing its environmental impact. As a significant player in the natural resources industry, BHP is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for commodities worldwide while continuing to be a leader and innovator in the mining sector.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Coal Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against the other coal stocks.\n\nResearch by The Business Research Company estimates the coal market to grow by 2.6% in 2025, reaching a market value of $669.84 billion. The continued dependency on coal for developing countries should sustain a growth rate of 2% until 2029. The APAC region is the region with the largest share of the market with China being the largest player. Slow economic growth in the region is the reason for the lackluster performance of the commodity in 2024.\n\nRising energy demand is the primary driver for the growth in the coal industry but a transition to renewable forms of energy forms a major headwind. The steel industry along with other manufacturing sectors provides a sustained demand for coal. These industries have not fared well in 2024, leading to unfavorable pricing for coal companies.\n\nThe production in the US is expected to remain flat in 2025 after registering a 12% drop in 2024. The demand from utility firms is expected to be met by the accumulation of inventory. India continues to be the destination where a majority of the exports of metallurgical and thermal coal take place. While the trend is expected to continue, a strengthening dollar is expected to lower the volumes in the near future.\n\nThe recent performance of coal companies has not been particularly good due to the overall macroeconomic environment. Companies are looking to diversify their assets and are exploring opportunities in other commodities like mining. Nonetheless, most of these companies have a healthy balance sheet that has enabled them to tide over this period. With a better year around the corner, there should be a revival in business for these companies.\n\nCoal ETFs have generated returns of -4.34%, -17.86% and -20.86% for 1-month, 6-month and 1-year tenors. While big tech players pose a threat, there is immense potential to tap a constantly growing advertising pie that would benefit traditional players.\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article we picked 10 coal stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) operates as a resources company with coal being one of the key segments. The primary operations of BHP are located in Australia, Europe, China, Japan, India, South Korea, the rest of Asia and North America.\n\nWhile the overall business has been growing, energy coal production was down 4% y-o-y and steelmaking coal was lower by 23% in the latest quarter. This does not deter the annual guidance as the company expects coal production to be in the upper half of its guidance for 2025. The impact of unfavorable coal prices has been offset by higher shipments. A diversified business makes BHP a defensive investment in the commodity space. A more favorable coal pricing should enable BHP to generate better margins. It has already received a higher EBITDA revision for the year. A forward dividend yield close to 6% also offers a lucrative investment opportunity in this stock.\n\nOverall BHP ranks 8th on our list of the best coal stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BHP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BHP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Once fully operational in 2031, the mine will become the largest potash production site in the world, with an annual output of 8.5 million tonnes.\n\nIn an interview with Valor, Karina Gistelinck, President of BHP\u2019s Potash Operations, underscored Brazil\u2019s strategic importance for fertilizer producers, noting that the country imports over 90% of its agricultural fertilizer needs.\n\n\u201cBrazil accounts for about 20% of global demand and has significant growth potential. For us, gaining access to this market and forging the right partnerships is essential,\u201d she said\n\nRather than supplying potash directly to end users, BHP will adopt a partnership-based distribution model, aligning with its core identity as a mining company. Ms. Gistelinck highlighted that discussions with potential Brazilian partners have been ongoing for years. While some agreements have already been finalized and others are still in negotiation, BHP has not disclosed the companies involved for strategic reasons.\n\nOn the prospect of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil, Ms. Gistelinck did not rule out the possibility but remained measured in her response. \u201cBHP is always evaluating growth opportunities and likes to compare organic and inorganic options,\u201d she said.\n\nBHP\u2019s footprint in Brazil includes its joint venture with Vale through Samarco and its previous acquisition of copper and gold assets from OZ Minerals, which was later sold to G Mining at the end of last year.\n\nThe Jansen Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, marks BHP\u2019s first foray into the fertilizer sector. According to Gistelinck, the project underwent 15 years of study before receiving approval.\n\nThe first phase, Jansen I, was greenlit in 2021 after BHP identified opportunities in a sector traditionally dominated by global suppliers such as Russia.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver of potash demand is population growth. When combined with climate change, which complicates food production, the outlook becomes even more promising,\u201d she explained.\n\nIncreasingly severe droughts and erratic rainfall are degrading soil quality, heightening the need for corrective fertilization.\n\nThe Jansen project is a key pillar in BHP\u2019s strategy to diversify its operations and expand supply options for global importers. \u201cDiversification and the opportunity to contribute to food security were crucial factors in securing board approval for the Jansen project,\u201d Ms. Gistelinck said.\n\nLocated in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, the mine is being developed in two phases. The second phase, Jansen II, was approved in 2023. The total investment in the project is estimated at $12 billion, $6 billion currently allocated to Jansen I and $4.9 billion to Jansen II. The remaining funds are designated for studies and initial expenditures.\n\n\u201cWe expect to have the final product available in the second half of 2026, with the first shipment scheduled for late 2026 or early 2027,\u201d Ms. Gistelinck said. Jansen I is set to reach its full production capacity of 4.2 million tonnes per year by 2029.\n\nSimultaneously, Jansen II will begin production in 2029, bringing the mine\u2019s total capacity to 8.5 million tonnes annually by 2031.\n\nTranslation: Todd Harkin",

In the 14 days of our travel, my wife and I drove from Bangalore to different iconic destinations like Rann of Kutch, Jaisalmer et all covering the diversity of our country and the many challenges of driving Electric car. From charging infrastructure to scenic routes, each leg of the journey reinforced our commitment on reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n\n\nSustainability isn\u0092t just something we talk about\u0097it\u0092s how we live. Between our two electric cars (Tata Curvv and Mercedes EQB), an electric bike, a 14-kilowatt solar setup at home, and a house full of over 300 plants, going green isn\u0092t just a choice; it\u0092s a lifestyle. This trip was our way of proving that electric travel isn\u0092t just possible\u0097it\u0092s practical, fun, and the future. We hope our journey inspires more people to embrace sustainable travel.\n\n\n\nWhile there were some early challenges driving an electric car on an epic cross-country journey \u0097 notably, finding enough charging stations \u0097 the obstacles added to the excitement and spontaneity of the trip. We found that the charging stations we encountered, many with restaurants and rest areas, were encouraging us to take breaks, reducing driving fatigue and making the trip more enjoyable.\n\n\n\nThe Joy of the Unexpected\n\nThe highlight of the trip is it is entirely unplanned. We only had Ran of Kutch and Jaisalmer in our minds and route and stays along the way are out of spontaneity. We have chosen Tata Curvv for this trip because of easiness in terms of servicing in any emergency case. We tried to charge mostly in Tata Power wherever it is available but mostly others as well since they are faster compared to Tata Power Chargers. Charging in 120kwh fast charger is so refreshing that it charges 20% to 80% in less than 20min.\n\n\n\nTrip in Numbers \u0096\n\n\n\nTotal Trip Days: 16\n\n\n\nCore Travel Days: 11\n\n\n\nDistance Covered: 6,387 km (Bangalore to Bangalore), 5,522 km (Nellore to Nellore)\n\n\n\nAverage Km per Day: 400 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 502 (Nellore to Nellore)\n\n\n\nStates Covered: 7\n\n\n\nTotal kWh Consumed: 954 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 816 (Nellore to Nellore)\n\n\n\nKm per kWh: 6.7 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 6.77 (Nellore to Nellore)\n\n\n\nCharging Stops: 31 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 27 (Nellore to Nellore)\n\n\n\nDay 1: Bangalore to Tirupati (250 km)\n\nOur journey began in Bangalore, leaving in the late afternoon at 4:30 PM. We reached Tirupati by 8:30 PM. After charging our electric vehicle at the Taj Hotel (Tata Power Station, 37 kW), we stayed overnight at my sister\u0092s place, marking the first leg of our exciting road trip.\n\n\n\nDay 2: Tirupati to Nellore (135 km)\n\nWe spent the day in Nellore, where we dropped our kids and Fizzy (Doggy) off at their grandparents' house. We didn\u0092t rush and enjoyed some quality family time before continuing our journey.\n\n\n\nDay 3: Nellore to Hyderabad (485 km)\n\nAfter leaving Nellore, we stopped in Ongole to see some friends while charging as well. We stopped at Rompicherla for a quick charge, then continued to Hyderabad, where we arrived by 6:00 PM. We stayed at friends place and topped up the vehicle at TML Select in Alkapuri (Tata Power).\n\n\n\nDay 4: Hyderabad to Ellora Caves and then to Dhule (764 km)\n\nWe set out early and debated whether to take the route through Maharashtra to Rann of Kutch or the one heading to Jaisalmer. We opted for the former and took a detour to Ellora Caves, stopping to charge at Basavakalyan and Beed along the way. Reaching Ellora, driving 600 km, by late afternoon, we explored the caves and the Grishneswar Temple before heading to Dhule for the night. Charged in Ellora Resort in Ellora while having our dinner.\n\n\n\nDay 5: Dhule to Statue of Unity and to Mehsana (568 km)\n\nAfter a relaxing overnight stay in a nice hotel and nice breakfast and quick charge in Dhule, we made our way to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat. Reaching by 3:00 PM, we spent the afternoon touring the statue and other attractions nearby, while charging our vehicle in Ramada Encore. We then continued to Mehsana for an overnight stay after charging at Kalol while dining.\n\n\n\nDay 6: Mehsana to Rann of Kutch (355 km)\n\nThe drive to Rann of Kutch was one of the most memorable of our trip. We charged our vehicle in Radhampur and continued our journey of 245 kms to Rann Utsav area. As we drove through the vast, endless white desert, we felt like we were in another world. We reached Rann of Kutch by 4:30 PM, charging the car at Mobiline before heading out to explore the white desert and catching the night views. If the only charging station in Rann Utsav is not working then the backup plan was to drive 82 km to Bhuj for charging which would be a detour. We stayed at Tent City for the night, enjoying cultural programs and traditional food. The following morning, we caught the stunning sunrise over the desert.\n\n\n\nDay 7: Rann of Kutch to Barmer (475 km)\n\nWe started from Rann of Kutch and crossed through the picturesque Radhampur route. Along the way, we visited the Dholavira Harappan civilization site and stopped to charge at Hotel Shivaay in Tharad. After another quick charge in Sanchur along with Dinner, we reached Bamar by evening, ready to rest.\n\n\n\nDay 8: Bamer to Jaisalmer (166 km)\n\nWe left Bamar early and reached Jaisalmer by 11:30 AM. We charged the car at Taj Gowrabandha Palace Hotel before heading to Jaisalmer Fort and other nearby attractions. The city, with its sand-coloured architecture, was a sight to behold. After some shopping, we headed to the desert camp area in Sam, where we stayed overnight in neat and clean tents, enjoying cultural programs and delicious food.\n\n\n\nDay 9: Jaisalmer Desert Safari and Longewala and to Pachpadra (558 km)\n\nThe morning began with a thrilling desert safari and a camel ride in the Sam Desert. Afterward, we decided to visit Longewala, a site with significant historical importance due to the 1961 India-Pakistan war. My wife\u0092s father had sentimental ties to the place as he was posted in Jaisalmer. We visited the Longewala Museum and picked up some souvenirs. We then returned to Jaisalmer and charged the car before starting our journey back. We have reached Pachpadra for overnight stay. We took a non-highway route for some reason and ended up in an nervousness filled drive as we have seen none for over 100 kms in that pitch dark but safely cruised along to Pachpadra and stayed overnight.\n\n\n\nDay 10: Pachpadra to Ujjain (658 km)\n\nWe departed Pachpadra and made our way toward Ujjain. We reached Udaipur for a brief stop where we charged and dined. Due to time constraints, we didn\u0092t visit the Udaipur Fort but enjoyed lunch and a drive around the city. By evening, we headed to Ujjain for a brief rest and planned to visit the Mahakaleshwar Temple the next morning. We charged in Malgalwaad while snacking and in Dhodar while dining.\n\n\n\nDay 11: Ujjain to Khamgaon (390 km)\n\nEarly in the morning, we visited the Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain before heading to Indore for a charge and breakfast. Afterward, we drove to Omkareshwar Temple, but due to a heavy rush we were stopped 4 kms before, we had to take an auto rickshaw and after reaching we were told the darshan would take hours. Since I visited the temple earlier, we decided to head to Hyderabad for the New Year\u0092s Eve celebration instead. The road from Omkareshwar to Maharasthra border was was very rough. We reached Khamgaon by 7:30 PM for charging and dining. We contemplated for a moment to stay overnight or continue to Hyderabad and decided the later.\n\n\n\nDay 12: Khamgaon to Hyderabad (570 km)\n\nWe didn\u0092t stop overnight and instead continued our journey to Hyderabad, charging the vehicle at Nanded around 2:00 AM. By 8:00 AM, we reached Hyderabad, where we spent the day resting and celebrating New Year\u0092s Eve with friends.\n\n\n\nDay 13: Hyderabad to Nellore (480 km)\n\nAfter having a nice breakfast while charging and also visiting couple of friends in Hyderabad, we started our journey to Nellore at 1.30pm. We reached Nellore by 8.30pm while got briefly charged in Ongole along the way. Reunited with family there.\n\n\n\nDay 14 and 15 : Quality time with family and friends\n\nNothing exciting except taking our Fizzy (Dog) to beach for the first time along with the kids.\n\n\n\nDay 16: Nellore to Tirupati and to Bangalore (390 Km)\n\nStarted the final leg of our Journey from Nellore to Bangalore, stopping at Tirupati for Charging and Lunch with sister\u0092s family.\n\n\n\nLooking Back\n\nThis 6,400-kilometer road trip across India in an electric vehicle was more than just a journey\u0097it was an adventure that combined exploration, sustainability, and a shared passion for driving. Every stop along the way, from the serene white deserts of Rann of Kutch to the historic sands of Jaisalmer and the spiritual Jyotirlingas, added a unique layer to our experience.\n\nThe highlight of this road trip was the stunning drives through the vast white deserts and golden sand dunes. These scenic routes reminded us of the beauty of India\u0092s diverse landscapes and why the journey matters just as much as the destination.\n\n\n\nThis road trip reaffirmed our confidence in the potential of electric vehicles to support long-distance travel while reducing our carbon footprint. And hence we have immediately done an another 1,600 km trip to Bhimavaram for Sankranthi/Pongal celebrations.\n\n\n\nWith this trip, we\u0092ve proven to ourselves\u0097and hopefully to others\u0097that long journeys in electric vehicles are practical, enjoyable, and aligned with the vision of a greener future. And as we set our sights on our next adventure, potentially the Maha Kumbh Mela, we hope to inspire more people to embrace sustainable energy solutions and explore the world with an eco-friendly mindset.\n\n\n\nAfter all, it\u0092s not just about the destinations we reach; it\u0092s about the memories we create and the impact we leave behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn electric road trip across India, a commitment to sustainable energy, a commitment to a greener future. In the 14 days of our travel, my wife and I drove from Bangalore to different iconic destinations like Rann of Kutch, Jaisalmer et all covering the diversity of our country and the many challenges of driving Electric car. From charging infrastructure to scenic routes, each leg of the journey reinforced our commitment on reducing our carbon footprint.Sustainability isn\u0092t just something we talk about\u0097it\u0092s how we live. Between our two electric cars (Tata Curvv and Mercedes EQB), an electric bike, a 14-kilowatt solar setup at home, and a house full of over 300 plants, going green isn\u0092t just a choice; it\u0092s a lifestyle. This trip was our way of proving that electric travel isn\u0092t just possible\u0097it\u0092s practical, fun, and the future. We hope our journey inspires more people to embrace sustainable travel.While there were some early challenges driving an electric car on an epic cross-country journey \u0097 notably, finding enough charging stations \u0097 the obstacles added to the excitement and spontaneity of the trip. We found that the charging stations we encountered, many with restaurants and rest areas, were encouraging us to take breaks, reducing driving fatigue and making the trip more enjoyable.The highlight of the trip is it is entirely unplanned. We only had Ran of Kutch and Jaisalmer in our minds and route and stays along the way are out of spontaneity. We have chosen Tata Curvv for this trip because of easiness in terms of servicing in any emergency case. We tried to charge mostly in Tata Power wherever it is available but mostly others as well since they are faster compared to Tata Power Chargers. Charging in 120kwh fast charger is so refreshing that it charges 20% to 80% in less than 20min.Total Trip Days: 16Core Travel Days: 11Distance Covered: 6,387 km (Bangalore to Bangalore), 5,522 km (Nellore to Nellore)Average Km per Day: 400 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 502 (Nellore to Nellore)States Covered: 7Total kWh Consumed: 954 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 816 (Nellore to Nellore)Km per kWh: 6.7 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 6.77 (Nellore to Nellore)Charging Stops: 31 (Bangalore to Bangalore), 27 (Nellore to Nellore)Our journey began in Bangalore, leaving in the late afternoon at 4:30 PM. We reached Tirupati by 8:30 PM. After charging our electric vehicle at the Taj Hotel (Tata Power Station, 37 kW), we stayed overnight at my sister\u0092s place, marking the first leg of our exciting road trip.We spent the day in Nellore, where we dropped our kids and Fizzy (Doggy) off at their grandparents' house. We didn\u0092t rush and enjoyed some quality family time before continuing our journey.After leaving Nellore, we stopped in Ongole to see some friends while charging as well. We stopped at Rompicherla for a quick charge, then continued to Hyderabad, where we arrived by 6:00 PM. We stayed at friends place and topped up the vehicle at TML Select in Alkapuri (Tata Power).We set out early and debated whether to take the route through Maharashtra to Rann of Kutch or the one heading to Jaisalmer. We opted for the former and took a detour to Ellora Caves, stopping to charge at Basavakalyan and Beed along the way. Reaching Ellora, driving 600 km, by late afternoon, we explored the caves and the Grishneswar Temple before heading to Dhule for the night. Charged in Ellora Resort in Ellora while having our dinner.After a relaxing overnight stay in a nice hotel and nice breakfast and quick charge in Dhule, we made our way to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat. Reaching by 3:00 PM, we spent the afternoon touring the statue and other attractions nearby, while charging our vehicle in Ramada Encore. We then continued to Mehsana for an overnight stay after charging at Kalol while dining.The drive to Rann of Kutch was one of the most memorable of our trip. We charged our vehicle in Radhampur and continued our journey of 245 kms to Rann Utsav area. As we drove through the vast, endless white desert, we felt like we were in another world. We reached Rann of Kutch by 4:30 PM, charging the car at Mobiline before heading out to explore the white desert and catching the night views. If the only charging station in Rann Utsav is not working then the backup plan was to drive 82 km to Bhuj for charging which would be a detour. We stayed at Tent City for the night, enjoying cultural programs and traditional food. The following morning, we caught the stunning sunrise over the desert.We started from Rann of Kutch and crossed through the picturesque Radhampur route. Along the way, we visited the Dholavira Harappan civilization site and stopped to charge at Hotel Shivaay in Tharad. After another quick charge in Sanchur along with Dinner, we reached Bamar by evening, ready to rest.We left Bamar early and reached Jaisalmer by 11:30 AM. We charged the car at Taj Gowrabandha Palace Hotel before heading to Jaisalmer Fort and other nearby attractions. The city, with its sand-coloured architecture, was a sight to behold. After some shopping, we headed to the desert camp area in Sam, where we stayed overnight in neat and clean tents, enjoying cultural programs and delicious food.The morning began with a thrilling desert safari and a camel ride in the Sam Desert. Afterward, we decided to visit Longewala, a site with significant historical importance due to the 1961 India-Pakistan war. My wife\u0092s father had sentimental ties to the place as he was posted in Jaisalmer. We visited the Longewala Museum and picked up some souvenirs. We then returned to Jaisalmer and charged the car before starting our journey back. We have reached Pachpadra for overnight stay.

            "content": "BHP share price in focus\n\nThe BHP Group Ltd ( ASX:BHP ) share price is down -21.61% since the beginning of 2024. So, how can you put a value on the BHP share price?\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nThe key metrics\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried reading a company\u2019s income statement on the annual report, you\u2019ll know just how complex it can get. While there are any number of ways you could slice up the statement, three key figures are revenue, gross margin, and profit.\n\nRevenue is important for obvious reasons \u2013 everything else (profit, margins, return on equity etc.) is downstream of a company\u2019s ability to generate sales and revenue. What we\u2019re looking for is not so much the absolute number, but the trend. BHP last reported an annual revenue of $56,027m with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 3 years of -0.7% per year.\n\nThe next thing we\u2019ll want to consider is the gross margin. The gross margin tells us how profitable the core products/services are \u2013 before you take into account all the overhead costs, how much money does the company make from selling $100 worth of goods and services? BHP\u2019s latest reported gross margin was 82.3%.\n\nFinally, we get to profit, the real headline number. Last financial year BHP Group Ltd reported a profit of $7,897m. That compares to 3 years ago when they made a profit of $11,304m, representing a CAGR of -11.3%.\n\nFinancial health of BHP shares\n\nNext, we could consider the capital health of the company. What we\u2019re trying to work out is whether the company is generating a reasonable return on their equity (the total shareholder value) and whether they have a good safety buffer. One important measure to consider is net debt. This is simply the total debt minus the company\u2019s cash holdings.\n\nIn the case of BHP, the current net debt sits at $9,467m. A high number here means that a company has a lot of debt which potentially means higher interest payments, greater instability, and higher sensitivity to interest rates. A negative value on the other hand indicates the company has more cash than debt, which can be seen as good (a big safety buffer) or bad (inefficient capital allocation).\n\nA metric that might be more valuable to us is the debt/equity percentage. This tells us how much debt the company has relative to shareholder ownership. In other words, how leveraged is the company? BHP Group Ltd has a debt/equity ratio of 45.3%, which means they have more equity than debt.\n\nFinally, we can look at the return on equity (ROE). The ROE tells us how much profit a company is generating as a percentage of its total equity \u2013 high numbers indicate the company is allocating capital efficiently and generating value, while a low number suggests that company growth may be starting to slow. BHP generated an ROE of 19.7% in FY24.\n\nWhat to make of BHP shares?\n\nOne way to have a \u2018speedy read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is could be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.52%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield. Be careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing, or both. In the case of BHP, last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price.",

            "content": "Vale S.A. VALE reported iron ore production of around 85 million tons (Mt) for the fourth quarter of 2024, which was 4.6% lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting a shift toward higher-margin products.\n\nHowever, VALE\u2019s iron ore production for 2024 reached 328 Mt, in line with its latest provided guidance. Compared with 2023, iron production was up 2% and was the highest since 2018.\n\nDigging Deeper Into Vale\u2019s Iron Ore Production Numbers\n\nThe decline in iron ore production seen in the quarter mainly reflected the company\u2019s portfolio optimization decision, which prioritizes the production of higher-margin products. The S11D mine produced record iron ore production of 23.7 Mt in the fourth quarter. The commissioning of Brucutu\u2019s fourth processing line resulted in the site\u2019s highest quarterly production since 2019. This was partially offset by maintenance activities at the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o 2 plant, which impacted Itabira\u2019s performance.\n\nIn 2024, S11D achieved a record output of 83 Mt as a result of the optimized maintenance strategy, which enabled greater asset availability and operational stability.\n\nVale\u2019s pellet production was down 7% year over year to 9.2 Mt in the fourth quarter. This was mainly due to the Vargem Grande plant performance, impacted by maintenance activities in November and December. Full-year pellet production was reported at 36.9 Mt, up 1.2% year over year.\n\nDetails on Vale\u2019s Iron Ore Sales Volumes & Realized Prices\n\nSales Volume Dip in Q4: Iron ore fines sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to 69.9 Mt. Pellet sales were down 2% to around 10 Mt. Total iron ore sales were down 10% year over year to 81.2 Mt. The decline in sales was attributable to portfolio optimization based on current market conditions, resulting in high-silica products being predominantly directed to the formation of blended products and concentration plants in China (PFC1).\n\nFull-Year Sales Improvement: Total iron ore sales were up 2% year over year to 306.7 Mt in 2024. Iron ore fines sales increased 1.4% from the prior year to 260 Mt and pellet sales were up 7% to around 38.3 Mt.\n\nIron Ore Prices Down: The average realized iron ore fines price was $93 per ton in the December-ended quarter, down 21.4% year over year due to lower iron ore prices. The average realized iron ore fines price for 2024 was $95.3 per ton, 11.8% lower than 2023.\n\nVale\u2019s Copper Operations Deliver Growth\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Vale produced 101.8 kt of copper, which was 2.7% higher than the year-ago quarter. Enhanced performance at Salobo 1&2 and the completion of the Salobo 3 ramp-up led to the improvement in the quarter. This was offset by lower output at Sossego due to decreased feed grade to the mill, as planned. In Canada, copper production improved mainly on the back of increased mill throughput in Sudbury and the ramp-up of VBME.",

            "content": "BHPian R15M_Rider recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nSpolier Alert: This acquisition will not make sense to most of you. Its one of my most emotionally driven purchase of just about anything for me with the heart having 90% weightage over the head\n\nThe Origin:\n\nFor those of you, who have haven't following my previous thread, I was an owner of a 2022 Yamaha YZF R15M for two years. It was my first motorcycle and it truly ignited the motorcyclist in me. It showed me how much of a liberator of stress and fun a machine on two wheels can be. It gave me the opportunity to venture out to touring and an unforgettable glimpse into the race-track. Of course, on tours, especially on highways, there one thing inevitably lacking, that is the power. 18.1 BHP, don't get me wrong is not slow by any means for that gem of a 155cc engine, but its something you definitely will grow out of pretty quickly, especially if you're an enthusiast who rides, breathes and sleeps dreaming about motorcycles. Its almost like a tug of war, one part of the emotional pull is to keep sticking with your first bike, do stuff with it and create memories, while the other keeps telling me that, you need 40 BHP in your life, especially in your prime youth and not upgrading now, might make me regret it later a lot when other responsibilities of life creep in.\n\nWhy 40 BHP is my ideal/dream figure? - Having done my research, I have a firm belief that in a country like ours, you need a bike that can feel comfortable at cruising speeds of 110-120 Kmph while also providing decent gas mileage. This is the sweet spot. This is the maximum level of performance that can be used in the best of roads, our country has to offer, but also act decently as a commuter too without being a hassle. The 600cc, litre class segment, with the R1s, Daytonas, R7s, ZX10R etc while they have definitely aspirational value like how a Ferrari or Lamborghini is viewed in the car world, they are equally not appropriate for daily use. Yes, in my dream, the motorcycle I choose needs to be able to do right from touring the country to something as simple as commuting to office on a daily basis. At no point in my ownership of the R15, unless it was for medical reasons, did it collect dust for more than 2-3 days at a single place.It also eventually became the reason, I had to let it go too. I intent to apply the same to this upgrade as well.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, and beginning of 2024, the 300-400cc segment saw a huge influx of bikes from Truimph, Bajaj, Aprilia, Kawasaki and of course Yamaha (please excuse if I missed any other significant brand).\n\nWhy the obsession for the R3 ?\n\n\n\nObsession Begins Here\n\nDec 2023 - Yamaha makes an announcement that, the well awaited, YZF-R3 and MT03 were going to hit Indian shores by Jan 2024. Thanks to the CBU route, it came with an astronomical price tag of 4.64L - ex showroom. What ensued, is of course the sheer expression of disappointment by both enthusiasts and journalists alike. Coming from the R15, I more or less became in love with the sports-bike category. The sheer feel of having razor sharp handling in corners is just equivalent to a chef's kiss. I also, have one more perspective and I understand this might not make sense a lot, but I always try to look at the value part first and then the accessibility part of it. To me, every machine has a character. In the long run, I strongly believe, choosing the machine whose character closely resembles your taste makes more sense than whether it has the features to justify its price tag. By character I mean, it can be something as simple as the design, the exhaust note, the engine response, handling etc. Its something that is so powerful and personal, that it will never make any sense if you try to explain to others who has a different opinion.\n\nSo, going by what is available on the market for a sporty-faired motorcycle in the 300-400cc segment with 40ish BHP, these are the options to choose from:\n\n1. Aprilia RS457\n\n2. Kawasaki Ninja 500\n\n3. Kawasaki Ninja 300\n\n4. Yamaha YZF R3\n\nI will go through what the normal perception is of the above 4 bikes:\n\n\n\nRS457 - Now, going by reviews and the general sentiment, the RS457 walks over the other three likes its nobody's business. It has the most power at 47 BHP, amazing low-end torque that pulls in just about any gear and at any speed. It also has the most modern looking design too and its packed with features and electronics that most customers crave for.\n\nKawasaki Ninja 500 - Creamy smooth engine. Ludicrously over-priced. No features on offer comparable to the Aprilia. Most expensive of the bunch here.\n\nKawasaki Ninja 300 - Kawasaki has forgotten to discontinue this model in India. But engine is bullet-proof.\n\nYamaha YZF R3 - 2019 designed model which is due for an upgrade in 2025. Not even a slipper clutch. Legendary and proven twin cylinder engine, Yamaha is trying to force us to accept their \"if it isn't broken, don't fix/upgrade it approach\".\n\nNow comes to the tricky bit, how do in the world do I explain to you guys, out of all the four, why in the right mind would I have chosen the R3 over the much more modern and VFM RS457.\n\nWell then, let us start with some honest admissions then. Right from my childhood, when it came to automobiles, I always had an admiration for the Japanese. I loved their car culture. I always found them interesting in their beliefs of stability over agility (which I guess is hurting them now in someways when it comes to sales tactics and figures, comparing with how other companies work). My most favorite era of cars from them is the 90s-early 2000s with the RB26 Skyline GT-Rs, 2JZ Supra, the Evos and STIs. I loved the designs of these cars. Simple, functional and not too extravagant with legendary engines, that some models are unsurprisingly having price figures rivalling Ferraris and Lambos today. So, I fully admit, I have a soft spot for Japs inspite of the sad state they are in today in certain areas.\n\nWhy I didn't wait till 2025 then? For the updated MY2025 YZF-R3 ? :\n\n\n\nSimplistic Beauty!\n\nReasons are getting more personal now. To try and explain to the best of my ability, let me draw another parallel with my interests of cars. As mentioned above, I drool over simplistic designs. My favorite cars in the world are the 90s, 2000s R32,R33 and R34 Skyline GTRs. Clean, elegant and simple. Also, this was a period of time, when cars were having only base level tech. I consider this period to be the best. It was when tech was not yet intrusive enough that required people to demand, but rather, the focus was more on the experience, the feel of driving, the roar of the engine, hardware induced emotions etc. While tech and features started into cars around the early 2010s itself, for bikes, I think its truly starting to show now only. The 2025 model seems a bit too busy for my taste especially the extra DRLs, who prefers simplicity. The back is way too similar to the R15 too. You can call me a boomer , but it is the truth for me.\n\nIn March 2024, I went to the MMRT for participating in the Track Day organized by Yamaha. Until this point, I never saw an R3 in the flesh, not the current one at least. I loved the design in the pictures due to reasons mentioned above. I have seen videos from the entire world of people riding and sharing their experience on the R3. But in the flesh when I saw it, that's when it truly became from just a bike I was deeply interested in to one that started to become an obsession. Something just clicked that day. A connection which just refused fade away with time. Trust me, as much as I tried to look at the logical side of things, watch millions of content on the RS457 or any of the others, none of them, I was able to connect with. No, I don't have someone having a gun to my head. Nobody is paying me to remain loyal to a company. I don't expect everyone to understand, but, truth is, this feeling can never be truly explained.\n\nI was also the same person who persuaded my dad to test-drive before finalizing on the CB350 Highness. But when it came to this, a dream so powerful that I made a complete U-Turn .\n\nBooking:\n\nInitially, the plan was to get this in Nov/Dec. But day by day, this impulse was getting stronger. I was rigorously saving up for this bike for months. Around 18th Oct, we had planned a trip to Yercaud, me and my dad. While starting the trip itself, it rained and since the forecast near Salem wasn't encouraging, we decided to postpone it. Instead, we just planned to enquire some showrooms and get an estimate on the R3. With Deepavali around the corner, I was hoping to see some discounts. Listing down the showrooms and their estimates shared:\n\n1. Shanti Motors, Pallikarnai - 60k discount, had stock ready to deliver on the day to which can be chosen - 4.90L onroad (without exchange value of my older R15)\n\n2. Sky Motors, Thoripakkam - Laziest staff, hardly interested. No discounts, pathetic estimate for my two year old R15. (95k)\n\n3. Bikerz Yamaha, Nandanam - Same showroom I got the R15 from. Being an existing customer, I did expect some good discount. But got a 30k discount only. Also, that complimentary kit which Yamaha offers for free on buying the R3/MT03, that seems to be part of the discount with value of 20k!\n\nApart from this one notable mention is Sri Motors, Kattupakkam- got a quoted discount of 40k over messages (didn't physically go).\n\nEventually, settled on Shanti Motors. 4.90L was in a way a good estimate. The RS457 on-road price comes close to it what you can get on-road. Once again, only saying about the price, not the features you get for it. An exchange offer was given for my R15 at 1.25L(low side only, should've gotten atleast 1.40L), but after discussion internally with my dad, we went for it.\n\nThe plan was part down-payment and part-finance/EMI. Earlier we had gone for L&T finance and this time too we decided to stick with it. The finance person was not that experienced I feel. Finalizing this itself took at least two separate trips to the showroom. The cherry on top was when everything was done, they added a \"loan processing charge \" amounting to 15k. Something which was never communicated earlier when were booking the bike. Nevertheless as much as it spoilt the mood, I stuck with it. So if any of you are planning to use L&T finance, make sure you have a written estimate of every single charge beforehand to avoid such hiccups. Transparency is needed.\n\nShanti Motors also offered to showcase the unboxing of the bike from the crate (as its a CBU) along with an option to ride the bike ourselves to the RTO. I believe these were suggestions given by fellow BHPian V.Max who also took delivery from the same showroom of the R3. Still, it was a good gesture and I am glad they offered it.\n\nDelivery:\n\nDelivery was taken today (31st Oct 2024) on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali. A day I was craving for so badly, dreaming of it every time I went to bed. Finally, around 11.30 AM, took delivery! Color I had chosen was signature Yamaha's \"icon blue\". Two colors are on offer - Icon Blue and Yamaha Black. Though I come from a silver R15, this time, it was indeed the call of the blue! Delivery was nicely organized as well.\n\n\n\nIts here!\n\nOverall, the experience at Shanti Motors was good. Whatever was promised, they have delivered on time. Communication for the most part was transparent too, though sometimes, I felt, when it came to submitting some documents, they could've reduced my showroom visits from 3 to 1 if they had mentioned everything to be shared in advance itself properly. But I guess, this occurs in other showrooms too. That finance part too was a slight downer. Overall, since these guys have already sold 3-4 R3s in Chennai, I guess, you can consider them if you're planning to get one in Chennai. Overall, satisfied with the experience.\n\nInitial Impressions:\n\nPros:\n\nThe riding posture is very comfortable coming from the R15. I have seen in reviews too, that the R3 is more sports-tourer orientated rather than a full blown Sports bike. I can confirm this.\n\nRight from the moment I started from the showroom, I can already feel, this is the perfect upgrade to my R15. The way in which the power is delivered, linearly, its just like the R15. But 321cc twin shows its color as you move up the rev range. Since its in run-in period, I am not going to push until 1000 km is done. But even then, I can feel the rev-happy nature of the engine.\n\nHaving not taken a test-ride, and this being a direct first on-hand experience, I can say it with confidence and a wide grin on my face that, I am so glad I went with my heart instead of going by reviews and other external factors. Pure Pleasure is what I can describe it as. The exhaust note is beautiful! Smooth and refined as expected.\n\nFuel Economy obviously drops significantly from my R15, but that's expected. Still a respectable 25 kmpl can be expected as per some reports. I can confirm only after a week or 2 of riding it.\n\nBuild Quality is rock solid! Overall impression is of a well-built product, one expects out of Japan, It is a CBU, I know, but still worth mentioning it.\n\nSuspension is neatly tuned. I did go through some bad patches of roads while returning home from showroom. Shocks are excellent.\n\nServicing costs mostly could be on the lower side compared to competitors at Aprilia and Kawasaki. Yet to confirm this, but definitely the service network is much more wider than the other 2.\n\nCons:\n\nLack of slipper clutch. I will admit its not as bad as I thought it would be. I already have a habit of rev matching when I down-shift, so that I guess is helping now. But still, its a major omission for sure.\n\nQuick-shifter? - While I don't mind its absence, It was nice to have this on my R15M even if it was for up-shift only. Since its sold in UK and some international markets from what I have heard, Yamaha should've provided it here as an accessory as well.\n\nLack of accessories. Hardly anything noteworthy to add officially from Yamaha.\n\nSpares availability is still a question mark for CBU bikes.\n\nPrice without a good discount is extremely steep.\n\nEngine does heat up quite a lot. But I think this must be due to initial engine oil which needs to be used till 1000km. Hopefully will be done after that.\n\n\n\nDual Headlights have a certain charm indeed!\n\nSide Note\n\nYamaha is supposed to send a complimentary kit with some Oakley sunglasses, T-Shirt, RS4GP engine oil. No sign of it yet.\n\nI will as usual, keep this thread updated and active whenever required and possible. Overall, this happens to be the best purchases I have done, most expensive but possibly the most heart's desire fulfilling asset till date. Having turned 25 just this month, I feel I have managed to acquire this dream machine in the best phase of my youth.\n\nTo conclude then, do I recommend to try this approach of going purely on instincts and intuition? Frankly, and ideal answer is no. Test ride and proper analysis is must when you're willing to spend this much especially when you aren't fully attached to anything particular. But sometimes, just sometimes, if your intuition is too powerful, then maybe, just maybe, try giving your heart the benefit of the doubt and go for it. Sometimes risks can be rewarding too without regrets!\n\nHappy Deepavali,\n\nRide Safe!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "For those seeking regular income, it\u2019s tougher going in today\u2019s markets. In Australia, the ASX 200\u2019s current dividend yield of 3.5% is near its lowest in 25 years. Worse, the dividends aren\u2019t expected to grow much over the next 12 months as earnings flatline.\n\nOverseas, it\u2019s no better. The S&P 500 is yielding just 1.25%. At least, the US has stronger forecast earnings growth of 15% for 2025, some of which should flow through to dividends.\n\nGiven this, where can investors go to find regular income in stocks?\n\nA dividends primer\n\nMany people don\u2019t understand where dividends come from and how they grow, so here\u2019s a brief guide to get you up to speed. Put simply, dividends come from earnings. So, firstly, you want to own a company that earns a profit. Second, you ideally want a business that is growing its earnings over time. Third, you also hope that the stock will pay out dividends from the growing earnings stream.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the example of theoretical company, XYZ:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Theoretical earnings and dividend growth. Source: Firstlinks\n\nXYZ has shareholders\u2019 equity of $100, from which it makes $14 in profit in year one. Of that profit, it pays out $7 in dividends, equivalent to a dividend payout ratio of 50%. It retains the remaining $7 to fund future growth or improve operations by paying down debt or building a cash reserve for a rainy day.\n\nThe company maintains a healthy return on equity of 14% in future years as well as a dividend payout ratio of 50%.\n\nBy year five, it\u2019s a pretty picture. Equity and earnings have grown nicely, as have dividends. The dividends have increased each year, and amount to $9.20 by year five, compared to $7 at the end of year one.\n\nIf I was an income investor in XYZ, I\u2019d be happy.\n\nThe ASX\u2019s dividend problem\n\nThe current issue with Australian shares is that unlike XYZ, they\u2019re barely growing earnings, and they\u2019re paying out less of those earnings out as dividends. Last financial year, the dividend payout ratio for the ASX 200 fell to 53%.\n\nThe market is also putting a heftier price on those earnings and dividends. The current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the ASX 200 is 21.6x, more than 20% above its long-term average.\n\nThat\u2019s resulted in the dividend yield for Australian stocks falling to 3.5%, almost two standard deviations below its average since 2000. Put another way, the dividend yield has only been lower about 5% of the time over the past 25 years.\n\nThe other problem is that growing dividends may prove more challenging going forward. Bank earnings aren\u2019t expected to grow much more than mid-single digits over the next 12 months after falling in recent years.\n\nThe other index heavyweights, mining companies, are dealing with falling iron ore prices, and both BHP (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) are highly leveraged to these prices. That means there is likely to be more dividend cuts from resource firms in 2025.\n\nWhere, then, can investors go to find income? Here are some ideas.\n\nIdea 1: High yield dividend ETFs\n\nAn obvious idea is to own high dividend yielding ETFs. For instance, the largest dividend ETF, Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield (VHY), sports a forecast dividend yield of 4.8%, which equates to 6.4% grossed up. That compares to the ASX 200 dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nVHY tracks the return of the FTSE Australia High Dividend Yield Index and invests in companies with higher forecast dividends versus the average ASX company. It pays quarterly distributions, though the dividends aren\u2019t fully franked. Franking was 66% in 2024 and 97% in the prior year.\n\nThere are a couple of issues with VHY to be aware of. First, it\u2019s even more heavily weighted in financials and commodities than the ASX 200. Almost 75% of the ETF is exposed to these two sectors. That means future dividend streams are likely to be volatile - they may go up and down.\n\nSecond, like most high yield ETFs, VHY invests in high dividend yielding companies, and largely neglects those businesses that can grow dividends over time.\n\nBoth these issues can be gleaned from the chart below.\n\nFigure 2: VHY distributions by year. Source: Vanguard, Firstlinks\n\nThe chart shows VHY dividends by year. As you can see, dividends have bounced up and down. Part of that can be attributed to Covid, though not all of it. Note also how the dividends haven\u2019t grown a lot over the past decade.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens when you heavily invest in banks such as Commonwealth Bank (CBA), which have struggled to grow earnings and dividends.\n\nFigure 3: CBA dividends over time. Source: CBA, Firstlinks\n\nDespite these drawbacks, VHY or other equivalent ETFs are still worth considering for those seeking regular income. After all, grossed up yields of 6.4% for VHY remain relatively attractive.\n\nIdea 2: Stocks with rising earnings and dividends\n\nThe next idea is to invest in Australian shares which are expected to grow profits and dividends. How do you do this? Well, you probably need to look outside of the banks and miners.\n\nOne possible option is listed investment company, Whitefield (WHF), which invests solely in industrials \u2013 essentially the ASX 200 minus commodity companies - and has a long track record.\n\nYou can also get exposure to faster growing stocks by investing outside the largest companies by market capitalization. For example, Betashares Australian ex-20 Portfolio Diversifier ETF (EX20) owns just businesses outside the top 20 of the ASX 200. There are also well-run managed funds, such as Auscap\u2019s ex-20 Australian Equities Fund, that can achieve similar things.\n\nAnother idea is to invest in an equal index weighted ETF. For example, VanEck\u2019s Australian Equal Weight ETF (MVW) offers exposure to the largest ASX companies, but weighted equally rather than by market cap. This results in holding less of the banks and miners, and more of the rest of the ASX.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to invest in ETFs and can own stocks directly instead. I won\u2019t go into too much detail here as I\u2019ve outlined many dividend stocks in previous articles, but companies with decent, growing yields on reasonable valuations that I currently like include Telstra (TLS), Medibank (MPL), Aurizon (AZJ), Charter Hall Retail (CQR), Lottery Corp (TLC) \u2013 all sport dividend yields from 3.3% to 7.6%.\n\nIdea 3: International stocks\n\nThose seeking income can also invest overseas. Unlike Australia, the US has so-called dividend aristocrats \u2013 companies that have not only paid dividends but grown them in each year for at least 25 years. The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF tracks these companies. The downside is that the current dividend yield for this ETF is just 2.25%. And its total return of 11% over the past decade has trailed the S&P 500\u2019s 13.4% (which isn\u2019t a big negative given the outperformance of tech companies over everything else).\n\nAnother way to invest internationally for income is to just own the S&P 500 index or world index itself. For example, the top 500 companies in the US have grown dividends by almost 8% per annum over the past decade. Of course, past performance is no indicator to the future, though American companies have historically grown earnings by 5% per year in real terms.\n\nAnother idea is to get income via thematic investing. I like infrastructure as a theme as many of the companies in the sector - airports, utilities, railroads, toll roads and the like - have critical assets with CPI-adjusted pricing. There are Australian-based global ETFs that capture this theme, including Vanguard\u2019s (VBLD) and VanEck\u2019s (IFRA). There are also managed infrastructure funds with decent track records such as First Sentier, Resolution Capital, and Magellan.\n\nIt's worth noting that international investing has some complications that Australian-based investing doesn\u2019t. One is tax - dividends here offer franking credits, while those overseas don\u2019t. The tax paperwork for overseas dividend paying stocks can also be exhaustive. A further issue is exchange rate fluctuations. Whether to hedge the currency or not is a key decision when investing overseas.\n\nFinal considerations",

            "content": "BHPian Tvk1991 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nSeeing the complexity on working with the newer generation cars for tuning, I was desiring to have a car which is more mod friendly on the performance aspect.\n\nBudget: 15-20l\n\nThe cars considered were :\n\nE89 Z4 (N54) - first consideration\n\nN54 with a stage 3 turbo upgrade can see will push upto 550hp, but spoke to several tuners they all told the engine is not reliable and could not see much people doing an stage 2 or 3 for the N54 engines in India.\n\nI can see in overseas there is a huge community in tuning these N54 engine (particularly 335i E90).\n\nAudi TT or the VRS:\n\nThis was suggested by most people due to plenty of support and parts availability in this platform. Was able to see many TT cars with AWD achieve 10-11s 1/4 mile timing in Dragy app.\n\nI was slightly hesitant to go for one more 4 cylinder car and made up my mind to look for V8, I6 and V6 cars.\n\nSaw few RS5 V8 l, the cars were priced between 30-35l but offered good VFM according to me seeing the fact the extinction of NA cars.\n\nConcerns were not much power can be extracted from the NA cars only way is the supercharger route. The cost of brake pads and rotors were too expensive for my expectations.\n\nSo decided to miss it and started looking for anything interesting.\n\nAudi A6 3.0TFSI:\n\nFew threads in Team-BHP made me more interested in the supercharged V6 and their potential. Found couple of cars but the air suspension scared me a lot to take a call on this. The cars were price between 9-12l and the past owner history in most cases was not very clear. But other wear and tear parts are priced reasonably and easily available.\n\nOne day while casually browsing Team-Bhp found an Audi S4 for sale in Banglore with TN number plate. Immediately had a long discussion and being a fellow enthusiast he was very transparent and the deal was finalised before I saw the car. Fixed a date (1 week after) flew to Banglore did the transfer and took delivery of a less driven Audi S4 2014.\n\nAdvantages: 2x+ price of Audi A6, but no concerns of Air suspension. Damage of Air suspension replacement itself was roughly 3-4l.\n\nSpoke to a acquittance (now a good friend) who owns an S4 before the purchase decision on what to look out for and the price. He gave me good tips on what should I see in the car and rough idea on the pricing.\n\nODO:49k kms\n\nAdditional add ons: CF interiors and optional sports differential.\n\nImmediate concerns: Tires has to be changed before driving to Chennai. The owner told this very clearly in the initial call we had that all tires had bumps due to very less usage.\n\nLeft headlight(bulbs) was kaput and was not working.\n\nSpare tire torn completely due to age I believe.\n\nIt seems the owner did not use the car much for the last 2+ years (seeing the last tire alignment sticker on the windshield) and only take it out once a week for short drives.\n\nCalled several tire dealers in Banglore based on google reviews and found the store Tyre Empire had Conti SC 6 for the size 245/45/18 the stock ones were 245/40/18 I upgrade it to a profile higher as told by a fellow owner he has been running with the upgrade for a long time. The price of the tires was the best when compared to Chennai (top tire shops). Rs.65,000 (for 4 tires with balancing, 2024 YOM).\n\nThe tire shop guy told I need to replace all 4 struts for alignment, I found the suspension to be manageable. He offered to replace it himself seeing I just purchased the car used (slightly felt he tried to upsell as they were pushing for decarbonisation immediately when I refused Suspension change). Told him I do not need alignment and did the replacement and balancing alone and was out in 1 hour.\n\nDue to no spare tire, selected a better ones of the 4 old tires and took it for safety till I replace the spare donut wheel.\n\nBy the time I took delivery (4:30pm) and did the replacement the time was (7:00pm). Decided to stay in Hosur due to non functional left headlights and tiredness of driving in Banglore traffic.\n\nDrove slowly to Hosur and reached the hotel by 9:30 pm, thanks to Banglore traffic and me not able to take the Electronic City flyover had to crawl through to reach the hotel in Hosur.\n\nHad a nice dinner at 10:00 PM and went to sleep and planned to start at 5:00 am. Woke up at 6:30 am and started the drive back home, reached home by mid day 12:30.\n\nThe car was different to whatever I have driven before it pulls like an NA car with a whine above 4k rpm till redline the whine sound is addictive and exhaust note was quite good for a stock car compared to the current stock cars sold in the market . Each shift in higher rpm is with a slight burble from the exhaust if shifted in redline.\n\nThe suspension was in a more softer side when compared to the ones found in my A35. The seats were similar to the Alcantara types seats offered in my A35.\n\nInitial assessment:\n\nWaited for an auspicious day to finish Pooja and get blessing from temple used it for couple of days before sending the car to VAGMASTERS in Chennai to check the car.\n\nThey gave me a feedback that few suspension parts has been replaced by the previous owner and the suspension (struts) and rotors can last another 1 year (<10k kms) understanding my very less usage.\n\nThey told the car is well maintained and less used for its age. Did general service with all filter change and oils with the change of headlight bulbs both side the total damage was 28k.\n\nBeen using the car for 600km after the service and enjoyed driving it. This car has better ground clearance when compared to the A35 AMG and handles bad roads better due to softer suspension.\n\nDid a 0-60 time in Draggy and got 5.0 s. Could not do multiple runs and was happy to see this time in my first launch itself.\n\nMods planned:\n\nI have decided to focus minimal on the exterior mods and to do stepwise for the stage wise engine mods. I believe the total budget for max and easier mods possible in this car is around 5-6l (480-520bhp) maximum not including good suspension and brake upgrade . Few threads in team-bhp itself explaining the mods done 3.0 TFSI engines, I plan to go with the same path.\n\nWith all my money spent on going above my budget in buying the car, decided to wait for few months before I spend anything on the car.\n\nThanks to my family for being supportive in my crazy decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "BHPian ADI7YAK recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI too drove the car but it was a really short test drive (<5km) and hence I could not really explore all the features though first impressions are fairly positive,\n\nDesert Myst colour looks quite nice though my personal favourite would be the Nebula Blue (?) also offered on other Mahindras. I also think there's way too much gloss black going on the outside.\n\nFit finish levels seemed quite good. Notice the charging flap which was misaligned on many media cars is fair bit more aligned here.\n\nIt drives really well, picks up pace fast and modulating throttle is easy which makes driving on slow roads quite soothing.\n\nThe ride quality at slow speeds over bad roads is multiple times better than Kona (which I know isn't really a benchmark) It glides over small potholes and undulations without a worry.\n\nSound system is fantastic, though someone prior to me had turned the bass all the way up (typical) and I basically turned equalizer to flat default setting. Will need to play around with the equalizer to see if I can manage an even better output. I'm also looking forward to see if Dolby Atmos works wirelessly on Apple Carplay with Apple Music since it connects via WiFi and not bluetooth.\n\nSound insulation seemed fine, car has acoustic windows and windshields. Mahindra claims it to be quieter than some German cars, I want to put this claim to the test on Mumbai Pune Expressway at triple digit speeds.\n\nI tried one pedal mode, it worked well but I'll need to use it more to see if there are any jerks at the fag end of the stop, from say 5kmph to 0kmph. This should tell how well calibrated One pedal drive mode is.\n\nI also tried adaptive cruise control at slow (30kmph) speed while following a car. Seemed to work fine.\n\nTesla like traffic visualization is easily my favourite screen now. It shows cars, bikes, trucks, and pedestrians as well!\n\nThis car had it's software updated to show consumption information. I didn't pay much attention to it since it's useless without resetting the trip meter and calculating it properly over a long test drive.\n\nSpace at the back is awesome. My dad at 5'10\" had zero complaints. Should be comfortable even for tall occupants.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "ASX Blue Chip Shares Deliver Stability And Growth Investors turn to established companies for reliable returns amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThe allure of ASX blue chip shares is undeniable, especially in today's fluctuative market. These stocks represent the largest and most stable companies on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), providing investors with not only financial stability but also significant opportunities for steady income and growth.\n\nASX blue chip shares serve as benchmarks for younger investors seeking reliable investment avenues amid the unpredictable global economy of 2025. This year, investing in major banks and companies has taken on heightened relevance due to global uncertainties and shifting stock market dynamics.\n\nDefinitionally, ASX blue chip shares are the backbone of Australia\u2019s stock market, typically denoting large-cap companies with established market dominance and proven performance records. Their reliable income generation through regular dividend payments makes them particularly attractive to income-focused investors, such as retirees. The stability they offer during volatile economic periods has positioned these stocks as safer investments for those wary of market fluctuations.\n\nLeading companies like BHP Group Ltd. (ASX: BHP) and CSL (ASX: CSL) exemplify the qualities of these blue chip stocks. BHP, for example, reported impressive figures for FY2023, with revenue reaching USD 53.8 billion, reinforcing its reliability as a cornerstone investment. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), renowned as the largest bank by market capitalization, delivered dividends totaling AUD 4.65 per share during the same fiscal year, catering to investors\u2019 appetite for consistent income.\n\nCSL's dedication to innovation is evident through its R&D expenditure, which rose to USD 1.22 billion, ensuring its position as a leader in biotechnology and providing life-saving therapies and vaccines. Collectively, these companies showcase why ASX blue chip shares have become indispensable for investors aiming for long-term sustainability.\n\nInvestment experts argue for the value of diversification, which is achievable through blue chip shares. For investors desiring to balance risk, adding stocks like Rio Tinto can help reduce volatility, as these corporations\u2019 international operations provide extensive revenue streams.\n\nThe potential for growth is also evident. The Australian blue chip sector not only stands resilient amid economic downturns, but companies like BHP and CSL regularly innovate, ensuring their growth trajectories remain positive.\n\nFor investment newcomers, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are becoming increasingly popular as they offer exposure to multiple blue chip stocks through single transactions. ETFs, such as the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (VAS) or iShares S&P/ASX 200 ETF (IOZ), enable investors to tap directly from the performance of the top blue chip companies without the need to select individual stocks.\n\nTo understand how blue chips fare during challenging times, take Gold Road Resources Ltd (ASX: GOR). Recently, this gold stock witnessed significant fluctuations, with shares dropping 5% following concerning production guidance for FY 2025. The release indicated the Gruyere operation's production fell short of expectations, prompting market skepticism about future performance. Despite these challenges, Gold Road's management remains optimistic about achieving higher production levels due to operational advancements and strategic initiatives.\n\nDespite Gold Road's day-to-day struggles, the company has reported significant growth over the past year, with shares up 70%. Its continued efforts to meet production targets demonstrate the potential variability within blue chip stocks but also reflect the challenges inherent to the resources sector.\n\nOverall, investing wisely requires thoughtful consideration of both financial performance and market conditions. Nevertheless, the solid foundation laid by ASX blue chip stocks provides reassurance to investors. The sector's resilience suggests these investments remain attractively positioned for those seeking both income and potential capital appreciation.\n\nThe analytic rigor needed to assess investments can often appear intimidating, yet the overarching trends demonstrate the real and lasting value of blue chip companies on the ASX. From consistent dividends to long-term growth potential, the evidence supports the strategy of incorporating these stocks within diversified investment portfolios. Understanding how to select and value these shares can significantly benefit both novice and seasoned investors alike.",

            "content": "WHETHER BHP will make another takeover offer for Anglo American remains a tantalisingly open question for 2025. Intriguingly, Mike Henry's group remains ambivalent. Twice last year senior company figures, notably the chairperson Ken Mackenzie at the AGM on October 30, said BHP had \u201cmoved on\u201d from Anglo, only for the company to clarify in front of the UK Takeover Panel that \u201ccomments made will not be treated as a statement of intention not to make an offer in respect of Anglo American\u201d.\n\nAs recently as November, Henry said a recent trip to meet senior South African politicians and the state-owned Public Investment Corporation, a major Anglo shareholder, had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Anglo. That remains to be seen. The smart money suggests BHP will first see how Anglo's restructuring plan works out before considering its options.\n\nWhile the future of Anglo remains on the backburner, BHP remains locked on M&A as it seeks to add to its copper portfolio, agreeing with Canada's Lundin Mining in July a joint C$4.1bn cash offer for Filo Corp. Henry's group has targeted 70% growth in annual copper production from 1.9Mt last year to 2050 but organic growth is proving expensive.\n\nEscondida, BHP's jewel-in-the-crown copper asset in Chile, will sap $10bn in outlay if it is to replace reserves and grow as planned. Returning from a visit to the asset, some analysts concluded M&A was BHP's best growth option, especially as project permitting is time consuming. Meanwhile, BHP is seen as a touchstone on market health. Asked recently what he thought of China's stimulus efforts, Henry said commodities were beginning to respond.",

            "content": "ANGLO American is tipped to be among the most likely takeover target of European mining stocks, according to a report by Bloomberg News on Monday.\n\nCiting a survey of 50 merger and acquisition experts conducted between January 6 and 17, the newswire said Anglo was picked 12 times as the top target.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Times said BHP was reticent to renew a takeover attempt while Anglo was undertaking a restructuring process of its own. The Australian group made an unsuccessful \u00a339bn bid last year.\n\nDespite this, Anglo was described by JP Morgan Cazenove analyst Dominic O\u2019Kane as digestible and desirable given its high quality copper production.\n\nHe said separately in an investment report that \u201cthe strategic and economic logic for a BHP-Anglo combination is robust,\u201d although Anglo\u2019s share price carries an M&A premium to his estimate of its fair valuation.\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, director of Specialist Sales at Panmure Liberum, Anglo\u2019s restructuring made it an \u201coven ready\u201d takeover target. It is just a matter of time before mining\u2019s \u201cbig guns get the check book out again,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nBroadly, M&A specialists said the mining sector was on the cusp of renewed M&A activity. News that Glencore and Rio Tinto recently discussed a combination perhaps gave evidence of this theme.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of optimism about a big M&A cycle coming, and event-driven investments are getting attention again,\u201d said Peter Germonpre, co-head of event-driven and special situations at Olivetree Financial. \u201cThere\u2019s activity in Europe to create big players.\u201d",

My first attempt was on 16th of January when the cars first came at the showroom and by 5:00 PM there were already 8-10 people who were surrounding the car like a celebrity trying to get in queue for their first test drives.\n\n- I felt having dedicated SA would make test drive manageable as typically with too many SAs who have their own prospective customers it becomes a race who gets to the seat first and claim position in test drive queue.\n\n- There were still more customers coming for test drives, so I had to wait about 30 minutes patiently before I could get an opportunity to test drive.\n\n\n\nI have nothing to do for 30 minutes and then I look back at the showroom and see Scorpio-N with steelies and 3XO with grey alloys. I decide to spend my time with those 2 while waiting for BE6 meeting. I spent those 30 minutes with a Scorpio-N Z2 and 3XO MX3 Pro display cars. Scorpio-N interiors felt airy (compared to BE6) and bigger while 3XO felt VFM in MX3 Pro avatar.\n\n\n\nThe test drive duration and track:\n\n- The test drives length is still very limited due to number of people waiting in queue.\n\n- I could drive BE6 for only 6-7 kms only.\n\n- The entire test drive track comprised of good paved road except 4 patches of about 50 meters with dug roads. I could take the car up to 100 kmph for about 30 seconds max.\n\n\n\nThe approach:\n\n- I noticed previously that both BE6 and 9E had MH registrations. This is different as dealerships typically use temp registration only for test drive cars in Hyderabad. I also see from test drive experiences shared by others that the cars in other cities are MH registered.\n\n- I approach the BE6 from front and front is one of the best looks for BE6 (different, quirky, somewhat robot like).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aero alloys look nice. Replacing 19\" alloys will cost a bomb unless there is flood of 19\" tyres in market in next 4 years and the cost of 19\" tyres goes down substantially. I don't see this happening so changing tyres will burn a big hole in my pocket.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seats were getting dirty with all the people taking test drives. The green colored fabric started to show some black muck marks in about 1.5 weeks since the BE6 came for test drive.\n\nThe previous test drive customer started groove mode (disco lights), so the SA made me look at light show from front and back. Honestly I was not interested in this light show, but I obliged as the show was already running.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe front seat experience:\n\n- I felt that floor height is more which results in lesser height inside the cabin. Spent about 30 seconds to adjust the seats to my comfort.\n\n- The view from IRVM was very limited as highlighted in the official review. I would rely on rear cam feed to look at rear traffic and window area is very small.\n\n- The fixed arm rest as with all other cars did not offer lot of place to rest by left elbow.\n\n- The first thing I notice is that the front seat sitting posture was not like an SUV where my legs are bent slightly. I felt like sitting in a sedan or sports car as I had to stretch my legs forward to reach accelerator and brake pedal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drive:\n\n- The previous SA shutdown the engine before handing over key to my SA. I tap on start/stop button (which felt like a touch button and not physical button) and car started. Just like all EVs I could not make it out if the car is started as there was no sound inside the car.\n\n- I encounter the general Mahindra bug on first startup. The driver MID screen does not come up and only infotainment screen was turned on. The infotainment screen was the only indicator to me that the car had started. I start/stop twice, but the MID refused to come up. I thought the test drive would be cancelled, as I would not risk driving on blank MID. The SA tries twice and finally the BE6 MID started. I took a sight of relief as my test drive plan would not go haywire.\n\n- I see the car in \"Race\" mode and second thing I do is switch to \"Range\" mode. I start driving and find pickup good in Range mode (coming from driving my 2.2 tonne SUV). The acceleration was smooth and I could reach 60kmph in no time. The car felt planted on curves.\n\n- I encounter first bad patch of road filled with some potholes and uneven road. At 40kmph - 50kmph the car glided over the uneven section and I did not feel too bad inside.\n\n- I leave the pedal to experience regen and braking felt too strong (like pushing brake moderately in an ICE car) and car speed reduced too fast for my comfort. This is when I see that Regen mode is set to Level-3. I work with SA to change regen mode to Level-2 (using pedal shifters). Level-2 regen mode feelt comfortable and just like other EVs I have tested recently (like Atto3, Windsor EV)\n\n- Level-1 regen felt more comfortable and natural for person like me who currently drives ICE behemoth everyday where engine braking is not too hard at speeds above 30kmph.\n\n- I did not feel comfortable to test single pedal drive after harder braking experiences with Level-3 regen mode.\n\n- I change to \"Everyday\" mode and engine felt more responsive. The acceleration is better than Range mode and I could still keep the car under control with moderate throttle inputs. Overall, Range and Everyday modes are the comfortable modes for driving BE6.\n\n- The suspension handled some more bad patches well and the car felt planted. When going slow on small dug up road section my head started wobbling and I had to control throttle speeds to remain below 10kmph.\n\n\n\nThe Race mode:\n\nThe SA kept pushing me to test \"Race\" mode. I obliged when I reach a section with no traffic and good road. The acceleration in Race mode is scary as I got push back on the seat. This reminded me of my short stint driving Ford Mustang 2014 with 227 Duratec V6 engine for 3 days about 10 years back. 240hp power and so much acceleration feels kind of scary on normal Indian roads where someone could cut or come out suddenly and join the main road at weird slow speed. I took the car upto 100kmph in Race mode and felt the rush, but I had to be too much attentive on the road which resulted in some stress for me. I change drive mode and come back to \"Everyday\" mode in less than 1.5 minutes.\n\n\n\nOverall experience summary:\n\n- To summarize, the entire drive experience of BE6 felt more like a sports car rather than a fast SUV.\n\n- The car has so much torque and power available from get go and this makes me scared as most of people don't understand how to handle so much refined engines with high power. I don't want BE6 to end up with KTM Duke where KTM drivers are unnecessarily accelerating as soon as signal turns green or dart in between the gaps, just because KTM says \"Ready to Race\".\n\n- All black interiors are okay with sunroof panel open, but when I closed the panel the interior did not feel that spacious due to small sized window and black roof liners. Pack3 is out of my reach and Pack1 without a sunroof to get more light in will be rejected by my short heighted (5' 3\" inch height) partner in life as it will feel claustrophobic for them. Will wait for Pack2 feature reveal and if Pack2 is beyond \u20b923 lakh then I will stick to ICE car for next 2 decades as this is my last car purchase for next 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nRange:\n\nRange before starting, 68% charge left and 208 km range\n\n\n\n\n\nRange after end of test drive was 66% charge left and\n\n\n\n\n\nI test drive in all 3 modes with couple of regen in between for 7 kms of my test drive. I started with 208 km range shown on MID and when I stopped I lost 2% charge but gained 8 kms range.\n\n\n\nI got opportunity to meet and experience BE6 at Landmark Mahindra Tellapur showroom in Hyderabad.- The dealership has allocated couple of SAs exclusively to deal with BEV test drives and they are coordinating with customers for test drive schedule.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Australian Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against other best Australian stocks to buy now.\n\nAccording to a report by Vanguard published on January 24, Australia\u2019s economy is expected to experience a gradual recovery in 2025, following its slowest growth in 32 years in 2024. The report forecasts an economic growth of 2% year over year by the end of 2025, with trimmed mean inflation, a core measure that excludes items at the extremes, expected to reach 2.5% year over year. However, the report notes that low productivity growth and higher unit labor costs will keep core inflation from falling sustainably to the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) 2%\u20133% target range until later in 2025.\n\nThe RBA has left its policy rate target unchanged at 4.35% since December 10, but has softened its language around future policy decisions, noting that it is \u201cgaining some confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the target.\u201d Despite this, Vanguard expects the RBA to remain patient and not initiate rate cuts until the second quarter of 2025, due to a tight labor market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024.\n\nIn an interview on January 19, Lochlan Halloway, Market Strategist at Morningstar Australia, pointed out that the premium to fair value of large-cap stocks in the Australian market is abnormally high, trading at around 20% above fair value. According to Halloway, this is a concern as 20 companies account for about 60% of the ASX 100.\n\nIn terms of value opportunities, Halloway identified the energy sector, particularly companies that are trading at significant discounts to their fair value. He also noted that small-cap companies, which were largely left behind in the market rally may offer value, although investors need to be judicious in selecting quality companies. Additionally, sectors such as consumer defensives appear close to fair value or even cheap.\n\nAs the Australian economy gradually recovers in 2025, opportunities lie in undervalued sectors such as energy and consumer defensives, as well as among small-cap companies that have yet to catch up with the broader market rally.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best Australian stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to identify Australian companies. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 22\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is a global resources company that extracts and processes commodities such as iron ore, copper, and coal. The company has a strong portfolio of assets and supplies raw materials essential for global infrastructure and energy needs to industrial manufacturers and governments.\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is actively pursuing growth opportunities in the copper market, which is expected to experience significant demand growth over the coming decades. In South Australia, BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is expanding its Olympic Dam operation, with plans to increase production to over 500,000 tons per year by the early 2030s. The company is also progressing a number of other copper projects in Chile, including the Escondida mine, where it is planning to invest in new leaching technology to increase production and extend the life of the mine. Additionally, BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) has recently announced a joint venture with Lundin Mining to develop the Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects in Argentina and Chile, which have the potential to become major new copper producers.\n\nAnother key area of growth for BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is its potash business, where the company is investing in the Jansen project in Canada. The Jansen project is a world-class potash asset that is expected to become one of the largest potash producers in the world. BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is currently constructing the first stage of the project, which is expected to produce around 4.3 million tons of potash per year. The company is also planning to expand the project in future stages, with the potential to increase production to over 16 million tons per year.\n\nOverall BHP ranks 2nd on our list of the best Australian stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of BHP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BHP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Oil and gold are the first things that come to mind when investors think about mining and exploration stocks, but the sector is far more diverse and expansive than just two commodities.\n\nCoal, natural gas, construction materials like limestone, industrial metals like copper and aluminum, and even the lithium in our batteries, all come from mining companies.\n\nHowever, mining operations consume immense amounts of time and capital expenditure, so mining companies tend to perform well during economic booms, and poorly during downturns.\n\nAs luck would have it, we have a strong economy, low inflation, and a new, business-friendly administration, all pointing to a very good year for mining stocks.\n\nHere are four stocks that are well-positioned for growth through 2025.\n\nRio Tinto Group RIO\n\nRio Tinto Group is a diversified large-cap mining company with a $100 billion market cap and operations in numerous industrial metals and materials. Based in Melbourne, RIO trades on several global stock exchanges, including the FTSE, ASX, and the NYSE.\n\nThe company was named after the original mine it purchased from the Spanish government in 1871. Over time, RIO has become the world\u2019s second-largest public mining company, focusing on iron ore, aluminum, copper/diamonds, and energy minerals (like uranium).\n\nRIO shares have a few tailwinds that could benefit investors in 2025. First, the company has been dropping unprofitable coal mining operations to improve efficiency and recently purchased Arcadium Lithium in a $6.7 billion deal to add more properties to its renewable energy portfolio (RIO is now the third largest lithium miner in the world).\n\nAdditionally, the company is said to be pursuing a merger with Glencore, which would create the largest combined mining company in the world. With demand for copper, aluminum, and lithium expected to increase as more electric infrastructure is built, RIO is set up to be a major beneficiary. The stock is a consensus Buy based on nine analysts covering the stock, and the average price target is $73, representing a 17% upside. Plus, that 7% dividend yield isn't too shabby, either.\n\n[Get a New, High-Potential Trade Every Morning]\n\nConstellium SE CSTM\n\nConstellium was part of Rio Tinto Group but was spun out in 2011 when the company sold its Alcan Engineered Products unit. Today, Constellium is a major manufacturer of aluminum and various related alloys with plants in North America, Asia, and Europe. Constellium is headquartered in Paris and employs over 12,000 full-time workers.\n\nCompared to its former parent company, Constellium is small. The company has a mere $1.5 billion market cap and posted $1.6 billion in revenue last quarter, but it has a high-profile list of clients in the aerospace and automotive industries, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Boeing, and Airbus.\n\nAccording to analyst reports, the stock is a consensus Buy with an average price target over $20, which would be nearly double the current market price. The company recently announced it's moving to US-based accounting principles (like filing 10K reports with the SEC), which could hint at potential expansion into new US markets. With defense spending expected to increase over the next decade, companies manufacturing lightweight and innovative aluminum products stand to reap the rewards.\n\nAlcoa Corp. AA\n\nAlcoa Corp. used to be a staple amongst Jim Cramer's most essential earnings calls and guidance reports. Still, the long-time aluminum producer has seen its market cap shrink from nearly $17 billion to just over $10 billion in the last three years.\n\nYear-over-year revenue growth declined for seven consecutive quarters starting in Q3 2022, and 2023 full-year gross profit was a disappointing $738 million (down from $2.2 billion in 2022). However, the last two quarterly reports have shown that revenue is growing again, and the stock is positioned fundamentally and technically for a turnaround.\n\nAlcoa primarily produces aluminum and bauxite and operates in 10 countries, including the United States, Australia, Iceland, and several Caribbean nations. At its peak in the bull market in 2022, the stock traded near the $90 range.\n\nToday, it sits around $40 and only has a Hold rating and a $43 price target based on 15 analyst reports. However, revenue growth has returned, and the stock's 200-day moving average could act as a support level for a continuing uptrend.\n\nBHP Group BHP\n\nBHP is the world's largest mining company, with a market cap of over $125 billion and operations in materials like iron core, copper, zinc, gold, silver, uranium, and more. The company is based in Australia but has mines worldwide, including domestic operations in Queensland and Western Australia, plus international extraction sites in Canada, Brazil, and Chile.\n\nBHP's copper operations are expected to be a main profit driver over the next few decades as the material is required for EV batteries, data center grids, and other electrification projects. The company expects copper demand to increase by 70% by 2050, and recent output from the Escondida mine in Chile has significantly boosted BHP's production.\n\nAdditionally, the company has found another profit driver: potash! BHP has become one of the largest potash producers, a water-soluble potassium mineral commonly used in fertilizer. Based on coverage from eight different analysts, BHP shares are currently a consensus Buy, with an average price target of $67 (indicating a potential 34% upside from the current market price).\n\nThe valuation looks cheap with a 16.1 P/E ratio, and the stock also pays a hefty 5.8% dividend yield. BHP is also a serial M/A participant, and that type of business is expected to pick up under a merger-friendly Trump administration.\n\nSimplify your strategy with a daily, carefully curated stock pick designed for profit potential, complete with expert analysis and actionable insights.

            "content": "BHP's CEO Sees No 'Must Do' Transactions, Abandons Anglo American For Now\n\nGlobal mining leader BHP (NYSE:BHP) has temporarily abandoned its pursuit of Anglo American (OTC:AAUKF), one of the largest M&A attempts in 2024.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that the Australian miner now views a deal as \"too expensive,\" given Anglo's share price surge in recent months \u2013 as London-listed company shares rose 26% in the last 12 months, owing to restructuring efforts and favorable investor sentiment.\n\nBHP's $49 billion bid targeted Anglo's copper assets, particularly its stakes in the Collahuasi mine in Chile and the Quellaveco mine in Peru. These sites rank among the world's most significant copper reserves, with Collahuasi containing 3.93 billion tons of ore at 0.66% copper and Quellaveco holding 1.1 billion tons at 0.55% copper.\n\nAnglo American responded with a swift restructuring, selling its Australian coal assets for $3.8 billion, spinning off its South African platinum operations, and working on Brazilian nickel asset divestments.\n\n\"If BHP were bidding what they thought was fair value, it is difficult to see why they would bid more now,\" remarked George Cheveley, fund manager at Ninety One.\n\nBHP's interest in Anglo American stems from the rising demand for copper, a critical metal in the energy transition and digital infrastructure. The miner has projected that copper demand will increase sixfold by 2050, driven by electrification trends and the explosive growth of data centers. Data centers, in particular, are emerging as significant copper consumers, requiring the metal for power networks, cooling systems, and circuit boards.\n\nAn internal analysis estimated that the copper used for data centers will grow from 500,000 tons annually to 3 million tons by 2050.\n\n\"Digital demand,\" as BHP describes it, includes copper use in data center construction, electricity generation, and power delivery infrastructure. The miner also anticipates global electricity consumption by data centers will rise from 2% of total electricity demand today to 9% by mid-century.\n\nDespite not acquiring Anglo's copper assets, BHP still expanded its copper operation. Earlier this month, the company completed a $3 billion joint acquisition of the Filo del Sol project in Argentina with Lundin Mining. The project in the Vicu\u00f1a district holds a probable estimate of 2,22 million pounds of copper, 2,86 million ounces of gold, and 133,33 million ounces of silver.\n\nStill, regardless of the firm's optimism about the metal, CEO Mike Henry has set tight criteria for further deals, clarifying that they have to create value and align with the company's long-term goals.",

            "content": "BHPian fhdowntheline recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nYesterday I encountered a most unusual and as yet undiagnosed issue in my Hyundai Verna DCT. I took my family to a restaurant in a popular high-street area in Balewadi, Pune in the afternoon. Lunch over, I walked back to the car and tried to start it with the push button. The car simply did not start, try as I might for a few times.\n\nRemoved the \"smart key\", placed it next to the stop-start, near it around it, everywhere. It simply could not detect the key.\n\nThe horn was working, the car was getting into ACC mode, and everything seemed ok. Then finally, dispatched the rest of my family through Uber, called RSA and then after an hour, a person appeared from the battery service.\n\nHe tried all sorts of jugaad, opening the battery terminal (to reset). He also asked me to try out the Bluelink start. Mind you, I have only recently changed my phone and had simply cloned over the app, never re-registered the car. So I went through that rigmarole and then tried to remote start from Bluelink. Nothing worked. The battery person was completely flabbergasted and said it was the first time that a battery reset had not worked. So towards the evening, we requested the Flatbed truck.\n\nWhen the Flatbed guy arrived, he too started tinkering with the battery etc. But he was on a call with some technician, who had the notion that the car was \"hung\" or \"stuck\" in some Bluelink-related issue. So he again reset the battery, and we waited for some time, and then by around 6 pm or so (after an ordeal of 4 hours) I again sent a Bluelink command for remote start. And this time, the car started as if nothing had ever happened.\n\nNot wanting to take chances, however, I took the car to the nearest service centre (Garve). Those folks were quite courteous, including the relationship person from whom I had purchased the car. Explained to the Service manager about this issue, and they too seemed to be a bit perplexed, but have promised that they will scan and resolve any potential issue.\n\nAt this point:\n\nI thought the SmartKey battery was bad- doesn't seem so.\n\nStarter motor issue- doesn't seem so.\n\nCar battery issue- doesn't seem so- the car is just 1 year old and is regularly used.\n\nBut one thing both the RSA guy and the Service Manager agreed- today's cars are sophisticated in technology, and therefore come with such potential pitfalls.\n\nThere are also a lot of What-Ifs - What if the car had failed to start when we were on our trip to Wai, say at a highway-side restaurant? With aged parents, it would have been a huge hassle to arrange for alternatives etc. Or at some remote location without nearby RSA access.\n\nWill update you all with the outcome. But, it is a good idea to pause and think of just how much unnecessary tech is coming into our lives (remote start, smart key, ICE etc.)\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "BHP's Acquisition Pursuit of Anglo American Stalls Amid Strategic Realignments\n\nThe global mining sector is closely watching the unfolding dynamics between industry giants BHP and Anglo American. According to a report by the Financial Times, BHP has temporarily shelved its unsolicited bid to acquire Anglo American due to rising acquisition costs and divergent share price performances. This potential merger, valued at approximately $160 billion, promises to reshape the copper production landscape significantly.\n\nAnglo American, which initially resisted BHP's overtures, has been strategically reshaping its portfolio to align with BHP's vision. The London-headquartered company is divesting its non-copper assets, including operations in Southern African diamonds and platinum, Australian coal, and Brazilian nickel, to focus on copper, which is set to make up 60% of its portfolio. Combined with BHP, they could produce an impressive 1.9 million tonnes of copper on an equity basis annually.\n\nOn a broader scale, global copper trade dynamics reveal interesting trends. According to recent data from the IndexBox platform, Chile led the pack in copper exportation in 2024 with a market value of $14.6 billion, followed closely by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at $12.1 billion. Notably, the DRC continues to be a predominant source of additional copper, expected to contribute over 200,000 tonnes to global production in 2025. Meanwhile, on the import side, China dominates with a staggering $39.2 billion worth of copper imports in 2024, highlighting its immense industrial demand.\n\nAs industry titans like Glencore, Rio Tinto, and BHP vie for strategic dominance, the future of copper production and distribution remains dynamic. The potential consolidation of key players would mean that a mere two companies could control up to 16% of global copper production, underscoring the significant impact these mergers could have on the world's copper supply chain.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "BHPian Jeroen recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI am not sure if the Citroen 2CV was ever sold in India. I doubt it somehow, as this was one of the early cheap cars for the masses in Western Europe.\n\nHowever, most petrolheads would be familiar with this little iconic car. To date, it still has a substantial hard core of devotees. It is also a car that brings a smile to people's faces. It is the least macho-threatening car on the road. Many Western folks of my age will have owned one or at least driven one. It has featured in many movies, the most prominent being the James Bond movie \"For Your Eyes Only.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen that movie, have at least a look at the 2CV chase scene! It shows the 2CV's incredible corner handling.\n\nThe 2CV used in the movie is a 2CV6 but with the engine of a Citroen GS. These cars were not known for being fast. More about this and the 007 version later.\n\nSome information on the 2CV, stolen from various internet sources:\n\nThe Citro\u00ebn 2CV (French: deux chevaux, pronounced [d\u00f8 \u0283(\u0259)vo], lit. \"two horses\", meaning \"two taxable horsepower\") is an economy car produced by the French company Citro\u00ebn from 1948 to 1990. Introduced at the 1948 Paris Salon de l'Automobile, it has an air-cooled engine that is mounted in the front and drives the front wheels. Conceived by Citro\u00ebn Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise the large number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and straightforward, utilitarian bodywork. The 2CV featured an overall low cost of ownership, simplicity of maintenance, an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering 6.6 kW, 9 hp), and minimal fuel consumption. In addition, it had been designed to cross a freshly ploughed field with a basket full of eggs on the passenger's seat without breaking them, because of the great lack of paved roads in France at the time; with a long-travel suspension system, that connects front and rear wheels, giving a very soft ride. Often called \"an umbrella on wheels\", the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads, and until 1955 even stretched to cover the car's trunk, reaching almost down to the car's rear bumper. Michelin introduced and first commercialised the revolutionary new radial tyre design with the introduction of the 2CV. Between 1948 and 1990, more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, making it the world's first front-wheel drive car to become a million-seller after Citro\u00ebn's own earlier model, the more upmarket Traction Avant, which had become the first front-wheel drive car to sell in similar six-figure numbers. The 2CV platform spawned many variants; the 2CV and its variants are collectively known as the A-Series. Notably, these include the 2CV-based delivery vans known as fourgonnettes, the Ami, the Dyane, the Acadiane, and the Mehari. In total, Citro\u00ebn manufactured over 9 million of the 2CVs and its derivative models. A 1953 technical review in Autocar described \"the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford\". In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a \"car like no other\". The motoring writer L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as \"the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car\", and a car of \"remorseless rationality\".\n\nI owned a 2CV at some point. I think it was the 3rd or 4th car I ever owned. It did not last very long, as it was so rotten when braking that the doors flew open due to the flexing of the chassis! A common problem with older 2CVs.\n\nMany countries have their own pet name. In the Netherlands, it is eend (duck), and in Belgium geit (goat). In the UK it is known by at least three different pet names; Tin Snail, Dolly and Upside-down.\n\nAs luck would have it, there is a Citroen 2CV museum in Andijk, the Netherlands. Just around the corner from my good friend and spanner mate Peter. Those of you who follow some of my threads will have read about us and our Spideristi friends doing at least one annual Alfa Spider trip together. As luck would have it, all of us happened to be around on the last Sunday of the year. This museum opens only on the last Sunday of every month. So we decided to meet up at the museum and have lunch afterwards at Peter's place.\n\nThis museum is the private collection of Edwin Groen. His collection consists of more than 300 Eenden and also quite a few other interesting mostly French cars. I have concentrated on the 2CVs for this thread.\n\nIt is really a unique collection as you will see! This is the first view as you enter the museum.\n\nThen there are endless rows of 2CVs. Each with a unique story. Each different from the other.\n\nIt doesn't get much more basic, dashboard, than a 2CV\n\nThis is a special James Bond 007 version! It is a 2CV6. Citroen provided four 2CVs for the movie. In order to capitalize even more on this PR they produced this special 007 version. It is unclear how many were produced. Different sources mention different numbers. Most likely either 500 or 1000.\n\nThe colour yellow was originally meant to be used for the new Charleston version, but ended up on the 007 version. New owners would find a little plastic bag with bullet hole stickers in the glove compartment!\n\nThis one is known as the compact version\n\nA couple of images of the engine and gearbox. Everything on this engine was simple and basic. Easy to work on and by and large very reliable.\n\nHere is another pretty unique 2CV. The 4x4, but it also had two engines. notice the extra petrol tanks under the front seat with the filler gap that protrudes through the door. I think I have come across 2-3 of these in the last ten years of visiting classic car events and show. This museum has four of them!\n\nWhere else would you find the oldest surviving 2CV in the world, other than in a museum in Andijk? This one was produced in 1949. It is the 430th 2CV produced in the factory in France. The paint and interior was probably renewed in the 50s/60s but the engine and gearbox are still original.\n\nFrom that first production run of about 875 2CVs in 1949 about 12 have survived. Few in driveable conditions.\n\nThe museum acquired this unique 2CV at a French auction. They ended in a bidding war with no other than Michelin, but won!\n\nThis is a 2CV6 Club from 1987. I had one like this, in the same colour. It was the first 2CV suitable for lead-free petrol. It had an astonishing acceleration of 59.4 seconds on the 0-100 km/h!!\n\nI remember when these cars were banned from using on your driving test. These cars were so slow the examiner could not get a feel for whether you could keep up with traffic.\n\nEndless varieties\n\nGuys my age will remember this one. And their dads too. The ANWB is what the AA is in the UK. A national car association that also provides breakdown services for its members. we call it the \"wegenwacht\" (road watchers)\n\nThese days they drive fancy E-vans. But for a long time, they drove these 2CVs.\n\nI remember it well. In those days my parents drove a DKW-1100. One year we went on holiday. Which meant my three sisters got in the back seat and I would sit in the front on my mum's lap. No seat belts, no airbags, no crumple zone and both my parents chain smoking. My dad had a roof rack that held most of our luggage. But he had not secured it well enough. So it blew off, somewhere near Arnhem on our way to Germany. A \"wegenwacht in one of these 2CVs came to the rescue. He managed to pile some of the luggage in his car. But those little cars were pretty much crammed with tools and parts. So some of the luggage went on top of my sisters. Next he drove us to a shop that sold us a new roof rack. He helped my dad install the new roof rack securely.\n\nThese wegenwacht guys are incredibly skilled in helping you out when you find yourself stranded. They know just about all brands and models of cars and have a quick fix for just about any problem.\n\nOf course, 2CVs are pretty much indestructible and reliable in normal use. But they never did well in a crash. Or like this one, a tree fell onto it. Made several newspapers!\n\nThe museum has a couple of these little alleys with shops from the 60-70s. Very nice. Including a nice collection of car models\n\nContinue reading about Jeroen's visit to the museum for BHPian comments, insights and more information.",

At the time of BHP\u2019s initial bid, Anglo was trading at about \u00a321 ($26), and now, its stock has risen above \u00a325 ($31).\n\nThe increase in value coincides with the British miner\u2019s proposed restructuring of its mining business, which includes the sale of its coal, diamond and platinum assets, after it fought off BHP\u2019s takeover attempt. The coal assets were successfully sold first in a $3.8 billion deal with Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) in November.\n\nOn BHP\u2019s side, chairman Ken MacKenzie previously stated at its annual meeting that his company had \u201cmoved on\u201d from a deal that \u201ccame within the window of opportunity\u201d and \u201cmade sense\u201d for the mining business. BHP later clarified those comments to say that it does not mean another bid won\u2019t be presented within UK laws.\n\nAny deal, whether for Anglo or another company, would only happen at the right price for BHP, company executives have said.\n\nCEO Mike Henry previously stated that it will remain \u201cdisciplined\u201d when considering acquisitions, and that mergers and acquisitions are \u201conly one growth option\u201d for the world\u2019s largest miner.\n\nAfter walking away from the Anglo deal last year, the company teamed up with Canada\u2019s Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN) in a joint $3 billion bid for copper explorer Filo Corp (TSX: FIL).",

            "content": "mobike008 Senior - BHPian\n\n\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2006 Location: Seattle, WA Posts: 11,933 Thanked: 16,574 Times\n\nView My Garage\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-New 2025 BMW X3 M50 Review | Initial Driving Impressions\n\n\n\nLast week I went back as I had forgotten by X3 M40i registration papers in the BMW IX M60 that I got as a loaner. For folks, who missed checking out my brief impression of the BMW IX M60, here is the link :\n\n\n\nhttps://www.team-bhp.com/forum/elect...ml#post5905274 (BMW IX M60 in Seattle, Washington - Brief Driving Impression)\n\n\n\nI asked them if the X3 M50 was available for a TD, they said yes so I crossed the street to the sales department and got myself into a X3 M50 for a test drive\n\n\n\nThe sales advisor was a nice Asian guy who decided to jump into the car along with me for the test drive. I did request him for a \u201clongish\u201d test drive so we did a loop of about 15 miles one-way. So, a total of about 30-miles which is long enough to get a decent impression.\n\n\n\nHe guided me through the route which included straight freeways including a 1.5 miles section of drive on the \u201cLongest Floating Bridge in the world\u201d which is located in Seattle, Washington.\n\n\n\nHe also ensured to include winding freeways, tunnels and winding roads of Mercer Island so I get a fair idea of it\u2019s handling\n\n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n\n\n- New Design Language is hate it or love it. It looks better in person that in pictures\n\n- Interior Space and Cargo space is increased\n\n- It looks long in the tooth due to the increased wheel base\n\n- ID9 is snappy and looks great on the new curved display\n\n- New Steering Wheel feels superb to hold and just loved the new paddle shifters and is apparent it's borrowed from M cars\n\n- Seats are more bolstered and feels softer/cushier than previous generation\n\n\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t\n\n\n\n- The exhaust note of previous generation missing. B58 note has been reducing each year since the loudest in 2018. In M50, it\u2019s the subtlest ever.\n\n- Exhaust note sounds fake with sound piping through the speakers\n\n- Interiors are glossy plastic, all around so will be a dust magnet- Does not look rich and classy. It looks funky\n\n- Moonroof does not open anymore- What a bummer\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior & Exterior Looks\n\n\n\nWell, there are fans of the new BMW design and then there are tons of folks who hate it. But, we all have to understand this design is not going anywhere. Gone is the clean beautiful lines of BMW and now this garish, modern design has been infused into their entire line-up.\n\n\n\nWhat I can safely say is that this new modern design is not \u201cphotogenic\u201d so they will always look absolutely terrible in pictures. But, when you see the new BMW in person, they aren\u2019t too bad looking. And, as they say designs always grow on you.\n\n\n\nX3 side profile looks pleasing, front looks garish and ugly but, the best angle is its rear with quad pipes re-introduced in the X3 M50.\n\n\n\nInterior design language is also same for all newer models in BMW. Increased usage of plastic, bright accent colors, large curved displays. When asked, The sales advisor was commenting that lot of women customers love the new X3's newer design and BMW probably is trying to attract this new segment. Might be partly true, but the interiors look bright and flashy. Some may like it and some may not. But, that\u2019s what the new BMW\u2019s are evolving into. Sad but, true.\n\n\n\nEngine and Performance\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get down to the meat of the matter. The minute you take off in Sports mode, you know it\u2019s the same B58 engine and has the same urgency like its predecessors. However, what you will immediately notice is much lower sound of the exhaust, It kept getting muffled each new iteration thanks to emissions regulations and OPF sound deadeners. A BHPian friend here in Seattle has an exact same X3 M40i as mine including the color which is 2018 model and his is the loudest exhaust I ever heard on an X3 M40i and mine is second loudest. We did a rev battle in one of our meets (Had a 2022 LCI X3 M40i as well in that battle) back in the day so I know for sure.\n\n\n\nFrom 2022 onwards (LCI with Hybrid) the exhaust sound kept reducing. In my opinion, 50% of excitement of driving a B58 engine is tied to it's glorious exhaust sound.\n\n\n\nAnother big miss is the pops, crackle and bangs that was very prominent in the older models.\n\n\n\nUnder the hood of the X3 M50 is the same deliciously potent BMW\u2019s 3.0-liter B58 In-line 6 which is now in its 3rd iteration (TU3)- Mine is TU2. Paired with the same 48-volt hybrid system that was introduced in the LCI models of X3 M40i in 2022.\n\n\n\nX3 M50 now makes 393 horsepower (11 horsepower more than mine) and 428 lb-ft of torque, which is a slight bump to the power figures. In real life, this bump is not really felt. Maybe the longer you spend time with it then it can become evident.\n\n\n\nAnother disappointing aspect, now there is no SPORTS + ( Like the newer BMW\u2019s they have done away with SPORTS + mode in many models) and only has one setting which is SPORTS. In the previous generation X3 M40i\u2019s. There is a significant difference in Sports and Sport + as the gear changes happen at higher RPM\u2019s in the Sports +. Not sure if SPORTS mode matches the same rev range. I drove the car mostly in manual mode using the paddle shifters and dropped gears when in tunnel to extract the sound from the B58 but, nope it wasn't loud at all.\n\n\n\nIn my car, when in Sports +, the car feels like it\u2019s on steroids and is lunging forward and becomes like a horse kept on leash. It\u2019s challenging to drive slow as it demands to be in high speed mode with the drama of increased sound of pops and crackles that makes you feel like a \u201cboy racer\u201d\u2026lol.\n\n\n\nThis feeling is just not there in M50. Power delivery is now more smooth and linear.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, they have taken a wild horse and made it into a professional racing horse meaning it now feels more sorted, smooth and silky. It most certainly lost some of its character and soul in this iteration.\n\n\n\nSteering & Handling\n\n\n\nX3 M50 gotten lot of improvements right from the steering rack to improved adaptive dampers.\n\n\n\nI absolutely love this new steering design which is flat bottom and now it comes with beautiful M-stitching. It feels great to hold and premium too compared to previous versions. However, the steering has play (mine feels super tight even in comfort mode) so there is a little bit of give and take here but, when it gets into motion the heaviness comes back especially in Sports mode.\n\n\n\nHandling felt similar and is as nimble, agile and quick to respond to steering inputs as before.\n\n\n\nRide definitely feels like an upgrade as the slight imperfections on the road like joints etc didn't feel too jarring. Previous generation BMW X3 M40i does feel little harsher in comparison, especially when in Sports + mode.\n\n\n\nNVH\n\n\n\nX3 M40i was always good on NVH and the cabin felt solid and silent. But, BMW took this to next level. It now feels even more silent which is a great thing.\n\n\n\nSunroof\n\n\n\nWe live in PNW where sun is a rare commodity and whenever it\u2019s sunny, we drive with the blinds of moon roof open OR, with partial roof open (especially in the mountains). In the M50, it\u2019s now a just a permanently closed moonroof and does not open which is disappointing. Maybe they took the cue from Tesla-What a shame.\n\n\n\nAnother big miss is the ambient lighting does not extend to rear seats.\n\n\n\nHarman Kardon music system sounds lot cleaner and punchier in this car compared to mine which isn\u2019t anything to talk about.\n\n\n\nThere is clearly signs of some bit of cost cutting like sunroof, missing ambient lights, lot of plastic on dashboard and especially the center console which is super glossy and is going to be a dust magnet. This area is the most used by us (from my experience of driving for last 4 years) and imagine leaving fingerprints, dust accumulation each time you drive the car is painful to maintain.\n\n\n\nPricing : With all these upgrades, BMW has increased the price by roughly $6k-$7K which as a standalone is totally fair. But, when you look at the pricing from a holistic view. A fully loaded BMW X3 M50 would now cost around $74-$75K ($82K on road with 12% tax in Seattle). Come on, 80 grand for a X3 M50 most definitely not worth it. I would think of getting this as a pre-owned maybe 2-3 years down the line when it can be had for $50K or less and, by that time hopefully my excitement with the X3 M40i would die down...lol!!\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts :\n\n\n\nI seriously went with a thought of upgrading to an X3 M50 as I have some equity in my X3 M40i and I could have swapped to this one for the same amount. But, I have to confess that when I drive a car, I look for excitement. We spend a lot of time behind a wheel here and I\u2019m particular that apart from the other things a car do- Carry People, Luggage, etc., it should be fun to drive. If a car does not excite me, I don\u2019t turn back and look at it again.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, It didn\u2019t give me the same feeling when I test drove the X3 M40i at BMW Tully in New Hampshire on Jan 1st, 2021 and bought the car in 15-days flat without even being in the market for a new car.\n\n\n\nBMW X3 M50 is an upgrade from the following aspects- Complete redesign of interiors, exteriors, suspension and steering rack and have increased the base price to almost 10 grand. Like I said before, it\u2019s now become a more polished and sorted car with a funky design which may excite some but, it did not excite me.\n\n\n\nCheers and Thanks for reading !!\n\n\n\nSide profile of the X3 M50 is quite pleasing to the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX3 M is discontinued but, they took its best part out- Quad Pipes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear Quarter Angle- Not too pleasing to the eye, IMO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely new steering wheel with the M stripe and stitchings too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX3 gets the new BMW design and futuristic curved display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever been a fan of black interiors. Looks drab and old even in a new car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like \" Rangoli Colors\"....Haha!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo in your face side panel design. Now you can use sliders to turn the AC vents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter Console- Looks cheap. Now all modes also got touch screened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice sticking on the wheel and those paddles look really cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaddle Shifters borrowed from M cars. Well, Ali Express has tonnes of such options for us lesser mortals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPic taken by the sales advisor during the drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving on the longest floating bridge in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike all new BMW's. HUD is bright, colorful and high definition (much higher)\n\n\n\nI had visited BMW Seattle recently for my car\u2019s brake pads and rotors replacement and then had asked for a test drive of the X3 M50. Unfortunately, that day it was not available so I told them that I will come back on some weekend to TD the new X3 M50.Last week I went back as I had forgotten by X3 M40i registration papers in the BMW IX M60 that I got as a loaner.

            "content": "audioholic Distinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2012 Location: BengaLuru Posts: 5,904 Thanked: 20,997 Times\n\nRe: Maha Kumbh 2025 - Parking and Gate/Ghat queries Finished this mission with a rather positive experience, but conditions apply:\n\nLike I explained earlier, we flew BLR-LKO on Thursday 24th Jan, stayed overnight in Lucknow. 24th Morning we took a cab from Lucknow and went to the Kumbh. Did the needful there and returned yesterday to Bengaluru. The details will follow but a brief summary:\n\n\n\nPositives: Absolutely clean surroundings, clean water everywhere. Very much unlike my expectation. In spite of all the people, there is no debris in the water.\n\nTemporary setup of many large chain outlets like Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Chai Point, Chaayos, etc offers clean food with not too much crowd. Apart from this even the economy options are very clean and hygienic\n\nElaborate checks done for food safety randomly so none of these outlets skimp on quality\n\nPlenty of rest rooms and temporary toilets everywhere, like thousands which are regularly cleaned and refilled.\n\nMassive scale of arrangements everywhere and unbelieveable efforts put together to create all the temporary infrastructure\n\nTemporary infra includes not only tents, but a network of roads, bridges, food courts and what not\n\nTent facilities are very much upto the mark in the luxury tent area called tent city. Not sure about the other places. Very good food within the tent campus, access to a clean river bank etc\n\nNegatives: Traffic management is horrible. All the network of parallel roads created goes for a toss when the police dont know how to divert people\n\nTraffic jams can be massive and there is no guarantee of time to move from the closest of places. So if you are on a tight schedule, better not keep expectations high\n\nTent city itself is unmanageable to walk around due to its massive area for elders. E-rickshaws cant get to this area due to the slope and only if cabs are allowed here, its a good choice else avoid at any cost\n\nRoad diversions can change dynamically, so the road you take now can be blocked in an hour and the entire plan can go for a toss. This is the biggest issue in the entire arrangement\n\nLack of guidance or any signboards etc to guide people on which is the best route to take to reach the destination. All signboards are only indicating the direction to the sangam, where the traffic jams are\n\n\n\nGetting there:\n\nThe journey from Lucknow to Prayagraj outskirts was rather smooth and we made it there in good time, but from there it became hell. The diversions are not planned well and depends on the mood of the police manning that post. Hence we were diverted near the bypass to a temporary road that has been built to cross the Ganga river. While we crossed that, this road had no further directions and our driver was also unaware of what to do. We followed the road for a while and then the driver decides to take a turn and a little ahead, we land right in the heart of Prayagraj, with endless traffic jams. Once we were here, the ETA to our tent shot up and up.\n\nSome of the temporary roads that have been set up:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a two hour battle inside city, we were able to cross Naini Bridge and get to the south of the city to sector 25 without too much of trouble. While we were estimated to reach our stay by 2PM, we reached at 430PM.\n\n\n\nStay:\n\nWe had booked tents with Aagman India which is located in the tent city area with many other tent providers all in one place. This is in sector 25 situated alongside other providers like Kumbh Village, UPSTDC etc. We only got the deluxe tent since the booking was in short notice but the tent itself was pretty good. This package offers full board meals and costed around 16k for a tent for two people. While the tent was clean and food was very good, they lack basic organisational skills and there was lot of chaos for check in, lot of people arriving there who were being told they were overbooked and what not. Definitely not what to expect after shelling out lot of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo stay away from this organisation and its arrangement at the Mahakumbh. We were lucky we didnt face this issue but still had teething trouble because the room allocated to us was not prepared even at 5PM while the check in time was 2PM onwards. They blame it on people who delay their checkout, which is actually before 12PM. It was a bunch of blame game with lot of people getting into loud arguments and the owners sitting in a corner in front of their screens counting money, while the newbies at the check in had no clue how to manage the bookings.\n\n\n\nThe other disadvantage of these tents is that since they are located on the river bank, the e Rickshaws dont make it there and you will end up having to walk a long distance to catch them. While getting to the tent was possible in our cab, going around was not easy and food is limited to what they serve you in the buffet three times a day. If you miss it, there is no ala carte option and going out and fetching food is difficult.\n\n\n\nGetting around:\n\nOnce we realised our location and its limitations it was already past 5PM and we were told that the boats that take people to the sangam point would stop and it wasnt possible to do anything at that time. Hence after being pretty overwhelmed with the entire mela, first thing to do was to get some food since we missed our lunch. Had to walk a pretty long distance to reach a Chai Point outlet and had something to eat and drink. Then we started figuring out options to go boating the next day, and asked around. The rickshaw guys were asking us to go to Sangam Ghat and they would take us early in the morning. They were trying to pull a fast one on us because the one closer to us was Arail Ghat and they would charge a lot of money to take us to Sangam. And this also meant a lot of extra time going there and returning.\n\n\n\nAfter getting confused by too many advises, hitting language barriers, going blank due to food starvation, we hit the SOS button by contacting a person whom we knew. He took matter into his hands and arranged an official vehicle with a local person who knew his stuff. He took us on a tour of the Akhadas which was just massive and we retired for the night after that.\n\n\n\nTaking the plunge:\n\nNext morning at 6AM, from our tent we headed to Arail Ghat which was just 3kms away. They arranged a boat for us five, which would take us to the point of the Sangam. This was pretty smooth and was a 20 min journey, followed by which they would dock onto a stationary boat. Here, we could get into the water and take a dip and spend time. We only did what was necessary, and quickly returned to our boat. The ladies had limited changing options(just a cloth curtain room) while there are elaborate facilities on the river banks. Followed by this was a 30 min return journey and we were back on the river bank at 815. By then the crowd at the river bank had built up and were waiting for boats. We rushed back to our tent but again were blocked on the way due to UP CMs visit to Arail Ghat. This took some time and we were back in our tent by 930 before the breakfast closed.\n\n\n\nWe did not go towards the other side, ie Sangam Ghat or the Hanuman temple etc where more crowd and action was, due to lack of time. One full day would be ideal to be reserved for this activity, and half a day for the dip. That would be a better idea than ours since we had less than 16hrs in Prayagraj.\n\n\n\nGetting back:\n\nAfter a good breakfast, came to our tents to take shower and got ready by 1030 to start our return journey home. However again got stuck in traffic and lot of stationary time. Our return flight was at 1950hrs from Lucknow and at a certain point of time Google maps was showing our ETA at 1900hrs. Then the driver literally decided to go an extra mile or few, drove south towards a town called Sirsa, where he learnt there was a pontoon bridge across the Ganga. After crossing this bridge, we travelled another 9kms to reach the Bypass road. After this the pace improved even though we were still in the outskirts of Prayagraj at 2PM. Finally he made it to Lucknow airport at 6PM, quite some time ahead of our flight including a stop for lunch.\n\n\n\nThis sounded like a bad idea, but then at the airport we met some other groups which had left Prayagraj areas at 8AM and still reached at the same time as us, and many missed their flights.\n\n\n\nSad part was, while many places had barricades put up, not one policeman tried to guide people to their destinations. If this was done better, it would have really made the event flawless. In the coming days I expect this situation to get worse unfortunately.\n\n\n\nTemporary toilets like these are all over the place, right from the bypass:\n\n\n\n\n\nPontoon bridges which are selectively allowed to be accessed:\n\n\n\n\n\nA map I found to be useful to get a hang of the entire place:\n\n\n\n\n\nMassive crowds at the sangam point where boats dock:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe built up crowd as we returned at 8 AM:\n\nLike I explained earlier, we flew BLR-LKO on Thursday 24th Jan, stayed overnight in Lucknow. 24th Morning we took a cab from Lucknow and went to the Kumbh.

This year, Tata Motors is said to be planning to roll out the next-generation Nexon.ev.\n\nThe next-gen Tata Nexon.ev could be launched in India by Diwali 2025. The EV is expected to get new features and battery options.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Nexon.ev will be based on Tata\u2019s Acti.ev platform and could be offered with two battery options: a 45 kWh and a larger 55 kWh unit. The former delivers a range of 489 km on a single charge, while the 55 kWh battery, which powers the Curvv.ev, offers a range of 585 km.\n\nCurrently, the entry-level Nexon.ev comes with a 30 kWh battery pack. Whether it will continue to be on sale remains to be seen.\n\nTata is said to be upgrading the Nexon.ev on the lines of the new Curvv. It is likely to get smart door handles, a hands-free boot lid, and a more refined interior with features such as dual 12.3-inch screens, 6 airbags, ADAS, and a \u2018summon\u2019 function.\n\nThanks to the Team-BHP fan (he prefers to remain anonymous) who sent this information in.

            "content": "Some experts say the recently improved iron ore price will help keep dividends strong.\n\nWhat is the dividend outlook for ASX 200 mining shares?\n\nYou\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nAnalysts say ASX 200 mining shares may pay better dividends than previously expected in 2025 given the strengthened iron ore price this month.\n\nThe iron ore CNY price rose by about 7% over the past two weeks to $US110.30 per tonne on Friday.\n\nThe 62% iron ore price also lifted by 3.7% to US$101.40 per tonne on Friday.\n\nTrade data from China buoyed the commodity. The data indicated that existing stimulus measures were already working to raise steel demand.\n\nTrading Economics analysts said iron ore prices were generally still volatile as the world waits to see if US President Donald Trump will implement a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nThe analysts said:\n\nDespite these concerns, investors remain optimistic that China will fulfill its promises of additional stimulus, with state media reporting that the People's Bank of China may cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks later this month. On a positive note, recent data showed that China's annual imports of iron ore reached a record high of 1.24 billion tons last year. Additionally, the country's steel shipments hit their highest level since 2015, totaling 110.7 million tons.\n\nWhat do the brokers think?\n\nDr Peter Gardner from Plato Asset Management is expecting a \"decent dividend\" from BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO), and Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG) shares this year.\n\nAs reported in the Australian Financial Review (AFR), Dr Gardner said:\n\n[Fortescue] look like they're reducing their investments for Fortescue Future Industries, which is the clean energy part of their business. That should be positive for the dividends going forward.\n\nAaron Binsted, portfolio manager of Lazard's Australian equity income fund, is hoping for \"better mining dividends\" if the iron ore price remains above $US100 per tonne.\n\nBinsted said he was confident the mining giants would pay decent dividends even with \"a bit more pressure\" on the commodity's value.\n\nHow much will the ASX 200 mining shares pay in dividends?\n\nLet's take a look at the 2025 dividend forecasts for the major ASX 200 mining shares.\n\nThese predictions reflect consensus expectations among analysts on the CommSec trading platform.\n\nWe also compare these forecasts to the trailing dividend yields. These are the 2024 dividends paid by the miners expressed as a percentage of their share prices today.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we are focusing on ASX 200 large-cap mining shares.\n\nASX 200 mining share 2024 dividend Trailing yield Forecast 2025\n\n\n\ndividend Forecast yield Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG) $2.005 10.7% $1.128 6% Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO) $6.36 5.4% $5.489 4.7% BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) 2.204 5.6% $1.726 4.4% South32 Ltd (ASX: S32) 5.3 cents 1.5% 5.6 cents 1.6% Northern Star Resources Ltd\n\n\n\n(ASX: NST) 40 cents 2.3% 47.5 cents 2.8% Evolution Mining Ltd (ASX: EVN) 7 cents 1.3% 11.2 cents 2% Source: CommSec. Dividend yields calculated by the author based on share prices before the close on Friday\n\nCommodity values create divergent dividend forecasts\n\nAs you can see, the forecast dividend yields for the big ASX iron ore shares are lower than last year.\n\nThey're also low by historical standards.\n\nVolatile iron ore prices are a key reason for this. For example, the 62% iron ore price fell by more than 20% last year as investors anticipated lower demand from China.\n\nLatest government data and forecasts for iron ore export earnings show an anticipated decline.\n\nEarnings expectations are $108 billion in 2024\u201325 and $96 billion in 2025\u201326, down from $138 billion in 2023\u201324.\n\nIt's a different story for the ASX gold miners. A very strong gold price is keeping the earnings outlook bright.\n\nThe Federal Department of Resources expects record gold export earnings of $34 billion in 2024\u201325, up 4.7% on 2023\u201324.\n\nIt forecasts a slight increase in export earnings to a new record of $35 billion in 2025\u201326.",

For now, let\u2019s quickly go through the pros and cons of the Jeep Compass.\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Like:\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s a looker. A black Compass is a sight to behold.\n\n\u2022 Best interior quality in its segment.\n\n\u2022 Powerful enough for most needs.\n\n\u2022 Great handling\u2014it feels connected to the road.\n\n\u2022 Refined engine, except for the diesel clatter during cold starts.\n\n________________________________________\n\nWhat You Won\u2019t Like:\n\n\u2022 Expensive service costs (I can explain later why this might not be as serious as it seems).\n\n\u2022 Small size\u2014vehicles like the Mahindra XUV700 and Tata Harrier/Safari have better road presence.\n\n\u2022 The base model offers terrific value for money, but higher automatic variants don\u2019t.\n\n________________________________________\n\nWhy the Jeep Compass?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first experience with cars was with the Maruti 800\u2014a peppy little machine with great manual controls and good enough performance up to 60 km/h, especially in the bottom end. When it was time to upgrade for my father, we bought a Honda Amaze Diesel Manual. A few years later, I drove a Grand i10 Manual in college before starting my job and later pursuing an MBA.\n\n________________________________________\n\nMBA Saga and How the Jeep Compass Launch Helped Me Stay Back in India\n\nWhen the Compass was launched back in 2017, I had the option to either take the CAT and pursue an MBA in India or take the GMAT and move abroad. When I looked at Compass prices in the USA/Canada, I found them to be similarly priced in India.\n\nGiven the high insurance costs abroad, I did some funny math and concluded that if a car this good was available in India at a similar cost, there was no need to move abroad (my decision was based purely on how good the cars were that I could drive). Hence, I decided to stay back in India and promised myself that I would buy a Compass once I had enough money.\n\n________________________________________\n\nFast forward to 2022\u2014I got placed after my MBA, got married to the love of my life (whom I met during my MBA), and immediately needed a car for my wife, Priya, to learn driving. We wanted something simple, reliable, safe, and budget-friendly. Enter the Honda Amaze, this time in the Petrol CVT version.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThe Amaze is a Brilliant Car:\n\n\u2022 The space is cleverly designed.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s safe enough and very smooth.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s a no-nonsense, \u201cfill-it, shut-it\u201d type of vehicle.\n\nThanks to the simplicity of the Amaze, Priya became a confident driver. But let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s a boring car.\n\n\u2022 The steering is heavy but inconsistent.\n\n\u2022 Ride quality is great on smooth roads, but there\u2019s too much horizontal movement on corners.\n\n\u2022 It cruises comfortably at 80 km/h at 1,500 RPM, but progress beyond that feels sluggish.\n\n\u2022 Mileage is awesome (22+ km/l between 60\u201380 km/h), but it drops significantly in the city (14\u201316 km/l).\n\n\u2022 Build quality is great, but interior quality is average.\n\nHonda, though a nice brand, lacks road presence\u2014especially with the Amaze.\n\n________________________________________\n\nI Have Always Been a Driver\u2019s Car Enthusiast\n\nIn 2001\u20132002, I wanted my family to buy a Gypsy. We got a Maruti 800 instead.\n\nIn 2014, I wanted the Brio. We got the Grand i10.\n\nIn 2022, I wanted a used Polo TSI or a Rapid Rider but ended up with the Amaze CVT.\n\nDespite being the go-to person for car advice among my family and friends, I always ended up with cars that were functional but uninspiring.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThen Came the Midlife Crisis\n\nI found myself asking: What was I doing for my passion? What about my inner satisfaction? That\u2019s when I started looking at used Fiat Lineas, Puntos, Polos, and Rapid TSI models. They were all fantastic cars for enthusiasts like me, but I never went ahead with any of them.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, we brought a new joy into our lives\u2014a Retriever puppy named Pookie. He\u2019s now 6 months old. What a cutie he is!\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nWith Pookie\u2019s arrival, the need for an SUV shifted from a \u201cwant\u201d to a necessity. Traveling with him in our current cars was becoming increasingly challenging. He\u2019d often pounce on us from the back seat, creating major safety concerns while driving.\n\nWe realized we needed:\n\n\u2022 Foldable rear seats: So we could leash him securely in the boot while folding the 40/60 split, giving him enough access to the rear passenger area without feeling claustrophobic.\n\n\u2022 Spacious interiors: To ensure he could stretch out and feel comfortable on long drives.\n\n\u2022 Safety-first design: To prevent distractions and ensure everyone\u2019s safety, including Pookie\u2019s.\n\nThis shift made choosing an SUV not just about fulfilling a passion but also about addressing a practical need for our growing family.\n\n________________________________________\n\nRediscovering My Passion for Cars\n\nI started binge-watching car reviews and taking Priya on test drives just for fun. One memorable test drive was of the Citro\u00ebn C3 Aircross\u2014a fantastic driver\u2019s car.\n\nFrom that day, I began explaining car history, brand perceptions, and more to Priya on every road trip. Based on my \u201cwisdom,\u201d she now believes the hierarchy of car brands in India is:\n\nMaruti < Hyundai < Honda < Mahindra/Tata < Jeep < Audi/BMW/Mercedes < Porsche.\n\n\n\nWhy the Jeep Compass?\n\nPriya\u2019s POV:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving already owned a Honda, brands like Maruti and Hyundai were simply ignored (though I have a soft spot for the Creta N). Priya was also firmly against buying something that \u201cevery other household in Haryana owns\u201d (she\u2019s a Jaat). This led to Mahindra being rejected outright. Tata was also ruled out due to service issues I\u2019d heard about. This left Jeep next in line in her perceived hierarchy.\n\n________________________________________\n\nMy POV:\n\n\u2022 Scorpio N was eliminated because the XUV700 seemed like a better option. Besides, the Scorpio N\u2019s suspension didn\u2019t feel great, and its handling was subpar.\n\n\u2022 XUV700 could have been our next best choice, but the interior quality felt a bit plasticky, with hardly any soft-touch materials. To top it off, the display vehicle had a few noticeable quality issues.\n\n\u2022 Roxx was another contender. Priya was willing to make an exception for this one. It\u2019s a real head-turner with decent reviews. However, by the time we considered it, we had already test-driven the Jeep Compass, and the comparison just didn\u2019t seem fair anymore.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThe Jeep Compass Test Drive: Where Our Opinions Merged in Harmony\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Jeep Compass test drive, both Priya and I found ourselves perfectly aligned\u2014a rare marriage of thoughts.\n\nHere\u2019s what stood out during the test drive:\n\n\u2022 Great professional staff: They proactively arranged the test drive without us even asking.\n\n\u2022 Driving the manual: After using the Amaze CVT and Baleno AMT (now owned by my father after retiring the Amaze Diesel), driving the Compass manual felt like regaining control in life.\n\n\u2022 Handling: The steering feedback and precision were miles ahead of anything we\u2019d experienced before.\n\n\u2022 The engine: The 2.0 Multijet engine was explosive yet refined.\n\n\u2022 Interior quality: Easily the best in its segment.\n\n\u2022 Base model essentials: The base model had all the features we truly needed.\n\n\u2022 Jeep legacy: Let\u2019s not forget\u2014this is a real Jeep manufacturer, with that legacy in its DNA.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic experience.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThe Deep Dive\n\nAfter the test drive, I was hooked. I started devouring everything about the Jeep Compass:\n\n\u2022 Team-BHP threads (best midsize SUV thread is the best one)\n\n\u2022 YouTube reviews\n\n\u2022 Ownership threads\n\n\u2022 Reddit discussions\n\n\u2022 Jeep forums\n\nExcept for concerns about reliability, there were no major red flags.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThoughts on Service Costs and Reliability:\n\n\u2022 Service costs: \u20b920,000\u201330,000 per service.\n\n\u2022 Service interval: 15,000 km or 1 year (whichever comes first).\n\n\u2022 Comparatively, higher running would result in similar expenses with cars like the Harrier or Safari (10,000 km intervals).\n\n\u2022 Over 10 years, I estimate spending roughly \u20b91.5 lakh extra on service costs. For us, this is manageable, so the \u201cexpensive service\u201d argument wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker.\n\nReliability:\n\nMost issues on forums seemed related to low battery or auxiliary battery problems. With an extended warranty (up to 5 years) and a backup car, this felt like a risk we could handle.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThe Final Decision: Jeep Compass\n\n\n\nPriya was crystal clear: If it\u2019s Jeep, forget other features. But if we chose anything else, it had to have a sunroof.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a big fan of base models. I\u2019d always prefer a car from the next segment rather than a higher trim within the same segment.\n\nHere\u2019s where things clicked:\n\n\u2022 The XUV700 sunroof model costs almost the same as the Jeep Compass base model.\n\n\u2022 For us, the Compass was the obvious choice.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThe Deal\n\n\n\nWe worked out the deal with Landmark Jeep, South Delhi. There were no discounts on the base model (due to a recent price revision for the Sport variant), but we saved on insurance overheads and logistics.\n\nTo further increase the value-for-money quotient, I opted for a BH number, saving an additional couple of lakhs. All in all, it cost us \u20b920 lakh. Imran is great guy to deal with. Give him a try in case you are interested in Compass\n\n________________________________________\n\nDelivery Experience\n\n\u2022 Got free mats, a single ceramic coat, and some cool goodies (the Jeep cap is particularly great).\n\n\u2022 The experience was seamless, and the BH number is on its way.\n\n________________________________________\n\nMeet Thunder\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the car itself. You\u2019ve read the context, so you\u2019ll connect better now. From this point on, I\u2019ll call it Thunder, because that was the first song we played after bringing it home.\n\n\n\nHow Does Thunder Look from the Outside?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall silhouette is excellent\u2014compact yet rugged, thanks to the side plastic cladding. It\u2019s definitely a looker and arguably the best-looking SUV in this segment. Of course, looks are subjective, but most of my friends agree that it excels in the aesthetics department.\n\nThe glass blocks UV rays, giving it a premium feel and a slight tint that further enhances its appearance. Once my budget allows, I plan to add roof rails, crossbars, and perhaps paint the alloys black. If aesthetics are a top priority, the Compass should definitely be at the top of your list.\n\nTires:\n\n\n\nThe tires are from Firestone\u2014an unfamiliar brand, but they seem to offer good grip in both wet and dry conditions. Road noise is slightly excessive, but for now, they meet my needs.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nEngine Bay\n\n\n\nNothing particularly special here. The engine cover is present, with good protection and insulation on the sides of the hood. It\u2019s a clean bay to look at, and I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that this part of the car remains healthy.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nBoot\n\n\n\nThe boot is adequate for four passengers traveling light. It\u2019s not enormous but definitely an upgrade compared to the Honda Amaze. It\u2019s spacious enough\u2014no complaints.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nHow Does Thunder Look from the Inside?\n\n\n\nThe Sports Base Model features a fabric dashboard material, which looks great when clean. I wish leather interior trim (in black) was available as standard because it looks even better. However, the dealership does offer a complete cabin redo in leather\u2014similar to upper trims\u2014for \u20b940,000\u2013\u20b950,000. We\u2019ll probably opt for that once we tire of the fabric.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nInstrument Cluster\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s functional and straightforward. While nothing groundbreaking, it offers many controls and doesn\u2019t make me miss digital clusters. The old-school analog dials add a retro touch that I enjoy.\n\nOne noteworthy point: when I\u2019ve pushed the tachometer to the redline, there\u2019s no abrupt power cutoff or loss beyond 3,500\u20134,000 RPM, unlike many other cars.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nFunctional Controls\n\n\n\nKey features are accessible via buttons, even though most can be operated through the touchscreen. For instance, controls for the volume, FM tuner, AC on/off, fan speed, and circulation mode are just a click away\u2014essential for undistracted driving.\n\nSteering Wheel Controls: Buttons behind the steering wheel are intuitive, as are those on the wheel itself.\n\nDoor Buttons: These have a great tactile feel and are backlit, reflecting attention to detail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Vent Controls: Excellent quality, with no risk of breakage like the vents in the first-gen Amaze.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nComfort\n\n\u2022 Front Seats: Offer excellent lumbar and under-thigh support, with good side bolstering.\n\n\u2022 Rear Bench Seat: Comfortable for four adults and a child. However, the middle passenger won\u2019t find it as accommodating.\n\n\u2022 Armrest: The armrest is padded and at a perfect height, making it easy to rest my arm on the gear knob and the armrest simultaneously. Additionally, the right-hand door armrest aligns with it, enhancing the ergonomic experience\u2014a feature often overlooked in other vehicles.\n\n\u2022 Rear Seat: It\u2019s 60/40 foldable and offers great under-thigh support for side passengers, though the middle passenger\u2019s experience is less ideal. The fabric seat material feels premium compared to lower-end cars and even outshines the fabric in lower trims of the Scorpio N.\n\n\u2022 Boot Space: Sufficient for luggage for four passengers.\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nDriver Controls\n\n\n\n\u2022 Steering Wheel:\n\no Volume and Track Change Controls: Located behind the steering wheel, though one of the buttons feels slightly flimsy.\n\no Rake and Reach Adjustment: Great to touch and hold.\n\no Cruise Control: Missing on the manual variant. Interestingly, the base Sport trim in Canada includes cruise control (albeit in the automatic variant).\n\n\u2022 Gear Knob: A joy to hold, with short and precise throws (except for first gear, which shifts smoothly only at low speeds\u2014common in most manual cars).\n\n\u2022 Pedals: Perfectly spaced and great to use.\n\n\u2022 Right and Left Stalks:\n\no Right Stalk: Wiper controls.\n\no Left Stalk: Indicators.\n\n\n\nClever Features (Skoda Touch?)\n\n\u2022 Electronic Parking Brake with Hill Hold: Standard from the base model. However, explaining its operation to car wash guys can be a task.\n\n\u2022 All Four Auto-Down Windows: Possibly a first in this segment.\n\n\u2022 Auto-Up Windows with Anti-Pinch (Front Two): Handy and safe.\n\n\u2022 Rear Cabin Lights: Turn off with a click\u2014a cool party trick.\n\n\u2022 Vanity Mirrors: Both driver and passenger sides. Priya loves this feature!\n\n\u2022 Extendable Sun Visors: A nostalgic nod, even the Maruti 800 had these.\n\n\u2022 Alloy Wheels (Base Variant): If I owned a white car, I'd paint them black immediately.\n\n\u2022 Firestone Tires: Partnered with Bridgestone, they feel reliable.\n\n\u2022 Exceptional Insulation: Whether it helps significantly is debatable, but full marks for effort.\n\n\u2022 Multi-Layer Rubber Beadings: Soft to touch; however, I\u2019m curious if they\u2019ll need frequent replacements.\n\n\u2022 Attention to Detail: Even on parts you can\u2019t see\u2014impressive.\n\n\u2022 TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System): From the base model, invaluable for long trips.\n\n\u2022 Boot Hooks: Perfect for securing Pookie while folding the rear seat.\n\n\u2022 Soft-Close Glovebox Lid: Illuminated for convenience\u2014Priya\u2019s go-to spot for her lipstick.\n\n\u2022 Rubber Grips in Cup Holders: A small but thoughtful addition.\n\n\u2022 Passenger-Side Lock/Unlock Button: Priya enjoys unlocking doors for rear passengers now.\n\n\u2022 Reverse Camera Guidelines: A lifesaver, even with my 70,000 km of driving experience.\n\n\u2022 Clever ORVM Design: Appreciated, though not highly impactful.\n\n\u2022 Rear Wash and Wipe (with Anti-Fog): Standard from the base model\u2014a practical feature.\n\n\u2022 Thick, Heavy Doors and Engine Hood: The solid sheet metal adds to the car\u2019s robust feel.\n\n\u2022 No Fuel Tank Cap: The lid is well-sealed, though, so no complaints.\n\n\u2022 Compass Display in MID: A nod to the Jeep Compass, adding a nice touch of charm.\n\n\u2022 Flush-Fit Floor Mats: Stay perfectly in place, unlike my previous cars\u2019 mats.\n\n\u2022 Base Model 4-Speaker System: Surprisingly delivers amazing mids and bass.\n\n\u2022 Adjustable Handrest: Aligns perfectly with the gearshift knob, making long drives much more comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTouch and Feel\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Interior Materials: The interior quality is impressive, with extensive use of soft-touch materials, especially on the dashboard and doors. Few competitors, such as the Harrier or Astor, come close to this level of refinement. Even the XUV700 AX7 doesn\u2019t quite match the premium feel.\n\n\u2022 Doors: The doors are heavy and close with a reassuring thud. Even in areas without soft-touch materials, the plastic quality is top-notch.\n\n\u2022 Handrest: The padded handrest, fabric upholstery in the base models, and fabric-accented dashboard contribute to a premium experience, making the cabin feel upscale despite being a lower trim.\n\n________________________________________\n\nHeadlights\n\n\n\nThe headlights (both low and high beam) are more than adequate for everyday needs. While higher trims may have a different lighting setup, the current configuration serves its purpose well.\n\n________________________________________\n\nVisibility\n\n\n\nVisibility is excellent overall, though the A-pillars slightly obstruct side views. The compact design of the Compass ensures great drivability, and the reverse camera is of exceptional quality\u2014though its performance at night could be better.\n\n________________________________________\n\nClutch and Pedal Feel\n\n\u2022 Pedal Spacing and Feedback: The pedals are perfectly spaced, with the brake pedal offering good feedback. The accelerator pedal has significant travel, making it easy to maintain a constant speed. There\u2019s a feeling that it\u2019s staged for different speeds\u2014possibly just a placebo, but it works well.\n\n\u2022 Clutch Pedal: The clutch strikes a perfect balance\u2014not too heavy, not too light. The engagement point is consistent and easy to identify, with a moderate travel distance. It\u2019s a massive improvement over the Amaze Diesel and Grand i10, offering a refined and predictable feel.\n\n________________________________________\n\nHow It Drives?\n\n\u2022 Smooth Driving: The driving experience can only be described as \"Makhan\" (buttery smooth). On city roads or expressways, the clutch and gear shifts work in harmony. In bumper-to-bumper traffic, the clutch release is easy to modulate. Gear shifts\u2014both upshifts and downshifts\u2014are smooth, with no resistance when shifting quickly, except for downshifting to first gear.\n\n\u2022 Acceleration: The real magic starts post-1700 RPM, where you feel a distinct push into the seat. Even below this, the car handles well, although 1st gear is essential for speeds below 10 km/h. Above 1700 RPM, the Compass becomes a beast, effortlessly hitting speeds like 120\u2013160 km/h. The throttle response is steady and predictable, making overtaking a breeze.\n\n\u2022 Stability at High Speeds: Whether cruising at 120 km/h or higher, the car remains stable. It\u2019s reassuring to have this kind of performance on tap, even if Indian roads rarely allow for it.\n\n________________________________________\n\nHandling\n\nThis is the Compass\u2019s standout feature. Every review and ownership report highlights the precise and confident handling, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\n\u2022 Steering Feedback: The steering is light at low speeds and becomes heavier as speed increases, offering excellent feedback. The return-to-center action is quick, and the adjustability allows for a perfect driving position.\n\n\u2022 Overall Feel: The Compass feels planted and agile, with precise control that instills confidence on winding roads and highways alike.\n\n________________________________________\n\nBrakes\n\n\u2022 Performance: The braking system is excellent, with all four wheels equipped with disc brakes. The host of safety features ensures reliability in any situation.\n\n\u2022 Test Drive Highlight: During the test drive, the salesperson demonstrated the braking prowess by engaging the electronic parking brake at high speed, and the car came to a perfect, straight-line stop.\n\n________________________________________\n\nSuspension and Chassis\n\n\u2022 Ride Quality: The suspension is superbly calibrated, absorbing bumps and irregularities effortlessly. There\u2019s no noticeable horizontal or vertical movement, even at higher speeds.\n\n\u2022 Dynamic Suspension: This isn\u2019t just a marketing gimmick\u2014it works exceptionally well, providing excellent composure and stability.\n\n\u2022 Expressway Stability: The Compass feels like a heavy, planted car on highways, offering unmatched confidence and comfort.\n\n\n\nhen I mentioned achieving 22+ km/l with the Honda Amaze Petrol CVT, I wasn\u2019t exaggerating. On a smooth run from Noida to Delhi with sparse traffic, I\u2019ve even managed 25+ km/l (cruising at a constant 60 km/h with mild overtaking).\n\nHaving mastered a CVT for optimal mileage, transitioning to a manual for fuel efficiency wasn\u2019t a big challenge.\n\n________________________________________\n\nCity Mileage\n\n\u2022 Enthusiastic Driving: Revving up to 2,000 RPM before shifting in the city results in 12\u201314 km/l (as shown on the MID, which is mostly accurate with a minor 2\u20133% variation).\n\n\u2022 Moderate Driving: When driven like a typical manual car, 14\u201315 km/l is easily achievable.\n\n\u2022 Economical Driving: Driving it like the Amaze CVT (haven\u2019t tried it much yet), 17\u201318 km/l seems very achievable.\n\n________________________________________\n\nHighway Mileage\n\n\u2022 Cruising at 80\u2013100 km/h: You can expect 20 km/l with ease.\n\n\u2022 Cruising at 100\u2013120 km/h: Mileage drops slightly to 18\u201319 km/l.\n\n________________________________________\n\nReal-World Example\n\nFor reference, my Noida-to-Ayodhya round trip (1,500 km) cost just \u20b96,800 in fuel. You can do the math!\n\n________________________________________\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019m highly satisfied with the mileage, especially considering this is before the first service. The efficiency only adds to the satisfaction of owning this car.\n\n________________________________________\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\u2022 Great car so far. Am I satisfied? Absolutely.\n\n\u2022 Is Priya happy with the purchase? Of course!\n\n\u2022 Can Pookie join us on road trips without compromising on space or driver safety? Yes, and comfortably so.\n\nHas it helped me tackle my midlife crisis? Hell yeahhhhhh!\n\n________________________________________\n\nNow, Let\u2019s Be Real:\n\n\u2022 Is it the best car under \u20b920\u201330 lakh? No.\n\n\u2022 Is it the best car for people like me? Maybe.\n\n\u2022 Is it the best car for the 300-odd customers buying it each month? Certainly seems so.\n\nThe Jeep Compass deserves better sales numbers. If you\u2019re in the market, go test-drive the manual variant\u2014it\u2019s an absolute hoot to drive!\n\n________________________________________\n\nDear Jeep/Stellantis,\n\nPlease, market your car to a broader audience if you genuinely intend to increase sales. The Jeep Compass is a fantastic vehicle, but it deserves better recognition.\n\nHere\u2019s my humble request:\n\n1. Engage with Current Customers: People like me who\u2019ve experienced the Compass firsthand can vouch for its quality. Talk to us, learn why we chose it, and use that to reach others with similar preferences.\n\n2. Understand Your Audience: Dive deeper into the profile of Compass buyers. Who are they? What do they value? Showcase how the Compass aligns perfectly with those aspirations.\n\n3. Improve the Automatic Gearbox: The 9-speed automatic is the only real chink in its armor. It\u2019s slow and doesn\u2019t do justice to the otherwise stellar package. The Aisin 6-speed automatic is a tried-and-tested option\u2014please explore integrating it into the Compass lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Compass deserves more life on the road. It\u2019s a car that can win hearts if more people get to experience it.\n\n\n\nFew more pictures- , I was quite confused about choosing the title for this thread. Here are some of the options I considered over the past few weeks:\u2022 Jeep Compass: Poor Man's BMW Experience\u2022 Jeep Compass: Best Manual Car Below \u20b91 Cr On Road in India\u2022 Jeep Compass: Manual Should Be the Only Version to Buy\u2022 Jeep Compass: The Car That Helped Me Choose a Career in India Rather Than Going Abroad\u2022 Jeep Compass: My Wife's Choice\u2022 Jeep Compass: Is Jeep Life Overhyped?...and many more.Give me a few minutes, and I\u2019ll explain each of these in detail. For now, let\u2019s quickly go through the pros and cons of the Jeep Compass.________________________________________\u2022 It\u2019s a looker. A black Compass is a sight to behold.\u2022 Best interior quality in its segment.\u2022 Powerful enough for most needs.\u2022 Great handling\u2014it feels connected to the road.\u2022 Refined engine, except for the diesel clatter during cold starts.________________________________________\u2022 Expensive service costs (I can explain later why this might not be as serious as it seems).\u2022 Small size\u2014vehicles like the Mahindra XUV700 and Tata Harrier/Safari have better road presence.\u2022 The base model offers terrific value for money, but higher automatic variants don\u2019t.________________________________________My first experience with cars was with the Maruti 800\u2014a peppy little machine with great manual controls and good enough performance up to 60 km/h, especially in the bottom end. When it was time to upgrade for my father, we bought a Honda Amaze Diesel Manual. A few years later, I drove a Grand i10 Manual in college before starting my job and later pursuing an MBA.________________________________________When the Compass was launched back in 2017, I had the option to either take the CAT and pursue an MBA in India or take the GMAT and move abroad. When I looked at Compass prices in the USA/Canada, I found them to be similarly priced in India.Given the high insurance costs abroad, I did some funny math and concluded that if a car this good was available in India at a similar cost, there was no need to move abroad (my decision was based purely on how good the cars were that I could drive). Hence, I decided to stay back in India and promised myself that I would buy a Compass once I had enough money.________________________________________Fast forward to 2022\u2014I got placed after my MBA, got married to the love of my life (whom I met during my MBA), and immediately needed a car for my wife, Priya, to learn driving. We wanted something simple, reliable, safe, and budget-friendly. Enter the Honda Amaze, this time in the Petrol CVT version.________________________________________\u2022 The space is cleverly designed.\u2022 It\u2019s safe enough and very smooth.\u2022 It\u2019s a no-nonsense, \u201cfill-it, shut-it\u201d type of vehicle.Thanks to the simplicity of the Amaze, Priya became a confident driver. But let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s a boring car.\u2022 The steering is heavy but inconsistent.\u2022 Ride quality is great on smooth roads, but there\u2019s too much horizontal movement on corners.\u2022 It cruises comfortably at 80 km/h at 1,500 RPM, but progress beyond that feels sluggish.\u2022 Mileage is awesome (22+ km/l between 60\u201380 km/h), but it drops significantly in the city (14\u201316 km/l).\u2022 Build quality is great, but interior quality is average.Honda, though a nice brand, lacks road presence\u2014especially with the Amaze.________________________________________In 2001\u20132002, I wanted my family to buy a Gypsy. We got a Maruti 800 instead.In 2014, I wanted the Brio. We got the Grand i10.In 2022, I wanted a used Polo TSI or a Rapid Rider but ended up with the Amaze CVT.Despite being the go-to person for car advice among my family and friends, I always ended up with cars that were functional but uninspiring.________________________________________I found myself asking: What was I doing for my passion? What about my inner satisfaction? That\u2019s when I started looking at used Fiat Lineas, Puntos, Polos, and Rapid TSI models. They were all fantastic cars for enthusiasts like me, but I never went ahead with any of them.In the midst of this crisis, we brought a new joy into our lives\u2014a Retriever puppy named Pookie. He\u2019s now 6 months old. What a cutie he is!________________________________________With Pookie\u2019s arrival, the need for an SUV shifted from a \u201cwant\u201d to a necessity. Traveling with him in our current cars was becoming increasingly challenging. He\u2019d often pounce on us from the back seat, creating major safety concerns while driving.We realized we needed:\u2022 Foldable rear seats: So we could leash him securely in the boot while folding the 40/60 split, giving him enough access to the rear passenger area without feeling claustrophobic.\u2022 Spacious interiors: To ensure he could stretch out and feel comfortable on long drives.\u2022 Safety-first design: To prevent distractions and ensure everyone\u2019s safety, including Pookie\u2019s.This shift made choosing an SUV not just about fulfilling a passion but also about addressing a practical need for our growing family.________________________________________I started binge-watching car reviews and taking Priya on test drives just for fun. One memorable test drive was of the Citro\u00ebn C3 Aircross\u2014a fantastic driver\u2019s car.From that day, I began explaining car history, brand perceptions, and more to Priya on every road trip. Based on my \u201cwisdom,\u201d she now believes the hierarchy of car brands in India is:Maruti < Hyundai < Honda < Mahindra/Tata < Jeep < Audi/BMW/Mercedes < Porsche.Having already owned a Honda, brands like Maruti and Hyundai were simply ignored (though I have a soft spot for the Creta N). Priya was also firmly against buying something that \u201cevery other household in Haryana owns\u201d (she\u2019s a Jaat). This led to Mahindra being rejected outright. Tata was also ruled out due to service issues I\u2019d heard about. This left Jeep next in line in her perceived hierarchy.________________________________________\u2022 Scorpio N was eliminated because the XUV700 seemed like a better option. Besides, the Scorpio N\u2019s suspension didn\u2019t feel great, and its handling was subpar.\u2022 XUV700 could have been our next best choice, but the interior quality felt a bit plasticky, with hardly any soft-touch materials. To top it off, the display vehicle had a few noticeable quality issues.\u2022 Roxx was another contender. Priya was willing to make an exception for this one. It\u2019s a real head-turner with decent reviews. However, by the time we considered it, we had already test-driven the Jeep Compass, and the comparison just didn\u2019t seem fair anymore.________________________________________During the Jeep Compass test drive, both Priya and I found ourselves perfectly aligned\u2014a rare marriage of thoughts.Here\u2019s what stood out during the test drive:\u2022 Great professional staff: They proactively arranged the test drive without us even asking.\u2022 Driving the manual: After using the Amaze CVT and Baleno AMT (now owned by my father after retiring the Amaze Diesel), driving the Compass manual felt like regaining control in life.\u2022 Handling: The steering feedback and precision were miles ahead of anything we\u2019d experienced before.\u2022 The engine: The 2.0 Multijet engine was explosive yet refined.\u2022 Interior quality: Easily the best in its segment.\u2022 Base model essentials: The base model had all the features we truly needed.\u2022 Jeep legacy: Let\u2019s not forget\u2014this is a real Jeep manufacturer, with that legacy in its DNA.Overall, it was a fantastic experience.________________________________________The Deep DiveAfter the test drive, I was hooked. I started devouring everything about the Jeep Compass:\u2022 Team-BHP threads (best midsize SUV thread is the best one)\u2022 YouTube reviews\u2022 Ownership threads\u2022 Reddit discussions\u2022 Jeep forumsExcept for concerns about reliability, there were no major red flags.________________________________________Thoughts on Service Costs and Reliability:\u2022 Service costs: \u20b920,000\u201330,000 per service.\u2022 Service interval: 15,000 km or 1 year (whichever comes first).\u2022 Comparatively, higher running would result in similar expenses with cars like the Harrier or Safari (10,000 km intervals).\u2022 Over 10 years, I estimate spending roughly \u20b91.5 lakh extra on service costs. For us, this is manageable, so the \u201cexpensive service\u201d argument wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker.Reliability:Most issues on forums seemed related to low battery or auxiliary battery problems. With an extended warranty (up to 5 years) and a backup car, this felt like a risk we could handle.________________________________________Priya was crystal clear: If it\u2019s Jeep, forget other features. But if we chose anything else, it had to have a sunroof.Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of base models. I\u2019d always prefer a car from the next segment rather than a higher trim within the same segment.Here\u2019s where things clicked:\u2022 The XUV700 sunroof model costs almost the same as the Jeep Compass base model.\u2022 For us, the Compass was the obvious choice.________________________________________We worked out the deal with Landmark Jeep, South Delhi. There were no discounts on the base model (due to a recent price revision for the Sport variant), but we saved on insurance overheads and logistics.To further increase the value-for-money quotient, I opted for a BH number, saving an additional couple of lakhs. All in all, it cost us \u20b920 lakh. Imran is great guy to deal with. Give him a try in case you are interested in Compass________________________________________\u2022 Got free mats, a single ceramic coat, and some cool goodies (the Jeep cap is particularly great).\u2022 The experience was seamless, and the BH number is on its way.________________________________________Now, let\u2019s talk about the car itself. You\u2019ve read the context, so you\u2019ll connect better now. From this point on, I\u2019ll call it Thunder, because that was the first song we played after bringing it home.The overall silhouette is excellent\u2014compact yet rugged, thanks to the side plastic cladding. It\u2019s definitely a looker and arguably the best-looking SUV in this segment. Of course, looks are subjective, but most of my friends agree that it excels in the aesthetics department.The glass blocks UV rays, giving it a premium feel and a slight tint that further enhances its appearance. Once my budget allows, I plan to add roof rails, crossbars, and perhaps paint the alloys black. If aesthetics are a top priority, the Compass should definitely be at the top of your list.Tires:The tires are from Firestone\u2014an unfamiliar brand, but they seem to offer good grip in both wet and dry conditions. Road noise is slightly excessive, but for now, they meet my needs.________________________________________Engine BayNothing particularly special here. The engine cover is present, with good protection and insulation on the sides of the hood. It\u2019s a clean bay to look at, and I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that this part of the car remains healthy.________________________________________BootThe boot is adequate for four passengers traveling light. It\u2019s not enormous but definitely an upgrade compared to the Honda Amaze. It\u2019s spacious enough\u2014no complaints.________________________________________How Does Thunder Look from the Inside?The Sports Base Model features a fabric dashboard material, which looks great when clean. I wish leather interior trim (in black) was available as standard because it looks even better. However, the dealership does offer a complete cabin redo in leather\u2014similar to upper trims\u2014for \u20b940,000\u2013\u20b950,000. We\u2019ll probably opt for that once we tire of the fabric.________________________________________Instrument ClusterIt\u2019s functional and straightforward. While nothing groundbreaking, it offers many controls and doesn\u2019t make me miss digital clusters. The old-school analog dials add a retro touch that I enjoy.One noteworthy point: when I\u2019ve pushed the tachometer to the redline, there\u2019s no abrupt power cutoff or loss beyond 3,500\u20134,000 RPM, unlike many other cars.________________________________________Functional ControlsKey features are accessible via buttons, even though most can be operated through the touchscreen. For instance, controls for the volume, FM tuner, AC on/off, fan speed, and circulation mode are just a click away\u2014essential for undistracted driving.Steering Wheel Controls: Buttons behind the steering wheel are intuitive, as are those on the wheel itself.Door Buttons: These have a great tactile feel and are backlit, reflecting attention to detail.Air Vent Controls: Excellent quality, with no risk of breakage like the vents in the first-gen Amaze.________________________________________Comfort\u2022 Front Seats: Offer excellent lumbar and under-thigh support, with good side bolstering.\u2022 Rear Bench Seat: Comfortable for four adults and a child. However, the middle passenger won\u2019t find it as accommodating.\u2022 Armrest: The armrest is padded and at a perfect height, making it easy to rest my arm on the gear knob and the armrest simultaneously. Additionally, the right-hand door armrest aligns with it, enhancing the ergonomic experience\u2014a feature often overlooked in other vehicles.\u2022 Rear Seat: It\u2019s 60/40 foldable and offers great under-thigh support for side passengers, though the middle passenger\u2019s experience is less ideal. The fabric seat material feels premium compared to lower-end cars and even outshines the fabric in lower trims of the Scorpio N.\u2022 Boot Space: Sufficient for luggage for four passengers.________________________________________Driver Controls\u2022 Steering Wheel:o Volume and Track Change Controls: Located behind the steering wheel, though one of the buttons feels slightly flimsy.o Rake and Reach Adjustment: Great to touch and hold.o Cruise Control: Missing on the manual variant. Interestingly, the base Sport trim in Canada includes cruise control (albeit in the automatic variant).\u2022 Gear Knob: A joy to hold, with short and precise throws (except for first gear, which shifts smoothly only at low speeds\u2014common in most manual cars).\u2022 Pedals: Perfectly spaced and great to use.\u2022 Right and Left Stalks:o Right Stalk: Wiper controls.o Left Stalk: Indicators.Clever Features (Skoda Touch?)\u2022 Electronic Parking Brake with Hill Hold: Standard from the base model. However, explaining its operation to car wash guys can be a task.\u2022 All Four Auto-Down Windows: Possibly a first in this segment.\u2022 Auto-Up Windows with Anti-Pinch (Front Two): Handy and safe.\u2022 Rear Cabin Lights: Turn off with a click\u2014a cool party trick.\u2022 Vanity Mirrors: Both driver and passenger sides. Priya loves this feature!\u2022 Extendable Sun Visors: A nostalgic nod, even the Maruti 800 had these.\u2022 Alloy Wheels (Base Variant): If I owned a white car, I'd paint them black immediately.\u2022 Firestone Tires: Partnered with Bridgestone, they feel reliable.\u2022 Exceptional Insulation: Whether it helps significantly is debatable, but full marks for effort.\u2022 Multi-Layer Rubber Beadings: Soft to touch; however, I\u2019m curious if they\u2019ll need frequent replacements.\u2022 Attention to Detail: Even on parts you can\u2019t see\u2014impressive.\u2022 TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System): From the base model, invaluable for long trips.\u2022 Boot Hooks: Perfect for securing Pookie while folding the rear seat.\u2022 Soft-Close Glovebox Lid: Illuminated for convenience\u2014Priya\u2019s go-to spot for her lipstick.\u2022 Rubber Grips in Cup Holders: A small but thoughtful addition.\u2022 Passenger-Side Lock/Unlock Button: Priya enjoys unlocking doors for rear passengers now.\u2022 Reverse Camera Guidelines: A lifesaver, even with my 70,000 km of driving experience.\u2022 Clever ORVM Design: Appreciated, though not highly impactful.\u2022 Rear Wash and Wipe (with Anti-Fog): Standard from the base model\u2014a practical feature.\u2022 Thick, Heavy Doors and Engine Hood: The solid sheet metal adds to the car\u2019s robust feel.\u2022 No Fuel Tank Cap: The lid is well-sealed, though, so no complaints.\u2022 Compass Display in MID: A nod to the Jeep Compass, adding a nice touch of charm.\u2022 Flush-Fit Floor Mats: Stay perfectly in place, unlike my previous cars\u2019 mats.\u2022 Base Model 4-Speaker System: Surprisingly delivers amazing mids and bass.\u2022 Adjustable Handrest: Aligns perfectly with the gearshift knob, making long drives much more comfortable.Touch and Feel\u2022 Interior Materials: The interior quality is impressive, with extensive use of soft-touch materials, especially on the dashboard and doors. Few competitors, such as the Harrier or Astor, come close to this level of refinement. Even the XUV700 AX7 doesn\u2019t quite match the premium feel.\u2022 Doors: The doors are heavy and close with a reassuring thud. Even in areas without soft-touch materials, the plastic quality is top-notch.\u2022 Handrest: The padded handrest, fabric upholstery in the base models, and fabric-accented dashboard contribute to a premium experience, making the cabin feel upscale despite being a lower trim.________________________________________HeadlightsThe headlights (both low and high beam) are more than adequate for everyday needs. While higher trims may have a different lighting setup, the current configuration serves its purpose well.________________________________________VisibilityVisibility is excellent overall, though the A-pillars slightly obstruct side views. The compact design of the Compass ensures great drivability, and the reverse camera is of exceptional quality\u2014though its performance at night could be better.________________________________________Clutch and Pedal Feel\u2022 Pedal Spacing and Feedback: The pedals are perfectly spaced, with the brake pedal offering good feedback. The accelerator pedal has significant travel, making it easy to maintain a constant speed. There\u2019s a feeling that it\u2019s staged for different speeds\u2014possibly just a placebo, but it works well.\u2022 Clutch Pedal: The clutch strikes a perfect balance\u2014not too heavy, not too light. The engagement point is consistent and easy to identify, with a moderate travel distance. It\u2019s a massive improvement over the Amaze Diesel and Grand i10, offering a refined and predictable feel.________________________________________How It Drives?\u2022 Smooth Driving: The driving experience can only be described as \"Makhan\" (buttery smooth). On city roads or expressways, the clutch and gear shifts work in harmony. In bumper-to-bumper traffic, the clutch release is easy to modulate. Gear shifts\u2014both upshifts and downshifts\u2014are smooth, with no resistance when shifting quickly, except for downshifting to first gear.\u2022 Acceleration: The real magic starts post-1700 RPM, where you feel a distinct push into the seat. Even below this, the car handles well, although 1st gear is essential for speeds below 10 km/h. Above 1700 RPM, the Compass becomes a beast, effortlessly hitting speeds like 120\u2013160 km/h. The throttle response is steady and predictable, making overtaking a breeze.\u2022 Stability at High Speeds: Whether cruising at 120 km/h or higher, the car remains stable. It\u2019s reassuring to have this kind of performance on tap, even if Indian roads rarely allow for it.________________________________________HandlingThis is the Compass\u2019s standout feature. Every review and ownership report highlights the precise and confident handling, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\u2022 Steering Feedback: The steering is light at low speeds and becomes heavier as speed increases, offering excellent feedback. The return-to-center action is quick, and the adjustability allows for a perfect driving position.\u2022 Overall Feel: The Compass feels planted and agile, with precise control that instills confidence on winding roads and highways alike.________________________________________Brakes\u2022 Performance: The braking system is excellent, with all four wheels equipped with disc brakes. The host of safety features ensures reliability in any situation.\u2022 Test Drive Highlight: During the test drive, the salesperson demonstrated the braking prowess by engaging the electronic parking brake at high speed, and the car came to a perfect, straight-line stop.________________________________________Suspension and Chassis\u2022 Ride Quality: The suspension is superbly calibrated, absorbing bumps and irregularities effortlessly. There\u2019s no noticeable horizontal or vertical movement, even at higher speeds.\u2022 Dynamic Suspension: This isn\u2019t just a marketing gimmick\u2014it works exceptionally well, providing excellent composure and stability.\u2022 Expressway Stability: The Compass feels like a heavy, planted car on highways, offering unmatched confidence and comfort.hen I mentioned achieving 22+ km/l with the Honda Amaze Petrol CVT, I wasn\u2019t exaggerating. On a smooth run from Noida to Delhi with sparse traffic, I\u2019ve even managed 25+ km/l (cruising at a constant 60 km/h with mild overtaking).Having mastered a CVT for optimal mileage, transitioning to a manual for fuel efficiency wasn\u2019t a big challenge.________________________________________City Mileage\u2022 Enthusiastic Driving: Revving up to 2,000 RPM before shifting in the city results in 12\u201314 km/l (as shown on the MID, which is mostly accurate with a minor 2\u20133% variation).\u2022 Moderate Driving: When driven like a typical manual car, 14\u201315 km/l is easily achievable.\u2022 Economical Driving: Driving it like the Amaze CVT (haven\u2019t tried it much yet), 17\u201318 km/l seems very achievable.________________________________________Highway Mileage\u2022 Cruising at 80\u2013100 km/h: You can expect 20 km/l with ease.\u2022 Cruising at 100\u2013120 km/h: Mileage drops slightly to 18\u201319 km/l.________________________________________Real-World ExampleFor reference, my Noida-to-Ayodhya round trip (1,500 km) cost just \u20b96,800 in fuel. You can do the math!________________________________________ConclusionI\u2019m highly satisfied with the mileage, especially considering this is before the first service. The efficiency only adds to the satisfaction of owning this car.________________________________________Final Thoughts\u2022 Great car so far. Am I satisfied? Absolutely.\u2022 Is Priya happy with the purchase? Of course!\u2022 Can Pookie join us on road trips without compromising on space or driver safety? Yes, and comfortably so.Has it helped me tackle my midlife crisis? Hell yeahhhhhh!________________________________________Now, Let\u2019s Be Real:\u2022 Is it the best car under \u20b920\u201330 lakh? No.\u2022 Is it the best car for people like me? Maybe.\u2022 Is it the best car for the 300-odd customers buying it each month? Certainly seems so.The Jeep Compass deserves better sales numbers. If you\u2019re in the market, go test-drive the manual variant\u2014it\u2019s an absolute hoot to drive!________________________________________Dear Jeep/Stellantis,Please, market your car to a broader audience if you genuinely intend to increase sales. The Jeep Compass is a fantastic vehicle, but it deserves better recognition.Here\u2019s my humble request:1. Engage with Current Customers: People like me who\u2019ve experienced the Compass firsthand can vouch for its quality. Talk to us, learn why we chose it, and use that to reach others with similar preferences.2. Understand Your Audience: Dive deeper into the profile of Compass buyers. Who are they? What do they value? Showcase how the Compass aligns perfectly with those aspirations.3. Improve the Automatic Gearbox: The 9-speed automatic is the only real chink in its armor. It\u2019s slow and doesn\u2019t do justice to the otherwise stellar package. The Aisin 6-speed automatic is a tried-and-tested option\u2014please explore integrating it into the Compass lineup.The Compass deserves more life on the road. It\u2019s a car that can win hearts if more people get to experience it.Few more pictures- Attached Thumbnails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast edited by Aditya : 28th January 2025 at 05:05 .

            "content": "Driving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol AT\n\nThe only engine option on the Kylaq is the 999cc, turbocharged, 3-cylinder, direct-injection petrol engine that puts out 114 BHP and 178 Nm. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic (AQ250-6F). It is shared with the Kushaq, Slavia, Taigun and the Slavia. The Kylaq doesn\u2019t get the bigger 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine that these cars get. Being the only engine option on offer puts the Kylaq at a bit of a disadvantage compared to some of the other cars in the segment. Cars like the Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and the Mahindra XUV3XO also have a diesel engine on offer. The Maruti Brezza and Tata Nexon also come with a factory-fitted CNG option.\n\nThe engine is pretty refined at idle and you don\u2019t get the typical 3-cylinder hum from the engine. Start driving and you\u2019ll notice that the throttle response is satisfactory and the Kylaq moves off the line with ease. The engine is tractable and isn't dead at low rpms. But, there is little turbo lag. If you want, you can pull from under 1,000 rpm, but it's only when you cross 1,500 rpm that the motor starts feeling more comfortable. The turbo kicks in at ~2,000 rpm and if you're used to a strong turbo kick, you will be slightly disappointed by the soft power delivery of this unit. Even in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the Kylaq feels smooth. However, since the Kylaq has a manual handbrake, you don\u2019t get an auto-hold function, which is dearly missed when stuck in traffic. Overall, the city driveability is good and the power delivery is nice and linear. Combined with light electric power steering, good ergonomics and excellent all-round visibility, the Kylaq is very city-friendly.\n\nOut on the highway is where you will appreciate the mid-range and the top-end of the engine. Past the 2,000 rpm mark, the engine pulls nice and clean all the way to 5,500. If you're pushing hard, this is where you would want to be. A bonus here is that the engine doesn't sound coarse at high revs, in fact, it sounds quite sporty. Even beyond 5,500 rpm, the top-end isn't flat and the engine keeps pulling all the way to 6,600 rpm. Highway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. You will see the engine rpm settled at ~1,900 rpm at 100 km/h and ~2,400 at 120 km/h. All in all, the engine is fast enough for Indian roads.\n\nThe 6-speed torque converter is butter-smooth in its operation and you will barely notice the shifts happening. Also in day-to-day driving conditions, the torque converter automatic makes sure you are in the right gear almost all the time. We didn't find it getting confused or hunting for gears at any point and the AT will keep most drivers happy. There\u2019s an \u2018S\u2019 mode as well, which holds on to the gears a bit longer than the \u2018D\u2019 mode and is slightly more aggressive with the shifts. The claimed 0-100 km/h acceleration time for this automatic gearbox is 11.5 seconds. You also get a manual mode and there are paddle shifters if you want full control, but like most torque converters, these aren't very engaging. Most owners will just let the electronics do all the shifting.\n\nDriving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol 6MT\n\nThe 1.0 TSI engine is also offered with a 6-speed manual transmission (MQ200-6F). This is also the gearbox that we have seen on the other cars based on the MQB-IN platform. One of the first things you will notice when you depress the clutch is that the travel is long. It is not very heavy, but it\u2019s not as light as some of the Maruti cars. It does feel a bit springy as well when releasing. Getting off the line is however not that difficult and you can move smoothly. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t lug this engine as you might end up stalling. And in case you stall, all you need to do is press the clutch pedal all the way in and the engine fires back up. This is essentially an extension of the engine auto start/stop feature.\n\nThe gearbox has short throws and the gates are well defined. Moving through gears is not as smooth as say in the Maruti Brezza, but it\u2019s fairly convenient. Quick shifts while driving enthusiastically are handled well. The gear ratios are spread out nicely and you can putter around town in the first 3 gears comfortably. The maximum speed you can do in the 1st gear is 50 km/h and you can go up to 95 km/h in the 2nd gear.\n\nHighway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. The 6 gear ratios will help you extract maximum fuel efficiency from this motor. It revs at a comfortable ~2,100 rpm at 100 km/h and 2,500 rpm at 120 km/h in 6th gear. For a quick overtake, however, from cruising speeds, you might have to downshift to 4th to get the engine in its powerband. Skoda claims a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 10.5 seconds with this manual transmission.\n\nNoise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)\n\nThe 1.0L TSI is overall a refined motor. Despite being a 3-cylinder engine, the vibrations and noise are well controlled. On the move, things are fine at regular rpms. It's only when you hit high revs that the 3-cylinder thrum is obvious. But it\u2019s an enjoyable, sporty note. Road and tyre noise are also kept in check. On the other hand, wind noise did start creeping in at 90 km/h, but it was not excessive.\n\nMileage & Fuel economy\n\nIf driven with a light foot, the 1.0 TSI should give you an acceptable FE. However, do keep in mind that turbo-petrol cars are sensitive to throttle input and the torque converter automatic does sips in more fuel than a manual. So, drive the car hard and you'll see the tank needle drop very fast. To aid fuel efficiency, you get an idle start/stop system that shuts off the engine when the car is stationary and the gear position is neutral.\n\nClaimed fuel efficiency \u2013\n\n1.0 TSI MT \u2013 19.68 km/l\n\n1.0 TSI AT \u2013 19.05 km/l\n\n1.0L turbo-petrol engine makes 114 BHP @ 5,000-5,500 rpm and 178 Nm @ 1,750-4,000 rpm:\n\nNo insulation sheet under the bonnet:\n\nFuel tank capacity is 45 litres:\n\nSuspension\n\nRide Comfort\n\nBack in October last year, I got the chance to drive the pre-production version of the Kylaq at the CoASTT High Performance Centre in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and I was quite impressed with the ride and handling of the car. I was also looking forward to driving it on regular roads to get a hang of how it would be to live with the Kylaq. Overall, not a lot has changed from the pre-production version to the production version. The Kylaq comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam rear axle. The ride quality is very similar to the Kushaq which just hits the right spot. It\u2019s neither too soft nor too stiff. Owners used to driving some of the older German cars will appreciate this suspension tune. It has an underlying stiffness to it, which is why you feel the potholes in the cabin at low speeds. It\u2019s not uncomfortable though. The 17-inch wheels further add to the stiffness of the suspension. We expect the 16-inch rims to do better in this area.\n\nHandling & Dynamics\n\nGet up to highway speeds and the ride quality gets better. The Kylaq has sorted road manners and maintains composure at high speeds. Expansion joints or road undulations at highway speeds are handled nicely and don\u2019t unsettle the car very easily.\n\nI was impressed with the Kylaq when pushing it hard on the track and it is impressive on the regular roads as well. The wide front and rear track accompanied by short overhangs means that the Kylaq has a wide footprint. This makes the chassis more stable and gives it more grip around corners. Sure, there is some body roll due to the height of the car, but nothing alarming though. The turn-in is sharp and it\u2019s easy to place the car in the corners. Quick direction changes are also handled really well.\n\nSteering\n\nThe EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. It is still a level too light and comfort-oriented at high speeds and we wish Skoda had firmed things up a bit. Even when pushing the car hard in corners, you will wish for more weight along with the directness. It still feels a bit vague in the center. For day-to-day driving, however, it does the job pretty well.\n\nBraking\n\nThe Kylaq gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear which is more like a segment standard. The brakes perform well and are adequate for the performance on offer. Emergency braking maneuvers are also handled well and the car comes to a halt without much drama. The brake pedal is well-calibrated and feels sharp to use.\n\nContinue reading the discussion on the Skoda Kylaq on our forum.",

            "content": "BHPian scorpi0N recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nTrying to Decode Sales Numbers for Scorpio N\n\nSo, for some reason Mahindra doesn't disclose the sales data for Scorpio and Scorpio N separately. Take for instance the recent car sales data for September 2024, one can see the numbers for Scorpio but not for Scorpio N and Classic.\n\nI tried to do some back calculations based on an update shared by Mahindra on their official instagram page in February, which indicated that by February 1, 2024 there were 1 lakh Scorpio N on the street.\n\nThe delivery of Scorpio N started in September, 2022. This means that in 17 months (September 2022 to January 2024), a total of 1 lakh Scorpio N were sold.\n\nDuring this same time (based on monthly car sales data released on teambhp), a total of 1.05 lakh XUV 700 and 83k Thars were sold. The total sale of Scorpio during this time was 1.66 lakh which means 66k Scorpio Classics were sold. The breakup along with estimated monthly average is as below.\n\nThe data seems to indicate that at least till January 2024, Scorpio N and XUV 700 sales were very close to each other. This was slightly surprising for me as I have seen very few Scorpio Ns in Mumbai where XUV700 is ubiquitous. It is possible that Scorpio N is much more popular than XUV700 in non-metro cities and small towns perhaps. Now, when I come to think of it I did spot one Scorpio N in McCluskiegunj , which is perhaps one of the remotest towns/villages in India.\n\nThis does seem to indicate that Scorpio N has been a success in terms of sales. Then why Mahindra still produces the Classic? Just for record, I think that Mahindra Classic is a phenomenal vehicle! Anyway, if Mahindra had to move to a second generation Scorpio then why not move completely?\n\nOne can note that based on estimates, Scorpio Classic sales have been robust! Who is buying these vehicles? Now, this is just my guess, but I think Mahindra has a captive Scorpio Classic client base in many government organisations. I have noted that a significant portion, if not the entire, of the Mumbai RTO fleet, BMC fleet and many Navy cars in Mumbai are Scorpios (Classic and old generation Scorpios). Also for many politicians, who would want to travel with their bodyguards, Scorpio Classic with its sideways back seats is more practical perhaps. I guess Mahindra doesn't want to disturb this captive client base and, hence, is continuing the production of Scorpio Classic!\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

At each stage, Brambles earns daily hire fees for its pallets and crates.\n\nBHP shares\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nBXB & BHP share price valuation\n\nWe would consider BXB to be a \u2018mature\u2019 or \u2018blue-chip\u2019 business, so some of the metrics that could be worth considering include the debt/equity ratio, average yield, and return on equity, or ROE. These measures give us a sense of the company\u2019s debt levels, their ability to generate returns from their assets, and their ability to consistently return profits to shareholders.\n\nFor FY24, Brambles Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 81.8%, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nOver the last 5 years, BXB has delivered an average dividend yield of 2.7% per year. This is important to note if you\u2019re looking for income from your investments.\n\nFinally, in FY24, BXB reported an ROE of 25.6%. For a mature business you generally want to see an ROE of more than 10%, so BXB clears this hurdle.\n\n&BHP Group Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 45.3% in FY24, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nAs for dividends, since 2019 BHP has achieved an average dividend yield of 6.9% per year, and in FY24 reported an ROE of 19.7%\n\nKeep in mind that these are only a small selection of metrics.

Learn More\n\nAt a macro level, ASX shares outperformed investment property in 2024.\n\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) lifted 7.49% last year, with total gross returns (including dividends) of 11.44%.\n\nMeantime, the median national home value rose by 4.9%, with total gross returns (including weekly rents) of 8.9%, according to CoreLogic data.\n\nShares vs. property: What's the outlook for 2025?\n\nLooking ahead to the outlook for shares vs. property in 2025, Morgan Stanley predicts the ASX 200 will rise to about 8,500 points by year's end.\n\nThis implies a potential uplift of 1.08% from Friday's closing value of 8,408.9 points.\n\nDr Shane Oliver, Chief Economist at AMP Ltd (ASX: AMP), is more bullish.\n\nHe expects the ASX 200 to rise to 8,800 points by year's end, a potential 4.6% rise. But he factors in a \"highly likely\" 15% correction along the way.\n\nMeantime, Louis Christopher, Head of Research at SQM Research, expects capital city home values to rise by 1% to 4% under his base case scenario this year.\n\nHis base case involves a 25 to 50 basis-point interest rate cut in mid-2025, continued population growth above 500,000 per annum, and no inflationary outbreak.\n\nChristopher is more ambitious for home values if a rate cut occurs sooner, in the March quarter, and population growth continues at 500,000-plus. In this case, he predicts capital city price rises of 6% to 10%.\n\nCheck out Christopher's specific predictions from his annual Housing Boom and Bust Report below.\n\nWhich ASX stocks are ripe for investment?\n\nNow that we've looked at the macro view for shares vs. property, let's drill down to some specifics.\n\nBased on recent notes from top brokers, here are some ASX stock picks for your consideration this year.\n\nGoldman Sachs has a buy rating on BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) with a share price target of $46.80.\n\nA share price target is a broker's estimate of how much a stock will be trading for in 12 months' time.\n\nGoldman is also encouraging investors to buy the dip on Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) shares after a significant fall in 2024. Goldman has a $36.10 share price target on the supermarket giant.\n\nThe broker also likes Xero Limited (ASX: XRO) shares (price target $201), CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL) (price target $325.40), and Web Travel Group Ltd (ASX: WEB) (price target $7).\n\nMorgans has an add rating on Lovisa Holdings Ltd (ASX: LOV) with a 12-month price target of $36.\n\nThe broker also has add ratings on ASX gold stock Regis Resources Ltd (ASX: RRL) (price target $3.82), Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS) (price target $3.25), and Nextdc Ltd (ASX: NXT) (price target $20).\n\nBell Potter likes Boss Energy Ltd (ASX: BOE) and has a $4.70 price target on the uranium mining stock.\n\nThe broker also sees value in diversified asset manager HMC Capital Ltd (ASX: HMC) with a price target of $13.50.\n\nHot suburb picks for 2025\n\nThe CEO of McGrath Estate Agents, John McGrath, has outlined his top suburb picks along the East Coast of Australia for the new year.\n\nNational network LJ Hooker has also released its hot spot forecasts for 2025.\n\nIn NSW, McGrath likes Glebe, Millers Point, and Eastlakes in Sydney and Long Jetty on the Central Coast.\n\nLJ Hooker names Mosman, Freshwater, Blacktown, and Wattle Grove in Sydney, along with Orange and Warrawong in the regions, as 2025 hot spots.\n\nIn Victoria, McGrath likes Keilor East, St Kilda East, and Altona North in Melbourne. His top regional pick is Spring Gully, on the edge of Bendigo.\n\nLJ Hooker names Werribee and Frankston in Melbourne as hot spots, along with Geelong and Ballarat in the regions.\n\nIn Queensland, McGrath tips Springwood, Forest Lake, and North Ipswich in Brisbane. In the regions, he likes Caloundra West on the Sunshine Coast and Townsville in North Queensland.\n\nLJ Hooker tips Coorparoo and Springfield Lakes in Brisbane, along with Toowoomba and Nambour in the regions.\n\nIn Tasmania, McGrath likes Kingston in Hobart, Legana in Launceston, Latrobe in Devonport, and Primrose Sands in the regions. LJ Hooker also tips Kingston in Hobart.\n\nIn South Australia, LJ Hooker tips Hillcrest and Seacliff in Adelaide and Port Lincoln in the regions.\n\nOver in Western Australia, LJ Hooker names Innaloo in Perth and Busselton and Geraldton in the regions as areas to watch.\n\nIn the ACT, LJ Hooker names Kambah, Wright, and Amaroo as 2025 hot spots.\n\nMcGrath says affordability remains a key issue for buyers this year.\n\nHe says:\n\nThe age of 2% to 3% mortgage rates is over, and many buyers are responding to tighter credit by moving to more affordable areas, particularly along the coast, or buying smaller homes in the cities.\n\nLJ Hooker Head of Research, Mathew Tiller, says interest rates will \"heavily influence market performance in 2025, and the impact will be dependent on the timing and the depth of the cut\".\n\nHe comments:",

            "content": "Omkar Team-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2016 Location: Mumbai Posts: 2,815 Thanked: 28,728 Times\n\nDriving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol AT\n\n\n\nThe only engine option on the Kylaq is the 999cc, turbocharged, 3-cylinder, direct-injection petrol engine that puts out 114 BHP and 178 Nm. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic (AQ250-6F). It is shared with the Kushaq, Slavia, Taigun and the Virtus. The Kylaq doesn\u2019t get the bigger 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine that these cars get. Being the only engine option on offer puts the Kylaq at a bit of a disadvantage compared to some of the other cars in the segment. Cars like the Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and the Mahindra XUV3XO also have a diesel engine on offer. The Maruti Brezza and Tata Nexon also come with a factory-fitted CNG option.\n\n\n\nThe engine is pretty refined at idle and you don\u2019t get the typical 3-cylinder hum from the engine. Start driving and you\u2019ll notice that the throttle response is satisfactory and the Kylaq moves off the line with ease. The engine is tractable and isn't dead at low rpms. But, there is little turbo lag. If you want, you can pull from under 1,000 rpm, but it's only when you cross 1,500 rpm that the motor starts feeling more comfortable. The turbo kicks in at ~2,000 rpm and if you're used to a strong turbo kick, you will be slightly disappointed by the soft power delivery of this unit. Even in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the Kylaq feels smooth. However, since the Kylaq has a manual handbrake, you don\u2019t get an auto-hold function, which is dearly missed when stuck in traffic. Overall, the city driveability is good and the power delivery is nice and linear. Combined with light electric power steering, good ergonomics and excellent all-round visibility, the Kylaq is very city-friendly.\n\n\n\nOut on the highway is where you will appreciate the mid-range and the top-end of the engine. Past the 2,000 rpm mark, the engine pulls nice and clean all the way to 5,500. If you're pushing hard, this is where you would want to be. A bonus here is that the engine doesn't sound coarse at high revs, in fact, it sounds quite sporty. Even beyond 5,500 rpm, the top-end isn't flat and the engine keeps pulling all the way to 6,600 rpm. Highway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. You will see the engine rpm settled at ~1,900 rpm at 100 km/h and ~2,400 at 120 km/h. All in all, the engine is fast enough for Indian roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 6-speed torque converter is butter-smooth in its operation and you will barely notice the shifts happening. Also in day-to-day driving conditions, the torque converter automatic makes sure you are in the right gear almost all the time. We didn't find it getting confused or hunting for gears at any point and the AT will keep most drivers happy. There\u2019s an \u2018S\u2019 mode as well, which holds on to the gears a bit longer than the \u2018D\u2019 mode and is slightly more aggressive with the shifts. The claimed 0-100 km/h acceleration time for this automatic gearbox is 11.5 seconds. You also get a manual mode and there are paddle shifters if you want full control, but like most torque converters, these aren't very engaging. Most owners will just let the electronics do all the shifting.\n\n\n\nDriving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol 6MT\n\nThe 1.0 TSI engine is also offered with a 6-speed manual transmission (MQ200-6F). This is also the gearbox that we have seen on the other cars based on the MQB-IN platform. One of the first things you will notice when you depress the clutch is that the travel is long. It is not very heavy, but it\u2019s not as light as some of the Maruti cars. It does feel a bit springy as well when releasing. Getting off the line is however not that difficult and you can move smoothly. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t lug this engine as you might end up stalling. And in case you stall, all you need to do is press the clutch pedal all the way in and the engine fires back up. This is essentially an extension of the engine auto start/stop feature.\n\n\n\nThe gearbox has short throws and the gates are well defined. Moving through gears is not as smooth as say in the Maruti Brezza, but it\u2019s fairly convenient. Quick shifts while driving enthusiastically are handled well. The gear ratios are spread out nicely and you can putter around town in the first 3 gears comfortably. The maximum speed you can do in the 1st gear is 50 km/h and you can go up to 95 km/h in the 2nd gear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. The 6 gear ratios will help you extract maximum fuel efficiency from this motor. It revs at a comfortable ~2,100 rpm at 100 km/h and 2,500 rpm at 120 km/h in 6th gear. For a quick overtake, however, from cruising speeds, you might have to downshift to 4th to get the engine in its powerband. Skoda claims a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 10.5 seconds with this manual transmission.\n\n\n\nNoise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)\n\n\n\nThe 1.0L TSI is overall a refined motor. Despite being a 3-cylinder engine, the vibrations and noise are well controlled. On the move, things are fine at regular rpms. It's only when you hit high revs that the 3-cylinder thrum is obvious. But it\u2019s an enjoyable, sporty note. Road and tyre noise are also kept in check. On the other hand, wind noise did start creeping in at 90 km/h, but it was not excessive.\n\n\n\nMileage & Fuel economy\n\n\n\nIf driven with a light foot, the 1.0 TSI should give you an acceptable FE. However, do keep in mind that turbo-petrol cars are sensitive to throttle input and the torque converter automatic does sips in more fuel than a manual. So, drive the car hard and you'll see the tank needle drop very fast. To aid fuel efficiency, you get an idle start/stop system that shuts off the engine when the car is stationary and the gear position is neutral.\n\n\n\nClaimed fuel efficiency \u2013\n\n1.0 TSI MT \u2013 19.68 km/l\n\n1.0 TSI AT \u2013 19.05 km/l\n\n\n\n1.0L turbo-petrol engine makes 114 BHP @ 5,000-5,500 rpm and 178 Nm @ 1,750-4,000 rpm:\n\n\n\n\n\nNo insulation sheet under the bonnet:\n\n\n\n\n\nFuel tank capacity is 45 litres:\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspension\n\n\n\nRide Comfort\n\n\n\nBack in October last year, I got the chance to drive the\n\n\n\nHandling & Dynamics\n\n\n\nGet up to highway speeds and the ride quality gets better. The Kylaq has sorted road manners and maintains composure at high speeds. Expansion joints or road undulations at highway speeds are handled nicely and don\u2019t unsettle the car very easily.\n\n\n\nI was impressed with the Kylaq when pushing it hard on the track and it is impressive on the regular roads as well. The wide front and rear track accompanied by short overhangs means that the Kylaq has a wide footprint. This makes the chassis more stable and gives it more grip around corners. Sure, there is some body roll due to the height of the car, but nothing alarming though. The turn-in is sharp and it\u2019s easy to place the car in the corners. Quick direction changes are also handled really well.\n\n\n\nSteering\n\n\n\nThe EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. It is still a level too light and comfort-oriented at high speeds and we wish Skoda had firmed things up a bit. Even when pushing the car hard in corners, you will wish for more weight along with the directness. It still feels a bit vague in the center. For day-to-day driving, however, it does the job pretty well.\n\n\n\nBraking\n\n\n\nThe Kylaq gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear which is more like a segment standard. The brakes perform well and are adequate for the performance on offer. Emergency braking maneuvers are also handled well and the car comes to a halt without much drama. The brake pedal is well-calibrated and feels sharp to use. The only engine option on the Kylaq is the 999cc, turbocharged, 3-cylinder, direct-injection petrol engine that puts out 114 BHP and 178 Nm. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic (AQ250-6F). It is shared with the Kushaq, Slavia, Taigun and the Virtus.

Also in day-to-day driving conditions, the torque converter automatic makes sure you are in the right gear almost all the time. We didn't find it getting confused or hunting for gears at any point and the AT will keep most drivers happy. There\u2019s an \u2018S\u2019 mode as well, which holds on to the gears a bit longer than the \u2018D\u2019 mode and is slightly more aggressive with the shifts. The claimed 0-100 km/h acceleration time for this automatic gearbox is 11.5 seconds. You also get a manual mode and there are paddle shifters if you want full control, but like most torque converters, these aren't very engaging. Most owners will just let the electronics do all the shifting.The 1.0 TSI engine is also offered with a 6-speed manual transmission (MQ200-6F). This is also the gearbox that we have seen on the other cars based on the MQB-IN platform. One of the first things you will notice when you depress the clutch is that the travel is long. It is not very heavy, but it\u2019s not as light as some of the Maruti cars. It does feel a bit springy as well when releasing. Getting off the line is however not that difficult and you can move smoothly. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t lug this engine as you might end up stalling. And in case you stall, all you need to do is press the clutch pedal all the way in and the engine fires back up. This is essentially an extension of the engine auto start/stop feature.The gearbox has short throws and the gates are well defined. Moving through gears is not as smooth as say in the Maruti Brezza, but it\u2019s fairly convenient. Quick shifts while driving enthusiastically are handled well. The gear ratios are spread out nicely and you can putter around town in the first 3 gears comfortably. The maximum speed you can do in the 1st gear is 50 km/h and you can go up to 95 km/h in the 2nd gear.Highway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. The 6 gear ratios will help you extract maximum fuel efficiency from this motor. It revs at a comfortable ~2,100 rpm at 100 km/h and 2,500 rpm at 120 km/h in 6th gear. For a quick overtake, however, from cruising speeds, you might have to downshift to 4th to get the engine in its powerband. Skoda claims a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 10.5 seconds with this manual transmission.The 1.0L TSI is overall a refined motor. Despite being a 3-cylinder engine, the vibrations and noise are well controlled. On the move, things are fine at regular rpms. It's only when you hit high revs that the 3-cylinder thrum is obvious. But it\u2019s an enjoyable, sporty note. Road and tyre noise are also kept in check. On the other hand, wind noise did start creeping in at 90 km/h, but it was not excessive.If driven with a light foot, the 1.0 TSI should give you an acceptable FE. However, do keep in mind that turbo-petrol cars are sensitive to throttle input and the torque converter automatic does sips in more fuel than a manual. So, drive the car hard and you'll see the tank needle drop very fast. To aid fuel efficiency, you get an idle start/stop system that shuts off the engine when the car is stationary and the gear position is neutral.Claimed fuel efficiency \u20131.0 TSI MT \u2013 19.68 km/l1.0 TSI AT \u2013 19.05 km/l1.0L turbo-petrol engine makes 114 BHP @ 5,000-5,500 rpm and 178 Nm @ 1,750-4,000 rpm:No insulation sheet under the bonnet:Fuel tank capacity is 45 litres:Back in October last year, I got the chance to drive the pre-production version of the Kylaq at the CoASTT High Performance Centre in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and I was quite impressed with the ride and handling of the car. I was also looking forward to driving it on regular roads to get a hang of how it would be to live with the Kylaq. Overall, not a lot has changed from the pre-production version to the production version. The Kylaq comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam rear axle. The ride quality is very similar to the Kushaq which just hits the right spot. It\u2019s neither too soft nor too stiff. Owners used to driving some of the older German cars will appreciate this suspension tune. It has an underlying stiffness to it, which is why you feel the potholes in the cabin at low speeds. It\u2019s not uncomfortable though. The 17-inch wheels further add to the stiffness of the suspension. We expect the 16-inch rims to do better in this area.Get up to highway speeds and the ride quality gets better. The Kylaq has sorted road manners and maintains composure at high speeds. Expansion joints or road undulations at highway speeds are handled nicely and don\u2019t unsettle the car very easily.I was impressed with the Kylaq when pushing it hard on the track and it is impressive on the regular roads as well. The wide front and rear track accompanied by short overhangs means that the Kylaq has a wide footprint. This makes the chassis more stable and gives it more grip around corners. Sure, there is some body roll due to the height of the car, but nothing alarming though. The turn-in is sharp and it\u2019s easy to place the car in the corners. Quick direction changes are also handled really well.The EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. It is still a level too light and comfort-oriented at high speeds and we wish Skoda had firmed things up a bit. Even when pushing the car hard in corners, you will wish for more weight along with the directness. It still feels a bit vague in the center. For day-to-day driving, however, it does the job pretty well.The Kylaq gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear which is more like a segment standard. The brakes perform well and are adequate for the performance on offer. Emergency braking maneuvers are also handled well and the car comes to a halt without much drama. The brake pedal is well-calibrated and feels sharp to use. Last edited by Omkar : 26th January 2025 at 11:12 .",

With Ola, let me be honest, sprocket kit wearing off would be the least of my worries. There're bigger fears, if you know what I mean (yes, you know).\n\n\n\nI think we need to properly research the chain-sprocket size-to-life assumptions before we can conclude something.\n\nA bigger sprocket may spread the torque caused wear over more teeth, thus causing lesser damage. As for the front, it might be expected to wear faster, but then since the teeth are less, we might as well see less chain slack on the front being worn out, which means the wear might not even be detected till the end.\n\nMy point is, there's no point with talks contradicting each other. And nothing can be concluded without research.\n\n\n\nThen again, not a single person mentioned metallurgy. How come? Stronger chain alloy will result in sprockets absorbing the wear more, and vice versa. We can ignore metallurgy for standardised chain sprockets from Rolon or so, but this Ola's kit looks anything but off the shelf Rolon, so this is a point too.\n\n\n\nThen, the big, BIG variable:- on any tested bike, if you conclude that a bigger rear sprocket lasts less, you have totally ignored the lower gearing(which happened due to the sprocket itself), which caused lower distance travelled anyways, ruining the longetivity stats for any undergeared setup.\n\nTo ensure a fair test, the gearing must not change even though sprockets change. This is rare to achieve.\n\nMy own '13 Duke 390 is on larger rear sprocket and now it seems the kit will be replaced at 12k something, but its undergeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyhow, knowledge debate aside, what happened to that Rs. 2.5L Roadster Pro is what I'm more interested in.\n\nThey announced that right before their IPO, so... will it happen?\n\nIs a 580 kms ranged(or even 200 for that matter) 200 kmph bike possible for 2.5L?",

            "content": "BHPian ravib recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI travelled from Madras to Bangalore via Thiruvallur-Thiruttani-RK Pet-Sholingur-Ponnai-Chittoor-Bangalore on Jan 1st 2025. Many Thanks to @SRVM for his guidance always.\n\nMy main idea was to avoid regular Sriperumbudur-Kanchipuram-Chennasamudram road, for 3 main reasons\n\nSo many BHPians reported atrocious road conditions in this stretch damaging tyres and vehicles Volume of traffic expected on a holiday Explore newer option to see how it works in terms of time and road conditions.\n\nMy last trip post Deepavali, i tried and explored Ranipet-Ponnai-Chittoor route, to avoid Bommasamudram railway crossing work , so am familiar about road conditions via Ponnai Route which was good. What i wanted to explore this time is about the timing,\n\nFrom a distance KMs perspective , Thiruvallur-Thiruttani-Sholingur-Ponnai route is negligible as it is just less than 10 kms more.\n\nHowever, the driving time wise, it is definitely 30 minutes to 1 hour more due to narrow roads, and we have to get in and out of these towns. To top up, i travelled on Jan 1st and there were multiple villages which were celebrating new year in village temples and churches, particularly in Tiruttani, Sholingur, and Karimalai Murugan temple areas. Only savior was being a holiday on Jan 1st, passing through Chittoor town was pretty quick as there was no traffic.\n\nStarted at sharp 12 noon from Pallavaram on Jan 1st and it took solid 45 minutes to reach ThirumazhaiIsai junction to take right towards Thiruvallur.\n\nAnd then due to scattered traffic all the way and huge traffic pile up in Thiruvallur town, mainly at PS4 restaurants due to proper lunch time, and a slow drive , reduced average KMPH coverage and overall it took me about 4:15 minutes to get out of Chittoor town, which is about 45 minutes more than Kanchipuram-Ranipet route normally from Pallavaram.\n\nMay be i can assume, it would have been same time on Jan 1st in Kanchipuram route , given bad roads and more traffic, just to make myself feel better\n\nDownside of this route is post Thiruvallur, till Chittoor/Bangarupalayam Nandi Food plaza, there are no good food/rest room stop overs. So have to plan accordingly.\n\nPost Mahasamudram Toll Plaza, continued to drive till Krishna grand after Nangli Toll and took a break for 30 mts and then continued the journey and reached Bangalore around 8 pm. So overall it was almost 8 hours including a 30 minutes break !\n\nIn current state, due to bad roads and diversions\n\nBangalore-Krishnagiri-Chennasamudram-Madras is 80% pain,\n\nBangalore-Chittoor-Ranipet-Chennasamudram-Madras is 40% pain.\n\nThe alternate with good roads but narrow and slow is via Chittoor-Ponnai-Sholingur-Tiruttani-Thiruvallur route or via Chittoor-Pallipat-Nagari-Tiruttani-Thiruvallur route.\n\nIn net effect, we have to choose which one to take till BCE comes up or atleast the Chennasamudram to Sriperumbudur is patched up !\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIf you are okay to risk the vehicle wheel alignment and balancing and driving in day time, continue to take Chennasamudram-Kanchipuram-Sriperumbudur route.\n\nIf you have a low GC sedan, ready to spend another 30 mts to 45 minutes and not in urge to drive at high speeds, go with Chittoor-Ponnai route.\n\nAvoid night drives/post dark travels either way between Chittoor to Madras stretch in both directions !\n\nHere is the google maps link i took between Thirumazhaisai to Mahasamudram Toll. Thanks to srvm again!\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Nickel is a versatile metal critical for the clean energy revolution, especially in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Its role in enhancing battery energy density and efficiency makes it indispensable for longer-range EVs.\n\nAs global demand for nickel surges, driven by electrification and renewable energy needs, it becomes a focal point for investors seeking growth opportunities.\n\nWith EV adoption accelerating, nickel demand is set to soar. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, over 50% of nickel demand growth by 2030 will come from battery production, requiring an estimated 1.5 million metric tons annually.\n\nThe global shift toward high-energy-density batteries further cements nickel\u2019s role. Additionally, global investment in nickel mining and refining infrastructure could surpass $66 billion by 2030, ensuring long-term supply stability.\n\nFor investors, the opportunity is immense. As automakers and governments prioritize EV adoption, demand for nickel could outpace supply, driving prices higher. Companies leading the charge in sustainable nickel production are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, making them attractive investment options in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHowever, investing in nickel stocks comes with its challenges. The mining industry is highly cyclical, with stock prices often fluctuating alongside nickel\u2019s market value. Geopolitical events have further strained global nickel supplies and added volatility to the market. To mitigate risks, diversifying with a basket of nickel stocks could be a smart strategy.\n\nWith this in mind, here are four nickel companies to watch in 2025, known for their strategic importance and potential in the global nickel market:\n\nVale S.A.: A Nickel Powerhouse Driving the Energy Transition\n\nVale is a global leader in nickel production, playing a crucial role in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy. With a US$38.52 billion market cap, the company accounts for 6%-7% of the global nickel supply. This makes the nickel company a critical supplier of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy technologies.\n\nIn 2024, Vale produced 179,000 metric tons of nickel, with operations spanning Brazil, Canada, and Indonesia. The company has invested heavily in sustainable mining practices, including its flagship Voisey\u2019s Bay and Sudbury operations in Canada.\n\nVoisey\u2019s Bay alone could add 45,000 metric tons of nickel annually once its underground expansion is completed in 2025.\n\nVale is also at the forefront of decarbonization. Its revolutionary On\u00e7a Puma ferronickel operation in Brazil integrates energy efficiency measures that reduce CO\u2082 emissions. The chart below shows the nickel company\u2019s GHG emissions profile.\n\nIn Indonesia, Vale partners with local entities to develop high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) facilities to meet the growing demand for high-grade Class 1 nickel.\n\nWith EV adoption expected to skyrocket, Vale is aggressively expanding its nickel refining capacity. The company has partnered with automakers, including Tesla, to secure long-term nickel supply agreements.\n\nVale\u2019s low-carbon nickel production technology, certified for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional methods, is a key selling point for environmentally conscious investors.\n\nHere\u2019s the company\u2019s recent financial performance:\n\nLooking ahead, Vale plans to invest over $3 billion to modernize its nickel operations and further reduce carbon emissions. With a clear focus on nickel\u2019s role in EVs, renewable energy, and advanced technologies, the nickel miner continues to attract investors seeking exposure to the green energy revolution.\n\nNorilsk Nickel: The World\u2019s Largest Nickel Producer Driving Sustainability and Innovation\n\nNorilsk Nickel or Nornickel, the world\u2019s largest producer of refined nickel with a US$19.39 billion market cap, is a powerhouse in the global metals market. Headquartered in Russia, the company accounts for over 20% of global high-grade nickel production and operates key assets on the Taimyr and Kola Peninsulas.\n\nWith its commitment to innovation and sustainability, Nornickel is central to the transition toward greener technologies like EVs. Below is the company\u2019s most recent financial highlights:\n\nIn 2024 (9 months), Nornickel produced approximately 146,210 metric tons of nickel, maintaining its status as a reliable supplier for the EV battery industry. The company\u2019s focus on sustainable mining practices includes its pioneering carbon-neutral nickel production program, launched to support global decarbonization goals.\n\nNornickel has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, making it an attractive choice for ESG-focused investors. The nickel company\u2019s GHG emissions have decreased since 2021.\n\nThe key to Nornickel\u2019s success is technological innovation. The company is advancing the use of artificial intelligence and automation across its operations, improving efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.\n\nNotably, its Bystrinsky Mining and Processing Plant is recognized as one of the world\u2019s most advanced facilities, producing nickel, copper , and other critical materials essential for EVs.\n\nTo ensure long-term supply stability, the mining giant is investing in exploration and modernization. The company plans to invest $8 billion by 2030 to upgrade its facilities and boost production of high-purity nickel, a key component of EV batteries. This includes expanding its Arctic operations, which hold vast untapped reserves of Class 1 nickel.\n\nBy securing long-term partnerships with global automakers and battery manufacturers, Nornickel is well-positioned to capitalize on the EV boom. Its commitment to sustainability, cutting-edge technologies, and robust supply chain solutions make it a top choice for investors looking to ride the wave of electrification.\n\nBHP Group: A Global Leader in Sustainable Nickel Supply for EV Growth\n\nBHP is one of the world\u2019s largest mining companies and is diversifying its portfolio to include more nickel production. The company\u2019s Nickel West operation, located in Western Australia, is a fully integrated business covering mining, smelting, and refining. This operation focuses on producing high-quality nickel products designed specifically for the EV battery supply chain.\n\nThe mining giant has invested around $3 billion since 2020 to develop a green nickel hub. However, as of mid-2024, BHP has paused its ambitions for this hub due to market challenges.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent financial achievements are as follows, with a $126.29 billion market cap:\n\nIn 2024, BHP\u2019s Nickel West produced over 80,000 metric tons of nickel, with 85% of this output directed toward EV battery manufacturers. The operation\u2019s commitment to sustainability is evident in its low-carbon production processes, supported by investments in renewable energy.\n\nFor instance, BHP recently announced a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at Nickel West by 2030 , aligning with its broader decarbonization goals.\n\nBHP is also ramping up its exploration efforts to secure future nickel resources through various initiatives. This includes its West Musgrave Project which it integrates into its portfolio following the acquisition of OZ Minerals in May 2023. This project is in the early stages of execution and is expected to significantly contribute to BHP\u2019s nickel production upon completion.\n\nThe company is investing billions over the next five years to expand its nickel production capacity and modernize its operations. This includes developing the Venus nickel deposit and upgrading the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter and Kwinana Refinery. These efforts are aimed at meeting the surging demand for high-grade Class 1 nickel, essential for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nPartnerships play a significant role in BHP\u2019s strategy. The company has secured long-term agreements with major automakers like Tesla and Toyota to supply sustainable nickel for EV batteries.

Parking brake had some slack and wheel alignment seemed a bit off - requested them to address both the issues. Even though the dealerships/workshops have changed few times (Friends Auto: Bimal Auto - Indira nagar, EVM Porsche: Raja Skoda - Doddankundi, VST: VW Victoria road, VST: Porsche Whitefield) - it's the same mechanic who has been servicing my car.\n\nI checked the underbody to see how the car is holding up on our world class roads - bruised but not broken!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy kid tagged along hoping to see some cool cars. There was a new 992.2 going through the PDI and a 992.1 convertible that was being serviced.\n\nFinal damage to the pocket was Rs 60K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn rare occasions, I get special permission to go for a late night drive\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

(BHP Canada) and Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin Mining) have completed the acquisition of Filo Corp., a Toronto Stock Exchange listed company (the Filo Acquisition). Filo Corp. owns 100% of the Filo del Sol (FDS) copper project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBHP Canada and Lundin Mining have also formed the Canadian-incorporated joint venture company, Vicu\u00f1a Corp. (the Joint Venture) to hold the FDS copper project and the Josemaria copper project located in the Vicu\u00f1a district of Argentina and Chile (together with the Filo Acquisition, the Transaction). BHP Canada and Lundin Mining each own 50% of the Joint Venture.\n\nPrior to completion, Lundin Mining owned 100% of the Josemaria project. At completion, BHP Canada acquired a 50% interest in the Josemaria copper project from Lundin Mining. BHP Canada and Lundin Mining then contributed their respective 50% interests in Filo Corp. and the Josemaria project into the Joint Venture.\n\nBHP\u2019s total cash payment for the Transaction was US$2.0 billion.\n\nMike Henry, Chief Executive Officer of BHP said:\n\n\u201cBHP is pleased to be partnering with Lundin Mining in the Vicu\u00f1a Joint Venture, an exciting new copper growth opportunity for both companies. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of Lundin Mining and BHP, the development of Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s projects aims to deliver substantial value to shareholders, as well as to other stakeholders. The projects will be developed and will operate in line with international industry standards.\n\nBHP is one of the world\u2019s leading producers of copper, a metal essential to global economic growth, the energy transition and to the rapidly growing demand for data centres to support the harnessing of artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nDetails of the Transaction\n\nThe Filo Acquisition was approved by Filo Corp shareholders on 26 September 2024 and the final court order for the plan of arrangement has been obtained.\n\nThe total consideration for the Filo Acquisition was C$4.0 billion excluding the Filo shares already held by Lundin Mining and BHP respectively. BHP Canada\u2019s share of the consideration for the Filo Acquisition was C$2.0 billion (US$1.4 billion) in cash at C$33.00 per Filo Corp. share. Lundin Mining\u2019s share of the consideration for the Filo Acquisition was C$877.8 million in cash and 94.1 million Lundin Mining shares.\n\nBHP Canada paid Lundin Mining US$690 million cash consideration for a 50% interest in the Josemaria project.\n\nThe Joint Venture is governed by a joint venture shareholder agreement which is between BHP Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lundin Mining, and Vicu\u00f1a Corp. Vicu\u00f1a Corp. will be the operator (acting independently from BHP Canada and Lundin Mining) and will be responsible for the management of the projects.

            "content": "BHPian Windingroads recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI had my own bucket list of places I wanted to visit one day. Since I've been based in Kashmir for two years so trying to tackle the list as much as I can.\n\nSo It went like...\n\nDay 1 (12-OCT-2024)\n\nWoke up early, completed my morning rituals, packed essentials, and hopped on my Tokyo (Name of my V-Strom SX). Although I was a bit late, still okay since I encountered only 6-7 vehicles until Sinthan Pass (riding from Kishtwar) and the freedom was exhilarating!\n\nI didn't stop at Sinthan Pass, as I'd been there many times before. Instead rode downhill towards Daksum, where I stopped for breakfast. Nun-Chai and an egg omelette there, then continued towards Anantnag/Islamabad (Anantnag is also known as Islamabad among locals, its historical name)\n\nVisited Ancient Martand Surya Temple Anantnag\n\nHaving booked Zostel Pahalgam prior I reached around 14:00.\n\nAfter checking in and freshening up, went to the common room and met a few fellow travellers (most of whom were solo travellers) and then I headed to Aru Valley with another solo buddy on his rented scooty.\n\nWe reached Aru, where there was a large crowd at the base, bought apples from a local vendor and hiked to a less crowded spot, where we enjoyed the apples and met a family of nomads and negotiated a deal to take pictures with the children \u2013 three packets of biscuits for a few photos!\n\nReturning to the hostel had an amazing dinner time with the hosts and fellow travellers\n\nDay 2 (13-OCT-2024)\n\nStarted early from the hostel and set my navigation to Margan Pass. I downloaded offline maps, which became a saviour later. I rode on the same route until Vailoo (Kokernag), then took a left turn towards Margan.\n\nRode across several villages, receiving thumbs-ups and smiles from the locals. Network coverage disappeared after a few miles, leaving me alone with Tokyo and the beautiful mountains. The roads were decent until I began climbing Margan Pass, where roadwork was in progress with few broken patches and fresh tarmac in patches. After climbing 12-15 hairpin bends, I finally reached Margan. Surprisingly there was nobody at the pass, so I rode further to partially constructed JKTDC huts.\n\nDropped my riding gear, changed into normal clothes with a fleece jacket, and then saw a Himalayan 411 approaching from Marwah Valley., A couple on the bike had been traveling for over a month in Himachal and Kashmir so we teamed up and started hiking towards Chaurnag Lakes (one of the easiest alpine lake treks in J&K, with a 6-7 km circuit trek).\n\nMet a group of five local guys from Kashmir, who were also attempting the trek for the first time.\n\nIt was 3 PM when we reached the third lake, so I decided to head back. While descending, I saw a few tourists which were fine but only after a few steps, I saw some empty food packets and a plastic water bottle that weren't there earlier. I was disappointed to see the litter and thought about hiking back to those people with the trash, but only settled for shouting a few abusive words (and it was intense as well and loud, I hope they have heard the words) due to the timing as I bit far away from my place and way back there was still 5-5:30 hrs with climb to Sinthan Pass so I collected the trash and headed back to Margan Pass, changed into my riding gear, and reached home around 20:30.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump\u2018s revoking the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit hasn\u2019t discouraged mining companies from continuing to source critical materials needed for EV manufacturing.\n\nRio Tinto RIO CEO Jakob Stausholm, for example, remains optimistic about the global demand for lithium. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Stausholm noted, \u201cLithium demand will probably go up another five times over the next 15 years.\u201d\n\nStausholm also praised Trump\u2019s greenlighting of the Resolution mine in Arizona. Resolution is a massive joint venture project with BHP Group BHP that could become the biggest copper mine on the continent, the companies claim.\n\n\u201cI do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he told the Financial Times. The $64 billion project has an estimated life span of a 60-years. It\u2019s expected to produce over 1 billion pounds of copper per year or around 25% of the U.S. needs.\n\nTrump\u2019s interest in Greenland is also said to go deeper than simply projecting power on the global stage. The Denmark-owned island is home to 25 of the 34 critical metals (per the EU\u2019s classification). Companies like Australia-based Energy Transition Minerals have already mapped over one billion tons of mineral resources. This includes heavy rare earth metals like terbium, neodymium, dysprosium, and uranium.\n\nAs of January, Greenland has one active mine. In 2023, there were two.\n\nAnother key focus of Trump's critical minerals strategy may be deep-sea mining. The Metals Company TMC, a prospective deep-sea miner, plans to submit its first application to the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in June.\n\nThe Vancouver, British Columbia-based company seeks approval to extract polymetallic nodules from the ocean floor. These nodules contain cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements crucial for battery and electronics production.\n\nTMC's application, with support from the Republic of Nauru, could face hurdles as ISA\u2019s new Secretary-General, Leticia Carvalho, has touted sustainability and equity in deep-sea mining governance.\n\n\"Our mandate is both a privilege and a responsibility\u2014to act in the interest of all humankind,\" Carvalho said after assuming the leadership role earlier this month.\n\nDespite this, TMC remains undeterred. CFO Craig Shesky told Benzinga last summer, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop [deep-sea mining] at this point. This is now inevitable.\u201d\n\nWith Trump's administration favoring deregulation and resource independence, TMC may find a more conducive environment for advancing its ambitions.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

            "content": "BHP's Western Australian Iron Ore sales of 64 million metric tons in second quarter fiscal 2025 are 3% up on the same quarter of fiscal 2024. First-half sales of 128 million metric tons are similar to last year. First-half copper sales of 730,000 metric tons are up 10%, driven by Escondida.\n\nWhy it matters: Production and cost guidance are reiterated, except for a modest reduction in production at the company's South Australian copper operations.\n\nWe forecast fiscal 2025 attributable copper sales volumes of around 1.4 million metric tons, similar to last year. We also still expect unit cash costs of about USD 1.55 per pound for Escondida.\n\nWe continue to forecast BHP's share of WAIO sales in fiscal 2025 to be around 255 million metric tons, about the same as fiscal 2024. Our estimate for WAIO unit cash costs of around USD 19.20 per metric ton is also unchanged and is a 6% increase on last year due to inflation.\n\nThe bottom line: Lower fiscal 2025 South Australia copper volumes are immaterial and we maintain our fair value estimate for no-moat BHP of AUD 40 per share. Shares trade close to fair value.\n\nKey stats: Its average realized iron ore price of about USD 88 per metric ton is modestly below our assumption of USD 91 for fiscal 2025. However, we assume modestly higher prices over the remainder of the fiscal year based on the futures curve.\n\nLong view: We expect iron ore demand from China to moderate in the longer term as steel production peaks and starts to decline as its economy moves from one reliant on fixed-asset investment to a more consumption-based economy.\n\nChina\u2019s falling population and rising scrap-based production contribute to reduced demand for iron ore. We also think additional supply is likely, led by Simandou and Vale.\n\nHence, we expect a long-term price substantially below the current spot of around USD 100 per metric ton. Based on our estimate of the marginal cost of production, we assume a midcycle iron ore price of about USD 72 from 2029.\n\nBHP's iron ore and copper mines performing solidly; Shares close to fair value\n\nBHP is the world\u2019s largest miner by market capitalization. Its main operations span iron ore and copper, with smaller contributions from metallurgical coal, thermal coal, and nickel. The company is also developing its Jansen potash project in Canada. BHP merged its oil and gas assets with Woodside Energy in June 2022, vesting the Woodside shares it received to BHP shareholders, and exiting the sector. It purchased copper miner Oz Minerals in fiscal 2023.\n\nCommodity demand is tied to global economic growth, China\u2019s in particular. BHP benefited greatly from the China boom over the past two decades. China is BHP's largest customer, accounting for roughly 60% of sales in fiscal 2024. With demand for many commodities likely to soften as the China boom ends, particularly iron ore which has disproportionately benefited from the boom in infrastructure and real estate investment, we think the outlook is for earnings to materially decline.\n\nIts generally low-cost, high-quality assets mean BHP is likely to be one of the few miners that remains profitable through the commodity cycle. Much of the company's operations are located close to key Asian markets, particularly the low-cost iron ore business, providing a modest freight cost advantage relative to some producers such as those in Africa and South America.\n\nBHP correctly values a strong balance sheet to provide some stability through the inevitable cycles and derives some modest benefit from commodity and geographic diversification.\n\nMuch of its revenue comes from assets in the relative safe haven of Australia. The development of Jansen in Canada is BHP\u2019s major expansion project, with the company also pursuing modest expansion of its Western Australia Iron Ore operations above 290 million metric tons per year.\n\nThe good times during the height of the China boom saw significant capital expenditure, notably on iron ore and onshore US shale gas and oil. Overinvestment in the boom diluted returns to the point where we struggle to justify a moat. As a commodity producer, BHP lacks pricing power and is a price taker.\n\nBHP bulls say\n\nBHP is a beneficiary of continued global economic growth and demand for the commodities it produces.\n\nBHP\u2019s Jansen potash project gives it additional diversification, with potash being less correlated to the other commodities it produces.\n\nBHP's iron ore assets are industry-leading. The company remains well placed to continue low-cost production and increase output with minimal expenditure and an efficiency focus.\n\nBHP bears say\n\nBHP has shown improved capital allocation since its missteps during the China boom, but continuing high commodity prices could encourage it to once again aggressively expand output.\n\nWith its earnings dominated by iron ore and copper, structurally lower demand from China could lead to significantly lower earnings.\n\nResource companies could face growing sovereign risk as governments under fiscal pressure look to plug budgetary holes by taxing the industry.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) shares were in focus on Tuesday when the mining giant released its second quarter and first half update.\n\nAs we covered here, BHP's CEO, Mike Henry, revealed that \"BHP delivered safe and reliable performance in the first half. Our flagship copper, iron ore and steelmaking coal assets delivered particularly strong production in the period.\"\n\nHowever, while its shares were trading higher for much of the session, they eventually closed the day flat.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity for investors? Let's see what one leading broker is saying about BHP now.\n\nWhat are brokers saying?\n\nAccording to a note out of Goldman Sachs, its analysts remain positive on the Big Australian following its \"strong\" quarterly update. The broker said:\n\nBHP reported a strong Dec Q with production beats vs. GSe in copper (+9%) and iron ore with FY25 production expected to be at the upper end of the guidance range.\n\nGoldman also highlights that BHP is coming close to its debt ceiling. However, the broker feels that the miner should scrap its current limits. It explains:\n\nBHP has guided to net debt of US$11.5-12.5bn at the end of Dec above GSe US$10.8bn, and at the end of FY25 net debt is expected to be around the top end of the US$5-15bn target range following completion of the Filo Mining acquisition (US$2bn investment) and payment of the Samarco settlement obligations. We reiterate our view that BHP's net debt ceiling appears conservative, as the company is growing EBITDA. In our view, setting balance sheet targets on a leverage ratio rather than net debt basis could be more appropriate as BHP enters a period of organic (and possibly inorganic) growth (for instance, ~1x through the cycle; note 20yr average is ~0.6x, and we see leverage peaking at 0.7x later this decade vs current leverage of 0.5x).\n\nShould you buy?\n\nIn response to the update, Goldman has retained its buy rating on BHP's shares with a trimmed price target of $46.80 (from $47.50).\n\nBased on its current share price of $40.61, this implies potential upside of 15% for investors over the next 12 months.\n\nGoldman also expects a 4.1% dividend yield in FY 2025, which stretches the total potential return to over 19%.\n\nCommenting on its buy recommendation, the broker said:",

            "content": "BHP Group BHP announced that its iron ore production rose 1% year over year to 66.2 Mt in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024). Higher production at Western Australia Iron Ore (\"WAIO\") as a result of strong supply-chain performance was partially offset by significant wet weather. This takes BHP's total iron ore production in the first half of fiscal 2025 to 130.9 Mt, 1% higher than the year-ago period.\n\nBHP\u2019s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2025 is unchanged at 255-265.5 Mt. WAIO's production is likely to be in the upper half of BHP\u2019s expectation of 250-260 Mt (282-294 Mt on a 100% basis).\n\nDigging Deeper in BHP\u2019s Iron Ore Production Numbers\n\nIron ore production at WAIO was up 1% to 128Mt in the first half of fiscal 2025. This was driven by strong supply-chain performance and record volumes at the Central Pilbara hub (South Flank and Mining Area C) following the completion of the ramp-up of South Flank in fiscal 2024. This was partially offset by the planned increase in tie-in activity of the multi-year Rail Technology Program (RTP1) and wet weather in December.\n\nSamarco\u2019s iron ore production increased 9% in the first half of fiscal 2025 to 2.8MT, attributed to the early resumption of Pelletizing Plant No. 4.\n\nBHP\u2019s Copper Production Up 10% in 1H25\n\nBHP\u2019s copper output improved 17% year over year to 510.7 kt in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. For the first half of fiscal 2025, BHP\u2019s copper production was 987 kt, up 10% year over year.\n\nCopper production at Escondida increased 22% year over year to 644 kt in the first half of fiscal 2025 as mining progressed into areas of higher-grade ore as well as increased concentrator feed grade. This was partially offset by planned lower cathode production as the integration of the Full SaL project continues. The project is expected to start production later in fiscal 2025.\n\nCopper output at Pampa Norte (which consists of Spence and Cerro Colorado) was down 9% in the first half of fiscal 2025. Production at Spence was down 1% due to lower cathode production. Total production at Pampa Norte was down on a year-over-year basis reflecting the impact of Cerro Colorado entering temporary care and maintenance in December 2023. It had contributed 11 kt of copper in the first half of fiscal 2024.\n\nProduction from Copper South Australia was reported at 145 kt for the first half of fiscal 2025, down 2% year over year. Gains from strong underlying performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were offset by the impact of a two-week weather-related power outage due to a significant storm at the beginning of the second quarter.",

That helped offset declines at its South Australian projects, which were shuttered for weeks after an electrical storm cut power supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, iron ore output rose just 1% in the period. While the commodity still accounts for about two-thirds of BHP\u2019s revenue, it sees long-term demand for the steelmaking material being pressured by a bleaker outlook for China\u2019s economy and languishing property market, and in recent years has bolstered its expansion strategy in other materials.\n\nThe company\u2019s thirst to grow its exposure to copper drove management\u2019s $49 billion attempt to acquire Anglo American Plc last year. When that failed, BHP launched a takeover of Filo Corp. alongside partner Lundin Mining Corp., giving it access to copper projects straddling the Argentina-Chile border that are yet to be developed. That transaction closed this month.\n\nBHP Chief Executive Mike Henry said the Filo assets were \u201cone of the most significant global copper discoveries in decades.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIron ore output was 66.2 million tons in the three months to Dec. 31. Full-year guidance for those operations was maintained at 255 to 265.5 million tons, with the miner keeping forecasts unchanged for all its commodities.\n\nMeanwhile, steelmaking-coal production slumped 23% in the three-month period, while energy coal dipped 4%. Copper output totaled 510,700 tons.\n\n\u201cOur flagship copper, iron ore and steelmaking coal assets delivered particularly strong production in the period,\u201d Henry said in the statement. \u201cWe made further progress on our growth pathways in future-facing commodities.\u201d\n\nFrom current heights of around 1 billion tons per annum, Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts predict annual China steel consumption could fall below 800 million tons by the end of this decade.\n\nIron ore was one of 2024\u2019s worst performing commodities, slumping 28%.

Steelmaking coal tonnes from the BMA operations were up 14%.\n\nWe made further progress on our growth pathways in future facing commodities. In January, we completed the formation of Vicu\u00f1a Corp. with Lundin Mining to advance the Filo del Sol and Josemaria projects in Argentina, which we consider to be one of the most significant global copper discoveries in decades. In Canada, our Jansen Stage 1 potash project is now 63% complete, with first production scheduled for late 2026, and we continue to execute Stage 2 in parallel.\n\nIn Brazil, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale signed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Brazilian government and public authorities for the Samarco Fund\u00e3o dam failure, reflecting BHP Brasil\u2019s commitment to support the people, communities and environment affected by the tragedy.

            "content": "MINING giant BHP has published half year results which show strong production gains in its copper mining business and consistent growth in its iron ore segment.\n\nThe Australian company announced an increase in its copper production of 10% in the first half of the 2024/2025 financial year (which began on July 1, 2024).\n\nThe majority of the 987,000 tonnes produced came from BHP\u2019s Escondida site in Chile, which yielded 644,000 tonnes, a 10-year high.\n\nProduction gains at the world\u2019s biggest copper mine (of which BHP owns 57.7%) was largely put down to mining higher-grade copper ore.\n\nAt BHP\u2019s other major copper mines, the picture was not so rosy. Production at Pampa Norte (also in Chile) declined 9% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, largely down to maintenance at the Cerro Colorado mine. BHP\u2019s Copper South Australia site also registered a decline in production of 6%, largely down to a weather-related power outage at the beginning of the second quarter.\n\nIn terms of iron ore, growth was not as eye-catching, but equally consistent. Overall iron ore production from BHP grew 1% in the first half of 2024/2025 compared to last year.\n\nIts Western Australia Iron Ore system of mines produced 128m tonnes of the 130.9m tonnes produced in total by BHP sites in the first half of 2024/2025. That\u2019s also a growth of 1%, which BHP was a result of record volumes delivered from its Central Pilbara Hub following the ramp up of its South Flank mine, Australia\u2019s largest new mine for 50 years.\n\nIron ore production guidance remained at 255m-265.5m tonnes. Anything in the upper realms of that prediction would once again break the company\u2019s production record, which was broken in 2023/24 when 260m tonnes of ore left BHP mines.\n\nChief executive Mike Henry said his company was \u201cwell positioned to continue strong momentum into the second half with a number of assets now expected to deliver production in the upper half of their respective ranges\u201d.",

It was a bit smaller than I'd anticipated, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Makes it easy to go lock-to-lock. The horn pads are very easily accessible. Also the horn is pretty loud, especially with no engine noise to muffle it.\n\n\n\nThe semi-active suspension gave a very nice ride. It was stiff enough to handle well, but didn't send waves in the cabin on bad patches. Happy with the state of tune.\n\n\n\nThe HUD is implemented REALLY well. It even has blind-spot indications within the HUD, which IMO is a game-changer. The HUD was crisp and displayed navigation well. My only qualm: it doesn't work well with polarised sunglasses. I mean that's a given, considering the HUD works explicitly by reflecting off the glass. But apart from that, I really liked how the HUD projects data.

You don't have to use the touch-screen to do it. I am a strong proponent of not using the touch screen for important controls, and this is a very decent half-way implementation. While there are no separate buttons for AC, the joystick and on-screen menu are easy enough to navigate even while driving.\n\n\n\nAnd finally on to the cherry on top: Self-parking. Again, the implementation is thoroughly impressive. It doesn't need street markings! You can simply select a rectangle in the 360 camera view on the touch screen, and initiate self park. And the car just freaking does it! I even panic braked a couple of times out of reflex, but the showroom rep urged me not to, and she seemed to be fairly confident. And she was right.

If you are, then check out the ASX 200 dividend shares in this article.\n\nThat's because they have recently been named as buys by brokers. Here's what they are saying about them:\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)\n\nGoldman Sachs thinks that mining giant BHP could be an ASX 200 dividend share to buy.\n\nIt likes the Big Australian because of its exposure to copper. It highlights that its analysts \"remain bullish on copper due to ongoing supply side challenges and increasing demand.\"\n\nThe broker expects \"BHP's copper EBITDA to increase by ~US$3bn to ~US$10bn by FY26E (~45% of group EBITDA).\"\n\nThis is expected to underpin fully franked dividends per share of US$1.08 in FY 2025 and US$1.14 in FY 2026. Based on its current share price of $40.05, this equates to dividend yields of 4.3% and 4.7%, respectively.\n\nBell Potter has a buy rating and $47.50 price target on its shares.\n\nChallenger Ltd (ASX: CGF)\n\nGoldman Sachs also believes that annuities company Challenger could be an ASX 200 dividend share to buy.\n\nIt is positive on Challenger due to its \"exposure to the growing superannuation market\" and belief that \"higher yields should drive a favorable sales environment for retail annuities.\"\n\nIt expects this to support the payment of fully franked dividends of 27 cents per share in FY 2025 and then 28 cents per share in FY 2026. Based on Challenger's current share price of $6.13, this would equate to attractive yields of 4.4% and 4.6%, respectively.\n\nGoldman Sachs currently has a buy rating and $7.60 price target on its shares.\n\nHomeCo Daily Needs REIT (ASX: HDN)\n\nFinally, Morgans thinks that HomeCo Daily Needs could be an ASX 200 dividend share to buy.\n\nHomeCo Daily Needs is a property company with a mandate to invest in convenience-based assets across the target sub-sectors of neighbourhood retail, large format retail and health and services.\n\nMorgans likes the company and highlights that its \"portfolio has resilient cashflows and continues to be a beneficiary of accelerating click & collect trends.\"\n\nIn light of this, it is forecasting dividends per share of 8.5 cents in FY 2025 and then 8.7 cents in FY 2026. Based on the current HomeCo Daily Needs share price of $1.16, this will mean dividend yields of 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively.\n\nMorgans has an add rating and $1.36 price target on its shares.",

The ASX:DOW ) share price is tracking 31.7% off its 52-week lows.\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nDOW shares\n\nDowner is the leading provider of integrated infrastructure services across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in the construction, maintenance, and operation of transit systems, utility services, and public infrastructure.\n\nWhile the name might not instantly recognisable, their work is highly visible. For instance, Downer operates Melbourne\u2019s Yarra Trams and manufactures the passenger trains you see in most states.\n\nBHP & DOW share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018quick read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is could be to study something like dividend yield over time. This can give us a sense of the stability of the company and whether they can consistently pay out a percentage of profits.\n\nRemember, the dividend yield is basically the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.46%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. In other words, BHP shares are trading lower than their historical average dividend yield. Be careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing, or both. In the case of BHP, we can see that last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nDOW is offering a historical dividend yield of around 3.22%, which compares to its 5-year average of 3.74%. This is just one of many ways you could put a value on DOW shares. The Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining valuation methods like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets which can help you learn how to value a company like BHP or DOW.",

Go blank screen for 5 minutes and it starts running around. Regardless of whether you have 1 in your garage already. That one emotion that unites you and me. Right?\n\n\n\nFor a quick recap of sorts, like many a good soul on this forum I grew up passionately loving bikes. Followed MotoGP closely and even attended the Donington Park editions regularly while studying in England. But unlike many, I didn't actually ride a bike until well into the thirties. That was a fine afternoon, slight drizzle and all, when I was casually browsing on the mobile and an Aprilia SR 150 pre-launch booking ad randomly popped up. Aprilia! Of the wild RS 125/250 fame?! Take my money!!! Took delivery from the first lot in our district. Rode pillion all the way home because I can't ride a two-wheeler, remember! But within a couple of days I was riding in the backyard practicing the 8 around a pair of coconut trees. Promptly received my two wheeler license in no time. Fast forward - upgraded to a Yamaha FZi 150 (Malaysian spec) a few months later and then a KTM Duke 250 once back in India. The mandatory falls all came by and a hairline fracture on the thumb joint. Yeah, battle scars alright! Then came an RE Himalayan 411. We were getting well attached with some 20k plus on the odo when I traveled abroad once again. A sale was the only option, albeit half-heartedly at best or heartbreakingly. The One above had other plans and I was back in India little over another year and a half.\n\n\n\nSo, I need a bike!\n\n\n\nIdeally I'd go and buy a Scram 411 with my eyes closed. But the budget was tighter than a Moto3 race on the opening lap. I also side glanced at a Honda CB300F with its price revision. Got rest rides on a Kawasaki W175, which I honestly liked. But the brain kept inviting me to look at the classifieds - This forum of ours, Olx, FB. If that was to be the case my choices would have been the Yamaha FZ25, a Suzuki 250 - the naked one preferably, or a Honda CBR 250. That's when I paid attention to the fact that I'd been randomly bookmarking KB Boxers and 4S Champions for a while.\n\n\n\nNow what I had not mentioned in the recap earlier was that while I had the Aprilia scooter and the Duke 250 in my garage I had randomly bought a cheap 2009 Karizma R that I found on Olx with plans of trying my hands on restoring it. Though I had quickly fixed some niggles and had kept it in running condition, the documents were missing and I just didn't find enough time to keep the project running. It was later given away.\n\n\n\nSo time it was to start a new project. But I didn't want to go the full-restoration route this time, because small steps can sometimes be big enough. And let me not be pretentious here and admit that I'm not very mechanically literate. Also owing to the simple fact that I'm in urgent need of some form of transportation. So I commenced negotiations on a few listings. The general trend was that either they had document issues or were in suspicious conditions. I finally rounded it off to a couple of Boxer AR models. Finally it came down to a 2003 model which had recently passed a fitness retest and was in fair condition. It was being used by a student who had bought it from the first owner. The lad was passing through my town after the weekend holidays, so he agreed to stop by, with the option of closing the deal if I did like it. He was riding about a 100 kms from his home on the way to college, which wasn't far from my town anyways, so the bike can't be all that bad. So I had a quick check and he explained the issues it had and we agreed upon a deal and the money was transferred and a sale document signed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there I was, kick-starting my biking days all over again, literally! (Behind the scenes bonus - the guy had boarded a bus and I was standing there kicking, but it wouldnt start. Finally my brother-in-law, who I had tagged along, gave a hand, or a leg, and it finally did.) The ride home was smooth however, and my little son, perched on the tank, was already in love with the cow-a-zacky.\n\n\n\nNow coming off a Himalayan to the Boxer AR the difference is significant, especially the weight. There was a weird moment when I had it off the stand and that very fact off my mind and almost let it go whilst standing on the kicker side, but I could just hold it without dropping it and then slowly cross a leg over it to balance it. Had it been the Himalayan it would have hit the ground before throwing me over it like a judoki. Riding the Boxer, you slot it into first gear and look around to see if there are any horses. Nope! Go to second and it squeals forward. Third, and suddenly some 5-6 horses come out of nowhere to join the party and you're riding along. Fourth, and you're galloping in quite the grandeur. But it's all so simple you'd smile. Somewhere along I read that the AR in Boxer AR stands for all-roads, since it was meant for rural usage primarily and in that sense it is a nursery Himalayan in short pants, especially with the Michelins on. We have some municipality roads that also identify themselves as off-road trails and Boxie does duty with all the shine and splendor.\n\n\n\nAnd thus little Boxie passionately started tending to commuter duties like a pro, while I noted down issues I had to attend to. The bike had just passed a PUC test less than a month before hand-over, and had had the oil changed along with the oil/air filters. Immediate requirement was a new chain and sprocket set, and a Rolon set was bought. The indicator warning light was working alone on the meter console not unlike a first-bencher on a secondary school project team and electricals overall were begging for an overhaul. One look at the tyres and you'd know how much they were contemplating retirement life so they were grateful to the pair of young Michelins who took the reins. Speaking of reins, needed new cables too.\n\n\n\nThe Boxer is known for its fuel efficiency but since the odo wasn't working I had no way to figure out current figures. Oddly enough the meter console had a fuel display but there was no actual gauge in this model. This meter came from the CT 100 then. One particular night I was on an incline and Boxie abruptly refused to climb, like an average Indian\u0092s salary these days. It turned out the carburettor was overflowing and I had already lost some fuel and I had no idea how much I was holding.\n\n\n\nSo now the routine was to get small works like these done in the evenings but whenever I had to travel out of town, Boxie would stay over at a garage for bigger works. So on one such occasion I had the wiring harness changed to the \u0091Swiss\u0092 brand and the switch gears were changed on both sides and new Minda switches and lock set were fixed. Now the young lad whom I bought from had informed me of the electrical issues and him being a student after all had mostly relied on a friend to get some free jugaad solutions. Hence a horn weirdly placed on the cross bar and wires adorning various colour tapes crowding to take a peep at the outside world. Meanwhile a chrome handlebar took duties from the black one because it's a tough world for black handlebars in a classic bike world. The seat cover was also changed more for aesthetic reasons than anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop priorities were thus mostly met and it was time to give Boxie some beauty treatment. Now here's the dilemma. Heart says - Dismantle and paint like them youtube projects. Head says - You have insufficient balance. A friend of mine runs a painting shop and he had previously done a good job on my car. His services were sought but he had recently shifted to a new facility and couldn't take up dismantling yet. However given some extra time he could try his best the undismantled route. Of course the smaller parts would come off, but the engine and some nooks and corners will have to be dealt with masking methods. Given my situation, trusting him was worth a try. So on another one of my out of town travels I handed over the bike for painting works. I wasn't bothered about it being period correct or restored to original looks. In fact I wanted a custom look as I found the AR graphics the worst of the Boxer liveries. The AT was clean and simple but by the time the ARs came out they felt a bit overdone. Inspiration was sought from classic Kawasakis, the Z400, Z750, the H1 et al and some SE Asian spec smaller capacity models like the Binter. The Boxer tank being tiny in size on the already tiny bike was given thought and the idea was to give it better presence while keeping it retro simple. Strangely enough the Benelli Tornado Tre 900 had a cameo in the whole process as that green and grey combo always had a place in my heart. Work took longer than expected and in the meantime I joined some online groups and finally found some enthusiasts who stocked original parts like they were expecting an automobile apocalypse or something. One nice chap even had the elusive \u0091Kawasaki K-Tec\u0092 engine stickers in stock. I wasted no time and ordered one and the good guy sent me two. \u0093Just in case\u0094, he said. I seriously hope he doesn't get bitten by a rabid coolant dripping Super Duke if that doomsday does occur. Also got a chrome saree guard from him which is ironic since the first mod with all my last bike purchases were de-sareeguarding them and I have them all lying around in some dark corner.\n\n\n\nNow the engine was treated to remove the flakes and given multiple coats. The fuel tank and side panels turned out nicer than I imagined. Subtle yet will make the odd person turn around. I had a moment when I rode into a Bajaj SC to get some parts and some staff gathered and admired it and took some pictures for inspiration for a Boxer AT that had just come in for restoration. They even invited me to the service area where the AT was kept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I've put on some 1500 kms since the meter and odo work was done. The carb tune is still not optimal. I tried a bit of tuning by myself and did get a fairly good tune but tweeked it further and lost it altogether. Currently its still troublesome to get it going in the early mornings. The project is ongoing but right now it is running in fairly good condition by Divine grace except early mornings. So the primary function of short conveyance to the town premises, shops and the likes is not only taken care of but fun as well. I don't know if I should take it on a longer ride yet, but that's something for the future. The electricals are another area that Im trying to work on as the headlight is pretty much useless right now. In the old times my parents used to narrate a story of a blind old man who walked at night with a candle. So when the people asked him what it's for since he cannot see anyways, he'd reply that it's for others to see him. Ditto with my headlight. Also once I hit the brakes when the headlights are on the brake lights are also pretty weak. Progress is being made though.\n\n\n\nThat's the journey so far. Keep the advices and suggestions coming, my good folks.\n\n\n\nBuying and restoring a Kawasaki Bajaj Boxer ARI need a bike!That one thought guys have that plays like an old Windows screensaver. Go blank screen for 5 minutes and it starts running around. Regardless of whether you have 1 in your garage already. That one emotion that unites you and me. Right?For a quick recap of sorts, like many a good soul on this forum I grew up passionately loving bikes. Followed MotoGP closely and even attended the Donington Park editions regularly while studying in England. But unlike many, I didn't actually ride a bike until well into the thirties. That was a fine afternoon, slight drizzle and all, when I was casually browsing on the mobile and an Aprilia SR 150 pre-launch booking ad randomly popped up. Aprilia! Of the wild RS 125/250 fame?! Take my money!!! Took delivery from the first lot in our district. Rode pillion all the way home because I can't ride a two-wheeler, remember! But within a couple of days I was riding in the backyard practicing the 8 around a pair of coconut trees. Promptly received my two wheeler license in no time. Fast forward - upgraded to a Yamaha FZi 150 (Malaysian spec) a few months later and then a KTM Duke 250 once back in India. The mandatory falls all came by and a hairline fracture on the thumb joint. Yeah, battle scars alright! Then came an RE Himalayan 411. We were getting well attached with some 20k plus on the odo when I traveled abroad once again. A sale was the only option, albeit half-heartedly at best or heartbreakingly. The One above had other plans and I was back in India little over another year and a half.So, I need a bike!Ideally I'd go and buy a Scram 411 with my eyes closed. But the budget was tighter than a Moto3 race on the opening lap. I also side glanced at a Honda CB300F with its price revision. Got rest rides on a Kawasaki W175, which I honestly liked. But the brain kept inviting me to look at the classifieds - This forum of ours, Olx, FB. If that was to be the case my choices would have been the Yamaha FZ25, a Suzuki 250 - the naked one preferably, or a Honda CBR 250. That's when I paid attention to the fact that I'd been randomly bookmarking KB Boxers and 4S Champions for a while.Now what I had not mentioned in the recap earlier was that while I had the Aprilia scooter and the Duke 250 in my garage I had randomly bought a cheap 2009 Karizma R that I found on Olx with plans of trying my hands on restoring it. Though I had quickly fixed some niggles and had kept it in running condition, the documents were missing and I just didn't find enough time to keep the project running. It was later given away.So time it was to start a new project. But I didn't want to go the full-restoration route this time, because small steps can sometimes be big enough. And let me not be pretentious here and admit that I'm not very mechanically literate. Also owing to the simple fact that I'm in urgent need of some form of transportation. So I commenced negotiations on a few listings. The general trend was that either they had document issues or were in suspicious conditions. I finally rounded it off to a couple of Boxer AR models. Finally it came down to a 2003 model which had recently passed a fitness retest and was in fair condition. It was being used by a student who had bought it from the first owner. The lad was passing through my town after the weekend holidays, so he agreed to stop by, with the option of closing the deal if I did like it. He was riding about a 100 kms from his home on the way to college, which wasn't far from my town anyways, so the bike can't be all that bad. So I had a quick check and he explained the issues it had and we agreed upon a deal and the money was transferred and a sale document signed.So there I was, kick-starting my biking days all over again, literally! (Behind the scenes bonus - the guy had boarded a bus and I was standing there kicking, but it wouldnt start. Finally my brother-in-law, who I had tagged along, gave a hand, or a leg, and it finally did.) The ride home was smooth however, and my little son, perched on the tank, was already in love with the cow-a-zacky.Now coming off a Himalayan to the Boxer AR the difference is significant, especially the weight. There was a weird moment when I had it off the stand and that very fact off my mind and almost let it go whilst standing on the kicker side, but I could just hold it without dropping it and then slowly cross a leg over it to balance it. Had it been the Himalayan it would have hit the ground before throwing me over it like a judoki. Riding the Boxer, you slot it into first gear and look around to see if there are any horses. Nope! Go to second and it squeals forward. Third, and suddenly some 5-6 horses come out of nowhere to join the party and you're riding along. Fourth, and you're galloping in quite the grandeur. But it's all so simple you'd smile. Somewhere along I read that the AR in Boxer AR stands for all-roads, since it was meant for rural usage primarily and in that sense it is a nursery Himalayan in short pants, especially with the Michelins on. We have some municipality roads that also identify themselves as off-road trails and Boxie does duty with all the shine and splendor.And thus little Boxie passionately started tending to commuter duties like a pro, while I noted down issues I had to attend to. The bike had just passed a PUC test less than a month before hand-over, and had had the oil changed along with the oil/air filters. Immediate requirement was a new chain and sprocket set, and a Rolon set was bought. The indicator warning light was working alone on the meter console not unlike a first-bencher on a secondary school project team and electricals overall were begging for an overhaul. One look at the tyres and you'd know how much they were contemplating retirement life so they were grateful to the pair of young Michelins who took the reins. Speaking of reins, needed new cables too.The Boxer is known for its fuel efficiency but since the odo wasn't working I had no way to figure out current figures. Oddly enough the meter console had a fuel display but there was no actual gauge in this model. This meter came from the CT 100 then. One particular night I was on an incline and Boxie abruptly refused to climb, like an average Indian\u0092s salary these days. It turned out the carburettor was overflowing and I had already lost some fuel and I had no idea how much I was holding.So now the routine was to get small works like these done in the evenings but whenever I had to travel out of town, Boxie would stay over at a garage for bigger works. So on one such occasion I had the wiring harness changed to the \u0091Swiss\u0092 brand and the switch gears were changed on both sides and new Minda switches and lock set were fixed. Now the young lad whom I bought from had informed me of the electrical issues and him being a student after all had mostly relied on a friend to get some free jugaad solutions. Hence a horn weirdly placed on the cross bar and wires adorning various colour tapes crowding to take a peep at the outside world. Meanwhile a chrome handlebar took duties from the black one because it's a tough world for black handlebars in a classic bike world. The seat cover was also changed more for aesthetic reasons than anything else.Top priorities were thus mostly met and it was time to give Boxie some beauty treatment. Now here's the dilemma. Heart says - Dismantle and paint like them youtube projects. Head says - You have insufficient balance. A friend of mine runs a painting shop and he had previously done a good job on my car. His services were sought but he had recently shifted to a new facility and couldn't take up dismantling yet. However given some extra time he could try his best the undismantled route. Of course the smaller parts would come off, but the engine and some nooks and corners will have to be dealt with masking methods. Given my situation, trusting him was worth a try.

I managed to book a ticket in VRL Travels from Bangalore to Pune and this was an overnight journey starting at Yeshwantpur Railway station and ending at Vadgaon Navale bridge in Pune.\n\nHad some real high hopes about the travel in a sleeper class bus but soon to turn into an anguish. The bus was supposed to be Volvo 9600 Gold class from VRL.\n\n1. The bus came late, travelled late, reached late. So punctuality for a VRL bus is out of the window in a jiffy.\n\n2. Had opted for lower berth (the double one) in which the lights (reading & cabin) inside didn't work. Fortunately the USB connection worked for charging the mobile.\n\n3. Unrequired and unplanned stops: First stop was at Tumkur hardly 2 hrs into travelling from Yeshwantpur, reason being tea break for Driver. Next halt wad diesel refuleing at Chitradurge. Third halt at 10 pm for dinner at Rane Bennur, who in the real world has dinner at 10 pm? Again this was to facilitate the driver, customer go take a walk. Next couple of halt for Nature's call for Driver. Next halt was tea break at Satara. The bus reached 1.5hrs late at the drop off destination.\n\n4. Unmaintained bus - The bus was rattling beyond expectations. The road conditions, speed breakers, rumbler strips, hard braking were all being felt very pronounced along with the twists and turns of the bus itself.\n\nMaybe I must be travelling after a long time but the trip surely felt an out of life experience. I have a return trip also planned from Pune to bangalore with the same bus operator and have been having second thoughts. I am thinking of opting for BlaBla car the car pool sharing app and have found one who is travelling at my interested time and date. Should I go with Blabla or continue the Bus trip itself?\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Back row (L-R): Tina Loyns (Maintenance Supervisor), Ashley Manitopyes, Vivian Tobias, Alison Solmes (Maintenance Supervisor), Erica Gerwing, Allison Pasitney BHP / Carleton College\n\nAn international potash company and a Saskatchewan college have joined forces to launch a training school for mine employees.\n\nThe first cohort of 13 students have already started studies at BHP Potash Academy at Carlton Trail College in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. Trainees are already participating in on-site orientation at BHP's nearby Jansen mine. Classroom studies begin January 20.\n\nThis eight-month paid traineeship is designed to equip those new to the mining industry with essential skills required for production or maintenance technician roles. The program includes a mix of classroom and theory learning, as well as practical workshop training for hands-on experience.\n\nSuccessful trainees will earn a Certificate in Mining Essentials, an Applied Certificate in Industrial Mechanics and permanent, full-time employment at the Jansen mine.\n\nGraham Reynolds, General Manager of Operations, BHP said his company was \"excited\" and \"thrilled\" about the new program.\n\n\"The launch of Potash Academy is an important milestone that will support the long-term success of Jansen and economic growth and participation in the region. We look forward to working with this great group of trainees who bring diverse experience that they can apply to BHP and the mining industry,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\nAmy Yeager, Carlton Trail College President and CEO said the partnership was \"bridging the gap between workforce need, classroom learning and the real-world application of skills.\"\n\n\u201cWe look forward to delivering this unique initiative that will shape the future of both training and industry,\" Yeager added.\n\nMinister of Advanced Education Ken Cheveldayoff said BHP was a \"strong partner\" to help develop \"a skilled and representative workforce.\"\n\n\u201cThis partnership is a clear demonstration of the success that comes from Saskatchewan post-secondary institutions working with key industry partners to create training opportunities that meet the needs of students and employers in the region,\" Cheveldayoff said.\n\nThe BHP Potash Academy, officially formed in July 2024 by BHP and Carlton Trail College, was created to help kickstart additional career pathways to the mining industry in Saskatchewan. It is an extension of a long-term partnership between BHP and Carlton Trail College that previously delivered pre-apprenticeship and related industry training.\n\nBHP anticipates approximately 5,500 workforce opportunities during construction of the Jansen mine and 900 long-term jobs once operational.\n\nMore information on Potash Academy and how to apply can be found at career8.successfactors.com.\n\nBHP is a global resources company with its Canadian operational headquarters in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and global business development headquarters in Toronto. BHP has a globa workforce of approximately 90,000 people working in locations across Canada, Australia, Asia, the UK, US and Latin America.\n\nBHP produces commodities essential for global decarbonization, economic development and food security including copper, nickel, iron ore, steelmaking coal.\n\nCarlton Trail College is a post-secondary institution in East-Central Saskatchewan that emphasizes innovation, collaboration, and community engagement. The college offers a range of academic programs, workforce training, and educational services. The college is expanding its offerings through the development of a state-of-the-art trades training facility.",

I have heard a lot about BYD and its products. Have driven Atto 3 briefly and found it okay (compared to MG ZS EV).\n\n\n\nHowever, today I went to Bharat Mobility Show only to check out EVs. I sat in almost all the EVs (except eVitara, Harrier EV & Sealion 6 PHEV of which doors were locked) and to be very honest my observations are below (I am 6 ft tall & owner of Honda City 2018 VMT & rear seat space should be comparable to Honda City):\n\n\n\n1. BE 6 - I barely able to sit in the car with knee up position. Didn't like the overall package (except large battery capacity). I will not consider buying BE 6 since it is too cramped for the price (about 20 lacs on road Noida).\n\n\n\n2. XEV 9 - I was able to sit with my knee almost touching front driver seat, which appears to be was pushed all the way back. Overall a respectable products considering the price of Pack 1 & Pack 2. I may consider it.\n\n\n\n3. Curvv.ev - Was not able to sit at the back seat (I think front seat was pushed all the way back). It was knee up position. Did not check Nexon.ev (I am not aware whether it was there or not).\n\n\n\n4. Punch.ev - I have heard a lot about the good rear seat space on this forum as well from the colleagues who own it, however, I could not sit at the back seat due to no space was there for me to sit properly (I again think that front driver seat was pushed all the way back).\n\n\n\n5. Creta EV - Trust me, this is the best overall package under 25 lacs for an EV for the family use. Except 5% to 10% people looking for performance oriented SUV, 90% people will love the overall package. It has SUV appearance, spacious, perfect ICE SUV like seating position at the back (no knee up position), excellent interior fit & finish. As per my calculations, a 42kWh battery pack can easily give 280km in city range (100% to 10%) and 51.4kWh battery pack will give 340km range. I was upset with the pricing, however, now I feel that Creta can become best selling or second best selling EV in India in coming months.\n\n\n\n6. Windsor Ev - Windsor EV is king of budget EV. If JSW-MG manage to improve AC efficiency, two way rear AC adjustment and 50kWh battery pack, they can sell 10000 Windsor EV every month, this is so damn good product.\n\n\n\n7. BYD Sealion 7 - I feel this deserve 75 lacs price tag if launched by Mercedes, BMW, Volvo or Audi. This is spacious like your drawing room, feature packed, solid build, excellent fit & finish, exceptional interior fit & feel & what not. It was unveiled few minutes before I entered Hall No. 6 and I was literally blown away by Sealion 7. Price will be revealed on 17th Feb 2025 and hopefully BYD will launch it for 44.90 lacs for Premium and 55.99 lacs for Performance variant. However, since now BMW iX1 LWB launched at 49 lacs, probably BYD has to launch it at 41.90 lacs for the Premium Variant and 47.90 lacs for the Performance Variant.\n\n\n\nI did not pay much attention to Mercedes & BMW as their products are out of my budget imagination (both buying & maintaining).\n\n\n\nI have seen other interesting products, but I have nothing much to write about them. I am not very optimistic about Maruti eVitara or Toyota eUrban Cruiser since they look like a raised hatchback, but the battery pack is good. The biggest drawback seems very poor leg room at the back and knee up position.\n\n\n\nI am surprised that except Creta EV & Sealion 7 EV, all other EVs have little or more knee up position at the back seat, which manufacturers are unable to sort out by redesigning the rear seat or overall appearing of the car.",

Two weeks in Tokyo was pretty intense, but the trip to Hamburg, Germany (end Nov \u2013 early Dec) was a bit more relaxed. All my previous visits to Europe were in Summer, and this was the first time I got to experience European winter and the famed Christmas markets. This is more of a photolog compilation of a weekend walk around in Hamburg, and the nearby town of L\u00fcneburg.\n\nLanded in Hamburg around late morning. It was a 13 hour long flight from Singapore to Frankfurt and another one hour from Frankfurt to Hamburg (with two two-hour layover).\n\nThe airport taxi was a Tesla Model Y:\n\n\n\nHamburg is known to be temperamental when it comes to the weather. And the scene outside the hotel was just that. The temperature was around 6\u00b0C\n\n\n\nAfter checking in, soon stepped out of the hotel for a short stroll, and to get some lunch. The gloomy sky theme continued\n\nGot back to the hotel, attended a couple of meetings (over Teams), and then stepped out again around early evening. It was already dark by then. Tokyo in the previous weeks was cold but Hamburg winter was on a different level.\n\nThe nearest train station had this steep stairway\n\nFirst sight of Christmas decorations\n\n\n\nThe Rathaus (Hamburg City Hall) at a distance\n\nI stopped by a small Christmas market next to Saint Peter\u2019s church, spent some time savouring some delicious bratwurst, and chit chat with some local Hamburgers. The community spirit and camaraderie in Europe is pretty awesome. You just share a table with a bunch of strangers, and have some nice conversations on food, culture and everything.\n\n\n\nMore Christmas decorations\n\n\n\nBrick/Brown is the shade of the city\n\nThe next day was a Friday, it was my first time in our Hamburg office, and the day was full of meetings. One of my colleagues (and a good friend) managed to get a ticket for a Bundesliga game. He\u2019s a staunch supporter of FC St. Pauli. Though the team sits in the bottom half of the table, the atmosphere was just electric. Absolutely enjoyed my first time watching a football game live in the stadium.\n\nAnd guess I brought some luck for the team \u2013 St. Pauli won comfortably and it was the first time they scored a Bundesliga goal at home this season.\n\nContinue reading BHPian vb-saan's travelogue for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Open this photo in gallery: Rio Tinto and Glencore were said to be in merger talks, or at least recently held them, according to a Bloomberg report.PATRICK T. FALLON\n\nIn the mining industry, mass creates mass. As mining companies get bigger, their expenses and debts rise, requiring more revenues and cash flow to cover their costs and occasionally epic cost overruns. So they devour their rivals, which also eliminates the hassle of building mines in unsavoury parts of the planet.\n\nSo it has always been, which is why a small number of giants dominate the global industry. BHP and Rio Tinto have market valuations of US$100-billion or more. Further down the list, though still enormous, are Glencore, Vale, Anglo American and Freeport-McMoRan. Soon there will be fewer. Another round of mergers and acquisitions seems almost certain this year.\n\nThis week, Rio Tinto and Glencore, both of them listed on the London exchange, were said to be in merger talks, or at least recently held them, according to Bloomberg. In a sense, the news was not really news, since highly opportunistic Glencore is always playing the M&A game\n\nGlencore, which owns the Canadian nickel miner once known as Falconbridge, tried to merge with Rio a decade ago. Since then, it has attempted to buy Teck Resources of Vancouver several times, most recently in 2023. The attempts failed but Glencore did pay Teck US$6.9-billion for 77 per cent of its coal business. Last spring, BHP made a couple of attempts to buy Anglo but was rebuffed. Led by Canadian CEO Mike Henry, BHP was primarily attracted to Anglo\u2019s copper and iron-ore assets.\n\nBHP, like all miners who want more energy-transition \u201ccritical\u201d metals, seems obsessed with copper. Last summer, it and Lundin Mining together bought Canada\u2019s Filo for US$2.8-billion. The attraction was Filo\u2019s big copper project on the Argentine-Chilean border.\n\nOn Friday, neither Glencore nor Rio would comment on the media reports about their merger talks. A \u201cno comment\u201d is often taken as confirmation that deal discussions are secretly under way. In this case, they may not be. Glencore shares rose as much as 3.4 per cent in the morning, then fell a bit. The U.K. Takeover Panel, the regulatory body that monitors deals to ensure that all shareholders are treated equally, did not publicly demand a clarification statement from either company, suggesting there was nothing to clarify.\n\nGlencore and Rio together do not make a lot of sense on paper, even if synergies \u2013 the polite term for cost-cutting \u2013 are always possible. Glencore is a coal heavyweight. Rio does not want coal. Rio earns more than half of its revenue from iron ore. Glencore does not mine iron ore, though does trade the commodity. Each is a strong player in copper and wants more of it. But combining their enormous copper operations would almost certainly attract the attention of antitrust regulators, especially those in China, which is wary of Western domination of the commodity, which is in exceedingly short supply in the country.\n\nAnd Rio CEO Jakob Stausholm seems allergic to M&A. \u201cI know that big M&A can be very disruptive for the organization and I think we are in a very important transformative phase, including resetting our culture, and I do not want to see that being destabilized,\u201d Mr. Stausholm told The Globe and Mail last year.\n\nOf course, Glencore and Rio could merge, then spin off Glencore\u2019s coal and Rio\u2019s iron ore into separate businesses, but that looks like a lot of work to create a company primarily engaged in copper and a few other critical metals. Glencore, the perpetual takeover machine, may be taking a short rest.\n\nWhich is not to say that 2025 will be M&A-free, far from it.\n\nThe company to watch is Anglo, which would be any copper advocate\u2019s dream. It is the 44-per-cent owner of the Collahuasi mine in the Chilean Andes. Collahuasi is the world\u2019s second-biggest copper operation \u2013 the main pit is almost four kilometres across and more than one kilometre deep \u2013 and has enough ore to stay in business until 2100. Anglo has several other big copper projects in Chile and Peru, including Quellaveco, one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper reserves.\n\nBHP could take another shot at Anglo once Anglo finishes its restructuring, which will see it sell or spin off its diamond and platinum businesses and mothball its nickel operations. The problem for BHP or another potential buyer is that Anglo\u2019s slim-down exercise has made the company expensive. In the past year, its shares are up 45 per cent. Still, the copper assets are hard to resist, given the global shortage of the commodity as the electrification drive builds momentum.\n\nAnother possible victim is Teck, whose Quebrada Blanca copper mine, the Canadian company\u2019s most valuable asset by far, lies less than a dozen kilometres from Collahuasi. QB, as it is known, suffered enormous cost overruns during the pandemic years but is nearing full production, turning Teck into one of the industry\u2019s fastest growing copper players, though it has yet to crack the top 10 globally (QB is about a third the size of Collahuasi).\n\nWhoever buys Anglo will end up with almost half of Collahuasi. That new owner would certainly want to merge Collahuasi with Teck\u2019s QB, since they are so close. The industrial savings would be enormous from, for instance, combining the port, milling and water desalinization activities. But, like Anglo\u2019s, Teck\u2019s shares are getting expensive, and the company is technically takeover-proof as long as the Keevil family of Vancouver controls its supervoting A shares.\n\nThere might be a price, though, that chairman emeritus Norman B. Keevil could not refuse. Given the strong price for copper and the relentlessly rising global demand for the product as industries try to decarbonize, lavish takeover prices \u2013 and more M&A \u2013 cannot be ruled out.",

The news comes as the mining industry grapples with a decline in commodity prices and a challenging economic environment.\n\nRio Tinto is the world's second-largest mining company by market capitalization, while Glencore is the world's largest commodity trader. Together, the combined entity would rival BHP, the current industry leader.\n\nThe talks are reportedly centered around copper, a metal with a bright future due to its use in renewable energy technologies. A combined Rio Tinto and Glencore would become a dominant player in the copper market, with production rivaling that of BHP.\n\nHowever, there are also significant challenges to consider. Both Rio Tinto and Glencore have a history of unsuccessful mergers and acquisitions. In 2008, BHP Billiton attempted to take over Rio Tinto, but the deal was ultimately blocked by regulators. Additionally, the mining industry is currently facing headwinds due to a decline in commodity prices.\n\nThe news of a potential merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore comes at a time when the traditional \"big five\" mining companies \u2013 BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Vale, and Anglo American \u2013 are facing difficulties. The combined market value of these companies fell by 25.3% in 2024, largely due to a decline in iron ore prices.\n\nThe future of the mining industry remains uncertain. While copper has the potential to be a major growth driver, the industry is also facing challenges from geopolitical tensions and a global trade slowdown. A potential merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore could be a way for the companies to navigate these challenges and remain competitive. However, the success of any merger will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to overcome regulatory hurdles and integrate the two companies effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore is a significant development in the mining industry. If successful, it would create a major force in the copper market. However, there are also significant challenges to consider, and the future of the deal remains uncertain.",

While Glencore has a market cap of approximately US$55 billion.\n\nShould Rio Tinto shares come to encompass Glencore's assets, the combined company would eclipse BHP as the world's biggest miner.\n\nBut is this deal really going to happen?\n\nWill Rio Tinto shares combine with Glencore in 2025?\n\nThe answer appears to be \"maybe\".\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter who wished to remain anonymous, Bloomberg reported the two mining giants are in early-stage discussions to combine their companies in what would be the largest mining deal in history.\n\nAmong the potential benefits for Rio Tinto shares are Glencore's copper assets. That includes Glencore's flagship Collahuasi mine in Chile, reported to have one of the largest copper reserves in the world.\n\nWith demand for the red metal expected to post strong, ongoing growth over the coming decade amid limited new supplies, miners worldwide are seeking to expand their copper footprint.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Grant Sporre, a combination of Glencore and Rio Tinto shares would result in the world's number one copper producer.\n\nBut there are many hurdles to cross before a deal goes through. Atop the range of regulatory issues, Rio Tinto has moved away from coal mining while Glencore maintains a strong focus on the fossil fuel.\n\nIn March 2018, Glencore agreed to buy Rio Tinto's interests in the Hail Creek coal mine and the Valeria coal development projects in Queensland for $1.7 billion.\n\nRio Tinto and Glencore have not yet commented on the merger rumours.\n\nA new mining behemoth on the horizon?\n\nCommenting on the potential combination of Rio Tinto shares with Glencore, Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro, said:\n\nToday's news of a potential merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore is significant as it would mark the largest deal in mining history. These talks are still early, but if successful, would create a mining behemoth.\n\nBut investors shouldn't put the cart ahead of the horse.\n\n\"There will be plenty of hoops to jump through,\" Gilbert cautioned.\n\nPointing to the potential uplift in mergers and acquisitions in 2025, he noted, \"There were early signs that M&A activity would pick up this year, after BHP went after Anglo American (LSE: AAL), while Rio Tinto acquired Arcadium Lithium (ASX: LTM) at the end of 2024.\"\n\nAddressing the rationale for a merger between the two global miners, Gilbert added:\n\nUltimately, the race to secure key commodities in the energy transition is ongoing. Commodities such as copper will play a role in renewable energy, energy storage, and upgrading electrical grids worldwide, particularly with the rise of AI and the energy it demands. Glencore has one of the richest copper deposits in the world, which is why this deal makes sense for Rio Tinto. The move would also allow Rio Tinto to reduce its reliance on profitability from iron ore when China's previously booming real estate sector has dwindled.\n\nThe rumoured merger has yet to lift Rio Tinto shares today, down 0.64% in late morning trade at $118.85 apiece.",

Is it time that you added BHP shares to your watchlist?\n\nBHP Group, formerly known as BHP Billiton, is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885. It produces a wide range of commodities used in energy production and manufacturing, and is expanding into fertilisers.\n\nBHP\u2019s primary business revolves around mineral exploration and production, with its assets and operations divided into three key focus areas: copper and related minerals (such as gold, uranium, silver, and zinc), iron ore, and coal (both metallurgical and energy).\n\nBHP is widely regarded as a stable, dividend-paying investment and is a common component of ASX share portfolios. If you invest in a popular ETF, LIC, or through an Industry Super fund, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nThe appeal of ASX Materials shares\n\nThe S&P/ASX200 Materials Index (ASX: XMJ) has averaged 2.69% per year in capital growth over the last 5 years. That compares to the ASX 200 index which has returned 3.30% per year over the same period. Let\u2019s take a look at why you might want a materials company like BHP in your portfolio.\n\nBig dividends\n\nWhile there are periods of capital growth, it\u2019s the dividends that most investors are interested in when assessing materials shares. After all, it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been known for for many years. Over the last 5 years the BHP dividend yield has averaged 6.86% per year.\n\nAussie materials companies like BHP have developed a good reputation of being reliable dividend payers. However, these are still commodity-driven businesses so the dividends (like the share price) can fluctuate quite a bit.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nMining is one of the backbones of our modern economy and the demand for things like iron ore, copper, and lithium is not going away any time soon.\n\nIn fact, the demand for a lot of precious metals is rapidly growing as the economy transitions to renewable energy. A lot of these materials are needed for things like electric car batteries and solar panels. Companies like BHP and Rio Tinto are investing a lot of money to put themselves at the forefront of this oncoming wave of demand.\n\nBHP share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018quick read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is would be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.47%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.\n\nBe careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing. In the case of BHP, last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price.",

            "content": "Lundin Mining and BHP Investments Canada (BHP) have completed their joint acquisition of Filo, a mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, for C$4bn ($2.78bn).\n\nThis deal grants both companies a 50% stake in Filo and its FDS copper project in the Atacama region of Chile.\n\nWhen the deal was announced in July last year, BHP made a payment of C$2bn in cash for the Filo acquisition, equating to C$33 per Filo share. Lundin Mining's contribution features $C877.8m in cash and 94.1 million of Lundin Mining shares.\n\nPrior to the completion of the acquisition, Lundin Mining owned 100% of the Josemaria copper project in the Vicu\u00f1a district of Argentina. Now, BHP has bought a 50% stake in Josemaria from Lundin Mining for $690m.\n\nThe two companies have also established a 50:50 JV called Vicu\u00f1a Corp, which includes FDS and Josemaria.\n\nOperating independently from BHP and Lundin Mining, the JV company is responsible for managing these projects.\n\nThe close proximity of the FDS and Josemaria projects enables greater economies of scale, enhanced flexibility for staged expansions and the integration of future exploration as the district develops.\n\nLundin Mining president and CEO Jack Lundin said: \u201cThanks to the strong collaboration between BHP and Lundin Mining, today we announce the formation of the newly formed Joint Arrangement, Vicu\u00f1a Corp., and now enter an exciting new chapter of growth that has the potential to transform Lundin Mining into a top-tier copper producer.\n\n\u201cVicu\u00f1a\u2019s newly formed team, with support from its board that is comprised equally of both Lundin Mining and BHP representatives, will work towards several key milestones during the year.\n\n\u201cVicu\u00f1a is targeting a mineral resource estimate for both the Filo del Sol and Josemaria deposits within the first half of 2025. This resource estimate will form the basis of an integrated technical report, which will outline the development plan for the phased construction of the district.\u201d\n\nTotal capital expenditure for the joint arrangement is forecast at $312m on a 100% basis for this year.\n\nThe future workplan for the JV will focus on a range of activities including FDS drilling, FDS mineral resource estimation and a Josemaria mineral resource estimation update.\n\nIt will also cover mine planning, metallurgy, hydrology wells and studies, the initiation of access road construction, and exploration at the Cumbre Verde target.\n\nAt the same time, engineering studies and trade-off analysis will be conducted in preparation for future permitting, along with the preparation of a technical report detailing an integrated project.",

            "content": "Rio Tinto regional headquarters in Perth, Western Australia. (Shutterstock image)\n\nRio Tinto Group and Glencore Plc have been discussing combining their businesses, which if successful would rank as the largest-ever mining deal and create a behemoth to rival longstanding leader BHP Group.\n\nRio and Glencore have recently held early-stage talks about a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. It\u2019s unclear whether the talks are still live.\n\nRio Tinto is the world\u2019s second-biggest miner, with a market value of about $103 billion at the close of trading in London on Thursday, while Glencore was valued at about $55 billion. BHP is worth about $126 billion.\n\nRepresentatives for both Rio and Glencore declined to comment. Rio\u2019s shares in Sydney fell as much as 1.8% in early trading on Friday, after Glencore\u2019s American depositary receipts jumped as much as 8.7%.\n\nAny deal would be complex and face multiple potential hurdles. Glencore\u2019s massive coal business would be a stumbling block \u2014 and could be spun off, one of the people said \u2014 while the smaller miner\u2019s assets from Kazakhstan to the Democratic Republic of Congo could be unappealing to Rio. The companies also have vastly different cultures and histories.\n\nThe mining industry has been galvanized by a wave of dealmaking in the past couple of years, driven largely by a desire by the biggest producers to expand in copper \u2014 a metal central to the world\u2019s decarbonization efforts.\n\nBoth Glencore and Rio own some of the best copper mines in the world. However, Rio \u2014 like BHP \u2014 still depends heavily on iron ore to drive its profits, at a time when China\u2019s decades-long construction boom is drawing to an end and the iron ore market appears headed for an extended period of weakness.\n\nHistory repeats\n\nGlencore, which previously proposed a merger with Rio in 2014, has been one of the most aggressive dealmakers in the sector. Its former CEO Ivan Glasenberg, who spearheaded the earlier approach to Rio, still owns almost 10% of the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny how history repeats itself,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Davis. \u201cEspecially since they\u2019ve gone on very different paths since then.\u201d\n\nIn the decade since, Rio Tinto has sought to pivot away from fossil fuels. It has exited coal mining completely and instead sought to grow its copper and lithium businesses. Glencore by contrast has added more coal, including buying mines from Rio.\n\nGlencore made an unsuccessful bid to buy Teck Resources Ltd. in 2023 but settled instead for the smaller company\u2019s coal unit. BHP last year tried to buy Anglo American Plc in a $49 billion deal \u2014 forcing Anglo to accelerate an overhaul of its business as part of its defense strategy \u2014 before eventually walking away empty handed.\n\nCentral to the wave of deals sweeping the sector is copper. The biggest miners are desperate to bulk up in a commodity favored by investors, but existing mines are getting older and lower grade, while new ones are hard to find and expensive to build.\n\nBuying Glencore would give Rio a stake in the Collahuasi mine in Chile, one of the richest deposits, that the company has coveted for more than a decade. Anglo\u2019s share in the same mine was a major lure for BHP\u2019s takeover proposal last year, while Bloomberg has previously reported that Rio made offers to both Glencore and Anglo for their stakes in the mine during the 2015 commodity slump.\n\nA combination of the two companies would create the number-one copper miner, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Grant Sporre.\n\nClear hurdles\n\nYet there are also very clear hurdles. Glencore is the world\u2019s biggest coal shipper and the company recently decided against spinning off the highly profitable unit after feedback from its investors. It mines nickel and zinc, commodities Rio doesn\u2019t, and has copper and cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 a difficult place to operate that Rio has long avoided.\n\nGlencore also operates one of the world\u2019s biggest commodity trading businesses \u2014 buying, selling and shipping huge volumes of metals, coal and oil.\n\nA combination with Rio would raise questions about Glencore\u2019s coal mining assets, which is a business that Rio exited several years ago. Glencore is also the world\u2019s biggest shipper of thermal coal and a top producer of coking coal. Any merger could also draw antitrust scrutiny from regulators.\n\nOne of the most obvious hurdles is the clash of cultures between the two companies. Glencore is renowned as a hard-driving, swashbuckling business that made its name as a commodity trader before getting into mining. The company listed in 2011 under former boss Glasenberg, before he handed over to Gary Nagle, a South African trained accountant who rose through the ranks of the company, making his name in running coal mines and trading the fuel they produced.\n\nRio has been wary of M&A \u2014 haunted by two disastrous top-of-the-cycle deals more than a decade ago \u2014 but has cautiously returned in recent years. The company bought out a copper miner for $3.1 billion, acquired a lithium project in Argentina and last year agreed a $6.7 billion deal to buy Arcadium Lithium Plc.\n\nCultural change\n\nYet Rio CEO Jakob Stausholm has remained publicly skeptical about big transactions and the potential for a shareholder backlash. He said just last month that investors would likely see the downside of mega deals to get more copper.\n\nRio has also undergone a radical cultural change as it seeks to move on from the destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site in Australia that ultimately cost both the CEO and chairman their jobs.\n\nUnder Stausholm, the company has sought to rebuild its reputation and sought to tackle head on issues surrounding bullying, sexual harassment and racism at its mines. Glencore has also faced its own reputational challenges, after paying over $1.5 billion in recent years to resolve a series of investigations into bribery and corruption around the world.\n\nBoth companies have large cornerstone shareholders. After Glasenberg, the second-largest shareholder in Glencore is Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, while Aluminum Corp. of China holds over 14% of Rio Tinto, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe talks also come with Rio riding high. The company has an unrivaled growth plan compared to most of its rivals, with copper, iron ore and lithium projects all coming on stream in the near future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not obvious what the motivation for Rio is at this point given the strategic divergence between the two companies,\u201d said Davis. \u201cFor Glencore it potentially gives their big shareholders an exit route.\u201d\n\n(By Archie Hunter, Thomas Biesheuvel and Dinesh Nair)",

            "content": "A new giant may emerge in the global mining industry.\n\nOn Thursday, January 16th, during the U.S. stock market's midday session, Bloomberg reported, citing informed sources, that Rio Tinto Group and Glencore Plc had been discussing a merger between the two companies and had recently engaged in preliminary negotiations regarding the deal. It remains unclear whether the negotiations are still ongoing.\n\nFollowing the news, Glencore's trading price in the U.S. over-the-counter market surged rapidly, with an intraday increase of over 8%, ultimately closing up more than 2%. Rio Tinto's U.S. stock closed down 1.1%.\n\nA spokesperson for Glencore later stated that the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation. Rio Tinto declined to comment.\n\nIf the news is true, it could lead to the largest deal in mining history, as the merged company would have a market value surpassing that of BHP Group, which has long been a leader in the industry.\n\nRio Tinto is the world's second-largest mining company. As of Thursday's close, based on the closing prices of Rio Tinto and Glencore listed in London, Rio Tinto's market value was approximately $103 billion, while Glencore's market value was about $55 billion. Based on Thursday's U.S. stock closing price, BHP's market value is less than $125 billion.\n\nBoth Glencore and Rio Tinto own some high-quality copper mines. However, like BHP, Rio Tinto, as the world's largest iron ore producer, heavily relies on iron ore to drive its profit growth. Last year, Rio Tinto agreed to acquire the U.S.-listed lithium producer Arcadium for $6.7 billion, reflecting Rio Tinto's efforts to enhance its influence in the battery minerals supply sector.\n\nThe merger with Glencore would allow Rio Tinto to acquire a stake in the Collahuasi copper mine in Chile. Collahuasi is one of the largest copper mines in the world, located in northern Chile, and is jointly controlled by Glencore and Anglo American Plc. Reports indicate that Rio Tinto has been eyeing the Collahuasi copper mine for over a decade.\n\nAt the same time, the merger with Rio Tinto raises questions about whether Glencore, as a global commodity trading giant, will continue its coal mining operations.\n\nRio Tinto began listing its coal assets for sale as early as 2013 and has gradually exited the coal business over the past five to six years. In contrast, Glencore is the world's largest thermal coal transporter and the largest coking coal producer.\n\nIn August last year, Glencore announced that after discussions with shareholders, the company decided to abandon its plan to divest its coal business. In an open letter, Glencore stated that this was because over 95% of shareholders \"bowed to money,\" believing that retaining the business would enhance cash generation capabilities.\n\nSome commentators suggest that whether the merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore can be achieved may depend on whether former Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg will support it. Glasenberg stepped down as CEO in 2021 but still holds nearly 10% of Glencore's shares. During his tenure as CEO, Glasenberg led a merger attempt with Rio Tinto in 2014, which ultimately did not succeed In addition, the support from Qatar and China is also crucial for the merger and acquisition between Rio Tinto and Glencore. Qatar is one of Glencore's largest shareholders, holding 8.5% of the company's shares, while Aluminum Corporation of China Limited is Rio Tinto's largest investor.\n\nIn 2008, Chinalco, in conjunction with Alcoa, acquired 12% of Rio Tinto's shares, with a total transaction value of slightly over $14 billion. In 2009, Chinalco also attempted to inject an additional $19.5 billion to nearly double its stake in Rio Tinto to 18% and secure two board seats, directly owning rights to some aluminum, copper, and iron ore assets, as well as establishing alliances with these businesses. However, as commodity prices recovered that year, Rio Tinto's financial situation improved, and Chinalco's investment plan was not realized",

This step marks a key milestone in the expansion of both giants in the copper market, a critical mineral for the energy transition and global technological growth.\n\n\n\nBy Panorama Minero\n\n\n\nThe transaction, which includes the creation of a joint venture named Vicu\u00f1a Corp., combines the resources of the Filo del Sol project and the Josemar\u00eda project, also located in the district. BHP and Lundin Mining each hold a 50% stake in this new entity, which will be managed independently by Vicu\u00f1a Corp., ensuring operations aligned with international industry standards.\n\n\n\nThe agreement involves a total payment by BHP of US$2 billion, including a US$690 million contribution to Lundin Mining for a 50% interest in the Josemar\u00eda project. Both parties have integrated their respective stakes in Filo Corp. and Josemar\u00eda into Vicu\u00f1a Corp., consolidating a strategic portfolio that promises long-term value for shareholders and local communities alike.\n\n\n\nImpact on the Copper Market\n\n\n\nAs highlighted by BHP CEO Mike Henry, this alliance represents a significant growth opportunity. \u201cWe are pleased to partner with Lundin Mining in the Vicu\u00f1a joint venture, which combines complementary capabilities to develop projects with a sustainable and high-impact approach. The growing demand for copper, driven by the energy transition and the development of technologies like artificial intelligence, underscores the importance of this metal for the future of the global economy,\u201d Henry stated.\n\n\n\nFinancial and Structural Details\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of Filo Corp. was approved by shareholders in September 2024, with a total valuation of C$4 billion. Of this amount, BHP contributed C$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) in cash, at a price of C$33 per share. Lundin Mining, for its part, contributed C$877.8 million in cash and 94.1 million of its own shares.\n\n\n\nThe agreement establishes an equitable governance model for the new joint venture. Both BHP and Lundin Mining will have equal voting rights on the board of Vicu\u00f1a Corp., ensuring balanced decision-making in strategic matters.\n\n\n\nWith these announcements, the Vicu\u00f1a region is cementing its position as a key hub for copper mining in South America, supported by the potential of these projects to generate employment, economic development, and significant contributions to global supply chains. This strategic move underscores Latin America\u2019s growing prominence in supplying essential resources for the world\u2019s energy and technological future.",

            "content": "Lundin Mining Completes Joint Acquisition of Filo with BHP and 50% Sale of Josemaria to Form Vicu\u00f1a Corp.\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, Jan. 15, 2025 /CNW/ - (TSX: LUN) (Nasdaq Stockholm: LUMI) Lundin Mining Corporation (\u201cLundin Mining\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the completion of the joint acquisition (the \u201cFilo Acquisition\u201d) of Filo Corp. (\u201cFilo\u201d) with BHP Investments Canada Inc. (\u201cBHP\u201d).\n\nConcurrently, Lundin Mining and BHP have formed a 50/50 joint arrangement, Vicu\u00f1a Corp. (the \u201cJoint Arrangement\u201d or \u201cVicu\u00f1a\u201d), holding the Filo del Sol project (\u201cFDS\u201d) and the Josemaria project. On completion, BHP paid Lundin Mining a cash consideration of US$690 million for a 50% interest in the Josemaria project.\n\nVicu\u00f1a will create a long-term strategic alliance between Lundin Mining and BHP to jointly develop an emerging copper district with the potential to support a globally ranked mining complex. The proximity of the FDS and Josemaria projects allows for greater economies of scale and increased optionality for staged expansions, as well as the incorporation of future exploration as the district matures.\n\nJack Lundin, Lundin Mining President and CEO, commented \u201dThanks to the strong collaboration between BHP and Lundin Mining, today we announce the formation of the newly formed Joint Arrangement, Vicu\u00f1a Corp. and now enter an exciting new chapter of growth that has the potential to transform Lundin Mining into a top-tier copper producer. Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s newly formed team, with support from its board that is comprised equally of both Lundin Mining and BHP representatives, will work towards several key milestones during the year.\n\n\u201cVicu\u00f1a is targeting a mineral resource estimate for both the Filo del Sol and Josemaria deposits within the first half of 2025. This resource estimate will form the basis of an integrated technical report which will outline the development plan for the phased construction of the district.\n\n\u201cThe district represents an opportunity to deliver on the world\u2019s growing copper needs in a meaningful way, both in terms of scale and operational excellence. The Joint Arrangement is committed to applying international industry standards to each facet of the business, from innovation in technology to the commitment of sustainability and capacity building.\u201d\n\nFilo Acquisition\n\nThe Filo Acquisition was approved by Filo shareholders on September 26, 2024 and the final court order for the plan of arrangement was subsequently obtained.\n\nThe total consideration for the Filo Acquisition was approximately C$4.0 billion, excluding the Filo shares already held by Lundin Mining and BHP respectively.\n\nLundin Mining\u2019s share of the consideration for the Filo Acquisition was approximately C$877.8 million in cash and 94.1 million Lundin Mining Shares to Filo shareholders, along with its existing 1.7% interest in Filo (prior to completion). The issuance of 94.1 million Lundin Mining shares to the Filo shareholders, represents a dilution to the existing shareholders of Lundin Mining of approximately 11% based on the issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of December 31, 2024. BHP will pay a cash consideration for its interest in Filo of C$2.0 billion at C$33.00 per Filo share, along with its existing 7.0% interest in Filo (prior to completion).\n\nFormation and Management of the Joint Arrangement\n\nThe Joint Arrangement is governed by a joint venture shareholders\u2019 agreement. Vicu\u00f1a will be the operator, acting independently from Lundin Mining and BHP, and will be responsible for the development, operation and management of the projects.\n\nLundin Mining and BHP have equal voting rights on the Board of Vicu\u00f1a that will govern the Joint Arrangement. The Board will be comprised of Jack Lundin (President & CEO Lundin Mining), Teitur Poulsen (EVP & CFO Lundin Mining), Brandon Craig (President Americas BHP), and Carlos Ramirez (VP Vicu\u00f1a JV BHP). Carlos Ramirez has been appointed as Chair of the Board of Vicu\u00f1a Corp.\n\nVicu\u00f1a will be led by Dave Dicaire, the former Executive Vice President, Josemaria Project for Lundin Mining. The employees from the Josemaria project team and FDS project team are expected to transition over to maintain continuity and knowledge of the projects.\n\nDave Dicaire, General Manager Vicu\u00f1a Corp.\n\nDave Dicaire has over 40 years of mining, engineering and construction experience gained on a variety of global projects leading both the Owners and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM) teams and has led the Josemaria project as Executive Vice President since August of 2022. His experience covers all facets of project management across several types of mining projects ranging from managing pre-feasibility studies to large EPC/EPCM projects. Dave\u2019s previous roles include Vice President, Projects at Lundin Gold where he oversaw construction of the Fruta del Norte project in Ecuador and prior to that Project Director at Freeport-McMoRan for the highly successful multi-billion-dollar Cerro Verde Expansion Project in Peru. Before moving to Freeport McMoRan, he was the General Manager, Project Development for South America for Xstrata Copper based in Santiago, Chile.\n\n2025 Budget, Work Program and Next Steps\n\nThe development of the Vicu\u00f1a District envisions an integrated project plan, incorporating both the Filo del Sol and Josemaria projects through a phased development strategy.\n\nCapital expenditures for the Joint Arrangement are forecast to total $312 million on a 100% basis for 2025. The workplan will focus on FDS drilling, FDS mineral resource estimation, Josemaria mineral resource estimation update, mine planning, metallurgy, hydrology wells and studies, commencement of access road construction, and exploration at the Cumbre Verde target. In parallel, engineering studies and trade off analysis will be completed in preparation for future permitting and a technical report outlining an integrated project.\n\nDrilling is currently underway at FDS and Cumbre Verde and will continue throughout the year. The drill program at FDS will focus on resource growth with multiple step-out targets in all directions from zones of known mineralization, including both the Bonita and Aurora Zones along with infill drilling to support an initial sulphide mineral resource estimate. Drilling at Cumbre Verde will follow up on the initial results from last year and target the same mineralized system and structures discovered to the north of the project.\n\nThe advancement of Vicu\u00f1a aims to line up with the application window of the Incentive Regime for Large Investments (\u201cRIGI\u201d) in Argentina. The incentive regime provides a clear fiscal stability framework for the overall operation during the initial construction period and future phased expansions.\n\nAbout Lundin Mining\n\nLundin Mining is a diversified Canadian base metals mining company with operations or projects in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America, primarily producing copper, gold and nickel. In December 2024 the Company announced the sale of its European assets to Boliden. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025 subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nThe information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out below on January 15, 2025 at 9:30 PDT.\n\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\n\nCertain of the statements made and information contained herein are \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

            "content": "BHPian holyshash recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nRecently I was surfing through Youtube when I came across a video where they were swapping a W204 C250 with a C63 V8. This made me wonder if it was legal to swap engines in India. I looked up for the answer to my question, but I could not find a proper answer to it. Thus I opened up TeamBHP and tried finding a thread related to it but all I found was an old thread from 2008 which again, did not have a proper answer.\n\nAll I found was:\n\nYou can swap an engine if it's from the same manufacturer or it has the same amount of power.\n\nYou can swap engines if you can get the right permissions from your state RTO, which seemed to be the right answer but upon looking deeper, many disagreed with this and said that one can't swap the engine without transferring the chassis number.\n\nA petrol-to-petrol swap is allowed but not a petrol to diesel or a diesel to petrol.\n\nI don't have any other place to confirm whether this information is true or not. If there are any members who work at the RTO or are aware of this topic please give me an insight if it's possible or not to swap engines legally.\n\nLet's say I want to swap a W211 E280 petrol with a 6.2L M156 V8 from a W211 E63, is it possible to do this legally?\n\nIf I want my car insured, I must know if it's legal to do so. Driving an illegal car is not worth the risk in my opinion.\n\nHere's what GTO replied:\n\nNope, there is no 100% legal way to do it. Those who do engine swaps follow the \"rather than ask for permission, it's better to apologize if caught\" philosophy. The best way to get a new engine is to rebuild your current engine. Second choice, get the same engine (preferred from the dealer / OEM). Anything else is illegal. And frankly, from the authority's point of view, it is impossible for them to classify just any & every engine swap as being roadworthy or not.\n\nHere's what BHPian DicKy replied:\n\nOnly legal way is maybe for your engine to be damaged and the same spec engine changed from the dealer. You can try to be legal by illegally etching/drafting the old engine number/chassis number into the new one, but that would work only if the engine layout is the same. Like putting a 1.5/1.6l four-cylinder engine in a car that had 1.2/1.4l engine. A casual glance wouldn't make out the engine difference, especially if the rest of the car is stock. But a V8 in a car that had an inline-4 in the first place. Any self-respecting MVD official can find that out. Nope. Possible in India, but never legal in India.\n\nHere's what BHPian RGK replied:\n\nGenerally, these are the modifications allowed in India as ruled by SC (in 2019). One can change the colour of the vehicle as the SC has said that changing the color of the vehicle depending on the customer\u2019s will not deter a vehicle from getting registered.\n\nMinor fitments like door protectors, decals, rain guard can be added.\n\nOne can change the tyres in affordable cars as the manufacturers usually offer different spec tyres for base and top variants.\n\nThe engine can be changed, but it requires prior permission from the RTO. If the protocols are not followed, the vehicle\u2019s registration can be cancelled. In the 1980s, many Ambassador cars underwent modifications to switch their petrol engines to Matador F205 diesel engines (the removed petrol engine was sold for just Rs 850/- if it had an alternator). Notably, some people even purchased new Ambassadors specifically to convert them to diesel. The engine modifications could be officially endorsed by contacting the relevant RTO. However, this practice was later halted due to safety and other concerns. Prior to the discontinuation, a well-known specialist in Coimbatore, Mr. Kumaresan, had completed over 250 engine conversions, utilizing imported Isuzu D engines and updating the vehicles in the process. When enquired now with an agent recently, these details have to be furnished. Details of the replacing engine (is it taken from a scrap vehicle, then disclose its RC with owner details, Chassis no., Eng no. etc., NOC etc., to avoid a stolen spare) He concluded it is better to get the same engine from OEM with the original invoice and warranty and avoid the modifications. He emphasized to visit the RTO to get things confirmed and hinted at the money factor (hope u understand).\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Three that could be worth a closer look are as follows:\n\nETFS Battery Tech & Lithium ETF (ASX: ACDC)\n\nThe first ASX ETF for investors to look at for mining sector exposure is the ETFS Battery Tech & Lithium ETF.\n\nACDC invests in companies throughout the lithium cycle, including mining, refinement and battery production, cutting across the traditional sector and geographic definitions.\n\nThis could be a good place to be for the future as battery technology and lithium are essential to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and mobile devices. The fund manager, Global X, notes that EVs produce zero direct emissions, meaning broader adoption could result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved urban air quality.\n\nAmong its holdings are giants such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS).\n\nBetashares Global Uranium ETF (ASX: URNM)\n\nA second ASX ETF that could be a good option for investors looking for mining sector is the Betashares Global Uranium ETF.\n\nIt could be a top pick if you believe that nuclear power is the future and another key to the decarbonisation of the planet.\n\nThat's because this fund allows you to buy a slice of the leading companies in the global uranium industry. These companies are positioned to benefit over the next decade if the forecast strong demand for the chemical element materialises.\n\nHoldings include locally listed miners Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX: PDN) and Boss Energy Ltd (ASX: BOE).\n\nBetashares Energy Transition Metals ETF (ASX: XMET)\n\nFinally, the Betashares Energy Transition Metals ETF. could be another great way to gain access to the mining sector with an ASX ETF.\n\nIt gives investors access to global producers of copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, manganese, silver, and rare earth elements. These are all metals that will be important for the decarbonisation of the planet.\n\nBetashares has named it as one to buy. The fund manager notes that \"both electric cars and clean energy use notably more metals than their conventional counterparts, and many of these minerals have highly concentrated and insecure supply chains.\"\n\nIts holdings include Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (ASX: LYC) and Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO).",

Market analysts suggest Anglo\u2019s recent strategic shifts may further attract BHP\u2019s interest. One major investor told The Sunday Times, \"Anglo\u2019s management is pushing ahead with its plans, but ironically, this could make them a more appealing acquisition target.\"\n\nBHP\u2019s primary focus remains Anglo\u2019s copper assets, while it has expressed no interest in retaining De Beers or the company\u2019s platinum group metals (PGM) operations. Since the previous bid, Anglo has strengthened its position by raising $4 billion through coal mine sales and is moving forward with plans to offload De Beers and its PGM holdings. These developments align closely with BHP\u2019s strategic objectives, making Anglo a more attractive acquisition target.\n\nIn May, shortly after rejecting BHP\u2019s offer, Anglo announced plans to divest or demerge its diamond, PGM, nickel, and steelmaking coal businesses to streamline operations and concentrate on its core copper assets. De Beers, which faced declining sales in 2023, is set for separation to provide \"greater strategic flexibility\" for both itself and Anglo American.\n\nIndustry observers now await BHP\u2019s next move as market conditions evolve and Anglo refines its portfolio, potentially setting the stage for one of the largest mining sector acquisitions in recent years.",

Rather, the contest was in which one held up best during their collective downturn.\n\nAs the chart below shows, BHP shares did better than Fortescue and Mineral Resources.\n\nAll three ASX 200 mining shares lost value, but BHP lost less than the other two.\n\nThe BHP share price fell 21.5% to close the year at $39.55.\n\nThe Fortescue share price fell 37.1% to finish the year at $18.25.\n\nThe Mineral Resources share price tanked, with factors beyond volatile commodity prices causing a 51.1% dive to $34.25 per share by 31 December.\n\nIn a shock scenario that no one saw coming, founder, CEO, and managing director Chris Ellison resigned in November amid a company investigation relating to his personal tax affairs and disclosures.\n\nHe will remain the managing director for 12 to 18 months until a replacement is found.\n\nOn dividend payments, Fortescue shares win\n\nIn 2024, BHP shares paid an interim dividend of A$1.0962 in March and a final dividend of A$1.11 in October. This totalled A$2.6143 in annual dividends with full franking credits.\n\nFortescue shares paid an interim dividend of A$1.08 per share in March. The iron ore pure-play then paid an 89-cent final dividend in September for a total annual dividend of A$1.97, fully franked.\n\nMineral Resources paid an interim dividend of 20 cents per share, fully franked, in March.\n\nThe diversified miner decided not to pay a final dividend later in the year. Management cited weak lithium prices and the remaining investment in the Onslow Iron project.\n\nSo, in dollar value terms, BHP shares win.\n\nArguably, the dividend yield is more important. So, let's calculate that using the ASX 200 mining shares' closing values on 31 December to determine which delivered the better returns.\n\nThe results are: 6.61% for BHP, 10.79% for Fortescue, and 0.58% for Mineral Resources, plus franking.\n\nSo, Fortescue shares did best.",

It\u2019s one of an estimated 10 examples of the 911 Turbo as modified by Koenig Specials GmbH \u2013 a company famous for building some of the wildest modified supercars in the world in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nCompany founder Willy Koenig became a pariah from the perspective of many of the period\u2019s supercar manufacturers as he was modifying their cars to such extreme lengths it made the originals look a little boring. For example, he developed a twin-turbo Ferrari Testarossa producing over 1,000 bhp, far more than the stock output of 385 bhp.\n\nFast Facts \u2013 The Porsche 911 \u201cKoenig Specials\u201d Turbo\n\nKoenig Specials GmbH, founded by Willy K\u00f6nig in 1977, became famous for extreme supercar modifications, including the Porsche 911 \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo and a 1,000+ bhp Ferrari Testarossa. The company faced criticism from manufacturers like Ferrari for its radical customizations.\n\nThe Porsche 911 \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo by Koenig Specials included major upgrades such as a fiberglass wide-body kit, Porsche 928 headlights, Audi 200 Turbo taillights, and performance modifications to the engine, turbocharger, suspension, and brakes.\n\nPerformance enhancements included boring the engine from 3.3L to 3.4 liters, fitting a larger KKK K27 turbocharger, and upgrading the ECU, intercooler, and exhaust. This resulted in 480 to 550+ bhp, a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.4 seconds, and a top speed exceeding 190 mph.\n\nThe featured 1988 Koenig Specials \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo has 25,000 km (15,534 miles), a single owner, and original Porsche Recaro seats. It is listed for \u00a3299,000 ($362,084 USD) and is believed to be the only one available for sale in Europe.\n\nWilly K\u00f6nig And His \u201cKoenig Specials\u201d\n\nKoenig Specials GmbH was founded by eccentric millionaire and successful racing driver Willy K\u00f6nig (sometimes spelled \u201cWilly Koenig\u201d) 1977 to formally sell kits and parts that Koenig had been developing and selling since 1974.\n\nThe cars built by Willy and his team were extreme to say the least, so extreme that former friend Enzo Ferrari demanded that any Ferrari modified by Koenig have its badges removed or face legal action \u2013 as the company no longer considered it to be a Ferrari.\n\nLove them or hate them, Willy and his team at Koenig had a significant influence on the global car tuning and modification scene. The company sold wide body kits, suspension systems, performance engine parts and they offered fully-built cars.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s most famous creations was an extensively modified Ferrari Testarossa with an avant garde body kit and a significantly modified twin-turbo engine capable of 1,000+ bhp. They also built a Porsche 911 Turbo with up to 550 bhp and a top speed not far off 200 mph.\n\nA slew of wild cars rolled out of the Koenig facilities during the 1970s and 1980s, today they\u2019re considered quite collectible but only to a specific kind of collector \u2013 one who cares more for the car\u2019s unusual nature than their lost originality.\n\nInterestingly, Koenig Specials GmbH is still in operation to this day selling body kits for cars from its glory days, though they no longer build custom cars in-house.\n\nThe Porsche 911 Koenig Specials \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo\n\nThe Porsche 911 Koenig Specials Turbo, sometimes referred to as the \u201cRoadrunner,\u201d was a comprehensive rebuild of the standard Porsche 930 (the 911 Turbo variant). It included modifications to the suspension, engine, and body of the car, resulting in a vehicle that was considerably quicker than the standard version.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious modification is the fitment of a multi-piece Koenig Specials fiberglass body kit including the front end, hood, sides/doors, rear quarter panels, and engine lid/spoiler. The original headlights were removed as part of the conversion, and a set of Porsche 928 headlights were used in their place.\n\nOut back a set of full-width taillights from the Audi 200 Turbo were integrated into the rear end, and a hefty new integrated spoiler curved around most of the rear of the car. The interior was left largely original with only minimal changes, as was often the case on Koenig Specials builds.\n\nUnderneath the car you would find the original Porsche 930 brakes still in place, these were cross-drilled, ventilated discs sourced from the Le Mans-winning Porsche 917 race car, and as such they were already more than capable of handling the additional performance.\n\nThe suspension was upgraded with Bilstein shock absorbers, heavy-duty anti-roll bars front and back, and up front a strut brace was added for a little additional body rigidity.\n\nThe original 3.3 liter flat-six was comprehensively rebuilt, it was bored out to 3.4 from 3.3 liters and given a significantly larger KKK K27 turbocharger. It was also fitted with a considerably air-to-air intercooler, the ECU was re-mapped, and an improved exhaust system was fitted.\n\nTotal power output varied depending on the specific car (as was often the case with Koenig Specials) however numbers from 480 bhp to 550+ bhp were quoted. This was a significant bump over the 325 bhp of the car it was based on, and the performance specs jumped as a result. The car could now to the 0-60 mph run in 4.4 seconds and it had a top speed of 190+ mph.\n\nThe original 4-speed manual transmission was replaced with a 5-speed unit, though there isn\u2019t any additional information on this gearbox we have to assume it\u2019s the G50 unit as the earlier 911 5-speed transmission would struggle with the torque being sent back by either of the turbo engine variants.\n\nExactly how many examples of the Koenig Specials \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo were actually made, estimates range from 10 to 12, and it\u2019s not known exactly how many have survived to the modern day. Another issue is that some additional cars were fitted with the body kit only and none of the mechanical upgrades.\n\nThe Koenig Specials \u201cRoadrunner\u201d Turbo Shown Here\n\nThe car you see here is listed as an original Koenig Specials \u201cRoadrunner\u201d from 1988 with just 25,000 kms on the odometer \u2013 that\u2019s 15,534 miles.\n\nThe listing is relatively light in information, it does explain that the car has its original Porsche Recaro seats, service history, and just a single owner from new.\n\nThe asking price is \u00a3299,000 or approximately $362,084 USD, which looks to be about right given the rarity of the car, its historic significance, and the fact that it\u2019s a low mileage, one owner vehicle.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read more about it or register to bid you can visit the listing here on Car & Classic. It\u2019s being sold out of Sussex in the United Kingdom and apparently it\u2019s the only one currently for sale in Europe.\n\nImages courtesy of Car & Classic",

            "content": "BHPian rpmmachine recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nAnother day, another serious issue with my Mahindra XUV700. This time, while the vehicle was in motion, it displayed a Check Engine System warning. Deeply concerned, I immediately contacted Mahindra Punj Autos in Hoshiarpur, Punjab. The service head, advised me to stop using the vehicle for safety reasons. He promptly helped arrange RSA and ensured the vehicle was towed to their service center without delay.\n\nWhile I am increasingly frustrated with the quality and reliability of the Mahindra XUV700, I am equally grateful for the exceptional support I received from Mahindra's customer care team, especially the service head. His professionalism, attentiveness, and consistent follow-ups\u2014checking the status of RSA, overseeing the towing process, and ensuring immediate action upon the vehicle's arrival at the workshop\u2014deserve recognition. Employees like him are invaluable, as they know how to manage and reassure frustrated and disappointed customers. Mahindra should make every effort to retain such dedicated individuals. This is the third sensor failure I\u2019ve faced this week, following the DEF error and AC actuator failure.\n\nMahindra urgently needs to re-evaluate its sourcing of components from vendors, as the current quality standards are far from acceptable. Having owned vehicles from Hyundai, Maruti, and Toyota in the past, I\u2019ve never encountered such persistent problems. Aside from routine annual servicing, I never had to visit service centers so frequently. With the XUV700, I find myself visiting the service center 3-4 times a month due to serious issues.\n\nI have only one car, and with issues like these, I\u2019ve started feeling that purchasing a Mahindra vehicle was a mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s better to settle for less features but peaceful ownership.\n\nI kindly request someone from Mahindra's customer care team to address this matter. My experience with the XUV700 has been disheartening.\n\nTo anyone considering purchasing the Mahindra XUV700, I urge you to reconsider. While the vehicle's features may initially charm you, these persistent issues can overshadow the excitement and lead to significant frustration, as I have unfortunately experienced.\n\nAt last, thanks to the Mahindra Roadside Assistance team for being so helpful.\n\nDear Mahindra team, please take this feedback seriously. Your customers spending 3 million deserve better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review a request from Sunoco and other oil companies to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Honolulu. The lawsuit accuses these companies of deceiving the public for decades about the dangers of climate change caused by fossil fuel use. The justices rejected an appeal from the oil companies, who were challenging a decision by Hawaii\u2019s highest court allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The defendants in the case include Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, BHP Group, Marathon Petroleum, and Chevron.\n\nHonolulu\u2019s lawsuit, filed in 2020 by the City and County of Honolulu and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply, alleges that the companies violated state law by misleading the public about the environmental risks of their fossil fuel products. The city claims these false statements contributed to property damage and infrastructure harm resulting from climate change. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages. Honolulu, located on Oahu Island, has experienced significant climate-related challenges, including heat waves that have strained its electrical grid. The lawsuit also highlights the need for costly retrofitting of a wastewater treatment plant to combat rising sea levels.\n\nBen Sullivan, an official at the City and County of Honolulu\u2019s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability, and Resiliency, praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. He called it a \"significant day\" for Honolulu, emphasizing that the ruling upholds the city\u2019s right to enforce state laws in local courts, protecting taxpayers and communities from the financial burdens of climate change, which the lawsuit attributes to the defendants' actions.\n\nHonolulu\u2019s case is part of a broader trend of U.S. jurisdictions suing fossil fuel companies, seeking damages for their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change. The lawsuit claims that for over 50 years, the companies have known about the harmful effects of their products but failed to warn the public. Instead, they allegedly concealed the risks, spread false information, and worked to undermine support for regulatory measures on greenhouse gases. As a result, the lawsuit argues, rising sea levels along Honolulu\u2019s coastline will lead to flooding, erosion, and loss of beaches, with extreme weather events becoming more frequent.\n\nThe oil companies had argued that federal law pre-empted the state law claims, as they believed the case sought to regulate interstate emissions and commerce, powers reserved for the federal government. However, Hawaii Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Crabtree denied this request, and the Hawaii Supreme Court upheld his ruling in October 2023. The companies then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the case. This is not the first time the defendants have attempted to move the case to federal court, as their previous request was also rejected by the Supreme Court in April 2023.",

I have taken the car out of town on highways and in rural settings and it shines in both! The seats are great and the interior space makes it pleasing to all passengers.\n\nIf there are a few things that I wish they would improve upon then it's the clutch. Relatively heavy, it can get a bit painful in bumper-to-bumper traffic and the absence of a dead pedal makes it worse. Another aspect is the relatively poor fuel efficiency - a combination of a turbo engine and city traffic means that it is difficult to do better than 8 kmpl in the city. To further compound this, the fuel tank is absolutely tiny and requires a refill a bit too often.\n\nThe dealership has changed in Mumbai - it was a bit disappointing that Citroen did not reach out to customers and inform them. I found out when I tried calling the previous dealer's service manager. However, after redirecting me to the new dealer it has been smooth thereafter.\n\nOverall, no regrets about my purchase and I'm enjoying the car, look forward to continued ownership.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nFor many years, BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) was the largest share on the Australian stock markets, only relatively recently being deposed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA).\n\nDespite this, the 'Big Australian' remains one of the largest mining companies in the world and is a staple investment in Australian share portfolios, regardless of age. Investors can't seem to get enough (understandably so) of the diversified, low-cost exposure to minerals like iron ore, potash, nickel and copper that BHP can lend to a portfolio.\n\nAs such, it goes without saying that the BHP financial calendar is an important document for many ASX investors. So today, let's go over some of the major dates that anyone with ownership or interest in BHP shares will want to circle on their calendars this year.\n\nWhat to expect from the Big Australian in 2025\n\nAccording to BHP's official 2025 shareholder calendar, the first event that investors might want to pay attention to this year is the 'operational review' scheduled for later this month on the morning of 21 January.\n\nThese operational reviews are typically when BHP provides a quarterly update to investors, including production and sales updates. As such, this month's report will give investors their first financial update from the miner since October last year. This might well set the tone for BHP's entire 2025.\n\nNext on the calendar, we have BHP's half-year earnings report, which will drop on the morning of 18 February. This is another big occasion for shareholders. They will receive the full report for BHP's revenues, earnings and profits for the six months to 31 December 2024.\n\nCrucially, shareholders will also find out exactly how much BHP's first dividend payment for 2025 will be worth.\n\nFollowing these earnings, BHP will deliver another quarterly operational review on 17 April, this one covering the nine months to 31 March 2025.\n\nRather unusually for a blue-chip ASX 200 share, BHP has not yet given us any dates on its financial calendar that come after 17 April. So we might have to wait a while until we learn when the miner's full-year results will be released, or when its annual general meeting (AGM) will be held. For a guide, these events occurred on 27 August and 30 October respectively in 2024.\n\nBHP share price snapshot\n\nBHP investors may be feeling a little apprehensive about 2025, given what 2024 brought (or didn't bring) to the table.\n\nIn contrast to the broader stock market, BHP shares had a horrible 2024. The miner dropped from $50.41 a share at the start of the year to $39.55 by the end. That's a fall worth 21.54%.\n\nCheck it out for yourself below:\n\nAt the time of writing, BHP shares are flat at $39.68 each. At this share price, BHP is trading with a trailing dividend yield of 5.56%.",

            "content": "BHPian Nagato710 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nGuerrilla 450 Ownership Review (1,000 Km)\n\nHi everyone from Bhutan. This is my first substantial post on Team-BHP. I\u2019ve been an avid follower for years, and it feels wonderful to contribute to this vibrant community. My love for automobiles began as a young teenager, voraciously reading magazines like Overdrive, Autocar, and TopGear, though my favorite was BSMotoring. I admired Bijoy Kumar Y\u2019s engaging style, and now Team-BHP fills that role. In this review, I\u2019ll share my journey with motorcycles, from the 2006 Bajaj Pulsar to the Guerrilla 450, detailing my experiences, modifications, and thoughts about each bike.\n\nThe Bajaj Pulsar 180 (2006)\n\nMy father gifted me this iconic motorcycle to celebrate securing a full government scholarship for my degree. The Pulsar was a revelation\u2014its sporty design, respectable power, and affordability made it a favorite among young riders of the time. The Ducati Monster-inspired design and the \u201cdefinitely male\u201d adverts were plus points.\n\nLikes:\n\n1. Power & Handling: With a 180cc engine, it felt powerful for a young and reckless rider. It was ideal for Bhutan's single-lane mountainous roads, but in hindsight, it was a dangerous combination for an inexperienced rider.\n\n2. Reliability: The bike was reliable for its time, with low maintenance costs and easy parts availability.\n\n3. Alloy Wheels and tubeless tires.\n\nDislikes:\n\n1. The brakes were disks at the front and drums at the rear. With no ABS, front end wound slip causing a few hair-raising experiences.\n\n2. A few months later, Bajaj introduced the all-black models. They looked much better.\n\nThis bike served me for a couple of years till I decided to upgrade when I started working and could save up for a new motorcycle.\n\nRoyal Enfield Classic 350 (2015)\n\nAfter years of dreaming, I finally bought the Classic 350, a decision influenced by its retro charm and iconic thump. At the time, I had to choose between the Classic 350 (C350) and the Classic 500 (C500). While the C500 offered fuel injection and more power, I opted for the C350 due to its simpler carburetor setup, easier maintenance, and significant cost difference. We still have just a single Official RE dealer in the whole country.\n\n\n\nLikes:\n\n1. Styling & Road Presence: The Classic 350 is a head-turner with its timeless design. It felt like a piece of history on wheels, exuding charisma wherever I went.\n\n2. Comfort: This motorcycle became my trusted companion for office tours to remote areas. It is perhaps one of the most comfortable motorcycles around.\n\nI carried out a number of modifications:\n\n1. Auxiliary Lights: Purchased from Amazon India for improved night visibility.\n\n2. Ladakh Carrier: Used only for tours, as it made the bike look bulky. I got the idea to install this from a YouTube video in the channel \u201ctollfreetraveller\u201d.\n\n3. Wildboar Exhaust: A controversial choice, installed for its bassy rumble during remote tours. In remote locations, there are instances where one may encounter wild animals such as bears and tigers. I reckoned that the loud sound would drive them away and it must have since I didn\u2019t encounter any such things. I switched back to the OEM exhaust for city rides.\n\n\n\nDislikes:\n\n1. Reliability Issues: Despite its charm, the bike required constant care. Common issues included Clutch and accelerator cables snapping mid-ride (I always had to carry spares).\n\n2. High maintenance costs compared to other bikes.\n\n3. Tubed tires were a constant worry during long tours, especially in remote areas with no workshops- I had to carry the entire tools and spares all the time.\n\nI reluctantly sold this beloved motorcycle after 6 years of use before heading abroad for further studies, knowing it would deteriorate without regular use.\n\n\n\nHero Xpulse 200 (2021)\n\n\n\nAfter returning to Bhutan during a vehicle import ban, I acquired a second-hand Hero Xpulse 200 from a friend. This bike introduced me to the world of adventure riding.\n\nLikes:\n\n1. Off-Road Prowess: The Xpulse shrugged off potholes, gravel roads, and uneven terrain. Whether on smooth asphalt or a rugged trail, the bike handled it all with ease.\n\n2. Comfort: Long and soft suspensions were a boon. I found this motorcycle more comfortable than the C35 I owned earlier.\n\nI carried out a couple of Modifications:\n\n1. Auxiliary Lights: The OEM lights were poor. I installed HJG auxiliary lights for better night-time visibility.\n\n2. Center Stand: Added for chain maintenance, though it compromised ground clearance.\n\n3. SC Project Exhaust: The OEM exhaust sound was conventional sounding. This installation makes better music. I also installed dB killer to reduce to a tolerable decibel.\n\n4. Sticker Removal: The stock stickers were too loud for my taste, so I removed them for a cleaner look.\n\nDislikes:\n\n1. Tubed tires remained a concern.\n\n2. Lack of power made overtaking on hilly roads nerve-wracking.\n\nDespite its strengths, the Xpulse left me craving a more powerful machine for hill overtakes and occasional long-distance touring.\n\nGuerrilla 450 (2024)\n\n\n\nAfter extensive research, I decided on the Guerrilla 450. While I considered the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 and the Triumph Speed 400, practical considerations like dealer proximity (No Trimp dealer in Bhutan) and features tipped the scales in favor of the Guerrilla. I had a chance to check out the H450 at Delhi after it was launched. I found it a bit too bulky for my everyday use. And also, since it was only available with tubed tires, I opted for the Guerrilla. As of today, I have ridden this motorcycle for 1000km.\n\nLikes\n\n1. Looks: Modern Design: A very handsome motorcycle.\n\n2. Powerful Engine: A significant upgrade over the Xpulse, making hill overtakes effortless.\n\n3. Alloy Wheels: A game-changer for long tours, eliminating the puncture anxiety I had with tubed tires. Now I just carry a tire inflator and a small repair kit.\n\n4. Ergonomics: Comfortable enough for both city rides and occasional tours.\n\n5. Service Accessibility: With a dealer in Thimphu, maintenance is more convenient.\n\n6. Digital Dash: A feature-rich cluster that feels modern and intuitive.\n\nDislikes\n\n1. Small Fuel Tank: At 11 liters, frequent refueling is required, especially on long trips.\n\n2. Loud Color Options: The available schemes are too brash for my liking. I may have liked them on my younger days, however, at my current age, I don\u2019t. I would have bought the silver color, however, that color option was only available for the base version with no digital dash. I opted for the next decent Playa Black color. Although this color also makes the motorcycle look like a Belgium flag, the red and yellow are sticker jobs and can be removed.\n\n\n\nThe Guerrilla 450 has been an excellent upgrade, offering a well-rounded mix of style, power, and practicality. It\u2019s a worthy companion for city commutes, weekend adventures, and long tours. However, its quirks, such as the small fuel tank and loud paint options, leave room for improvement. My Guerrila 450 is the first in Bhutan. Last I heard, it is still the only one in the country. This worries me in terms of parts availability, however, since most of the parts are shared with the Himalayan 450 (which is extremely popular here), I think it should be fine. I\u2019m looking forward to many more miles and memories with this machine.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

But it's still more than double the pre-pandemic decade average annual growth rate of 2%.\n\nCoreLogic's national rental index rose by 0.4% in the last quarter of calendar year 2024. This was the smallest December quarter increase since 2018.\n\nCoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said rental growth was slowing down across most capital cities except the ACT and Hobart.\n\nThis is due to a reduction in demand caused by lower net overseas migration, a trend towards larger capital city households, and continued affordability challenges.\n\nThe steepest falls in gross yields over the year occurred in the apartment markets of Perth (down 71 bps to 5.5%), Brisbane (down 54 bps to 4.5%), and Adelaide (down 36 bps to 4.7%).\n\nDarwin apartments experienced the biggest rise in gross rental yields last year, gaining 47 basis points (bps) to 7.9%. Melbourne apartments had the second-highest rise at 37 basis points to a yield of 4.8%.\n\nShares vs. property: How does the income stack up?\n\nHere are the current gross rental yields in each property market across Australia.\n\nProperty market Gross rental yield for houses Gross rental yield for apartments Sydney 2.7% 4% Melbourne 3.2% 4.8% Brisbane 3.4% 4.5% Adelaide 3.5% 4.7% Perth 4% 5.5% Hobart 4.3% 4.8% Darwin 6.2% 7.9% Canberra 3.8% 5.1% Regional New South Wales 4.1% 4.4% Regional Victoria 4.2% 5% Regional Queensland 4.4% 4.6% Regional South Australia 4.6% 5.1% Regional Western Australia 5.8% 7.9% Regional Tasmania 4.4% 5.1% Regional Northern Territory 7.2% N/A Source: CoreLogic\n\nTrailing dividend yields for the top 10 ASX shares\n\nFor perspective, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) lifted 7.49% last year, with total gross returns (including dividends) of 11.44%.\n\nThe ASX 200 usually delivers a 4% dividend yield, so last year's 3.95% is in line with the long-term trend.\n\nHere are the trailing dividend yields for the top 10 ASX 200 shares by market capitalisation.",

            "content": "BHPian abirnale recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nEasy roads lead to busy destination - difficult ones lead to beautiful destinations!\n\nSometimes you just don't have options - and that probably is the best thing to have!\n\nYou may ask why this trip at such an inappropriate time of the year (too much crowd on the road when schools are closed!). The answer is simple - because we want to! Technically speaking, this is the only time, both our kids have got holidays for about 10 days continuously and my work isn't going to be a hurdle for this year. So why not!\n\nJunior had Jim Corbett as his dream destination to visit someday - we made that as our prime journey destination for this trip! And the destination in itself is not everything - we had to throw in some more flavours of via points to make it a fun trip for everyone involved! To avoid better half turning into bitter half, I better include her wishlist item - Taj Mahal on the trip too if we are to go up north!\n\nSo the plan was made up:\n\nThe highlights here are:\n\nExcept the Safaris, everything else will be flexible and booked last minute.\n\nWe will take things easy - Instead of ticking off the list, we will soak into the destinations we are about to list\n\nJim Corbett isn't like Tadoba - so our hopes of sighting the tigers would be low - we still want to travel through this jungle!\n\nThe timing is odd - but thats the only time we can take out, so be it!\n\nPreparations:\n\nThere are two key items here - people and car. For Car, it wasn't anything specific - #TheRedSparkle is always ready to go anywhere we would like to - no special things here other than aligning luggage properly in the car!\n\nMy family (kids and spouse) have never been this far in north india are did not have any gear to protect from cold at this time of the year. So decathlon was out first choice to pick stuff for such destination and then more shopping for clothings and what not! Again nothing specific here - the only thing I ensured is everyone expects an ordinary trip so that no surprises can dampen our collective spirit.\n\nWith such a short prep and no extraordinary things, we made the plan and executed a little differently:\n\nPoints to note for repeating this trip:\n\nThere are a few things that you may want to make note of in case this trip you want to trace back again or a part of it to be done again.\n\nThe safari tickets to be booked in advance - there is no guarantee that you will get tickets of your choice and days/ timing!\n\nThe stays at Safari location needs to be such that your commute timing is optimum.\n\nThe Safari timings could be odd- you will miss your breakfast or lunch. Hotel should accommodate your odd requests to support!\n\nThe ASI monument tickets, Safari and National Park entry tickets can be booked online ahead of time - will avoid great deal of frustration and time for you!\n\nThe hotel stays on the commute route are only to sleep at night - pick the one with parking and better checkin/ checkout experiences. Early start helps greatly to cover maximum distance before the crowd gets up and jams the roads!\n\nDefensive driving all the time - it's easier that way to enjoy the trip!\n\nHotels we used:\n\nLK Inn @ Nirmal - Our Rating 2/5. Wouldn't recommend to use again.\n\nTipai Resort @ Mathani Gate - Our Rating 3.5/5. Descent place - great staff.\n\nJunglee Bagicha @ Sunna Gate - Our Rating 4/5. Costly though. Great staff, good support in all scenarios. Perfect location too. Great food.\n\nHotel Kadamb Tree @ Jabalpur - Our Rating 4/5. Great hospitality, optimum cost and good food. Superb staff!\n\nRegent Shyam Resort @ Bharatpur - Our Rating 2.5/3. Costly, great location. Below average hospitality.\n\nPearl of Taj @ Agra - Our Rating 4/5. Super cost optimum, best food, perfect location, Amazing staff\n\nCorbett Tiger and Trees @ Kyari Kham, Ramnagar - Our Rating 3/5. Average property, good kithen and service staff.\n\nHotel Jeetu @ Kausani - Our Rating 4.5/5. Awesome place, Super economic, great food, amazing service!\n\nOnline resources to book tickets:\n\nTipeshwar Safari Booking: https://safaribooking.mahaforest.gov.in/Userlogin\n\nBharatpur Booking: https://obms-tourist.rajasthan.gov.i...-National-Park\n\nTaj Mahal, Agra Fort: https://asi.payumoney.com/\n\nJim Corbett Package: https://www.corbettnationalpark.in/\n\nCredits for Support:\n\nWhile planning and executing for this trip, these TBhpians helped with a lot of inputs and real-time guidance too:\n\nMy heartfelt gratitude for their support and guidance throughout the trip!\n\nAs we neared to our the-date, we learnt that both kids have got holidays started earlier than we anticipated/ was declared officially by School! In addition to that, I had some open time on my calendar too - hence we decided to leave a day early. Also, that would give us a little time to breathe as me and my son were suffering form the cold even before we started the trip! So we decided to start early, take rest enroute. Since Tipeshwar Safaris are our hard dates, we decided to go closer to there and stay somewhere.\n\nThroughout the trip, my daughter was my navigator - she also has recently acquired the driving license and skills - grateful for her support during the trip. She did all hotel bookings, did satellite reece of the route and guided about the route whenever I asked for! This I think is our most important achievement - she has learnt to plan and execute these mega trips to unknown territorries! She was abl to pick the best hotels most of the times! Her choices in Jabalpur, Nagpur, Agra were superb!\n\nSome of the the roads we had taken were amazing.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe Tipeshwar Circuit: https://maps.app.goo.gl/9DoWW3mdozuFjYgH9 This is a great driving route with quaint villages!\n\nThe Jabalpur - Sagar Section: https://maps.app.goo.gl/fKQfTKGL96aspUui9 This section goes through a relatvely unknown tiger reserve - beautiful roads and perfect flora around for this time of the year!\n\nRamnagar - Kausani: https://maps.app.goo.gl/NT68QUD9BX2LgJ2L7 The road after Ranikhet upto the Someshwar Range is beautiful and goes through the jungle - least crowded and super twisty, scenic!\n\nBundelkhand Expressway: https://maps.app.goo.gl/LVXYQRYS29juSfUW9 The best road I have ever driven on - superbly marked, great surface and every 50 kms or so there is a fuel ad food stop! Not at all crowded too.\n\n#TheRedSparkle Summary\n\nSince TheRedSparkle has been with us for such a long time, we know our car very well by now! We know every tantrum, strength and weakness it has! We played to the best of it's strength: ADAS, Mile-munching ability, Soft-roading and mild off-roading! The car did not have any issues with regards to battery/ startup, ICE or even the DEF. Everytime, it behaved well and mind you that we have very old shoes on the car too. Everything form the beginning worked just perfect! Though we did not expect a great FE, sticking to speed limits has it's own benefits - we were able to much miles longer with great efficiency. Some times the FE was about 16 kmpl!\n\nAt times, the outside temperatures were at 2 degrees and the car did not let that affect us inside! We managed the temperatures inside so well that even in the foggy/ rainy situations, the windshield was always clear! This video below is a testimony of it's tech capabilities to aid in our safety during the most unfriendly weather conditions that we drove through.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cdejZlPhPKk\n\nAn important note: for ADAS to work, your windshield mounted camera needs to have clear vision and the sonar radar mounted behind front bumper should be clear of obstructions (like garland or mud etc.) If either of them have issues, the AEBS will be disabled thereby causing the ACC to switch off!\n\nSo the trick to drive during fogs is to ensure that there is no moisture/ fogging on the glass that causes such disruptions on the camera in ADAS unit as well as the sonar radar isn't blocked.\n\nTo highlight the role and contribution of #TheRedSparkle, rounding up the post with some select snaps of it:\n\nAt times the outside temperatures were 2 degree celcius!\n\nAnd in these temperatures too we did not see REGEN - case in point is, This is a workhorse who loves to munch miles tirelessly. If you keep it that way, DPF clogging is rarest of the rare event!\n\nContinue reading BHPian abirnale's post for more insights and information.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is taking a tumble today.\n\nThe benchmark index closed down 0.4% on Friday at 8,294.10 points. In late morning trade on Monday, the benchmark Aussie index is enduring steep losses at 8,187.2 points, down 1.3%.\n\nToday's retrace leaves the ASX 200 up 0.3% in the early days of 2025 and up 9.2% over the past full year.\n\nAs for some of Australia's biggest listed companies, BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) shares are up 0.2% at $39.77; CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL shares are down 2% at $279.33; and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) shares are down 1.9% at $153.03 apiece.\n\nHere's what's pressuring the wider market today.\n\nASX 200 catching US headwinds\n\nThe ASX 200 is following the lead of the United States' stock markets to head lower today.\n\nIn Friday trade the S&P 500 Index (SP: .INX) closed down 1.5% while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (NASDAQ: .IXIC) ended the trading day down 1.6%.\n\nThat puts the S&P 500 down 0.9% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has slipped 0.8%.\n\nThe sell-down in the US, which is pressuring the ASX 200 today, looks to be a classic case of what's good news for the economy can be bad news for markets.\n\nOn Friday, investors learned that the world's largest economy added more than 250,000 jobs in December, exceeding consensus expectations. US unemployment figures also ticked lower, surprising many analysts.\n\nSo, why are investors reacting by favouring their sell buttons?\n\nWell, that's mostly because the unexpected strength in the US labour markets could keep upwards pressure on wages, which in turn could stall the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nAnd if inflation surprises to the upside, we may not get the expected series of 2025 interest rate cuts from the Fed. Cuts that have already largely been priced in by the market.\n\nWhat are the experts saying?\n\nCommenting on the resilience of the US economy that's pressuring US stocks and the ASX 200 alike, Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro said, \"The shift in rate cut expectations has been big. Fed officials indicated they expect just two rate cuts across their eight meetings this year, down from four 25bps cuts in their September projections.\"\n\nAnd according to Bloomberg economists:\n\nRecent FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] communications indicate several members see the disinflation process as temporarily stalled or see risks that it could. December's CPI report is likely to support the view that it has indeed stalled, adding to the case for a careful approach to monetary-policy decisions in coming quarters.\n\nThe US CPI report is due out on Wednesday (overnight Aussie time).\n\nMax Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital (quoted by Bloomberg), added, \"There is just too much optimism based on consensus thinking that the Fed's going to keep cutting interest rates. People are over-reliant on a Fed put.\"\n\nOn Thursday, in addition to learning the US December inflation data, ASX 200 investors will also receive the latest Australian labour data from the ABS.\n\nStay tuned.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against other best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nPotash is a group of minerals and chemicals that contain potassium, a vital nutrient for plants and animals. The term refers to compounds including potassium sulfate, potassium-magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium oxide, and potassium chloride. Among these, potassium chloride (KCl), also known as muriate of potash (MOP), is the most commonly produced and used form of potash.\n\nPotash is primarily used to produce fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth and development. Fertilizers containing potash help to support plant growth, increase crop yield, and enhance disease resistance. Additionally, potash helps to improve water preservation, making it an indispensable supplement to the natural nutrient content of soils. Soils often lack these essential nutrients, or growing crops have depleted them, making potash a necessary addition to maintain soil fertility. With approximately 95% of potash being used in fertilizers, its role in agriculture cannot be emphasized enough. The remaining 5% is used in the production of potassium-bearing chemicals, such as detergents, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, water conditioners, and alternatives to de-icing salt.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing and 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nPotash is mined from underground deposits, either through conventional underground ore mining or by injecting water into the underground ore body and extracting the resulting brine. According to a report by the Canadian Government, potash production was estimated at 67.5 million tonnes globally in 2023, with Canada contributing 32.4% of the global supply. Canada, Russia, and Belarus dominate global potash production and accounted for 65.9% of the total in 2023. Canada is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of potash, with 11 active mines in Saskatchewan, producing 21.9 million tonnes and exporting 22.8 million tonnes in 2023, which accounts for over 41% of global exports.\n\nPotash prices have fluctuated over the years, declining from 2013 to 2016 and remaining relatively low until 2020. However, in 2021, prices rose sharply due to strong demand, and the surge continued into 2022, peaking at $1,202 per tonne in April, driven by geopolitical tensions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By June 2023, prices had fallen to $328 per tonne as global supply concerns subsided.\n\nPotash is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and its importance in fertilizers cannot be overstated. As the world\u2019s population continues to grow, the demand for potash is likely to increase.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 11 best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we sifted through financial media reports and potash-related ETFs to find companies that are involved in the production and processing of potash. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database to rank 11 stocks with the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is one of the largest mining companies in the world, producing a diverse range of resources, including potash. The company is developing the Jansen Potash Project in Canada, which is expected to become one of the world\u2019s largest potash mines upon completion. BHP Group\u2019s (NYSE:BHP) potash operations focus on meeting the growing demand for fertilizers to support global food security.\n\nBHP Group\u2019s (NYSE:BHP) growth strategy in potash is centered around the Jansen project, which is expected to enter the market at the low end of the global cost curve. The Jansen potash project is a significant investment for the company, with Stage 1 of the project ahead of schedule and expected to commence production in late 2026. The project has the potential to create value for many decades and will position BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) as a major player in the global potash market. The company has already signed non-binding sales agreements for all potash production from its Jansen potash project and plans to convert these agreements into binding contracts within 12\u201318 months.\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) also plans to expand the project in future stages, which could potentially lead to significant increases in production and revenue. The company\u2019s focus on potash is driven by the attractive long-term fundamentals of the market, with global demand expected to grow by around 70% by 2050. In addition to the Jansen project, BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is also exploring other opportunities to grow its potash business. The company\u2019s investment in potash is a key part of its strategy to diversify its portfolio and reduce its reliance on commodities such as iron ore and coal.\n\nOverall BHP ranks 6th on our list of the best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of BHP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The BHP Group Ltd (ASX:BHP) share price is about 3.7% above its 52-week low.\n\nBXB share price in focus\n\nBrambles manages the world\u2019s largest pool of reusable pallets, crates, and containers, providing a service central to most supply chains globally.\n\nThe company is better known by its main brand CHEP, which has operations across the Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions.\n\nBrambles makes money through a hiring model. For example, a manufacturer will make a product, then transfer the product to a retailer on CHEP pallets. Those pallets are then transferred back to CHEP or to another manufacturer or retailer in the supply chain. At each step, Brambles collects daily hire fees on its pallets and crates.\n\nBHP shares\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nBXB share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018fast read\u2019 of where the BXB share price is could be to study something like dividend yield over time. This can give us a sense of the stability of the company and whether they can consistently pay out a percentage of profits.\n\nRemember, the dividend yield is basically the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, Brambles Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.62%, compared to its 5-year average of 2.66%. In other words, BXB shares are trading lower than their historical average dividend yield. Be careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing, or both. In the case of BXB, the annual report shows last year\u2019s dividend was greater than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been growing.\n\nBHP is offering a historical dividend yield of around 5.51%, which compares to its 5-year average of 6.86%. This is just one of many ways you could put a value on BHP shares. The Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining valuation methods like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets which can help you learn how to value a company like BXB or BHP.",

            "content": "sushanthys BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2021 Location: Kottayam,Kerala Posts: 147 Thanked: 978 Times\n\nBYD Dashcam Installation in a BYD Atto3\n\nThis is a post regarding installation of a BYD dashcam in our BYD Atto 3 premium variant car.\n\nNow, BYD introduced a facelift for Atto3 in July 2024. Prior to the facelift, Atto 3 came as a single fully loaded variant. This car had an inbuilt dashcam. A very handy feature to have in any car.\n\nPost facelift, there were 3 variants \u2013 Dynamic (with a 50 kw battery), Premium (with a 60 kw battery) and Superior (with a 60 kw battery and ADAS). None of these have an in built dashcam. Considering that the retail price of a BYD original dashcam is around 70 USD(Rs.5800), I wonder why BYD did not continue with this very useful feature.\n\nAnyway, my wife bought a BYD Atto3 White Premium variant car in October 2024. The car has so far been a pleasure to own and drive.\n\nI had bought some accessories from topbyd.com after we got the car. They have all been of very good quality. I have written about them in detail in the BYD Atto 3 review thread.\n\nMy purchase also included the BYD dashcam. Before I committed, I had checked in youtube regarding the installation of the dashcam. The videos were all about other models of BYD such as Seal and Sealion.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Hfo5QhQFJoM?si=jEmoL1WNgtk0LXmg\n\nThe installation appeared simple enough. The gist of the matter is that there is a connecting cable for the dashcam in the plastic panel anterior to the IRVM. There is also a dedicated space for the dashcam to slot in. You remove the panel, release the cable, connect to the dashcam and slot the dashcam in place. A DIY job which is not at all difficult to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can appreciate the small circular aperture at the 4 o\u2019 clock position of the picture. That is the place where the camera slots in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the dashcam arrived (the parts are shipped from Hong Kong, takes around 2-3 weeks to arrive), the package looked like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera is quite small and looks sort of cute. There is provision for a cable connector at the back. A pry tool was also included along with the package to assist with opening the panel.\n\nOne Sunday morning, we opened the black IRVM panel & checked. Now there were whispers that the facelifted models did not have a dashcam cable inside. But I was unable to verify this, prior to the purchase. And sure enough, on opening the panel, the connecting cable was nowhere to be found.\n\nI contacted topbyd.com. They replied that the newer models do not come with the connecting cable. They advised me to purchase the connecting cable separately (costs around Rs.2900) and get it fixed at a competent shop or as a DIY project. I was not sure about this. There is a youtube video which shows how to get this done and the DIY job is actually not that hard. But you had to route the cable through the A Pillar in front of the airbag, which was not ideal.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/baLi6deTyiY?si=srOGLfRWoedbWKwK\n\nI checked for other dashcam options but was not happy with whatever I saw. So kept the dashcam project in the backburner for the moment.\n\nLast week, I took the Atto3 to Kochi for the car\u2019s first service (the first service is at 5000 km and then every 20,000 km/1 year thereafter). They finished everything in 2-3 hours. A Pleasant experience.\n\nI took delivery of the car and was driving it out when I remembered about the dashcam. To the security guy\u2019s bemusement, I reversed all the way back to the reception. I checked with my service manager whether they did the cable installation for the dashcam.\n\nThe service manager said \u201cBut Sir, the connecting cable is there in your car\u201d. He explained that the cable is sort of hidden under the roofing panel but can be taken out. He had never done it for a premium variant car but had done it for Dynamic variants so was very confident that the cable will be there.\n\nThe service technician was called and they went to work immediately. The steps went like this.\n\n-Remove the black plastic panel ahead of the IRVM (comes out in 2 separate segments)\n\n-Unscrew the IRVM\n\n-Unclip the lower part of the cabin lights panel\n\n-Remove the 2 screws connecting the Cabin lights panel to the roof\n\n-Remove the cabin lights panel\n\n-Remove the medial clip of the sun visor on the driver\u2019s side\n\n-Loosen the roof liner\n\nThe auto IRVM and cabin light connections are present here. Take care to carefully detach them during the work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see a thick cable running across the roof. This contains the connection for the sunroof & the sunroof shade. It also contains the cable for the dashcam. The cable is fixed to the roof tightly with a clip (blue arrow) and it has to be released first. The cable has to be pulled out slightly. The 3 cables are bound together by a tape and the tape has to be unwound. The dashcam connecting pin is well buried and the tape should be cut precisely over the pin to avoid cutting other wires (I was helping the technician and forgot to take pictures of releasing the cable)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work took around 20-30 minutes. It can be done as a DIY project if you are competent & confident and has the right tools. But I would recommend that it be done by professionals. It is not an easy job by any means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technician released the dashcam cable and screwed everything back together. He reconnected everything. He left the black panel uncovered since it would make it easier for me to connect the dashcam. The last part was just plug and play and I was confident I could do it by myself (the dashcam was at my home). I made sure that the sunroof and the cabin lights were working before driving back to Kottayam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo today morning, finished the job, with my wife\u2019s help. The cable has to be connected to the camera with the correct alignment of pins (you will hear a satisfying click).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera is slotted into its designated place (there is a small plastic cap covering the camera aperture which the technician had removed). Again, you will hear a satisfying click when the camera is fitted correctly. There is a clip on the roof of the panel where you can snugly hitch the wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the camera is in place, start the car. Once the touchscreen is on, you will have to reboot it. Once it restarts, it will recognise the dashcam and will reboot once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the screen restarts again, you can see the dashcam application. You can open it and check the settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image quality is good. You have the option to select the time loop for each recording. Option to record a particular event is also there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are sure that everything is working, fix the black panel back. It comes in 2 segments and both have to be fitted separately. It took some tinkering but was easy enough at the end. The whole process took around 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dashcam needs a microSD card. BYD recommends a max capacity of 128 GB. I will have to get one sometime this week. The microSD card slot is situated low down in the dashboard at the lower storage area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of the BYD dashcam\n\n-Ease of installation(camera). No separate need of cables, hardwiring.\n\n-Well integrated with very good aesthetics. The dashcam is virtually invisible, post installation. Despite taking multiple snaps, I could not get a picture in which the dashcam was visible from outside.\n\n-The image quality is good (HD).\n\n-Ease of usage. Can be operated directly via touchscreen. No need for mobile apps.\n\n-The cost is Rs.5800. Very reasonable for the ease, usage & aesthetics.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n-Professional help required for getting the dashcam cable ready for connection\n\n-Image quality is HD, not 4K.\n\n-No rear camera setup available with this model (that I know of)\n\n\n\nI hope this post is useful for BYD owners who are looking to get a dashcam installed. Cheers! Hi guys.This is a post regarding installation of a BYD dashcam in our BYD Atto 3 premium variant car.Now, BYD introduced a facelift for Atto3 in July 2024. Prior to the facelift, Atto 3 came as a single fully loaded variant. This car had an inbuilt dashcam. A very handy feature to have in any car.Post facelift, there were 3 variants \u2013 Dynamic (with a 50 kw battery), Premium (with a 60 kw battery) and Superior (with a 60 kw battery and ADAS). None of these have an in built dashcam. Considering that the retail price of a BYD original dashcam is around 70 USD(Rs.5800), I wonder why BYD did not continue with this very useful feature.Anyway, my wife bought a BYD Atto3 White Premium variant car in October 2024. The car has so far been a pleasure to own and drive.I had bought some accessories from topbyd.com after we got the car. They have all been of very good quality. I have written about them in detail in the BYD Atto 3 review thread.My purchase also included the BYD dashcam. Before I committed, I had checked in youtube regarding the installation of the dashcam. The videos were all about other models of BYD such as Seal and Sealion.The installation appeared simple enough. The gist of the matter is that there is a connecting cable for the dashcam in the plastic panel anterior to the IRVM. There is also a dedicated space for the dashcam to slot in. You remove the panel, release the cable, connect to the dashcam and slot the dashcam in place. A DIY job which is not at all difficult to do.You can appreciate the small circular aperture at the 4 o\u2019 clock position of the picture. That is the place where the camera slots in.Once the dashcam arrived (the parts are shipped from Hong Kong, takes around 2-3 weeks to arrive), the package looked like this.The camera is quite small and looks sort of cute. There is provision for a cable connector at the back. A pry tool was also included along with the package to assist with opening the panel.One Sunday morning, we opened the black IRVM panel & checked. Now there were whispers that the facelifted models did not have a dashcam cable inside. But I was unable to verify this, prior to the purchase. And sure enough, on opening the panel, the connecting cable was nowhere to be found.I contacted topbyd.com. They replied that the newer models do not come with the connecting cable. They advised me to purchase the connecting cable separately (costs around Rs.2900) and get it fixed at a competent shop or as a DIY project. I was not sure about this. There is a youtube video which shows how to get this done and the DIY job is actually not that hard. But you had to route the cable through the A Pillar in front of the airbag, which was not ideal.I checked for other dashcam options but was not happy with whatever I saw.

Changing the oil scraper ring will not help much. The oil consumption drastically increases after about 55-60K running. Mine went from about 40 Hrs of running to consume 1 litre to 20 hours. That meant in Mumbai standing/ crawling traffic, I was topping up 1 litre every 300-350 kms. However there was no loss of power. The only way out is to change to EA888 Gen2 engines that came in Octavia 1.8TSI from 2016 onwards.\n\n\n\nGiven yours is a DL car, you will not get FC extended in Delhi atleast. So the option is get a NOC now ( before RC expires) and transfer it to MH / Or any other state. That also will mean paying some road tax again. If you are not willing to do this, then just scrap the car and move on. Quote: autoliebe Originally Posted by Hey thetinywanderer! Get in touch with this guy - Mukesh Chandra.

Hope 2025 would be better.\n\nThe location of both these accidents is Almora-Pithoragarh Road, Uttarakhand. For those who do not know, this is a narrow, steep road post Nainital.\n\nAll these pictures are from April 2024 and September 2024.\n\nFirst accident\n\nThe Brown Duster was being driven by my father; he is a very sedate driver. The speed at impact was 48kmph as per the GPS device.\n\nAs my father recounts the event, there was a small laptop bag that my father keeps on the second row secured to the seatbelt but this time, he just kept it on the front left seat, on a tight left corner, he steered the vehicle left, at the same time the bag moved towards the right, my father for a second tried to put the bag back in its position and the accident happened.\n\nHe said the events unfolded so fast that the car was hanging by the cliff and hit the tree before he could even touch the brake pedal.\n\nI REQUEST ALL THE PEOPLE NOT TO KEEP ANY FLYING PROJECTILES, these things do make a difference.\n\nSecond accident\n\nThe second instance was on 28 September, 2024. I was on my way back to Delhi from my home, barely 60 kms away from my home. An ITBP truck, a Tata 1613SE, when he decided to take a right turn (the truck's perspective) as if he was driving in a left-hand drive country.\n\nThis accident happened at about 30kmph, please note that this was one of the widest sections of this road and there was plenty of space for the truck to pass, I have been driving our own Tata 1212 on this route with even 15 tonnes of load during the rains, sand gets heavier due to water.\n\nResult: The ITBP driver accepted his fault and I did not make any claim given these guys work hard for this country and the damage to my vehicle was mostly cosmetic, the car was still driveable and did complete the trip to Delhi in same condition, except for the bent steel spare that I was using that day.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "BHP share price in focus\n\nThe ASX:BHP ) share price is down 21.5% since the start of 2025. Is it time that you added BHP shares to your watchlist?\n\nBHP Group, formerly known as BHP Billiton, is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885. It produces a wide range of commodities used in energy production and manufacturing, and is expanding into fertilisers.\n\nBHP\u2019s primary business revolves around mineral exploration and production, with its assets and operations divided into three key focus areas: copper and related minerals (such as gold, uranium, silver, and zinc), iron ore, and coal (both metallurgical and energy).\n\nBHP is widely regarded as a stable, dividend-paying investment and is a common component of ASX share portfolios. If you invest in a popular ETF, LIC, or through an Industry Super fund, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nThe appeal of ASX Materials shares\n\nThe S&P/ASX200 Materials Index (ASX: XMJ) has averaged 3.06% per year in capital growth over the last 5 years. That compares to the ASX 200 index which has returned 3.74% per year over the same period. Let\u2019s take a look at why you might want a materials company like BHP in your portfolio.\n\nBig dividends\n\nWhile there are periods of capital growth, it\u2019s the dividends that most investors are interested in when assessing materials shares. After all, it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been known for for many years. Over the last 5 years the BHP dividend yield has averaged 6.86% per year.\n\nAussie materials companies like BHP have developed a good reputation of being reliable dividend payers. However, these are still commodity-driven businesses so the dividends (like the share price) can fluctuate quite a bit.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nMining is one of the backbones of our modern economy and the demand for things like iron ore, copper, and lithium is not going away any time soon.\n\nIn fact, the demand for a lot of precious metals is rapidly growing as the economy transitions to renewable energy. A lot of these materials are needed for things like electric car batteries and solar panels. Companies like BHP and Rio Tinto are investing a lot of money to put themselves at the forefront of this oncoming wave of demand.\n\nBHP share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a \u2018quick read\u2019 of where the BHP share price is would be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, BHP Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 5.51%, compared to its 5-year average of 6.86%. Put simply, BHP shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.\n\nBe careful how you interpret this information though \u2013 it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing. In the case of BHP, last year\u2019s dividend was less than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been falling.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the BHP share price.",

            "content": "BHPian HDx440Life recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI usually save leaves for the end of the year and have always dreamt of going on a coastal bike ride. I bought the Harley Davidson X440 end of 2023 and felt too scared of the unknown to go on a ride that year. Jump to 2024 and I was finally more confident in my bike and my handling skills on it. I finally applied for 1 week of leave and started to plan for a solo ride in Nov of 2024.\n\nI had to then decide on which route to take and finalized Bangalore - Chikmangaluru - Gokarna - Goa - Davanagere - Bangalore. I intentionally kept the first day short since it's been a long time since I went on a long ride. I wanted my body to get used to it. Below is the route I planned:\n\nNext came the stage of planning my stay during the bike ride. I wanted this ride to be an experience I will never forget, so I went ahead and booked an Airbnb in Chikmangaluru and a hostel in Gokarna! I've never stayed in a hostel and so was looking forward to the experience, especially since it was a mixed dorm with capacity to sleep 8 people! The plan was to spend 1 night in Chikmangaluru, Gokarna and 4 nights in Goa plus 1 night in Davanagere on my way back.\n\nAll set and I went about the task of buying the required gear. Got a GUARDIANGEARS Wolverine Magnetic Tank Pouch with Rain Cover, GUARDIANGEARS Rhino Mini 50L Tail Bag with Rain Cover, and some bamboo socks since I hate smelly feet. I already had the following: clan riding boots, Fly Butane Pants, Fly Terra Trek II Jacket and cramster waterproof gloves. I noticed all the armour had dry rot just like my old Alpinestar shoes and so bought knox elbow and shoulder ce level 2 armours (set of 4) plus royal enfield ergo pro-tech shoulder protector\u2014yellow. They fit my riding gear well and I have to say their quality is very good.\n\nFinally the night before my ride came, and I packed my stuff. Got up the next day and had the task of attaching my tailbag on the bike and then getting into my riding gear. Below is a pic of the bike all ready for the ride:\n\nThe first part of the ride was pretty uneventful as the roads were good, and I rode at a steady pace (70km - 80km speeds) and reached the Airbnb in Chikmangaluru. The place was lovely and just as described on the listing. Had light lunch and took out my DJI drone for a video and taking pictures. See pic of the loaction below:\n\nDrone shot of my stay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eLnFzMkmRU\n\nI got up early the next day and started my ride around 7 am. The roads were wonderful, and I reached Gokarna by 1 pm. I really had fun riding on the winding roads in the mountain and was looking forward to my hostel stay. The room was lovely and much better than I expected. Attached is a pic below.\n\nAn Insta 360 X3 video of my ride through the jungle:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAlkG7iZo6M\n\nMy hostel room, which I ended up sharing with another guy and 3 girls:\n\n\n\nI had fun in Gokarna would be an understatement. I went to the main beach, Paradise Beach, and Om Beach. Loved the vibe and made a short video compilation of my drone videos there:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9k9QelXEQ\n\nMy roommates (the girls) woke up early the next day (I guess around 4 am) and so I too woke up at that time. Was busy till 5:30 and left for Om Beach to see the sunrise. It's a sight to behold. You should try seeing the sunrise there if you ever visit Gokarna.\n\nNext I returned to my hotel by 7am and got ready and left for Goa by 8am. I have to say the roads are smooth as butter and on the way I had the sea to my left and a river on the right. Attaching my drone shoot of the place below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtI5br3ENIE\n\nI kept riding and eventually reached the end of the road- both figuratively and literally. Just see for yourself in the pic below:\n\nGoogle took me to a narrow road (with no option to turn my bike midway), and the road ended in the sea! I was shocked and started wondering what to do next . Fortunately, someone local came on a bicycle and, upon checking, informed me we need to take a boat across the sea! See pic below of the route and my bike going on a boat ride:\n\nI finally reached Goa, checked in to a boutique hotel I booked, and went to the airport. Did I forget to mention my wife wanted to go to Goa so I booked a flight for her and my 5 years old. Here are two pics from Goa as I am sure everyone is bored of looking at photos from Goa:\n\nWith all the fun over in Goa, my family flew back, and I left for Davanagere. An interesting thing happened on the way. Google took me off the highway and into a reserved forest. The road was in good shape for the most part, but not one vehicle was on it, except my bike. I stopped my bike at a point and took a photo in the middle of the jungle without a worry in the world. See pic below:\n\nStarted my bike, and then I came across a sign asking not to stop since there are cheetahs in the jungle!. Well, anyways, I continued to ride and stayed in a decent hotel that night. The ride back to Bangalore was smooth the next day and I was happy to have finally completed a ride I will remember for the rest of my life! Looking forward to the next adventure ride this year.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

The lighting in front seats of the car improved quite a bit.

All I could find was some after market lights sticked to the headliner with double sided tape or two strips of LEDs glued to the C-Pillar. Both of which were looking out of place.\n\n\n\nSo I decided to take matters into my own hands and started searching any OEM lights that might fit for the nano. I had only one criteria in mind, the housing of the light should match the colour of the headliner. Mine is an 2010 LX variant which comes with grey headliner, grab-handles, sunshades and pillar covers.\n\n\n\nSoon after this I came across two roof lights. One was for the Tata Nexon's rear seats and another one was the standard Maruthi cabin light used in Baleno, Brezza etc,.\n\n\n\nI Chose to go with the Maruthi one because it looked kind of Retro-ish.\n\n\n\nPart No - 36210M55K01-6GS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe colour matches very well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI removed my stock cabin light and found that it uses a 3 Pin connector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose three wires are,\n\nMaroon - Always Postive\n\nBlack and White - Always Negative (ON Position)\n\nBlack - Door Negative (DOOR position).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maruthi light also uses a 3 Pin connector, so I just need a 3 Pin connector at either end to connect these two together and they will work independently as intended.

            "content": "BHPian pvsk recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI have driven the Renault Kwid RXT 1.0 Option equipped with the Lovato EXR Blue CNG kit for 2,00,000 kilometers across most of the states of India, including diverse terrains like mountains, forests, and highways, here's my experience with the car, which was a reliable companion through every type of road and weather condition. After covering such an extensive distance, the car has shown impressive resilience.\n\nPerformance Across Various Terrains\n\nHighways: On long stretches of highways, the Kwid RXT 1.0 with the CNG kit performed admirably. CNG was significantly cheaper compared to petrol, reducing my running costs. On smoother highways, the car cruised comfortably at speeds of up to 100-110 km/h. Although the engine is not a powerhouse, it\u2019s sufficient for everyday long-distance driving. The smooth switch between petrol and CNG was mostly seamless as it was a sequential CNG Kit, it automatically switches itself to CNG and Petrol Whenever is required.\n\nMountains and Hilly Terrains: Driving up steep mountain roads posed a challenge for any car, but the Kwid held its ground. The 1.0L engine, while not the most powerful in its segment, provided enough torque to navigate inclines. However, I had to shift to petrol mode on steeper ascents because the CNG system tends to reduce engine performance due to lower energy content compared to petrol. Once on the flat or downhill stretches, switching back to CNG provided the best efficiency.\n\nForest and Rural Roads: The Kwid excelled in rural and forest roads, where roads are often narrow and bumpy. The compact dimensions made it easy to maneuver through tight spaces, and the light steering helped in making quick turns. However, the suspension did start to show signs of wear at this point. Over time, the ride quality became a little stiffer, especially when driving on uneven roads. I had replaced the helical spring of the suspension with the springs which comes with Volkswagon Vento with some minor alterations to fit in the mounts of Kwid and with that the height of the vehicle is increased by 60 mm which makes the ground clearance of the vehicle to 240 mm, almost similar to the most of the SUVs available in the market. After the upgradation of the suspension there is no challenge in the forest and rural roads with high ground clearance.\n\nCNG Kit Performance and Longevity\n\nThe Lovato EXR Blue CNG kit was a major factor in the car\u2019s overall fuel efficiency. The CNG kit was installed in the vehicle after completing approximately 4000 Kms. After the conversion, the system worked quite well and needed minimal intervention. Here's how the kit held up:\n\nFuel Switching: The switch from CNG to petrol and vice versa worked smoothly most of the time. On rare occasions, especially in extreme weather conditions like cold climate where the temperature is below 10 degrees, I noticed a slight hesitation or delay during the switch. These were minor inconveniences but didn\u2019t impact the overall experience much.\n\nMileage: CNG was a godsend for long-distance travel. The fuel efficiency was a major highlight, delivering impressive mileage of 30-32 Km/Kg on highways and 28-30 Km/Kg in city traffic and I could cover huge distances on a single tank. I did have to visit CNG refueling stations often in remote areas. I use Nawgati App, (earlier CNG ECO Connect) to find the CNG Stations on the route and the overall savings were massive compared to petrol.\n\nMaintenance: The CNG kit doesn't require any servicing. The filter was changed after completing 1 Lakh Kms. CNG cylinder needs to be tested for every 3 years. There were minor issues with the CNG hoses wearing out, but these were handled easily during maintenance. I kept the kit in good shape, which prevented major issues down the road.\n\nDriving Comfort and Handling\n\nSuspension and Ride Quality: Over the course of 200,000 km, the suspension system began to show signs of fatigue. In cities, where roads were rough or under construction, I began to notice more bumps inside the cabin. The shock absorbers and suspension bushings had worn down, which made the ride feel less smooth. I had replaced the helical spring of the suspension with the springs which comes with Volkswagon Vento with some minor alterations to fit in the mounts of Kwid and with that the height of the vehicle is increased by 60 mm which makes the ground clearance of the vehicle to 240 mm, almost similar to the most of the SUVs available in the market. After the upgradation of the suspension there is no challenge anywhere with high ground clearance.\n\nInterior Comfort: The cabin still remains functional, though wear and tear were noticeable after extensive use. The seats held up well for long trips, but after 2 lakh kilometers, the cushioning was a bit compressed. The infotainment system also worked well. I have upgraded the speakers with pioneer oval shaped coaxial speakers by replacing the rear parcel tray with wooden make. Activated the BOSE Audio in the infotainment system by cracking the internal system.\n\nClimate Control: The air conditioning system worked fine for the most part, but after extended use, there were signs of a drop in cooling efficiency. AC gas was refilled twice at around 80000 kms and again 150000 kms. At 178000 Kms the bearings and clutch kit of AC compressor has got damaged and replaced at a cost of around Rs. 3000.\n\nMaintenance and Cost of Ownership\n\nRoutine Servicing: Keeping up with regular oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks was crucial in maintaining engine performance. The CNG kit doesnt require any maintenance. Even with 200,000 km on the odometer, I didn\u2019t experience any major engine failures or breakdowns, which speaks to the durability of the Kwid and the CNG system when properly maintained. The average service cost for every 10000 kms is around Rs. 4000 - Rs.5000 at Renault authorised service centre.\n\nMajor Repairs: After 200,000 km, the engine finally needed an overhaul. One of the valve in the cylinder 3 got leaked and engine got misfiring issues. The timing belt and some internal components like pistons were showing wear after opening the engine for overhaul. This was expected after such high mileage. So the timing kit, valves and the pistons are replaced. Parts like brake pads, suspension bushings, and shock absorbers were replaced periodically as part of regular maintenance. After completing around 1,75,000 Lakh Kms the full body painting was done followed by ceramic coating. Sharing the before and after pictures.\n\nCost Efficiency: One of the best parts about owning the Kwid with the CNG kit was the low maintenance costs. Parts were relatively affordable, and service intervals were generous. CNG being a cheaper fuel than petrol resulted in immense savings on long trips across the country. My overall expenditure on fuel was drastically lower than it would have been if I were using petrol exclusively.\n\nStates Covered in India.\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nTamil Nadu\n\nKerala\n\nKarnataka\n\nTelangana\n\nMaharashtra\n\nGujarat\n\nRajasthan\n\nPunjab\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nPondicherry\n\nGoa\n\nDaman and Diu\n\nDadra and Nager Haveli\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nUttarakhand\n\nConclusion After 200,000 Kms\n\nStrengths:\n\nFuel Efficiency: The combination of the Renault Kwid's light weight and the Lovato CNG kit made it one of the most fuel-efficient cars in its segment, especially when driving across long distances.\n\nLow Cost of Ownership: Maintenance costs were low, and parts were reasonably priced, making it a highly economical vehicle for long-term use.\n\nReliability: Despite the high mileage, the car remained reliable through different terrains and conditions. The CNG kit continued to perform well with minimal issues.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nEngine Wear: After 2 lakh kilometers, the engine showed signs of wear, leading to the need for an overhaul. While this is expected with such high mileage, the engine was still functional before the overhaul.\n\nIn conclusion, the Renault Kwid RXT 1.0 Option with the Lovato EXR Blue CNG kit has been a fantastic long-term companion for over 200,000 kilometers. It has handled diverse terrains, extreme weather conditions, and long highway drives with ease. While there was some wear and tear, especially with the suspension and engine, the overall experience has been overwhelmingly positive. It was economical to run, reliable, and capable of handling the Indian roads with minimal issues. The engine overhaul was expected after such high mileage, but the car still has a lot to offer for those willing to invest in maintaining it for a few more years.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Poole said juniors have struggled in recent years to attract funding. But having access to the extensive technical capabilities within the BHP business is something money can\u2019t buy.\n\nIt also elevates the status of Picha, making clear one of the world\u2019s top miners thinks it has world class potential \u2013 something that could produce hundreds of thousands of tonnes a year over decades.\n\n\u201cBHP Xplor acts as an incubator for non-dilutive funding for projects that BHP believes has the potential to be a discovery of size and scale to meet their investment criteria, they aren\u2019t there for small scale anomalies,\u201d Poole said.\n\n\u201cThe access this opportunity gives us to tap into the technical resources of a resources powerhouse like BHP, who have been exploring for similar style copper deposits for decades, I don\u2019t think can be quantified.\n\n\u201cI think the real benefit for Firetail will be the ability to interpret multiple layers of data at an accelerated pace, helping to refine targets and develop appropriate follow up plans.\n\n\u201cFor Firetail to do this alone would take significantly longer and would rely on the availability of external parties.\n\n\u201cIn the event that Firetail is successful in defining a substantial discovery, BHP would be the ideal development partner.\u201d\n\nPoole said the program funding will be used for generative exploration \u2013 property wide geophysics to help define areas of interest, with the aim to follow up with high resolution drone/ground-based geophysics and geochemistry.\n\n\u201cThe aim, by the end of the program, is to have substantial targets defined that are drill ready, meeting the scale threshold of BHP style targets,\u201d he said.\n\nCopper the key commodity this year\n\nA mix of public and private exploration companies were selected to take part in the first cycle in 2023, including nickel-PGE focused Kingsrose Mining (ASX:KRM), nickel sulphide explorer Nordic Nickel (ASX:NNL) and battery metals explorer Impact Minerals (ASX:IPT) , which described the program as a \u2018mini-MBA\u2019 for minerals exploration \u2013 complete with boot camps, tool kits, master classes and one-on-one coaching sessions to help speed up the path to discovery.\n\nKingsrose is a shining example of the access the project provides. After its involvement in 2023 the mining giant came back last year with two \u2018industry-leading\u2019 exploration alliance agreements.\n\nThey will see BHP sole fund up to US$20 million ($31m) over up to four years looking for belt-scale base metal targets in Norway and Finland. If it identifies a \u2018defined project\u2019 BHP can earn up to 75% in two stages by sole funding up US$36m over seven years from the start of an earn-in phase. Notably, that excludes Kingsrose\u2019s existing Penikat and R\u00e5na projects, but plainly makes BHP an interested party should those assets deliver the sort of tier-1 critical minerals discovery the world\u2019s biggest miner is frothing right now.\n\nIn 2024, six companies joined the program including technology-focused Equivest Minerals and Longreach Mineral, UK\u2019s East Star Resources and Pallas Resources \u2013 both exploring Kazakhstan \u2013 WA\u2019s Hamelin Gold (ASX:HMG), and Botswana based Cobre (ASX:CBE). The commodities covered included petroleum, copper, gold, nickel, lithium.\n\nThis year, BHP has made an obvious shift towards copper players.\n\n\u201cThe field of applicants for BHP Xplor was extremely strong this year,\u201d BHP\u2019s head of Xplor, Marley Palin said.\n\n\u201cSuccessful applicants had to demonstrate not only that their critical-mineral projects were highly prospective but also that they were committed to pushing industry boundaries in their geological concepts and data-gathering, testing and processing to realise the project.\n\n\u201cFiretail and their Picha project more than met these criteria and we look forward to partnering with them.\u201d\n\nBHP famously failed in its bid to takeover Anglo American last year, a $70bn gambit designed to procure its low cost Peruvian copper mines. It later spent ~US$3bn on development stage assets in Argentina\u2019s Vicuna region.\n\nIt\u2019s a good time to be in copper. Poole sees copper remaining strong for many years as the world develops and increases its reliance on power supply and electronics.\n\n\u201cWe have seen significant changes in generation, supply and storage technology and the metals associated, but copper has remained in constant demand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Firetail can play a crucial role in feeding that demand, with copper projects covering the full exploration spectrum.\n\n\u201cSkyline already has significant drilling completed and significant potential for growth, and we are only beginning to scratch the surface of the potential we see in Peru, and the selection of the Picha project in Peru for the BHP Xplor program further validates this.\u201d\n\nWhile South America is the largest player in copper supply, the mining giant cast a wide net.\n\nPalin said the 2025 cohort was BHP\u2019s most diverse cohort to date.\n\nOther companies in the class of 2025\n\nBHP also picked a range of companies in or near the US for this year\u2019s Xplor program, including:\n\nScout Discoveries \u2013 Cuddy Mountain copper and Erickson Ridge gold projects in Idaho, USA\n\nOrogen Royalties \u2013 Eight properties under option, six projects for sale or option, one exploration licence and 27 royalties in the portfolio\n\nViridian Metals \u2013 Kraken nickel, copper, cobalt project and Seden copper project in Labrador, Canada\n\nCondor Prospecting \u2013 Holds multiple projects in Argentina and conducts exploration for companies like Belararox (ASX:BRX), which owns the TMT project.\n\nOutside of America and its neighbours, the mining giant chose two more companies to round out the 2025 cohort in Saudi Arabia\u2019s DesertEX and Electrum Discovery Corp, which holds the Timok East copper-gold and Novo Tlamino gold projects in Serbia.\n\nBHP Xplor participants share prices today:\n\nAt Stockhead we tell it like it is.

            "content": "The BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) share price experienced plenty of ups and downs in the last 12 months. Is the ASX mining share a buy? I\u2019m going to look at that in this article.\n\nBHP is one of the world\u2019s biggest resource businesses with a number of commodities including iron ore, copper, coal and potash.\n\nIs the BHP share price a buy?\n\nThere is a lot to like about the company\u2019s size and its blue-chip status. Its size means it\u2019s very well-placed to handle any downturns the resource sector may see, whereas small companies can be wiped out in a downturn.\n\nBeing one of the biggest in the world also gives BHP the most scale, so it has achieved cost advantages compared to some of its smaller mining peers, allowing it to generate higher profit margins and make stronger returns from a mineral deposit.\n\nBHP\u2019s balance sheet\u2019s size is also beneficial because it can get the best funding terms for its debt, and it also has the financial firepower to make acquisitions. The mining giant has been building its exposure to copper in recent times, which I believe is a good move to do and could help the BHP share price in the long-term.\n\nOne of the main questions I have right now is what\u2019s going to happen with the iron ore price. The commodity is normally integral to how much profit BHP makes each year.\n\nThe iron ore price is currently below US$98 per tonne in January, which is the lowest it has been for a few months. There are reports that Chinese steels mills have been cutting production due to weaker demand and smaller profit margins. Steel output is expected to decline further through the year.\n\nDespite those conditions, iron ore shipments to China have increased with iron ore miners, which may include BHP, increasing iron ore deliveries towards the end of 2024 to meet annual targets.\n\nI\u2019d suggest this is why the BHP share price has been falling in recent months.\n\nOn the positive side of things, it was also reported that China has expanded its consumer good trade-in scheme to help stimulate domestic demand, with some expectations that could increase future demand for iron ore.\n\nMy final thoughts\n\nOverall, with the BHP share price below $40, I think this is a reasonable time to look at BHP after a fall of 20% since 9 January 2024. I like its growing exposure to copper, though iron ore, potash and coal don\u2019t seem as compelling as they did a couple of years ago.\n\nIf the iron ore price falls further, BHP shares could become more interesting if the price falls further.\n\nBut, there are other ASX dividend shares that seem more appealing.",

As a basket, represented by the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index (ASX: XMM), they fell by more than 10%.\n\nThis was in a world where the broader S&P/ASX 200 index (ASX: XJO) set numerous record highs.\n\nThe mining giants were all down, just to different magnitudes. BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO), Mineral Resources Ltd (ASX: MIN), and Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG) all finished in the red.\n\nAfter this selloff, is now the time to pounce on the sector? Let's see what the experts think.\n\nCiti remains cautious on ASX 200 mining shares\n\nASX 200 mining shares were heavily sold last year and are trading at far lower prices than this time 12 months ago.\n\nSome might say now is the time to 'bottom-fish' among these beaten-up stocks.\n\nBut Citi analyst Paul McTaggart warns that valuations alone aren't a reason to buy into the sector. According to reporting by The Australian Financial Review:\n\nImproved valuation metrics are not yet a green light for investors to dive back in. The macro backdrop remains uncertain, with persistent demand-side concerns and geopolitical risks overshadowing the improving valuation metrics.\n\nMcTaggart expects one major headwind to be the slowdown in the Chinese economy.\n\nCiti forecasts the nation's GDP to slow to just 4.2% this year, impacting demand for many commodities, particularly iron ore. According to Statista, China is the world's largest importer of the resource.\n\nCiti also sees \"further downside to consensus\" for iron ore. It isn't alone, either. As my colleague Aaron reports, the RBA projects an 80% reduction in iron ore demand from China by 2050.\n\nFor this reason, McTaggart sees \"no reason to get excited yet\" on the ASX mining sector.\n\nViews are mixed ASX 200 mining shares\n\nCiti is tip-toeing around the space with a delicate outlook on ASX 200 mining shares.\n\nIn comparison, analysts at Morgan Stanley see value in the sector. In November last year, the broker recommended switching from overpriced bank stocks to unloved mining plays.\n\nIt has positive views on energy and niche segments like uranium, according to reporting from The AFR.\n\nBut it isn't ignoring the risks out of China, either. In its 2025 outlook, the broker said it sees \"weaker growth\" from the nation this year, \"due to insufficient consumption stimulus and the potential for higher US tariffs\".\n\nFoolish takeout\n\nWhile improved valuations might tempt some investors, Citi reckons the risks facing ASX 200 mining shares outweigh the rewards for now.\n\nBut Morgan Stanley takes the opposite view, noting now might be the right point in the cycle to consider mining plays.\n\nBoth see a weaker growth outlook from China as a risk. In that case, these brokers appear to be on two sides of the same coin. TIme will tell what eventuates from here.",

This was a \"friends and family\" drive, done together with my friends @robimahanta and @justwheels, each of us driving our own Thar 4x4. Thus we had three families in three Thars going together for this drive. This drive and the theme was the idea of @robimahanta, and thanks to him for this well planned and well executed drive.\n\nWe stayed at a beautiful bungalow called \"Sheikalmudi Bungalows by Tahr Trails\". It is an old tea estate bungalow with three rooms - perfect for our group of three families. Of course, although quite old, the bungalow is very well maintained and brought up to the modern standards, and offers a very comfortable stay experience.\n\nThe scenic bungalow that we stayed at:\n\n\n\nThe bungalow is located in a scenic and secluded place atop a small hill, surrounded by other hills and acres and acres of tea plantation. The hospitality of the staff led by the property manager and owner of the \"Tahr Trails\" brand, Lingesh was first class, and the food served was absolutely delicious. Fresh, hot and authentic local food. We loved it. Overall we had a great time there!\n\nThe only note of caution would be that since the bungalow is located deep inside a tea estate, the last 3km or so of the road to the bungalow is a typical estate road - a combination of unpaved trails and some old paved but broken down tarmac. It helped us that we were driving Thars on this road, but for low slung sedans, this road will prove to be a challenge. Nothing that can not be managed in a sedan, but it will certainly require a lot of care and patience to drive a sedan here.\n\nThe landscapes and wildlife in Valparai in this season, in December, are just amazing. We were so engrossed in enjoying those scenes that we forgot to take any car pictures at all. I did not get even a single photo of all three Thars together. Somehow managed just this photo of my own Thar, \"Dusty\", there in the tea plantations.\n\nDusty in the tea plantation\n\n\n\nLingesh was a great host; he is an expert in the nature and wildlife in this area, and knows the entire hills like the back of his hand. He was also gracious enough to be our local guide and drove us around in his old Jeep - sort of like a private Safari - and showed us the landscapes and the wildlife in Valparai. Truly a great experience.\n\nThe lovely old Jeep that was our Safari vehicle there:\n\n\n\nWith this introduction out of the way, let me get to the main agenda - the landscapes and wildlife photographs, in the next posts.\n\nLandscapes from Valparai\n\nWhile being driven around on the hills full of tea plantations, in that lovely old Jeep, tracking the wildlife (more on that in the next post), I managed to click a few landscape photographs there.\n\nJeep trails within the tea estate:\n\n\n\nWorker in the scenic tea gardens:\n\n\n\nRed tractor on the tea garden roads:\n\n\n\nViews of the \"Lower Sholayar\" reservoir:\n\n\n\nBright green tea and colorful evening skies:\n\n\n\nLate evening mist over the Sholayar reservoir:\n\n\n\nMoonrise over the tea gardens:\n\n\n\nMorning light:\n\n\n\nA sole red tree:\n\n\n\nMorning light and shadows:\n\n\n\nEvening light on the top of the hill full of tea plantations:\n\n\n\nFinally, my favorite photo of the trip, sunset over the tea plantations:\n\n\n\nContinue reading BHPian Dr.AD's travelogue for more insights and information.",

The benchmark index fell by 0.25% to 8,329.2 points.\n\nWill the market be able to bounce back from this on Friday and end the week on a high? Here are five things to watch:\n\nASX 200 expected to rise\n\nThe Australian share market looks set to rise on Friday after a relatively positive night of trade in Europe. According to the latest SPI futures, the ASX 200 is expected to open 32 points or 0.4% higher this morning. The FTSE was up 0.8% and the CAC was up 0.5%, but the DAX was down slightly. Wall Street was closed for a day of mourning.\n\nOil prices push higher\n\nASX 200 energy shares Beach Energy Ltd (ASX: BPT) and Karoon Energy Ltd (ASX: KAR) could have a good finish to the week after oil prices pushed higher overnight. According to Bloomberg, the WTI crude oil price is up 1% to US$74.06 a barrel and the Brent crude oil price is up 1.1% to US$77.00 a barrel. This was driven by optimism over US winter fuel demand.\n\nBuy Challenger shares\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs have reaffirmed their buy rating on Challenger Ltd (ASX: CGF) shares with a trimmed price target of $7.60. This implies potential upside of 26% for the annuities company's shares over the next 12 months. It said: \"Valuation appeal noting improved earnings / ROE while valuation has derated: CGF's 1-year forward P/E has fallen to ~10x against a backdrop of improving normalised ROE toward target in FY25 and COE margin (without material normalised capital returns) and improved normalised earnings.\"\n\nGold price rises\n\nASX 200 gold shares such as Evolution Mining Ltd (ASX: EVN) and Northern Star Resources Ltd (ASX: NST) could have a decent session after the gold price pushed higher overnight. According to CNBC, the gold futures price is up 0.75% to US$2,692.4 an ounce. The precious metal climbed despite bond yields and the US dollar continuing to rise.\n\nBuy BHP shares\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) shares are in the buy zone according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. This morning, the broker has retained its buy rating on the mining giant's shares with an improved price target of $47.50. Goldman is feeling confident ahead of the release of the mining giant's quarterly update later this month.",

Milan\n\n...The Original original plan included a half day visit to the Alfa Romeo Museum in Arese area of Milan and hence I choose a hotel in that vicinity. With a day short, we took it easy and started the day late with the Alfa Museum being the only agenda. Finally I was having my agenda finding a place. Or so I thought. My Italian Colleague, who has lived in Milan all her life, called me and suggested some other shopping destinations near Arese. I started to see my agenda quickly collapsing. My 8 yr old daughter is usually the swing voter in the family. Fortunately she likes cars. Unfortunately, Like the mom, she likes Shopping more than cars.\n\nI was forced to drive past the Alfa Museum to the shopping center..\n\nAfter being so close yet so far to the Alfa Romeo Museum last time around, I had decided to make some time during my next work trip to Milan. Got lucky that a 3 day work trip came up in November- sooner than I thought.\n\nAlthough I finished my meetings on Day 2, I took my return flight towards EoD of day 3 just so I didn't have to rush through the time I had for myself.\n\nHad breakfast, checked out and Uber'd my way to Museo Storico Alfa Romeo.\n\nDifferent folk have different Halo cars in their memory that connects them to certain Brands. The Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione happens to be one of my all time favorites just for the way it looks. Simply Gorgeous. The closest I had some to seeing one in-person was in the Motorworld Center in Munich. Being aware that the Alfa Museum had one, I just had to go there and spent some time ogling at it.\n\nAlfa did not hide their masterpiece deep inside to find after a Labyrinth of halls like a IKEA center. No No. They put their pride and joy right up front at the entrance.\n\nMy joy knew no bounds. Spent a lot of time appreciating every single line. Best part, this was even before buying a ticket to the Museum !\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 10 Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio Racing Edition engineered by Sauber.\n\n..and then, the Museum.\n\n1953 750 Competizione.\n\n1960 Giulietta Sprint\n\n1959 Giulietta Spider\n\nAlfa's Aero engines.\n\n1954 AR51 made for the Army inspired by Jeep.\n\nThe main floor focusing on the best hits of the past.\n\n1910 A.L.F.A 24 HP. The first car from the brand.\n\n1911 A.L.F.A 15 HP Corsa.\n\n1925 RL Super Sport\n\n1931 6C 1750 Gran Sport designed by Zagato.\n\n1932 8C 2300 Corto Mille Miglia.\n\n1935 6C 2300 B\n\n1947 6C 2500 Sport\n\n1950 Alfa Romeo 1900\n\n1954 Alfa Romeo 1900 Super Sprint\n\n1955 Giulietta\n\n1962 2600 Sprint\n\n1962 Giulia\n\nContinue reading BHPian 14000rpm's review for more insights and information.",

The click-wheel controller debuted 24 years back in the 2001 BMW 7-Series, before becoming a standard across all models.\n\nThe rotary knob has already been eliminated on certain models like the X2 and has been replaced with touchscreen controls. However, with the arrival of BMW's newest Panoramic iDrive system, the knob will be retired across all models.\n\nJoern Freyer, Head of User Interaction, BMW, stated that the decision to remove the knob was based on data. It showed that on recent versions of iDrive, customers moved towards touchscreen controls, leaving the rotary knob to be hardly used. The lack of engagement with the knob resulted in BMW no longer needing to design its software to work via two different controls.\n\nApart from the rotary knob, BMW has also decided to kill off its Gesture Control feature.\n\nSource: Road&Track",

I'm not familiar with the internal workings of an OS, but some great Assembly devs I know who were working on mobile and desktop apps (at that point of time, 10+ years ago) told me Android is a bad OS and it was kind of apparent too, with Android 4/4.x being a buggy and resource-hungry mess even on devices with 30-50% more raw compute and more than 2x the RAM of competing iPhones and Windows Phones.

Old Windows/Linux PCs are usable for well over 10 years.\n\n\n\nii) Geekbench scores are good because it's probably one of those apps that is optimized for all platforms, being a benchmark. But running apps designed for RISC (i.e. Android apps) on x86 might mean encountering weird bugs and would be a waste of the x86 chip's potential. It's unlikely that x86 will be the primary target architecture of any Chromebook app. Note that this isn't necessarily a problem, and it is definitely better than the alternative, i.e. running x86 apps on RISC, which is something Microsoft has tried and failed at for over 12 years now starting with the Surface RT.\n\n\n\niii) If you're scouring for deals anyway and battery life isn't the biggest concern, it might be possible to get second-hand Windows laptops at the same price depending on where you're purchasing.

            "content": "BHPian anshumandun recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nDo we buy cars/motorcycles to go places? Or do we go places because we have a vehicle in the garage that should be taking us places?\n\nIn my case, it was the Versys 650 in the garage that was just dying to take me across India and to the roof of the world: The Himalayas! I could not say \"NO\" so there we were, on the Bangalore-Hyderabad highway as she warmed up galloping 550 kms with a grin on her face. She was happier than usual as she had her previous year's Leh road trip friends for company: Mean Green and Matt Black.\n\nNext morning, as she tore across the Maharashtra highway with her torquey mid-range, I just sat cocooned in utmost comfort and in awe of her best asset: Suspension. The Showa Separate Functions Forks setup on the Versys is just outstanding!\n\nAnd then came MP, where we were reminded that nothing in life is free, not even sitting without purpose.\n\nFinally, the marathon day arrived. I tried to tell her that we'll take it easy but she had a different plan. Jhansi came and went. Gwalior came and went. Agra came and went. Delhi came and I said \"Enough\"! But the Agra Expressway had unleashed her inner monster that made her unstoppable and she broke her record of 1000 kms plus in a single day and we ended up in Chandigarh.\n\n2500 kms away from home, now the actual trip began. Dark, Windy, Rain and Thunderstorm: a perfect welcome to the Himalayas.\n\nAfter spending the night in Narkanda, we rode to Chitkul amidst scenic snow-capped mountains. Hailing from Bangalore, she was not used to the bitter cold of the mountains and the night took a toll on her. Frozen water on the wiring shorted some connections and her horns went blaring in the middle of the night and woke up everyone in the tents. I had to crawl out in freezing temperatures and pull-off the horn wiring connections to calm her down.\n\nThe mountains mesmerized us as we rode through Pooh, Nako, Tabo, Pin Valley, Dhankar, Hikkim, Langza and Kaza. It was the magic of the place that took our bond to a different level and I felt 'one with the machine' and I think she felt the same.\n\nAnd then it happened! Fork seal oil leak and that too one day before the Kaza-Manali ride. With no doctor in town with skills to help her out, I had no option but to trust her to make it through.\n\nThe D day arrived. The 10 hours of 200 kms off-roading threw everything possible at us: snow walls, melting glaciers, slush, innumerable water-crossings, falling stones. Finally, we entered Manali by evening and I've never felt happier to see a tar road in my life.\n\nIn hindsight, I would never have attempted this ride had I known what I was getting into. But I am so grateful that this ride happened to us because this day has been etched in our memory forever. My Versys made me do something which I thought was beyond my motorcycling skill.\n\nAs they say, you retire at your peak. I felt like this was the peak for me. And so we decided to part ways. I hope she has moved on because I have not. I will find a replacement soon because she was just a machine, but with a SOUL\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Unfortunately, you don\u2019t have a boss button on the front left seat:Middle passenger also gets an adjustable headrest:Centre armrest is set slightly high and gets two retractable cupholders:You get manual sunshades for the rear windows:As mentioned earlier, the Q7 comes with a 4-zone climate control system. Below, you have a 12V socket and two USB-C charging ports:Third row of seats are more of a novelty feature and they\u2019re certainly not for adults. Kids can manage, but for short journeys only. You get 3-point seatbelts and adjustable headrests for both passengers:Once you fold down the middle row of seats, you can see the controls for the third row just behind them:With the third row of seats in place there is 295 litres boot space available:This is how most people would be using the boot. There\u2019s plenty of space with the third row folded down. You can even fold down the middle row of seats (40:20:40 split) for more luggage space:No spare wheel. The space underneath the boot floor is taken by the subwoofer, amplifier and a puncture repair kit:On the left, you have the controls for the air suspension to lower or raise the loading lip height. You can also fold down the last row of seats electrically:Our test car came with these accessories for separating luggage: Last edited by Rudra Sen : 9th January 2025 at 13:46 .",

            "content": "The shift to renewable energy and Electric Vehicles (EVs) has skyrocketed demand for green metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Mining companies focusing on these resources are capitalizing on the global push for cleaner energy solutions. The increasing adoption of EVs and energy storage systems has driven demand for these metals, creating significant opportunities for mining firms.\n\nGiven this landscape, investors might consider investing in three fundamentally stable mining stocks: Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO), Rio Tinto Group (RIO), and BHP Group Limited (BHP) for potential gain.\n\nIn a global scenario, governments are implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions, fueling investments in green technologies and propelling growth in the sector. Additionally, corporates are creating a pathway to sustainability in mining by adopting approaches that integrate IoT in smart mining, building circular economies, and shifting to renewable energies.\n\nSimilarly, technological advancements that include AI and Machine Learning, 3D printing, automation and robotics, drones and aerial surveying, blockchain for ethical sourcing, and biotechnology for waste management also help clear the way out for mine workers and corporations. Companies that adopt eco-friendly mining technologies are likely to gain a competitive edge, addressing both operational efficiency and environmental accountability.\n\nMoreover, the global market for the green mining industry is anticipated to reach $16.9 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.4%, driven by key factors such as growing environmental legislation and regulatory pressures, rising green finance, and rapid integration of renewable energy in mining operations.\n\nGiven this positive outlook, let us delve into the fundamentals of three Industrial \u2013 Metals stocks, beginning with the third.\n\nStock #3: Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO)\n\nSCCO is an integrated producer of copper and valuable by-products. It operates the mining, exploring, smelting, and refining facilities in Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador. Its operating segments include Peruvian operations; Mexican open-pit operations; and Mexican underground mining operations.\n\nOn November 21, backed by its strong financials, the company declared to its shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share and a stock dividend of 0.0062 shares per share of common stock.\n\nSCCO pays an annual dividend of $2.78, which translates to a yield of 2.97% at the prevailing price levels. Its four-year average dividend yield is 4.50%. The company\u2019s dividend payments have grown at a CAGR of 5.8% over the past five years.\n\nSCCO\u2019s sales for the third quarter (ended September 30, 2024) increased 17% year-over-year to $2.93 billion. The company reported an operating income of $1.45 billion, indicating a 35.6% growth from the prior year quarter. SCCO\u2019s adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.68 billion, up 30.5% year-over-year, while its net income per share grew 43.8% from the prior-year quarter to $1.15.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $2.87 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter (ended December 2024) represents a 25.2% increase year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $1.11 for the same quarter indicates a 94.9 % improvement year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history; it surpassed the consensus EPS estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.\n\nThe stock has gained 14.7% over the past year to close the last trading session at $93.78.\n\nSCCO\u2019s POWR Ratings reflect this robust outlook. The stock has an overall rating of B, which equates to Buy in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nSCCO has an A grade for Quality and a B for Stability. It is ranked #10 out of 31 stocks in the Industrial \u2013 Metals industry. Click here to see the additional ratings for SCCO (Growth, Value, Momentum, and Sentiment).\n\nStock #2: Rio Tinto Group (RIO)\n\nHeadquartered in London, the United Kingdom, RIO engages in exploring, mining, and processing mineral resources worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Iron Ore; Aluminum; Copper; and Minerals.\n\nOn December 12, RIO approved a $2.5 billion investment to expand the Rincon project in Argentina, the company\u2019s first commercial-scale lithium operation, to 60,000 tonnes per year. The project uses direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology, a process that supports water conservation, reduces waste, and produces lithium carbonate more consistently. This investment will help RIO to strengthen its commodity portfolio.\n\nIn the same month, RIO entered into a partnership agreement with the Swedish investment company Vargas, Mitsubishi Corporation, and other international and local industry partners to study low-carbon aluminum projects in Finland. This partnership should strengthen the company\u2019s global leadership in low-carbon aluminum.\n\nFor the six-month period that ended on June 30, 2024, RIO\u2019s consolidated sales revenue increased marginally year-over-year to $26.80 billion. The company\u2019s operating profit amounted to $8.26 billion, reflecting a 14% rise from the previous year\u2019s quarter. In addition, its profit after tax reached $5.89 billion, and EPS came in at $3.56, reflecting increases of 19.1% and 13.3% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nAnalysts expect RIO\u2019s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year ended December 2024 to be $52.73 billion and $6.86, respectively.\n\nRIO shares have declined marginally intraday to close the last trading session at $58.19.\n\nRIO\u2019s bright prospects are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of B, which translates to a Buy in our proprietary rating system.\n\nIt also has a B grade for Value, Stability, Sentiment, and Quality. Within the Industrial \u2013 Metals industry, it is ranked #5. Click here to see RIO\u2019s ratings for Growth and Momentum.\n\nStock #1: BHP Group Limited (BHP)\n\nBased in Melbourne, Australia, BHP is a global resources company specializing in producing various commodities, such as iron ore, copper, nickel, potash, and metallurgical coal. The company operates through three segments: Copper; Iron Ore; and Coal.\n\nOn December 4, BHP signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with HBIS Group to collaborate on decarbonizing the steel value chain. In the new MOU, using BHP\u2019s Pilbara iron ores in commercial-scale DRI-EAF steel production will continue to be optimized. BHP aims to establish best practices and scalable solutions that continue aligning with its climate goals.\n\nOn October 31, BHP announced the signing of a multi-year Global Framework Agreement with ABB, a leading global technology company. This strategic collaboration will enable opportunities for both companies to collaborate in support of project delivery, operations and maintenance, and operational decarbonization.\n\nIn the fiscal year which ended June 30, 2024, BHP\u2019s revenues increased 3.4% year-over-year to $55.66 billion. Its underlying EBITDA came in at $29.02 billion, up 3.8% from the previous year\u2019s quarter. The company\u2019s profit after taxation from continuing and discontinued operations amounted to $9.60 million, and its earnings per ordinary share stood at $1.56.\n\nStreet expects BHP\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year (ending June 2025) to be $52.22 billion. Moreover, its EPS estimate is expected to be $4.36 for the same period.\n\nShares of BHP have declined marginally intraday to close the last trading session at $48.18.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that BHP has an overall rating of B, equating to a Buy in our POWR Ratings system. It has a B grade for Value, Stability, and Quality. Out of 31 stocks in the same industry, BHP is ranked #4.\n\nBeyond what is stated above, we\u2019ve also rated BHP for Growth, Momentum, and Sentiment.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Uranium Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) stands against the other uranium stocks.\n\nThe global demand for uranium is accelerating, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the electrification of industries. According to research from Goldman Sachs, data center energy consumption is expected to surge by 160% by 2030. Nuclear power, with its ability to deliver consistent and low-carbon electricity, is emerging as the preferred solution to meet these energy demands. Tech giants have publicly recognized the role of nuclear energy in supporting their operational energy needs.\n\nIn November 2024, the Biden administration unveiled a plan to triple U.S. nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This plan includes the deployment of 200 GW of new nuclear capacity through new reactor construction, plant restarts, and facility upgrades. In the short term, the administration aims to bring 35 GW of new capacity online by 2035.\n\nFollowing the domestic nuclear energy deployment targets by the Biden administration, Russia announced restrictions on the export of enriched uranium to the United States. According to the Russian Government, these temporary restrictions are a response to the U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports, which was signed into law earlier in 2024. However, the U.S. ban includes waivers that allow shipments to continue until 2027 to address supply concerns. According to Reuters, Russia is a major player in the global uranium market and produces about 44% of the world\u2019s uranium enrichment capacity. In 2023, 27% of the enriched uranium used by U.S. commercial nuclear reactors was imported from Russia.\n\nRead Also: 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing and 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on December 12, 2024, John Ciampaglia, CEO at Sprott Asset Management, discussed the current state and future prospects of the uranium market. Ciampaglia acknowledged that despite high demand, there has been no major increase in the production of uranium. He explained that this is a strategic decision rooted in supply discipline, a lesson learned when the industry was struggling to survive for nearly 10 years after the accident in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. Ciampaglia noted that producers are now cautious about balancing future production with future demand, ensuring that they have built their contract books with utilities before ramping up production. This approach is aimed at maximizing value and revenue in the current market cycle.\n\nCiampaglia identified three major drivers: growing electricity consumption in emerging markets such as China and India, the pivot of Western countries toward energy security and decarbonization, and the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). He noted that big tech companies are investing in SMR technology, which is crucial for validating and advancing this technology. This investment is expected to boost the demand for uranium.\n\nCiampaglia also mentioned the gradual recovery of uranium prices, which had been stagnant in 2019 and 2020. The price is now slowly moving up, both in the spot market and the term market, reflecting the building demand. Higher prices are necessary to incentivize miners to expand production and develop new mines, which is essential for meeting the growing demand for uranium in the coming years.\n\nAs the world leans heavily on nuclear energy to power the next phase of technological and industrial advancements, uranium will remain a critical resource.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find companies that are involved in the mining, trading, or processing of uranium. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks with the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is a global leader in the mining sector and owns a diverse portfolio of high-quality assets across various commodities. The company has a significant presence in uranium exploration and resource development, particularly in Australia, which is home to some of the world\u2019s largest uranium deposits.\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is actively evaluating potential uranium projects and partnerships to enhance its position in the uranium market. The company\u2019s strategic approach involves leveraging its existing infrastructure and operational capabilities to ensure that any new uranium projects are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) has been involved in the exploration of the Olympic Dam deposit in South Australia, which is one of the world\u2019s largest known uranium resources. While the primary focus at Olympic Dam is copper, gold, and silver, the potential for uranium extraction also presents a significant long-term opportunity.\n\nBHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is committed to sustainable and responsible mining practices, which is particularly important in the uranium sector due to the environmental and safety concerns associated with uranium mining and processing. The company has implemented rigorous safety protocols and environmental management systems to ensure that its operations are conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental impact and maximizes social benefits.\n\nOverall BHP ranks 4th on our list of the best uranium stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of BHP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Overall with the new planes, if I had to answer the titular question of the thread, it would be a cautiously optimistic yes.\n\nSome of our observations:\n\nThe app is hugely improved. We had clear updates on the flight status, aircraft, online check in and then gate and baggage updates via push notification, whatsapp and email.\n\nLike that the app gives details of the plane you'll be flying on.\n\nSelf check in at LHR was a bit of a mixed bag. It only printed one of the luggage tags but it was swiftly solved when dropping off the luggage.\n\nThe cabins are a HUGE upgrade over the old offerings. As my partner exclaimed \"oh look, the screens work\".\n\nAbout 3hrs in all the IFE systems went down and required rebooting. Allowed me to notice that it's a Panasonic system and it's basically an Android app that we use for the interface.\n\nI think I had just about the nicest bread roll ever during the main meal service. It was heated.\n\nBig fan of the nifty tray table design - not come across it before. Press the release button, pops straight up, you slide and unfold. It had a nifty folding section on the underside that when folded out allowed you to prop your phone/tablet along it.\n\nSeat was very comfy, with plenty of recline and crucially legroom. Particularly appreciated the big leg rests.\n\nHeadphones were provided in a nice fabric bag and then collected an hour from landing with replacement earphones provided instead.\n\nThe small details that stood out to me:\n\nI like the narrow, frosted plastic cup design, very grippy.\n\nSpeaking of grippy, the meal service trays look outwardly like those clear plastic trays you get Diwali gifts on but in fact the upper surface was quite grippy without being sticky. This was welcome, stopped stuff sliding around.\n\nOut of habit I would turn right from my seat and walk all the way down to use the loo - when passing through economy during the night, I noticed the crew walking the aisle picking up detritus.\n\nThe cabin crew in our section were very proactive, one of them was very attentive to this toddler who was in our section. Totally unprompted by the parents. Was very pleasing to see.\n\nNot just one air freshener in the loo, but two!\n\nI noticed a camera on our IFE systems (didn't notice in econ). When asked about it, the crew were cryptic, they said there's features incoming that'll use it. What for?\n\nThe less good:\n\nBoarding was extremely rapid at LHR, a full 45 mins before the time displayed on the screens initially. We were at the gate so it wasn't an issue but if we were across the terminal at the lounge, you'd end up legging it for no reason.\n\nFlight departed on schedule but arrived slightly late, took ages to find an airbridge.\n\nLuggage took too long to arrive at the belt.\n\nSince we boarded so quickly but had to wait for remaining passengers, the tannoy system incessantly reminded about keeping seatbelts unbuckled during refuelling. It got jarring after a while.\n\nAt least in prem. econ, the width of the seat base meant it took trap the remote for the IFE if it's coiled cable hadn't fully retracted before it was clicked back into it's recess.\n\n\n\nThe flight details interface on the app - like it!\n\n\n\nForgive the shoddy photo, but if you peer closely you can just about see the camera on the IFE system. Any clues folks as to its purpose?\n\n\n\nThey had air fresheners on the counter top and the door in the loo\n\n\n\nYou can just about see where the remote could get wedged in due to the seat base and unretracted cable\n\nOverall, very promising!\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

But why?\n\nASX 200 leaps back into the green following the latest Aussie inflation print\n\nYou\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nAt 11.30am AEDT, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) was down 0.1%.\n\nIn the minutes that followed, the benchmark Aussie index leapt 0.3% to be up 0.26% at the time of writing.\n\nThis move higher follows the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) release of the latest Australian inflation data, covering the month of November.\n\nWhile the ASX 200 continued to provide term deposit-busting returns of 7.5% in 2024 despite sticky inflation and high interest rates, investors and mortgage holders alike are eagerly awaiting the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) first rate cut.\n\nAs you're likely aware, Australia's benchmark interest rate has been held at a 12-year high of 4.35% since the last RBA rate hike in November 2023.\n\nAnd rates are unlikely to come down until inflation, particularly underlying inflation \u2013 the RBA's preferred gauge, which excludes volatile items \u2013 sustainably falls within the central bank's 2% to 3% target range.\n\nWith that in mind, here's what ASX 200 investors just learned from the ABS.\n\nASX 200 rises on core CPI data\n\nThe ASX 200 is back in the green after the ABS reported that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator rose 2.3% in the 12 months to November. That's up from the 2.1% increase reported for the 12 months to October.\n\nDriving the ongoing inflationary pressures were a 2.9% increase in the costs of food and non-alcoholic beverages, a 6.7% increase in the price of alcohol and tobacco, and a 3.2% increase in recreation and culture costs.\n\nHelping to tamp down inflation, electricity prices declined by 21.5% with the aid of government funding. And automotive fuel prices came down by 10.2% amid a surplus of global oil supplies.\n\nCommenting on the latest Aussie inflation data that's helping spur an intraday rebound on the ASX 200, ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt said, \"Annual CPI inflation has risen since last month, in part due to the timing of electricity rebates.\"\n\nShe added:\n\nIn some states and territories, households received two rebate payments in October in lieu of not receiving a payment in July. From November most households received one payment. As a result, electricity prices fell 21.5% in the 12 months to November, compared to a fall of 35.6% to October.\"\n\nSo, why are ASX 200 investors favouring their buy buttons after the latest inflation news?\n\nWell, that looks to be driven by the decrease in Australia's trimmed mean inflation.\n\n\"Annual trimmed mean inflation was 3.2% in November, down from 3.5% in October,\" Marquardt said. \"Annual trimmed mean inflation remains higher than CPI inflation as it removed large price falls for electricity and automotive fuel.\"\n\nStill, that's getting enticingly close to the upper band of the RBA's inflation target, meaning the first 2025 interest rate cuts could be fast approaching.",

(NYSE American: IE) (TSX: IE) (\"Ivanhoe Electric\") Executive Chairman Robert Friedland and President and Chief Executive Officer Taylor Melvin are pleased to provide an update on the activities of the BHP Exploration Alliance in the Southwest U.S. (the \"Alliance\").\n\nMr. Friedland commented: \"The Basin and Range province of the Southwest U.S. remains one of the most promising frontiers for porphyry exploration. Together with BHP, we have deployed a new generation Typhoon\u2122 system to look for potential world-class deposits that are hidden from the surface by younger cover rocks.\"\n\nMr. Melvin commented: \"We are pleased with the rapid progress made by our exploration alliance with BHP and look forward to completing our first Typhoon\u2122 survey at an Area of Interest located in Arizona. Our alliance is proving to be an effective platform to pursue exploration opportunities that are well-suited for Ivanhoe Electric's exploration technologies, looking deep below the surface for new sources of copper and other critical metals in the Southwest U.S.\"\n\nThe Alliance is focused on exploring mineral deposits hidden under post-mineral cover. It received an initial funding commitment of $15 million from BHP and is operated by Ivanhoe Electric's exploration team (refer to Ivanhoe Electric's May 8, 2024 news release).\n\nThe Alliance is actively exploring six designated Areas of Interest (\"AOI\") within Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Any Joint Venture that is agreed to be established within these areas will operate under a 50/50 ownership structure.\n\nThe first Typhoon\u2122 survey of the Alliance has commenced, exploring a major porphyry copper trend in Arizona\n\nA new-generation Typhoon\u2122 unit was mobilized in early December to commence the Alliance's first deep-penetrating geophysical survey. The initial Typhoon\u2122 survey is being completed along a well-known and major porphyry copper trend, with a significant production history and a large endowment of copper in current reserves and resources in the region.\n\nDuring the first phase of the Alliance, exploration teams have been deployed to advance reconnaissance work, geochemical sampling, and detailed geological mapping programs across the AOIs in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. In addition, over 5,600 line-kilometers of airborne magnetic surveying and 1,500 line-kilometers of hyperspectral surveying have been completed so far.\n\nThe results of exploration fieldwork and three-dimensional inversion of geophysical data were used to inform subsequent land acquisition and Typhoon\u2122 planning. So far, over 110 square kilometers of unpatented mining claims have been staked across Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nOnce the initial survey is complete, the Typhoon\u2122 results will be processed by Computational Geosciences Inc. The resulting data will then be integrated with other datasets to develop the Alliance's first drill targets.\n\nPhoto 1.

We believe the United States is significantly underexplored and has the potential to yield major new discoveries of critical metals. Our mineral exploration efforts focus on copper as well as other metals including nickel, vanadium, cobalt, platinum group elements, gold and silver. Through the advancement of our portfolio of electric metals exploration projects, headlined by the Santa Cruz Copper Project in Arizona and the Tintic Copper-Gold Project in Utah, as well as other exploration projects in the United States, we intend to support United States supply chain independence by finding and delivering the critical metals necessary for the electrification of the economy. We also operate a 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Arabian Mining Company Ma'aden to explore for minerals on ~48,500 km2 of underexplored Arabian Shield in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nWebsite: www.ivanhoeelectric.com\n\nAbout BHP\n\nBHP is a world-leading resources company.

Initially, the parties will explore six areas of interest across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah covering an approximate area of 3,655 km2.\n\nFor this, BHP has committed funding of $15 million over a three-year period, while Ivanhoe will serve as operator and provide its new-generation Typhoon system as well as machine learning and data inversion technologies.\n\nAccording to Ivanhoe, its team was mobilized in early December and will begin the alliance\u2019s first deep-penetrating geophysical survey on \u201ca well-known and major porphyry copper trend\u201d in Arizona with a large endowment of copper reserves.\n\nThe survey is part of the first phase of the Ivanhoe-BHP alliance focusing on early-stage exploration activities to identify and stake mineral rights within the areas of interest. Once the mineral rights are staked, they would qualify as projects generated by the alliance held under a 50/50 joint venture.\n\nActivities for the first phase included reconnaissance work, geochemical sampling and detailed geological mapping programs. In addition, over 5,600 line km of airborne magnetic surveying and 1,500 line km of hyperspectral surveying have been completed so far.\n\nThe results of exploration fieldwork and three-dimensional inversion of geophysical data were used to inform subsequent land acquisition and Typhoon planning. So far, over 110 km2 of unpatented mining claims have been staked across Arizona and New Mexico, Ivanhoe said.\n\nOnce the initial survey is completed, the Typhoon results will be processed by Ivanhoe\u2019s subsidiary Computational Geosciences. The resulting data will then be integrated with other datasets to develop the alliance\u2019s first drill targets, it added.",

            "content": "BHPian benbsb29 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nWhen you're on the Xmas shutdown and with time to spare, what's the best way to spend some time? Test driving some popular cars may be one of the options that appeal, and that's exactly what DBHPian kiku007 and I embarked on.\n\nWe test drove the BYD Seal 'Premium' variant which happens to be the mid variant among Dynamic, Premium and Performance.\n\nThis model has a claimed 0-100 kmph of 5.9 seconds and 650 kms of driving range. On first glance, what strikes you is the overall pleasing design and attention to detail given to some of the elements such as the taillamps design which look brilliant.\n\nStep inside and you are greeted with the overall theme of minimalist design which has become the norm now with a large 15.6\" display that grabs your attention. This screen can also be rotated to portrait mode at the touch of a button.\n\nSound insulation is good and there was barely any road noise that crept into the cabin during the roads we took this car on as part of our brief test drive. My daughter who accompanied us on the test drive brought our attention to the interior ambient lighting that actually synced to the beats of the music being played! We didn't expect this and a quick search within the menu later, we found the setting that enables this.\n\nAcceleration is brisk and no surprise being an EV, the sudden push back into the seat under rolling acceleration.\n\nI found the interiors quite pleasing and what i truly appreciate is how BYD have set about trying to win over customers used to internal combustion powered cars without the need to be radically different. There is a gear selector that is conventional without resorting to a swipe on a screen (Tesla Model 3), the indicator stalks are conventional (and on the correct side too!!) and there is also a screen in front of the driver which provides information where you want it, rather than on a centre placed screen.\n\nThe information displayed via the HUD is clear, bright and easy to read; we didnt explore the range of information that can be displayed on here owing to the limited time we had with the car. Infact, there was another customer waiting for the car to test drive when we got back.\n\nThe quality of the switchgear is good along with the overall design theme that resonates within the cabin, including the design of the airvents. A simple swipe on the screen is used to adjust the direction of the blowers, which I found interesting for a vehicle at this price point.\n\nTo address the common pain point about lack of physical buttons for common tasks such as volume, aircon, blower etc the Seal has these addressed. A swipe of three fingers in horizontal direction brings up these options, although I've briefly forgotten which option comes up under the horizontal and vertical swipes. There are roller buttons beside the gear selector as well which can be used for volume control without having to use the screen, which is in addition to the ones on the steering.\n\nIn my opinion, the learning curve as you step into the BYD Seal is minimal as opposed to my experience getting used to the Model 3.\n\nSummary:\n\nThere is no doubt that BYD along with its other fellow Chinese manufacturers have done exceedingly well playing to their strengths and providing VFM options with products that are right up there with established manufacturers. The quality of interiors, exteriors and strategic product placement ensures that the earlier stigma of opting for these brands no longer exist as a major deterrent. The sheer number of BYD, HAVAL, MG and other cars on the roads here in Australia show how they've captured a good share of the market.\n\nBack to the Seal, I would go on to state that if I was looking at adding an EV to my garage for the urban runs with the odd trips that are longer, this would most certainly be an option on my list. It's hard to look past the value and efficiency this brings along with warranties that go for 6 years/150,000 kms for the vehicle and 8 year/160,000 kms for the battery - sure exudes confidence in the product.\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "After the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 surged 7.5 per cent in 2024, many investors are looking to see where the growth will come from in the year ahead.\n\nThe major \u201cknown unknowns\u201d for investors include the shape and sequencing of incoming US President Donald Trump\u2019s policies after his inauguration on January 20, the magnitude and timing of interest rate cuts by central banks including the US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the extent of China\u2019s fiscal and monetary stimulus, most of which is expected to be announced in March.\n\n\u201cOur overall assessment remains that the trend is still up, including for Australian shares, but expect a more volatile and constrained ride over the year ahead,\u201d said AMP\u2019s head of investment strategy and chief economist Shane Oliver.\n\nDr Oliver expects global and Australian shares to return a far more constrained 7 per cent in 2025.\n\n\u201cStretched valuations after two strong years, the ongoing risk of recession, the likelihood of a global trade war and ongoing geopolitical issues will likely make for a volatile ride in 2025, with a 15 per cent correction somewhere along the way highly likely,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut with central banks still cutting rates, the RBA expected to start cutting in the first half 2025, and prospects for stronger growth later in the year supporting profits should still see OK investment returns.\u201d\n\nDr Oliver expects the ASX 200, which closed on Friday at 8250.5 points, to end 2025 at around 8800 points.\n\nFor investors looking to fine tune their portfolios, our expert stock pickers this week see plenty of opportunities.\n\nHere are their tips:\n\nShaw and Partners senior investment adviser Jed Richards\n\nBUY\n\nWoolworths (WOW)\n\nThe last decade for the Woolworths Group has been difficult. The Woolworths Group market cap has fallen to only $23bn (previously $38bn in 2020). Although competition from Coles, Aldi and Metcash continue to grow, Woolworths remains the dominant player with around 30 per cent share of the supermarket industry. With the industry forecasting an annual growth rate of 3 per cent in Australia, we are confident that Woolworths will grow revenues and have the management in place to adapt to the changing environment. The dividend yield is currently 3.4 per cent fully franked. Due to the non discretionary spending, Woolworths shares are usually more resilient in a negative share market environment.\n\nBHP (BHP)\n\nBHP market cap is down 27 per cent over the past year. Miners typically have volatile earnings and therefore volatile share prices. I suggest clients buy mining stocks while the share prices are off and BHP is currently suited for this strategy. The shares were trading above $50 in January 2024 and are now under $40. The market is concerned that China\u2019s growth is slowing and therefore will require less of BHP\u2019s commodities. This theory is not yet a reality and although China have high stockpiles at their ports, they continue to buy our Iron ore in record volumes. BHP has more commodity diversification than the other large miners and this adds a level of protection. I expect to see BHP up above $45 this year. As a cyclical stock with a volatile share price, this company is not a \u201cBuy and Hold\u201d and needs to be traded to realise the potential profits.\n\nHOLD\n\nOrigin Energy (ORG)\n\nOrigin is Australia\u2019s major electricity generator, gas distributor and retailer. The company has grown consistently and achieved a positive return for the last 4 years. In 2024 the company market cap grew 16.7 per cent. Whilst the Australian Energy regulator expects electricity prices to soften in 2025, Origin is well managed and therefore well positioned to maintain market share and profitability. The expected increase in gas prices is to grab the headlines in 2025. We expect Origin share price to remain around $10 while providing a dividend yield of 5 per cent.\n\nTelstra (TLS)\n\nTelstra have the most commonly used mobile and broadband services in Australia. Historically Telstra was considered a growth stock as technology and data usage gripped Australia. The share price subsequently fell back as the company is now priced as value stock with strong cashflows. The consistent revenues along with regular dividend payments, makes Telstra a favourite Australian blue-chip for income-focused investors. As data usage continues to grow, Telstra is well placed to continue delivering good solid results for Australian investors.\n\nSELL\n\nRio Tinto (RIO)\n\nRio Tinto is a global miners that historically has concentrated on iron ore production. Rio Tinto have their new African mine which will increase iron ore supply later this year. This is new supply is expected to contribute to the softening of the global iron ore price. I have often witnessed companies that operate in Africa come across trouble. Operational and geopolitical risks seems to be more problematic in Africa. The share price has held up relatively well and I prefer to gain my mining exposure from more diversified miners.\n\nQBE Insurance (QBE)\n\nQBE Insurance is an Australian general insurance and reinsurance company that offers commercial, personal and specialty products and risk management products. They have more than 13,000 staff globally and employment costs continue to rise. Insurance companies typically perform better in high interest rate environments as they have large bond portfolios. This is true for QBE and the share price has risen to $20 recently. We expect interest rates to reduce during 2025 and this may be the end of the economic cycle that favoured QBE. As the company now trades near the consensus price target I suggest locking in some good profits.\n\nEquity Trustees head of equities Chris Haynes\n\nBUY\n\nWorley (WOR)\n\nWorley engages in the provision of services to the resources, energy, and industrial sectors. Management recently reconfirmed the outlook for FY2025 at its AGM. Solid growth is expected. Worley has exposure to the growing need for energy, driven by data centres inter alia. Pricing is attractive at 14.7 times FY2025 earnings.\n\nElders (ELD)\n\nElders is engaged in providing financial, real estate services to rural, agricultural and automotive businesses. The acquisition of Delta, other bolt-on acquisitions, the backward integration strategy and transformation projects (systems modernisation, supply chain, wool handling) should all lead to Elders reporting strong earnings growth over coming years. Elders is oversold and too cheap (FY26 PE of 10.4x, and dividend yield of 5.8 per cent).\n\nHOLD\n\nPilbara Minerals (PLS)\n\nThe company is a major producer of minerals (spodumene) for lithium batteries. The price of spodumene has fallen significantly in line with an excess of supply over demand. The price of spodumene) looks to have stabilised as supply is gradually withdrawn. This should see the Pilbara Minerals share price stabilise.\n\nGuzman y Gomez (GYG)\n\nGYG engages in delivering clean, fresh, made-to-order, Mexican-inspired food. It operates through Australia and US geographical segments. There is a strong store roll out story for the next few years, however this appears to be captured in the price with the stock trading on forward price to earnings of 185 times for FY2025.\n\nSELL\n\nDowner EDI (DOW)\n\nDowner EDI engages in the provision of integrated services. The ACCC has initiated civil cartel proceedings against Ventia Australia, Spotless Facility Services (a subsidiary of DOW) in relation to alleged price fixing behaviour on the Estate Maintenance and Operation Services (EMOS) for the Department of Defence. This will distract management for some time and weigh on the stock price. Better value elsewhere.\n\nPinnacle Investment Management (PNI)\n\nPNI is an aggregator, owner, distributor of funds management businesses. 2024 was a stellar year with the stock price up 129 per cent. PNI now trades on a forward price to earnings of 36 times for FY2025. This is excessive for the business that it is. Everything has to go right from here to justify this valuation, which seems unlikely. Time to take profits.\n\nThis article first appeared in The Australian.\n\nThis story does not constitute financial product advice.

            "content": "Singapore-based dry bulk shipowner Berge Bulk and global mining leader BHP have launched a groundbreaking pilot project, marking a significant milestone in the push for greener shipping practices. Together, they successfully completed an iron ore voyage from Australia to China powered entirely by B100 biodiesel. The voyage, conducted in December 2024, featured the Berge Lyngor, a 2019-built 206,330 dwt Newcastlemax bulk carrier, which was bunkered with B100 biodiesel for the journey. This marked the first time the alternative fuel had been used on the vital iron ore trade route between Australia and China.\n\nB100 biodiesel, which is produced from renewable resources such as vegetable oil, animal fat, tallow, and waste cooking oil from restaurants and industrial kitchens, is a more sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels. It provides substantial environmental benefits, including a reduction of up to 84% in well-to-wake greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel oils. This key reduction in emissions highlights the growing role of alternative fuels in the shipping industry\u2019s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThis voyage also represents the first time Berge Bulk has utilized biodiesel on a Pacific route, marking an important step in the company's broader commitment to sustainability and the decarbonization of the shipping industry. Berge Bulk has been exploring the use of biodiesel blends (B30, B50, and B100) on various voyages since 2021, having already gained experience in Europe and North America. These efforts are part of the company\u2019s ongoing Maritime Marshall Plan for decarbonization, which is focused on reducing the carbon emissions associated with shipping and exploring new fuel options.\n\nBHP, as a major player in the global mining sector, expressed its enthusiasm for the collaboration with Berge Bulk. Gerard Ang, Head of Maritime Iron Ore at BHP, commented, \"This collaboration with Berge Bulk represents an exciting step in BHP\u2019s ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping of our products. Together, we are demonstrating that meaningful progress can be achieved through bold initiatives, innovation, and teamwork.\u201d\n\nDuncan Bond, Chief Commercial Officer of Berge Bulk, echoed this sentiment, saying, \u201cBerge Bulk has committed to building and operating a zero Scope 1 emissions vessel by 2030 and achieving zero Scope 1 emissions fleetwide by 2050. This collaboration with BHP is a testament to what we can achieve together. By deploying B100 biodiesel on the Berge Lyngor, we are not only reducing carbon emissions for that voyage but also setting an example of how partnerships and innovation can lead to a greener future for shipping.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Berge Bulk is taking further steps to advance sustainable shipping practices.

            "content": "BHPian ttm_220d recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nBengaluru to Hyderabad in my Kia Seltos; the last long drive for 2024\n\nDate of travel: 28.12. 2024 and 30.12.2024\n\n(Always wanted to take a picture of the Kia outside the massive Kia factory in Ananthpur, AP. Could only stop very briefly as it was a busy road but still managed to get some good clicks of the Kia from its home)\n\nPrelude\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself for my friend and I to drive from Bengaluru to Hyderabad, it was the perfect opportunity to take my Diesel Kia Seltos GT on a nice long drive. I had driven this stretch 2.5 years ago so it was going to be interesting to see how this drive would be different. This write-up is to highlight a few of my observations and point out some tips for those driving on this route.\n\nThe route\n\nThe route is extremely simple, from Bangalore Airport Road you join NH-44 and you stay on this route till Hyderabad, passing Anantapur and Kurnool on the way. The roads are great for a good majority of the journey. Almost 98 percent, but there is the occasional lane closure and road works.\n\n(Stopped for a chai around 240 KM from BLR, there were not many options we knew about so stopped at this small shack with a great view)\n\nThe car\n\nThe car was my eight-month-old Kia Seltos Diesel AT GTX+, I have already written a few write-ups on TeamBHP about this car. This drive was perfect for the car as it was only 2 people, many stretches I could use ADAS, great mileage and compact enough to not be a nuisance in city traffic. I also took it on the drive as it was recommended by many on this forum to prevent DPF issues.\n\n(Snapshot of Hyderabad ORR)\n\nPUC certificate\n\nAt least 150 KM from Hyderabad, you see a lot of Omni vans with PUC testing equipment. Turns out other state cars are checked by Telangana Police. As my car was still very new, the Police at the checkpost didn\u2019t ask me to stop but I saw many other cars being stopped and were apparently fined. Do get an updated PUC before visiting Hyderabad.\n\nHyderabad ORR\n\nHyderabad Outer Ring Road is a 158 Kilometre, 8-lane expressway. This is an expressway unlike no other in India and even makes the really good NH44 I drove on from Bengaluru seem small. This ORR has strict rules on speeding, lane discipline and going the wrong way. Ensure your car has sufficient fuel and you know your correct exit before entering ORR.\n\nRestaurants and toilets on the way from Bengaluru\n\nI keep doing the Bengaluru-Kochi drive frequently, there are ample choices of clean and comfortable restaurants and restrooms. In the Bangalore - Hyderabad stretch, there are not that many good places with clean washrooms in the middle of this route. Near Ananthpur, and Kurnool there are some places as well as 100 km before Bengaluru and Hyderabad. But if you are travelling for the first time, and unsure, take some snacks and refreshments with you and research on maps the good places to stop. I also saw many restaurants that were advertised as open but were closed when we reached. This is important for you to do your research especially if the washroom is a priority, I visited Big Bay and the KFC in the food complex near Ananthpur.\n\nStray cattle and people crossing randomly\n\nThe route from Bengaluru is great. I drive from BLR to Ananthpur to Kurnool to Hyderabad via the really smooth NH 44. There are some road works but overall great drive for your car. Only thing I noticed is there is quite a bit of stray cattle on this route to be careful of. There are also many junctions on NH 44 hence should be careful as many careless two wheels without helmets and other crazy drivers merge onto the highway without proper knowledge of driving.\n\nFuel\n\nThere is ample selection of the usual Indian Oil, HP and BP but if you want Shell, I only saw one shell In Karnataka just before crossing into AP. Also, I noticed that the fuel in Telangana was a bit pricier per litre compared to Karnataka. Some of the petrol bunks I saw on the highways looked old and dilapidated, so just felt more peace of mind filling up in Hyderabad city (especially since the DPF in the Kia and the entire fuel management system is quite finicky)\n\nSpeed\n\nThis stretch is overall mostly not too crowded, some cars do go quite fast and should be careful of them but if you drive between 100-120 KMPH you can make very good time, enjoy the drive and still be safe.\n\nHeat\n\nWhen driving through the day, it does get quite hot outside. Almost 40-45 degrees. Ensure your car is serviced well and equipped to deal with the heat before the long drive.\n\nEmergency services\n\nI didn\u2019t see many ambulances stationed on the roads or emergency phone booths, but did see highway patrol cars parked very frequently. Did see a hospital every 50-60 km.\n\nDriving in the night\n\nWould as much as possible avoid driving in night as I didn\u2019t see much passenger traffic, a lot lesser than the other routes I\u2019ve seen. Also, not many places to stop and stay the night so best to avoid driving at night. Many seasoned drivers who used to drive through this area did tell me that many years ago dacoits used to be an issue on this stretch during the night. Not sure of the authenticity of that statement today though.\n\nOverall, a great drive. Feel free to reach out in the comments.\n\n(This post is just my experience on my drive, the factors and circumstances may change when you set out on your drive!)\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

            "content": "Discover Promising Stocks for Steady Income\n\nFor investors seeking reliable ASX 200 dividend stocks, two names stand out this month, according to the investment experts at Bell Potter. These companies are recommended for their potential in generating strong long-term returns, making them worthy additions to any income-focused portfolio.\n\nBHP Group, a powerhouse in the mining sector, emerges as a top pick. The company is renowned for its significant involvement in copper production and is poised to gain from potential economic stimulus in China, which could positively impact commodity prices. BHP is recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading copper producers, with notable operations such as its majority ownership of the massive Escondida mine in Chile. Investors can anticipate a fully franked dividend yield around 5% in 2025.\n\nOn the other hand, Transurban Group is highlighted for its robust portfolio of toll roads across major cities in Australia and North America, including CityLink and the Eastern Distributor. Its unique inflation-linked revenue model positions it advantageously in the current economic climate. The company boasts a promising growth trajectory, backed by a substantial project pipeline worth $3.3 billion. With strong traffic resilience and long concession durations, Transurban is projected to deliver a dividend yield of approximately 4.7% over the upcoming year.\n\nBoth BHP and Transurban represent compelling opportunities for investors aiming to bolster their dividend income.\n\nTop ASX 200 Dividend Stocks for 2024: Maximize Your Investment Returns!\n\nInvestors looking for reliable dividend stocks in the ASX 200 should consider not only BHP Group and Transurban Group but also explore a few additional companies that show promise for stable income and growth. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons, features, and projections of these dividend-generating powerhouses.\n\n1. BHP Group: Mining Power and Dividend Strength\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Robust Dividend Yield: With an anticipated fully franked dividend yield of around 5% in 2025, BHP is a favorite among income-focused investors.\n\n\u2013 Commodity Price Rise: Its strong position in copper production may benefit from economic stimulus measures in China, enhancing revenue.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Commodity Price Volatility: The company\u2019s fortunes can be heavily influenced by global commodity prices, leading to potential fluctuations in stock performance.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\u2013 Major Operations: Majority ownership of the Escondida mine in Chile, one of the largest copper projects worldwide.\n\n\u2013 Global Presence: Extensive mining operations in various regions, making it resilient against regional economic downturns.\n\n2. Transurban Group: Infrastructure with Inflation Protection\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Inflation-Linked Revenue: The company\u2019s revenue model adjusts with inflation, providing a buffer against economic downturns.\n\n\u2013 Significant Project Pipeline: With a pipeline of $3.3 billion, Transurban is set for growth, which is appealing to long-term investors.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 European Market Exposure: Any economic or regulatory changes in the US or Australia could adversely impact its revenue streams.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2013 Traffic Resilience: Its toll roads, such as CityLink and the Eastern Distributor, have shown strong traffic patterns owing to their strategic locations.\n\n\u2013 Long Concession Durations: Extended timeframes on toll road concessions ensure sustained cash flow.\n\n3. Additional Recommendations for Diversification\n\nInvestors may also look at:\n\n\u2013 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA): Known for its strong dividend history and stability in banking. CBA offers a solid return on equity and a current yield around 4.5%.\n\n\u2013 Woolworths Group: As one of Australia\u2019s biggest retailers, its constant consumer demand supports dividend reliability with projected yields of around 3.5%.\n\nMarket Analysis and Trends for 2024\n\nAs we look ahead, various trends will influence dividend stocks:\n\n\u2013 Interest Rates and Inflation: With rising interest rates, safe-haven assets like dividend stocks become attractive as they offer steady income.\n\n\u2013 Increased Focus on Sustainable Investments: Companies with strong sustainability practices may see increased investments from ESG-focused funds, making stocks like BHP and Transurban even more appealing.\n\nInsights into Future Dividends\n\nWith economic uncertainties looming, investors should focus on stocks that not only promise returns but also exhibit resilience and adaptability. The companies profiled above are well-positioned to capitalize on both growth opportunities and economic stability, making them excellent candidates for any dividend-focused portfolio.\n\nFor more insights into investing and stock analysis, visit Bell Potter.",

For the washes, I carry my own towels to avoid using the ones maintained at the detailing centers (which is used across so many cars).\n\n\n\nHistorical Experience\n\nI avoid the automated wash systems due to possibility of scratches from the bristles used. Most of the other centers seem to be focusing on giving low cost washes and they achieve this by rotating cars very fast with most of the quality being average.

            "content": "BHPian Pancham recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nSnow Drive in Spiti (December 2024)\n\n(Some pictures to lure you into this thread)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: That one trip we always wanted to do!\n\nWe all have that one trip that we always wanted to do - that one Goa trip with school/college friends, that one road trip in Europe (after watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara?), or a trip to Manali with your special someone. For me, that 'one' trip has evolved over the years. Back in 2009, when I was a teenager I dreamt of driving my own SUV (read Fortuner) to Ladakh. At that time, I think it was a big deal. Nothing happened until summer of 2022, when I did Zanskar through Shinku La, Kurgiyak to reach Leh in my Jeep Compass (see the change in car taste, too). Slowly and in parallel, the idea of driving on snow in Spiti creeped in. Friends - the urge to do something extreme and getting out of your comfort zone every once in a while is a deep dark hole that some of us cannot get out of.\n\nFor me, the Zanskar trip was an eye-opener. It was kind of a solo trip with another Bhpian (he was in his Thar, and I was in my Compass). It was extreme and tough and took a toll on us for different reasons but it was epic. That trip instilled the need in me to do an extreme trip at least every once in two years (given work and other commitments). Cut to 2024, I ended up buying a used (almost new) Jimny for exactly this reason. I felt the Compass 4X4 could do many things but it was my primary car and is pretty expensive to fix. I need a rugged go anywhere - in came the Jimny MT 2024 (Zeta). This was in October 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving said that, there were no trips planned. Longer breaks during the Christmas and New Year time were my best bet since things are usually quiet in office. But it is always a trade off between indulging in selfish solo trips or going back to Kolkata to see my mum (I live in Gurgaon, by the way). This year I planned to do both. I carved out days between December 20 and January 5 so that I could do a trip of my own and immediately leave for Kolkata afterwards to spend some time at home. But like I said, there was nothing planned till November end.\n\nPart 2: Spiti, the idea of doing a snow drive.\n\nBack in 2021, when COVID was doing its thing, the urge to travel and exploring places hit me hard. I am sure this is true for many of us. As things went from bad to worse, us humans started to introspect more - we started spending more time with family, consumption on personal goods sky-rocketed, self-care signed a new lease of life, and most importantly, 'travelling' became a hobby for a lot of us. Around that time, in addition to being hit by COVID, I got bitten by the Spiti bug. Not just any Spiti bug, but 'hardcore winter time snow drive only' Spiti bug. I wanted to drive my own car to Spiti - period. In winter? - yes. On the snow? - Obvio!! Not sure how this would materialize, it remained a distant dream. I did manage Zanskar but that was it. I was not fully sure about taking the Compass for a snow drive in Spiti. My last failed attempt for a Spiti winter drive was in December 2023 and then I almost forgot about it this year (at least most of 2024).\n\nWith the Jimny successfully procured in October 2024 (and specifically for doing hardcore trips), the itch to do Spiti in winters started again and I decided to seriously plan given the time constraints and work related commitments. Nothing happened till November 27, when I decided to drop a text to Overlandtrips 2019 (OLT2019) - a typical Instagram Page that organizes these trips to Spiti. I had my eyes set on LaHimalaya but they were charging something astronomical for the Spiti trip. OLT2019 was surprisingly cheaper at one-fourth the cost. If you really costed a trip like this - you would think the package quoted by OLT2019 sounded about right. So I did some thinking and sometime early December, I took the plunge. I sent them a token amount to book my slot - that is it. It was INR 8000 and was partially refundable. The long awaited Spiti trip was locked in.\n\nWhy do the trip in December when you do not usually get snow during this time?\n\n\n\nA lot of friends asked me about this. I did not have an option. I knew it will most likely not snow in December in Spiti and I will end up doing a dry drive in cold. A lot of them smirked too at my foolishness - doing something like this in December is stupid - since its cold and you do not get to see much more than what you will see in the summer. Why go through this hardship? But I had no option. A sure-shot snow drive would mean going in Jan-March and I did not have that luxury due to work commitments. So it had to be December. And the urge to go through something extreme (which started post Zanskar trip) was always there - so I mentally accepted the fact that this will be tough trip - cold and harsh - and if luck would have it, I will get snow. If not, it was alright. Nevertheless, I did start tracking the weather and there were some predictions but by December 19-20, all predictions for snow were quashed and a dry winter was mostly confirmed. I checked with OLT2019 and they said there will be no snow and snow chains are not needed. Just chill. Lol! I should have realized that OLT2019 is not very experienced and professional and should have relied more on my intuition (more on this later).\n\nContinue reading BHPian Pancham's post for more insights and information.",

Whether it's improving fitness, boosting career prospects, or building wealth, a New Year's resolution can be a powerful motivator.\n\nThat said, studies have shown only around 9% of people actually stick to the personal commitments they make at the start of a new year.\n\nFinder analyst Saranga Sudarshan says setting unrealistic goals can be \"a recipe for failure\" and that achieving success requires being specific and consistent while taking things \"one step at a time\".\n\nIf, as 83% of Aussies did at the start of last year, you've resolved to get on top of your finances and start building wealth, you're already on the right track!\n\nEven starting small \u2014 reducing spending, paying down debt, saving more, and slowly growing your investments \u2014 can deliver big results over time.\n\nWith time, consistency, and the magic of compounding, you can transform your financial future.\n\nTo help set your wealth-building resolutions, we asked our Foolish writers for their top ASX stock picks for new investors in 2025.\n\nHere is what the team came up with:\n\n6 awesome ASX shares for newbie investors in 2025 (smallest to largest)\n\n(Market capitalisations as of market close 3 January 2025)\n\nWhy our writers think these ASX stocks make great first buys\n\nObjective Corporation Ltd\n\nWhat it does: Objective Corp provides software that simplifies building assessments, information management, and regulatory compliance. The company's 2,000-plus customers are dispersed across more than 60 countries worldwide and range from ANZ Group Holdings to the Scottish Government.\n\nBy Mitchell Lawler: As many of my colleagues note below, ASX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide an excellent starting point for a first-time investment. However, I believe there is one striking limitation to ETFs for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the rewarding world of investing: Learning the essence of a good business.\n\nPart of being a good investor is understanding the qualities of good business. As Warren Buffett \u2014 widely considered the 'greatest of all time' investor \u2014 once said, \"I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor.\"\n\nThat's why I think Objective Corp would make an ideal beginner investment. It's not only a fundamentally good business but also owned and operated by Tony Walls. In my opinion, Walls' long-term mindset provides an indispensable lesson for new investors hoping to master the art of investing.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Mitchell Lawler does not own shares of Objective Corporation Ltd.\n\nBetashares Nasdaq 100 ETF\n\nWhat it does: This ASX ETF tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 (NASDAQ: NDX), which holds 100 of the largest non-financial tech stocks. Annual management fees run at 0.48%.\n\nBy Bernd Struben: When it comes to ASX shares for beginners, I think ETFs are a great starting point. You can buy and sell shares in the Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF just like any other ASX stock.\n\nWith NDQ, you gain exposure to some of the world's leading tech companies, garnering broad diversity with a single ASX investment.\n\nLooking back at 2024, NDQ had a terrific run, with the ETF gaining a whopping 39%. That's largely in line with the gains posted by the Nasdaq-100, as intended.\n\nThe ETF's top holdings include powerhouse companies like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\n\nAll of these companies outperformed the ASX 200 in 2024, with Nvidia's 175% share price gains leading the charge.\n\nWhile what happens in 2025 remains to be seen, I believe the long-term growth outlook for leading US tech stocks remains strong amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and global energy transition.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Bernd Struben has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\niShares Core S&P/ASX 200 ETF\n\nWhat it does: The iShares Core S&P/ASX 200 ETF is an ASX index fund that tracks the performance of the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO), a basket of Australia's largest 200 stocks.\n\nBy Zach Bristow: For those looking to invest in ASX shares, the first question is usually where to start. A good place is the ASX 200 index. But you can't buy an index. It's not an investment.\n\nHere's where the IOZ ETF comes in. It tracks the ASX 200 index's performance.\n\nThis allows you to own a portfolio of Australia's largest 200 companies by market value in a single investment.\n\nMany of these are companies with dominant market positions, such as the big four banks, mining behemoths BHP Group Ltd, Rio Tinto Ltd and Fortescue Ltd, and healthcare giants like CSL Ltd and Cochlear Ltd, to name a few.\n\nThe IOZ ETF has climbed almost 10% in the past year, paying dividends of $1.14 per share in that time.\n\nLooking ahead, Morgan Stanley projects overall economic growth to \"improve gradually\" next year in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, accounting firm KPMG expects 2% economic growth in 2025, and the Australian Government's Trade and Investment Commission says Australia is projected to \"continue to outperform our peers over the next 5 years to 2029\".\n\nThese forecasts suggest a positive future for ASX shares, meaning the IOZ ETF should be well-positioned to benefit in 2025.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Zach Bristow has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nVanEck MSCI International Quality ETF\n\nWhat it does: This ASX ETF is focused on owning the highest-quality companies from across global share markets.\n\nBy Tristan Harrison: I think an ASX ETF is a great place to start investing due to the instant diversification it can deliver with just a single investment.\n\nBut which ETF is the right one to go with? How about one in which every single portfolio holding is 'high quality'?\n\nTo be chosen for the QUAL ETF portfolio, these international businesses must rank well on three key fundamentals: A high return on equity (ROE), earnings stability, and low financial leverage.\n\nThis means the companies make high profits for the amount of shareholder money retained within the business, the profit doesn't tend to fluctuate dramatically, and they have low debt on the balance sheet.\n\nWhen you put those factors together, they generally result in great businesses. There's a good chance these types of companies will perform over the long term thanks to their ability to reinvest newly generated profit for a high return (thanks to the high ROE).\n\nPast performance is not a guarantee of future returns, but over the past decade, the QUAL ETF has returned an average of 15.7% per year. That return was more than 2% stronger per year than the MSCI World ex-Australia Index, which measures the global share market.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Tristan Harrison does not own units of the VanEck MSCI International Quality ETF.\n\niShares S&P 500 ETF\n\nWhat it does: The iShares S&P 500 ETF is an index fund that gives ASX investors exposure to the largest 500 companies listed on the American stock markets.\n\nBy Sebastian Bowen: Normally, I'm a big fan of ASX index funds for beginner investors. However, I think that this America-centric index fund is a better pick for a beginner investor in the current environment.\n\nFor one, the largest US stocks in this index fund are still growing at a healthy clip, unlike some of the ASX's biggest companies right now.\n\nZooming out, the iShares S&P 500 ETF gives beginners exposure to what are, arguably, the best businesses on the planet. This index fund includes famous American names like Coca-Cola, American Express, Ford, Mastercard and Netflix.\n\nHowever, its largest holdings \u2014 the likes of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft \u2014 are truly globally dominant and, in my view, a great place for a beginner investor to start.\n\nIf you're looking to kick off the new year with your first stock market investment, you could certainly do a lot worse than this all-star ETF.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Sebastian Bowen owns shares of Coca-Cola, American Express, Mastercard, Netflix, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nXero Ltd\n\nWhat it does: Xero is a global small business platform provider. Its smart tools help small businesses and their advisors manage core accounting functions like tax and bank reconciliation, payroll, and payments.\n\nBy James Mickleboro: I think Xero would be a great option for beginner investors.\n\nIt is always advisable to invest in quality companies. So, as arguably one of the highest quality companies on the Australian share market, Xero certainly ticks this box.\n\nIn addition, the company has a huge growth runway that appears supportive of decades of growth. For example, in November, Xero had approximately 4.2 million subscribers using its cloud accounting software platform. This compares to its estimated total addressable market (TAM) of 100 million+ small-to-medium-sized businesses across the globe.\n\nI'm not alone in this view. Last month, Blackwattle Investment Partners said its analysts \"view XRO as one of the highest quality companies on the ASX with a significant long-term, compounding growth profile.\" Goldman Sachs also agrees. It recently gave Xero shares a buy rating and a $201.00 price target.\n\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro owns shares of Xero Ltd.",

In fact, without all our dikes (and some dunes) more than a 1/3 of the Netherlands would be flooded.\n\n\n\nThis map gives you a good idea how much of the Netherlands is below sea level!\n\n\n\nThis\n\n\n\nThe Dutch have been battling it out with the sea (and rivers) for many centuries. Not too long ago, flooding of large parts of the country was a yearly occurrence. Not all the dikes and other water protection systems were built overnight. It was accomplished again over many centuries. Bit by bit parts of the sea were reclaimed. People built a dike around a particular piece of land and pumped it dry. We call that a \"polder\". Lots of the Netherlands consists of \"polders\". This process started as early as the 12th century.\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of windmills larger bodies of water and thus polders could be built and milled dry.\n\n\n\nThis is about the so-called Haarlemmeerpolder. You can see it on the map just (south) west of Amsterdam. For many reasons, it is important, not least these days as Amsterdam Airphort is smack in the middle of it! Amsterdam Airport used to be called Schiphol, which means ship (ship) shelter (hol). Amsterdam Airport is the lowest international airport in the world. Most of its runway are 3 meters below seal level!\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote: The original Haarlemmermeer Lake is said to have been mostly a peat bog, a relic of a northern arm of the Rhine which passed through the district in Roman times. In 1531, the original Haarlemmermeer had an area of 26.0 square kilometres (10.0 sq mi), and near it were three smaller lakes: the Leidsche Meer (Leiden Lake), the Spiering Meer, and the Oude Meer (Old Lake), with a combined area of about 31 square kilometres (12 sq mi).\n\n\n\nThe Haarlemmermeer could be a dangerous place during storms. On 7 January 1629, Frederick Henry of the Palatinate, son and heir of Frederick V, the \"Winter King\" drowned trying to cross it. By 1647, the new Haarlemmermeer had an area of about 150 square kilometres (58 sq mi), which a century later had increased to over 170 square kilometres (66 sq mi).\n\n\n\nIn 1643, Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater proposed to dike and drain the lake. Similar schemes, among which those of Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius in 1742 and of Baron van Lijnden van Hemmen in 1820, were proposed from time to time. But it was not until a furious hurricane in November 1836 drove the waters as far as the gates of Amsterdam, and another on Christmas Day sent them in the opposite direction to submerge the streets of Leiden, that the matter was seriously considered.\n\n\n\nOn 1 August 1837, King William I appointed a royal commission of inquiry. Their proposal receiving the sanction of the Dutch Parliament's Second Chamber in March 1839, and in the following May the work was begun.[5]\n\n\n\nFirst, a canal was dug around the lake, called Ringvaart (Ring Canal), to carry the water drainage and boat and ship traffic which had previously gone across the lake. This canal was 61 kilometres (38 mi) long, and 2.40 metres (7.9 ft) deep, and the excavated earth was used to build a dike from 30 to 50 metres (98 to 164 ft) wide around the lake. The area enclosed by the canal was more than 180 square kilometres (69 sq mi), and the average depth of the lake 4 metres (13 ft). As the water had no natural drainage, it was calculated that probably 1000 million tons of water would have to be raised by mechanical means.\n\n\n\nAll of the pumping was done by steam mills, an innovation contrasting with the historic practice of draining polders using windmills. Three Cornish beam engines were imported from Hayle: the Leeghwater, the Cruquius (the largest Watt-design reciprocal stroke steam engine ever built and now a museum), and the Lijnden. Pumping began in 1848, and the lake was dry by July 1, 1852; 800 million tons of water were actually discharged. At the first sale of the highest lands along the banks on 16 August 1853, about \u00a328 per acre was paid; but the average price afterwards was less. The whole area of 170.36 square kilometres (65.78 sq mi) recovered from the waters brought in 9,400,000 guilders, or about \u00a3780,000, exactly covering the cost of the enterprise; so that the actual cost to the nation was only the amount of the interest on the capital, or about \u00a3368,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole visit was a bit of deja vu for me. I visited this museum with my dad when I was still at primary school. So we are talking about 55 years ago! We lived not too far away in Amstelveen. Perhaps difficult to imagine, but in those days there was no internet. I recall driving up to the museum in my dad's DKW several times, only to find out it was closed. It was impossible to figure out what the opening times were. But eventually, we managed to make it in. It wasn't anything like it is today. Especially the technical engine bits were in very poor shape. I do remember they had this huge 3D model of a map of the Netherlands. It would simulate the flooding of the Netherlands. Very impressive. Unfortunately, that model is gone. But they did an excellent job restoring the pumping station and most of its technical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe original plan for pumping the Haarlemmermeer dry called for windmills. It would have taken more than 180 windmills. Eventually, 4 steam engine pump stations were chosen. A controversial decision in those days. This painting depicts one of the meetings were steam instead of wind power was suggested. As you can see, that was a bit of a heated debate!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe museum website (\n\n\n\nThis type of steam engine was developed in Cornwall, mainly for pumping water out of mines. (\n\n\n\nIn all it took four identical steam pump engine to pump out the Haarlemmermeer in about 4 years. As we will see there are eight pumps driven by a single annular compound steam engine. The steam engine itself was a one piston, compound engine. Its pistons had a diameter of 2,15m (High Pressure) and 3,66m (low pressure) working according to the Conrwell cyclus at 5 strokes a minute.\n\n\n\nThe pumps themselves would displace 250m3 per minute across 4,5m height difference.\n\n\n\nThe Cruquis was operational till 1932! Polders, when pumped dry, still require continuous pumping to stay dry! It was commissioned in 1839 which meant it was operational for a staggering 84 years. Things were build to last in those days!\n\n\n\nLet's start with the boiler. Originally these were Cornwall boilers later replaced with Lancashire boilers. These are the so-called flue type boilers. Which means the fire is not underneath the boiler, but inside the boiler. The fire tube is a cylinder running from the boiler front to the back and connected to a chimney. The flues are fully enclosed by water and thus ensure very efficient heat transfer from the flames to the water.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, all the boilers have been removed. We have to make do with this 1:1 scale mock-up of one boilerplate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an image showing what it looked like in the early days, a row of boilers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a nice diagram that shows the inner workings, the boilers, the steam engine and the pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's have a look at the main engine: This is the main piston. Or rather you are looking at the piston rod sticking through the stuffing box. The rod is connected to this sort of crosshead onto which the 8 beams that drive the pumps are attached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am always fascinated by the architecture of these sorts of Industrial Revolution technical marvels. The building is gorgeous. But also look for instance at these stairs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few more images inside the main engine room, showing the various rods and levers that ensure the up-and-down motion of the engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteam engine technology at the time was fairly new to the Dutch engineers. So the design, building and also initial operation were all done with help from the British. A British engineer helped run the pumping station initially and he also trained the Dutch engineers and staff. The station's normal shift consisted of 6 people.\n\n\n\nAfter a decade-long restoration the pumping station was re-opened in 2002 in its current shape. The engine does not run on steam anymore. It is driven by a hydraulic pump so you can still see everything moving and water being pumped.\n\n\n\nLet's go outside and look at those pumps.\n\n\n\nWhat is interesting is that building is an integral part of the engine, so to speak. Its walls are the pivot points of the beams driving the pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the well, there is a simple butterfly valve, as on the drive rod. When the rod is pulled up it closes and all the water above it is pumped out and comes out here, where it drains into the Haarlemmermeer ringvaart. A circular canal, built on the outside of the dike built around the Haarlemmermeer.\n\n\n\nAs the rod with its butterfly valve closed moves upward it also sucks such water from the Haarlemmermeer through the bottom butterfly valve. As the rod reaches it top position it closes once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext door to the museum is a nice cafe/tearoom. Its quite well known and a bit of landmark.

In fact, without all our dikes (and some dunes) more than a 1/3 of the Netherlands would be flooded.This map gives you a good idea how much of the Netherlands is below sea level!This The Dutch have been battling it out with the sea (and rivers) for many centuries.

The tire was basically flat against the parking surface!\n\nYesterday I had gone to a nearby foam wash place and after the wash, while returning, I saw the dashboard had thrown the \"check tire pressure error\" for rear left tire. I immediately stopped and checked the rear tire's pressure and found it exactly 36.4 PSI (using etenwolf calibrated tire pressure gauge). I thought that the pressure water washing must've fouled up the ABS sensor and so the computer is reading it wrongly. I didn't think much of it and decided that I'd check it out today after the water would have dried off.\n\nBut today, when I saw the front left tyre completely deflated, I thought, perhaps the deflation warning system had wrongly identified the issue as rear tire instead of the front tire. Has anyone faced this issue before?\n\nIncidentally, about 10 months ago, that rear right tire had indeed had a puncture and the computer correctly identified that deflation. But it was a slow leak and was identified and fixed immediately and it hasn't leaked since. And since that time, I've rotated my tires twice so I don't even remember where that originally punctured tire sits now!\n\nAnyway, I immediately re-inflated my tire with the tire inflator and plugged the puncture after removing the nail. There was a 3 inch nail deeply embedded in the middle of the tread with its head inside the tire and the pointy end facing out!\n\nIt was a very back breaking task removing the tire and removing the nail with pliers and thereafter inserting the plug. The insertion tool bent multiple times and I had to restra But I think I did a decent job because it hasn't leaked since I plugged it.\n\nI took 2 long drives and the pressure is holding. The computer hasn't thrown any errors now. All errors cleared automatically.\n\nNow, the lingering questions I have from this experience are;\n\n1. Would there have been any lasting damage to the tire's side wall or the alloy rim from the car sitting on the fully deflated tire (basically, the rim touching the tire - which was touching the parking surface!)\n\n2. How exactly does the deflation warning system calculate if there's a deflation? I thought that the computer reads the ABS sensors inputs and sees if there's abnormal rotation speed on a single tire against all the others and it throws error for that specific tyre. In my case, the error should have been for the front left tire because it had puncture so it would have had more traction due to reduced pressure and would probably be rotating slower. But the computer threw the error for rear left tire. Did anyone face this issue ever before?\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

I haven't made up my mind yet if it has been value for money!\n\nI have installed FuelX lite on my Svartpilen 250 (bs6) just as an experiment to see what changes it does to the bike. My observations are, it made no difference from idle to about 4000rpm. From 4 to 6 the bike is more eager and the throttle response has improved even the sound has changed. But it\u2019s not a very significant, I wouldn\u2019t buy this product for such minor difference. From 6000 onwards there is no difference.\n\nI have also installed quick throttle, I am using progressive cam at the moment. It increases the throttle opening (as compared to stock) after about 30% of throttle twist. This cam gives the same throttle opening initially as the stock, which makes city riding easy.\n\nI haven't clicked photo of the cam so I am using image from google.\n\nAs for the mileage I feel it has dropped because of the quick throttle, I also feel that FuelX will not improve the mileage as they claim nor will the engine run cooler.\n\nOf the 2 mods I feel quick throttle is worth the money since you get 3 different cams and you can always interchange to get different riding experience and the change is much more prominent than that from FuelX lite.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

They are currently retailing the 2.0 generation of the Ray-Ban Meta (for brevity RBM).\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t closely tracked wearable tech products but only per chance stumbled on these glasses when a friend posted a video clip of riding with these. I had a relative coming from the US so used the opportunity to purchase a pair from their US store (link)\n\n\n\nThis is a very quick description of what they are (but please lean on relevant links for more information). I have summed up the use case for which I bought them personally (which is narrower than their broader abilities) and my quick take of the glasses based on my personal use case and usage so far. I bought my pair sometime in end October or early November and received them around late November.\n\n\n\nMy review will not be as comprehensive as a tech geek reviewer but limited to my own experimental usage so far. So please temper your expectations from this review accordingly.\n\n\n\nFAQ and general infobits\n\n\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMeta powered AI enabled glasses / sunglasses. It comes in 3 different styles (Wayfarer, Headliner and Skyliner) with each style offering 3 to 7 different permutations of colors and lens shades and two different sizes (two sizes fits all approach if you please) - medium and large. My head circumference is 56 cms and I bought the smaller size for myself.\n\n\n\nWhere can I buy one\n\nIt is retailed in select countries at the moment and India is NOT one of them. It is available as a grey market purchase here for a tidy premium.\n\n\n\nWhat does it cost\n\nThe range starts at $299 and goes up to about ~ $379 (taxes are extra) depending on the frame and more pertinently, the choice of lens. Transition lenses are predictably the most expensive.\n\n\n\nWhich one did I buy\n\nBased on my use case, I bought the Wayfarer with a basic clear lens which cost about $299 plus taxes. With US taxes and conversion these cost me ~INR 27k. In India, grey market sellers are retailing a similar piece for something like INR 40-42k.\n\n\n\nThe reason I chose these are they can pass off just as easily as regular reading glasses as they can as stylish sunglasses. I also picked the cheapest lens option since the idea was to immediately take them to my optician and replace the lens with my progressive reading number with a transition lens. This means I can wear them indoors as regular specs and they double up as sunglasses when I\u2019m outdoors. They have my 1.5 reading glass prescription baked in so they\u2019re fully functional for me in any setting.\n\n\n\nWhat can it do and key specifications and features\n\nA bunch of things. On an indicative basis, it can take calls like a Bluetooth device on which you can listen to music, take calls etc; it can take photos and videos including pushing these out real time to linked social media accounts like facebook, instagram etc. It can even livestream videos to these social media accounts. While on a WhatsApp video call, you can share your POV live feed from the RBM with the person you\u2019re speaking with.\n\n\n\nThe specs work with a Meta AI conversationalist assistant where you can operate various functions using preset voice commands. It can be used as a live chatGPT support where Meta AI could respond and react to questions like \u201cHey Meta, What am I looking at\u201d although I think this feature is still limited to some countries and there too on a beta basis.\n\n\n\nThe specs are managed via a Meta app, where you can choose a whole host of typical settings including what apps the RBM Meta can be linked to. A Meta account is required to use the glasses (although this can be done via pre-existing Facebook or Instagram accounts)\n\n\n\nThis 2.0 iteration has ramped up its hardware specs too and it now sports an integrated 12MP camera generating a photo resolution of 3024 x 4032 and video resolution of 1376 x 1824 at 30 fps. Five hidden mics and directional speakers that sit just above the ears power its BT voice call and listening functionality.\n\n\n\nWhat did I buy it for\n\nAside from basically the chance to experiment with a new tech with zero expectations hung on it, my intended use case for these is listed below.\n\n\n\n# Another pair of reading glasses that can also double up as an AirPod replacement, thereby not having to deal with the intrusiveness of an \u2018in-ear\u2019 device to take calls or listen to music.\n\n# The ability to take on the fly pics or videos while I\u2019m driving. Often while touring I\u2019d find a lovely view or a camouflaged test mule car or really anything that I\u2019d like to share. One no longer has to fumble around to take out a phone camera and multitask. It\u2019s a button click away on your frame or better still a \u201cHey Meta\u201d led voice command away from a click to make the process completely handsfree.\n\n# I don\u2019t use GoPros etc and in particular I like the idea of being able to take POV photos and videos while on the bike too, particularly for scenic locations, sunrise, a specific route etc. Really handy for this.\n\n\n\nThese really sum up my principal use case. I know there\u2019s a lot more these glasses can do but my primary use case is around the above three and I have indeed used it for all of the above with more than satisfactory outcome.\n\n\n\nOver time, I will figure out if any other features end up getting used by me as I experiment with the glasses.\n\n\n\nKey observations and takeaways\n\n\n\nI have summed up what\u2019s great, what\u2019s not so great and some general neutral observations and tagged them as [+], [-] and [=] respectively. Please bear in mind some of the observations in any of these buckets may simply be logical or acceptable given the nature of this specific device so should be viewed accordingly.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s great\n\n[+] The Wayfarer design is as stylish as it is versatile. Fits in just as well as a formal reading glass as it does as a sunglass when outdoors. My choice of a transition lens ensures it can work as both.\n\n[+] I love that they pass off just as regular glasses and I don't look like I'm using wearable tech from a mile away or wearing 'in your face' tech.\n\n[+] For the amount of tech and ability it sports, at 48 gms, it is a mere 5 grams heavier than traditional Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. While it is meaningfully heavier than my lighter design and primary / preferred reading glasses, it's still very comparable to some of the other weightier reading glasses I have. Can be used all day if needed for pure reading or sunglass purpose.\n\n[+] Battery life is pretty decent. On my recent road trip, it held up for several hours with reasonably regular on and off camera usage. I'm sure that figure would be lower if in continuous use but that's not the idea with a device like this.\n\n[+] These are clearly designed with a strong social media focus with a range of compatibility solutions for uploading direct to these accounts, live streaming etc. Live streaming YouTubers who want to share POV videos hands free will particularly appreciate this device. Take for instance, someone who wants to share a live POV video doing pottery or a similar artistic venture, alternately someone working with some tools on a machine who wants to share a POV video while working with his hands, without necessarily wearing a GoPro on their head or chest.\n\n[+] Audio quality is really very good, as is the quality of photos and videos. However, please don\u2019t expect to match the quality from a top of line smartphone on this aspect or even a top end BT headset when it comes to calls etc.\n\n[+] I think for what it offers, the price is pretty good. A pair of AirPods are similarly priced. Typical decent sunglasses of Rayban range too can cost US$ 150 - 200. Reading glasses too can range from anything from Rs. 6000 to Rs. 25,000 (I have some reading glass frames at both ends of that price spectrum. Keeping in mind these price benchmarks, I find a US$ 300 price point for these smart glasses fairly acceptable.\n\n[+] 32 GB of storage, which can store over 500 photos and more than 100 30-second videos.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s not so great\n\n[-] When it comes to taking photos and videos, it can only be taken in portrait mode and not landscape.\n\n[-] You can\u2019t \u201cframe\u201d or \u201ccompose\u201d your shot. You\u2019re kind of taking it blind. Nor can you immediately review the photo taken, since there is a bit of a process to download / import the pictures into the phone.\n\n[-] This is a big negative. I found that it\u2019s extremely cumbersome to pre-pair the glasses to two devices (like for instance an ipad and an iphone both). It gets very glitchy with its connectivity if you do this. This is a pretty basic expectation from any BT audio device.\n\n[-] This is not going to be the best BT audio device nor is it going to be the best photography or videography device. It does a range of diverse things, offering some very specific conveniences in the process. Please set expectations accordingly.\n\n[-] More specifically on the above, while overall Audio quality is excellent indoors, I\u2019ve noticed that Audio quality (listening) while on calls can be a bit inadequate when you\u2019re in noisy surroundings.\n\n[-] They're a bit cumbersome to wear inside a helmet and I definitely would not wear it throughout a long ride. I'd only wear it on specific sections when I anticipate I would want to take pictures or videos, for instance around sunrise or sunset or when I'm at a particularly scenic section of the ride.\n\n[-] A low IPX4 water resistance rating means while it\u2019ll handle the odd inadvertent sprinkle, it\u2019s definitely not a device I\u2019d risk with getting too wet. Definitely not cut out for any adventure activities in water bodies or for use in heavy rain.\n\n\n\nSome neutral observations\n\n[=] The glasses can be configured to upload straight to social media as well as livestream to social media.\n\n[=] Battery life is reasonably decent under normal use. It charges pretty quickly too.\n\n[=] Videos by default can now be 1 min long as a maximum limit. This can now be set to an increased 3 min time limit although that drains the battery faster.\n\n[=] While Meta has taken care to allay privacy concerns via the LED that lights up, it seems like some folks have hacked into this and defeated this protection. Regardless of the light, it can still creep people out if they know you're wearing glasses that can take pics and videos on the fly. Please use common sensical social etiquette if using these glasses in private settings.\n\n[=] Be mindful while wearing a cap while shooting. The tip of the cap / hat can show up in the media.\n\n[=] Mic quality is absolutely fantastic. But I find that also means that videos taken on a motorbike can have a LOT of ambient wind noise creeping in.\n\n[=] Decent video stabilisation although if you're moving your head a lot it may still not feel seamless.\n\n[=] Operates via Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity.\n\n[=] The strong mic means that Hey Meta commands can be said out in a fairly low voice and it will still pick it up, provided there is not too much ambient noise. When I was riding the bike with the visor open at highway speeds, it sometimes did not pick up the voice command. But with a closed visor / slower speeds and open visor, it picked it up comfortably. In closed other environments (closed car, home etc), even a very low volume of command does the job.\n\n[=] It\u2019s testament to how great a job they\u2019ve done with this 2.0 that this is not just a gimmicky weekend / holiday toy but something I wear and use almost every single day. Either for random photos, or as a BT device connected to my phone or just as my reading glasses / sunglasses when outdoors.\n\n[=] Black will give you the most discreet version of these glasses as the two LEDs / lens blend in best with this colorway.\n\n\n\nTRIVIA:\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding that this is likely against the terms of use imposed by Meta, is this and similar tech the next privacy nightmare. Food for thought.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zKVXNVnPCrQ?si=YFEUA4GfzLLFuoqU As many of you might be aware, Meta has partnered with Essilor Luxottica to create their version of wearable tech.

My association with cars started when my father purchased Alto in 2008. I learnt to drive as we were expecting our first baby and took my father\u2019s car to take my wife for shopping, groceries, etc. Alto was a no nonsense super trusted car which was easy on the pocket. Our whole family travelled a lot in it.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, I decided to purchase a car of my own and was looking for a comfortable 5 seater with a budget of Rs 10-11 lakhs. I looked at Creta, Honda City, TUV300, Scorpio because all these were falling in my budget. And this time I wanted a diesel as diesel was cheaper than petrol and since I was getting it within my budget, why not.\n\nOne day, my BIL asked me to check the Duster and we went to Renault\u2019s showroom to check it out. The car was big and very comfortable. Asked for TD and they arranged it at home. 4 people (Father, Mother, Wife and my 6 year old daughter) sat in the back seat and I was in the driver's seat with a sales guy as my co-passenger. Initially, I drove like I was driving my Alto, very cautiously, not to hit the underbelly, but then the sales guy said, you are driving an SUV, drive like one. And then I drove it over potholes, at speed and the handling blew my mind. I asked my family and they all said, leni to yehi hai ab. That sealed the deal.\n\nWelcome Big Bear, White Renault Duster RXL Diesel 85PS on 27th July 2016 and everyone loved it. My office was not so far and that\u2019s why my running was not too much but I enjoyed every day driving it. Took it to Haridwar, Rishikesh, Mendipur Balaji, Lansdowne, Mussoorie, Gwalior, Lucknow, Ayodhya and many other places and it is always such a comfortable journey.\n\n\n\nI always made sure that all the preventive maintenance services of both Alto and Duster were done only at authorised service centers religiously.\n\n\n\nWhy the new car?\n\nFast forward to 2024. As Big Bear completed 8 years in July, the itch to replace it started as the infamous NGT rule of 10 years was looming large on me. Also, the GRAP 4 rule in winters prompted me to start the search mid year as I knew it would take time. I was in the market with below conditions:\n\nBudget - under or around 20 lakhs on road. Less would be better Safety - 4 to 5 star, with stable body shell and atleast 4 airbags Rear Seat and Boot - Should accommodate 3 adults in rear with shoulders touching the back of the seat and should have a big boot, just like Big Bear. Last year, I shifted my house in Big Bear (except furniture) Petrol and Manual only - NGT rule in NCR, only Rs 7 per litre price difference b/w petrol and diesel, BS6 DEF challenges because of very low running (I am fully WFH), ban looming large on diesels from 2027. No Automatics for me. I feel disconnected from the car After Sale Service - Witnessed stark difference b/w Maruti and Renault A$$, Maruti being good Resale - Prefer model with great market appeal, decent to good present day sales numbers will lead to good resale later Engine and overall reliability - Reliable engine, 4 cylinder. I don\u2019t like 3 cylinders\n\nAlternatives considered\n\nWith a budget of around 20 lakhs looking at all the possible C2 and D1 segment SUVs, I prepared a detailed comparison sheet including dimensions, features, mileage, cost of ownership, pros and cons of each. My baseline in driving dynamics was Duster and we had a strict guideline to buy something which should better Duster in most of the aspects. Below are the alternatives considered. Please consider these as my personal views with no intention to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings. The cars listed are in no particular order and do not represent any preference.\n\nMaruti Grand Vitara - Comes with Maruti\u2019s trust of after sales service but the product was a big let down for us. The interiors felt as if they were lifted from Ritz. Yes, my BIL owned Ritz in 2010 and every knob, button, lever, plastics, everything felt so dated and bored in Grand Vitara. Black interiors were a big NO for me considering how hot it becomes in Delhi/ NCR in peak summers. It felt claustrophobic. The sunroof was big but the curtain was so thin that we could feel the heat from the sun in July. Boot was non-existent in the hybrid version. Even the non-hybrid's boot was way smaller than Duster\u2019s. So, it was striked off the list. Dealer was giving a great deal but the product was not able to excite us.\n\nToyota Hyryder - Almost similar to Grand Vitara except that the interiors were a mix of black and tan, a bit of a savior. However, the bones were from Maruti and every part has Maruti stamped on it except for the hybrid system. So, there was nothing Toyota in it which would have pushed us. Dealer was giving a good deal but not comparable to the Grand Vitara. Still it got off the list.\n\nKia Carens - One of my good friend purchased it at an on-road price of 14 lakhs and recommended it to me. Took a test drive, was pretty impressed with the drive, comfort and airy cabin. It had loads of space and had many places to keep water bottles and other knick-knacks (remember, I was coming from Duster which had bottle holders only in front doors). Carens is an MUV and its face looks drooping rather than upright like an SUV or even Ertiga. I have seen it running on Noida-Agra and Agra-Lucknow Expressways and it did not give me any confidence against my Duster. It could be a good city car but my occasional drives on highways forced me to write it off.\n\nHonda Elevate - One of the biggest contenders if I consider size. Comes very close to Duster in boot space, comfort and even plain interiors. In 2024, what on Earth was Honda thinking about launching a product with dated interiors. I understand, Japanese philosophy of practicality but they need to sell the product in India where buyers look for maximum value for their money. And this is evident in their sales numbers domestically and abroad. However, I still took its test drive and the sales agent was quite knowledgeable. But the NA CVT combo was a bummer for me. A slight tap on the accelerator was sending the rev needle to its peak and there was so much cabin noise. Honda\u2019s engine was peppy and CVT super-reliable but I did not enjoy the highway drive because of poor insulation and cannot live with so much noise everyday. In the city, it's a better car. Convinced my wife to keep it in our wishlist, though.\n\nMahindra Scorpio N - As with the current craze of SUVs, Mahindra\u2019s top the list with their macho machines. Scorpio N was a great contender because of its look and stance. Both Wifey and I went to check it in showroom but were put off by the callous attitude of sales person. Their attitude was take it or leave it, said it all. Mahindra is having buyers willing to pay any money in cash and take it. Coming back to the car, it was so big and tall, I almost had to stand on the footboard to step in. A thumbs down from both of us as my father will be travelling with us and I don\u2019t want him to do this exercise everytime. Also, being ladder on frame meant that 2nd row comfort is compromised. There was no test drive given so 2nd row comfort is bookish observation. Sales person never called back and so we lost interest and struck it off.\n\nMahindra XUV700 - Craze of India, as we call it. Everyone is after it. Such a great value for money. I was looking for diesel even though 80% of my driving would be in the city because I have read many horror stories of mStallions going bad on team-bhp. Also, mileage is almost non-existent for petrol, so only diesel. MX vs AX5 was the tussle as former was giving me full value for money in 17 lakhs whereas latter was giving the oomph factor with sunroof and screens but was going above 21 lakhs. Took test drive and was amazed by the NVH refinement of both the engines. Test drive vehicles were showing the single digit mileage figures in the city, petrol was pretty poor in the two. I did some calculations that even with my sedate driving style, will I be able to cross single digit, I could but very barely. Then the horror stories of DPF and the regen process started creeping in. The more I read about BS 6 diesel cars, the more I drifted from diesels. I did not want a car to be taken every week on highways just to burn the soot. It must have been a task in itself. I also visited Mahindra Service centre to get a feel of it and I could see it as no different than Renault. The chalta hai attitude of service guys was a No-No. I could still read many stories on the internet where reliability of XUV700 has been questioned even in recent batches. So, with a heavy heart we dropped it.\n\nTata Safari or Harrier - Never considered it considering poor product reliability and after sales service.\n\nVolkswagen and Skoda - Never considered it considering cramped 2nd row space, smaller boot and not so good after sales service.\n\nHyundai Creta - Albeit a bit smaller than Duster but it ticked all the boxes. Budget, space, comfort, interior, everything was on point. We selected the S (O) Petrol Manual variant and got a great deal from Capital Hyundai. Sales agent, Deepak, was very courteous and helpful in answering all our queries. Took almost an hour-drive in twisty winding lanes of Sector 63 Noida and then stretched its legs on FNG highway. Initially, I was not able to find my driving position but after multiple attempts I was able to find it. The drive was satisfying and at 16.30 lakhs on-road all inclusive was the deal offered which was best considering there were no offers on this hot selling car. Both Wifey and I were certain that this would be the car.\n\nHyundai Alcazar - Was in the showroom to check the car on the next day of launch in September. Had a detailed look at the Signature variant which was parked just opposite to Creta and was able to compare feature by feature directly. Outside except the grill and DRL style, everything is Creta. Inside except the tan color, it's Creta. Rear is where the difference lies for me. With the 3rd row in, it looked longer and bigger. I must say, the overhang and rear was not very SUVish as it is rectangular rather than curved at the edges. With the 3rd row down, the huge boot was the cherry on cake. After a bit of row adjustments, we were able to sit comfortably on all the 3 rows. It was hitting all the checkboxes which Creta was ticking plus the added advantage of premiumness, 7 seats and huge boot. Now, we were in a real fix against Creta. We were sure it would be a Hyundai only but which one.\n\nBooking Experience, Variant and other price details\n\n\n\nI wanted reliability, features, safety and great after sales service and my wife wanted my peace of mind plus an uplift from mundane interiors of Duster. After weighing in all our must-haves, we settled on Alcazar. I was considering the Executive (base) variant as it was fitting my budget. The only downside was I had to retrofit the infotainment system and speakers, either from Karol Bagh or from the dealership. I watched numerous Karol Bagh videos of base variant Creta being stripped and fitment done. Watching these videos was such a pain for both me and my wife. We both want our car to be perfect and do not want any aftermarket fitment. So, I had a relook at the variants and I found the Prestige variant which had everything we were looking after, without anyone touching anything. Sales Agent Deepak was very courteous and helpful. He made sure that whether it's Creta or Alcazar, we take the correct decision. He offered me multiple drives of Creta and Alcazar and made sure that I am satisfied completely. I have not seen sales agents going extra lengths and helping customers. In my 6 months search, I interacted with almost 8-10 sales agents and none of them can match Deepak\u2019s help and support. We negotiated hard and could get the Insurance almost matched. Spoke to VP Sales even to get an extra 5K discount. It was a tough bargain considering it was a recent facelift. Below are the final details of the car:\n\nMake : Hyundai\n\nModel : Alcazar\n\nVariant : Alcazar 1.5T MT Prestige 7S\n\nTransmission : Manual\n\nEngine : Turbo Petrol 1.5\n\nMfg Year : Nov 2024 (Facelift)\n\nFuel : Petrol\n\nColour : ATLAS WHITE\n\nBooking Date : 01/12/2024\n\nDelivery Date : 22/12/2024\n\nCity : Noida\n\nRegistration : Ghaziabad, UP\n\nDealer : Capital Hyundai, Sect 63, Noida\n\nAccessories (Dealer) : 3D Mat, Mud Flap, Perfume, Divinity\n\nAdditions: Extended Warranty (4th and 5th Year), Seat Covers\n\nPrice : Rs 19,50,000 (On-Road), Extended Warranty (Rs 21,239), Seat Covers (Rs 12,300)\n\nIncluded in OTR: Insurance (RTI, EP, ZD, CM, PB, KP) + Dealer Accessories\n\nDiscounts: Insurance 43K\n\nBooking Amount : Rs 25k\n\nGoodies (surprise) at the time of delivery : Curtain raiser, chocolate cake, two key chains, chocolate box with car shaped mini chocolates, framed pic of car delivery\n\nLoan : PNB New Car loan of 15 lakhs at 8.8 Floating ROI for 5 years Pre-Delivery Inspection and Pre-Delivery Work\n\n\n\nAs the White color was not in stock, so booking was made and the car was dispatched on 5th Dec from Chennai with a tentative arrival date of 15th Dec. Deepak gave me the VIN number and screenshots of the DMS system to track my car on regular intervals. However, to our surprise, the car arrived at the dealer's yard on 12th Dec and we planned to take delivery on 15th Dec. However, my wife\u2019s grandfather passed away on 13th Dec and we had to defer everything till the rituals were done. Finally, we decided on the 22nd Dec delivery date. On Friday, 20th Dec, asked Deepak that I wanted to do PDI in their stockyard and he gave me the location and connected me with the person responsible. Their stockyard is at Multi-level basement parking of Botanical Garden Metro Station, Noida. Reached there at 1pm and the person there took the car out in the sun and assisted me in checking everything. With My Team-Bhp PDI checklist with me plus my past experience, I was able to complete it in 1 hour. The odometer had 21 Kms which was ok with me. Gave a green signal to dealership and on 21st Dec paid balance amount of 4.5 lakhs plus Rs 21,239 for extended warranty. Also, asked bank officials to release the loan amount so that tax invoice and other formalities can be done. As 21st Dec was Saturday, Deepak and I completed all the formalities of signing of documents, demo, RTO invoice, Tax invoice, Fastag, etc. I wanted 22nd Dec to be free so that my family can enjoy the Car Delivery moment.\n\n\n\nDelivery Day\n\n\n\nAsked Deepak to get the Hyundai Alcazar seat covers installed which I confirmed to him last night. As I wanted the fitting to be done in front of me, I reached the dealership at 10:30am. Got the fitting done and was happy with the helpful nature of the people. They made sure work is perfect. In the meantime, Deepak handed over all the receipts to me, got the Bluelink activated. I was also coordinating with my wife and sister about their arrival at the showroom. They reached around 1:30pm and everything was ready by then. Car was thoroughly cleaned, parked in the delivery bay. Deepak was making sure that everything was perfect and it was indeed perfect. We exchanged pleasantries. We gifted Deepak a Ganesha idol and sweet box. He was overwhelmed with the gesture. Clicked lots of pictures as memories and departed by 2:30pm. Went straight to the nearby Indian Oil Petrol pump and got 5 litres petrol free. Also, got the full tank done. It was after so many years that I had to ask the attendant to fill petrol\n\n\n\nLikes\n\nDriving dynamics, stability and handling are on-par with my Duster. I am super impressed and proud of our decision. Product package in itself. Parts from Creta\u2019s bin means great fit and finish, consistent panel gaps and durability. Good quality plastics all around. Superb paint quality. All the colors look great. Atlas White looks like Nirma White 1.5L Turbo Petrol is smooth like butter. Neither free revving nor too slow to pick. Headlights and Connected DRLs are a big uplift for me coming from Duster. Did not miss the fog lamps. Huge windscreen just like Duster. All window glasses do not look fully transparent. They have some amount of blackishness. Doors do close with a reassuring thud. Bonnet is super heavy. Full Safety suite, 6 airbags and use of high strength steel should atleast give it 4 stars if not 5 in GNCAP (hope it gets tested). I will be more interested in reading \u201cbody shell stable\u201d rather than anything else. 3 point seat belts are a welcome addition for all the 7 occupants. 4 wheel disc brakes assure of a straight line on point stop. Gadgets, gizmos and huge screens consisting of an infotainment system and driver\u2019s cluster. Touch screen response is superb. After spending an hour with all the features of the infotainment system, I am able to set it based on my liking. Now, it is super convenient and feels a big uplift from Duster. Cruise Control and other buttons on steering are such an uplift for us. Reverse parking camera is a boon. I am not an audiophile so infotainment and speakers are decent for me. Whatever my daughter plays, I enjoy it. Loads of space to place water bottles, cooled glove box, wireless mobile charger, 2 cup holders, huge under-storage armrest, 2 snack trays with pop-out cup holders and much more. Sliding 2nd rows means usable 3rd row. Pull-up seat tumble feature is on both sides of the 2nd row. Getting to 3rd row in the 7 seater variant is super easy. My height is 5\u20197\u201d and my BIL\u2019s height is 5\u201910\u201d. Behind us sat my wife and my sister in the 2nd row who are 5\u20192\u201d. The 3rd row can then still sit my daughter who is 5\u20193\u201d and my nephew who is 4\u2019. 6-7 people of these sizes can sit comfortably with everyone getting decent shoulder room with ACs in all 3 rows. Car cools down pretty quickly as Auto AC or Manual AC both work like charm. Sunroof was the main attraction among everyone in the family. Even opening the curtain, brings so much light in. Now, the sunroof curtain always remains open and the cabin feels so bright during the day while we get the starry ceiling of Rolls Royce for free during the night. With all rows up, the boot can still carry 3-4 backpacks and other small stuff. If you put the 3rd row down, then the boot becomes 580 litres. Short trips or 1-2 day trips in summers can be done with all 7 occupants and very light luggage. But if you want to go for a long trip, then it is for only 5 passengers and the boot can swallow large cargo. Good looking alloys. Looks like lotus petal design. All 5 tyres in Executive and Prestige variants come with 215/60 R17. So, no need to upgrade the spare tyre to match the other 4. However, Platinum and Signature variants come with 18 inches and 17 inch as spare. Hyundai\u2019s after sales service is considered one of the best and on par with Maruti.\n\nDislikes\n\nProduct is not a big seller. Probably after Maruti launches Grand Vitara Max in 2025, Alcazar might get more notice and will sell better. Creta dominating and cannibalising its sales. I believe Hyundai never wanted it to sell in huge numbers to keep it differentiated. Like the TUV300 Plus, Hyundai should have cashed in on Creta\u2019s name and named it Creta Max. Missing Naturally Aspirated engine. I believe it was a conscious decision by Hyundai to differentiate it from Creta. No Crash Test of facelifted Creta and Alcazar puts a doubt in buyer\u2019s mind about the safety of the product. Upgrading to high strength steel and 6 airbags as standard on older platform does not guarantee better test numbers than Mahindra, Tata, Volkswagen or Skoda. Finding a comfortable driving position is difficult. After trying multiple settings, I am able to find a good position but still I feel there is some more improvement which I can have. However, ergonomically there is no challenge in reaching to controls. Everything is placed very thoughtfully. Magnet pad. Why Hyundai Why. No one is able to explain what to put there. In India, we don\u2019t put pictures of our loved ones or gods on magnet pads. I could not find any other use of it. It\u2019s a dead area for me. Instead Hyudani could have given cold drink tray just like Honda Jazz. Difficulty in pickup in 2nd gear in traffic due to turbo lag. Duster has better gear ratios and better low end torque. I have to downgrade to 1st gear every time as it feels jerky in 2nd gear. Reverse parking camera quality at night is not so good and is grainy. As the headrest is missing for the middle passenger in the 2nd row, even if Hyundai gives a seat belt, in my opinion, the car is technically a 6 seater. It\u2019s very dangerous for an adult to sit there. In my view, only a 4\u2019 kid should sit who can have head support from the seat. IRVM and ORVM are decently big but, the right side ORVM creates a big blind spot across the A-pillar and I had to stretch my neck like an ostrich. Would have loved the spare tyre in boot just like Creta. Had a tough time replacing the tyre in the Duster but I know it's not possible. Tyres came with 47 psi pressure from the dealership. So much glossy plastic in the interior is fingerprint and dust magnet. In a car marketed as premium, except one switch on the driver side door, none of the switches are backlit making it very difficult for passengers to locate them. Car notifies upshift of gear but does not notify downshift which becomes tricky as one has to rely on revs and sound of engine to judge whether to downshift or not. My Duster had both.\n\nExterior and Interior Pics\n\n\n\nBefore Delivery Day at the dealership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Morning. Waiting patiently for seat covers fitment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeat covers being fit. Don't want fabric seats to get soiled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning and decoration done, waiting to be parked in delivery bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the smiles on everybody's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGifting Ganeshaji to Deepak for the good luck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am hungry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandatory Pooja. Same Panditji who did Pooja of our Duster in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrome and Request Sensor only on Driver Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean lines at the rear and the three quarter look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH-shaped DRL design and turn indicator below it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull under bonnet insulation results in superb NVH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge Panoramic Sunroof which is the star of the show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat infotainment screen with superb touch response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one backlit switch on all the doors. Hyundai why spoil the party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetal shaped alloys. They are direct pick from last gen Alcazar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuad White LED headlamp setup is decent for night driving. Yet to test in foggy conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\n\n\n1.5 litre turbo petrol is butter smooth and Hyundai has done a fabulous job. Clutch is very light and smooth and the gears are slick. The gears have short throws. Putting it in reverse gear is different for me and I am always fearful that I should slot correctly. Upshifting from 1st to 2nd to 3rd is tricky as I am getting used to the new gear lever. Downshifting is easy however, absence of downshifter on screen does put a bit of strain and dropping gear from 6th to 4th or 3rd is something I need to learn. So, it's a mental thing which I am pretty sure I will get used to in a few days.\n\n\n\nIn the city, driving is easy and comfortable. However, I have felt that as speed comes in single digits and revs hover around 900-1000 rpm, the car gives jerks when picked in 2nd gear, so I have to drop to 1st gear to keep revs in check. Even though I have never stalled the car, it gives me a feeling and I have to press the accelerator pedal a bit more to keep moving. Turbo lag is thus very evident in 2nd gear.\n\n\n\nOn highways, the engine comes to full glory. It can touch speeds of 80+ km/hr in a short while in 3 gear and one has to quickly upshift to 6th gear to keep the revs under 2000 rpm. In 6th gear at speeds of 90 km/hr, revs settle at 1900 rpm and the engine keeps chugging smoothly. It is very easy to pick the car back from speeds of 50 to 90 km/hr and 1100 to 1900 rpm in 6th gear without any fuss. No drama, whatsoever.\n\n\n\nThere is so much power available for pulling loads and overtakes and I never felt uncomfortable and different than driving my Duster. I am very confident that being a turbo engine, the car has enough power to pull a full load on hills without any hesitation. Only a visit to Mussoorie or Nainital will confirm it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuel Economy\n\n\n\nRight now, the car speedo hovers at 450 kms out of which 360 kms are highway, 43 kms are before taking delivery of the car and rest in the city.\n\nIn the city, I am getting a mileage of around 11 kmpl with 100% AC on Auto.\n\n\n\nAlso, I went 180 kms each way to my hometown. While going I was alone with just one bag. While returning, it was a boot full with the 3rd row down and my father by my side. While going, I got an average of 18.8 kmpl and while returning got 16.5 kmpl. These figures are when I was driving with AC on Auto for the whole journey and doing 80-90 speeds. Occasionally, I did use Cruise Control at 85 or 90 speeds which definitely helped in better mileage.\n\nI believe these are decent numbers as of now, considering the car is still in breakin period and I am sure the numbers will go up after 1st service.\n\n\n\nDriving, Handling, Suspension and NVH\n\n\n\nI have driven many cars like I said and watched countless videos and can say that Duster is on top of my list when it comes to driving, handling and suspension. Now, after driving Alcazar, I can say that it matches the Duster very closely in all three aspects. Being Hyundai, NVH levels are so good that it's hard to hear anything from outside. Due to great insulation, both wind and road noise are cut-off.\n\n\n\nSteering feels one size smaller compared to Duster\u2019s but gives great feedback. Being EPS, at slow speeds, steering is light enough to assist in tight situations and parking is also very easy. On highway speeds, it gets enough weight to bring confidence but it\u2019s not on-par with Duster\u2019s steering weight at highway speeds. The Duster's steering is heavier and gives more confidence.\n\n\n\nCar swallows bumps and potholes easily at slow speeds and does not unsettle but I could feel rumble strips on my pedals. Also, I have noticed that if I have to change gear while going on white rumble strips, I find difficulty in slotting gears and the gear change is not smooth. So, I wait for some more seconds and then change them. Turning radius is a bit large compared to the Duster and I have to do 3 point turns unlike in my Duster but due to light steering, it becomes very easy to take u-turns.\n\n\n\nThe car is stocked with 215/60 R17 JK Lux tyres and I believe they are doing a very good job. The car has good highway manners and the tyres offer good grip. However, I still believe 16 inches on the Duster gives me more confidence, probably because Duster\u2019s height is lesser than Alcazar and it feels more planted. Still, in my 360+ kms highway trip, I never felt uncomfortable and the car was always behaving as per my input.\n\n\n\nWhile driving my Duster, I always felt confident even if I have to go over big bumps or potholes and it's the same for Alcazar. Ground clearance is not an issue.\n\n\n\nThe car comes with all four discs and they have great bite as they are new and sometimes we get jerk when I press the pedal a bit more while in city conditions. I remember I had a similar experience when I bought the Duster even though it had front discs and rear drums. Should settle down in few hundred kms.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOne thing I learned over the whole journey was that there is nothing like a perfect car. You need to make some compromises. The search lasted more than 6 months and in the end, we are satisfied with our decision. Many might argue, why Alcazar, it's not selling in numbers, you don\u2019t need a turbo engine, etc. My only answer to everyone would be - it suited our needs and gave us the best value for our money. Buying it was an aspirational decision and we desired to have something which has everything we wanted.\n\n\n\nI will keep the car stock and will not do any modifications to it except installing a dual channel dashcam (will post a review when done and tested extensively). I will now enjoy driving the Alcazar with my family and have a total peace of mind with respect to the reliability and ownership experience. On this note I'm ending it here and will update the thread as and when I do trips or get regular maintenance done. I have been a fan of cars, as most boys are, and have been following Team-Bhp for many years. My association with cars started when my father purchased Alto in 2008. I learnt to drive as we were expecting our first baby and took my father\u2019s car to take my wife for shopping, groceries, etc. Alto was a no nonsense super trusted car which was easy on the pocket. Our whole family travelled a lot in it.In 2016, I decided to purchase a car of my own and was looking for a comfortable 5 seater with a budget of Rs 10-11 lakhs. I looked at Creta, Honda City, TUV300, Scorpio because all these were falling in my budget. And this time I wanted a diesel as diesel was cheaper than petrol and since I was getting it within my budget, why not.One day, my BIL asked me to check the Duster and we went to Renault\u2019s showroom to check it out. The car was big and very comfortable. Asked for TD and they arranged it at home. 4 people (Father, Mother, Wife and my 6 year old daughter) sat in the back seat and I was in the driver's seat with a sales guy as my co-passenger. Initially, I drove like I was driving my Alto, very cautiously, not to hit the underbelly, but then the sales guy said, you are driving an SUV, drive like one. And then I drove it over potholes, at speed and the handling blew my mind. I asked my family and they all said,. That sealed the deal.Welcome Big Bear, White Renault Duster RXL Diesel 85PS on 27th July 2016 and everyone loved it. My office was not so far and that\u2019s why my running was not too much but I enjoyed every day driving it. Took it to Haridwar, Rishikesh, Mendipur Balaji, Lansdowne, Mussoorie, Gwalior, Lucknow, Ayodhya and many other places and it is always such a comfortable journey.I always made sure that all the preventive maintenance services of both Alto and Duster were done only at authorised service centers religiously.Fast forward to 2024. As Big Bear completed 8 years in July, the itch to replace it started as the infamous NGT rule of 10 years was looming large on me. Also, the GRAP 4 rule in winters prompted me to start the search mid year as I knew it would take time. I was in the market with below conditions:With a budget of around 20 lakhs looking at all the possible C2 and D1 segment SUVs, I prepared a detailed comparison sheet including dimensions, features, mileage, cost of ownership, pros and cons of each. My baseline in driving dynamics was Duster and we had a strict guideline to buy something which should better Duster in most of the aspects. Below are the alternatives considered. Please consider these as my personal views with no intention to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings. The cars listed are in no particular order and do not represent any preference.I wanted reliability, features, safety and great after sales service and my wife wanted my peace of mind plus an uplift from mundane interiors of Duster. After weighing in all our must-haves, we settled on Alcazar. I was considering the Executive (base) variant as it was fitting my budget. The only downside was I had to retrofit the infotainment system and speakers, either from Karol Bagh or from the dealership. I watched numerous Karol Bagh videos of base variant Creta being stripped and fitment done. Watching these videos was such a pain for both me and my wife. We both want our car to be perfect and do not want any aftermarket fitment. So, I had a relook at the variants and I found the Prestige variant which had everything we were looking after, without anyone touching anything. Sales Agent Deepak was very courteous and helpful. He made sure that whether it's Creta or Alcazar, we take the correct decision. He offered me multiple drives of Creta and Alcazar and made sure that I am satisfied completely. I have not seen sales agents going extra lengths and helping customers. In my 6 months search, I interacted with almost 8-10 sales agents and none of them can match Deepak\u2019s help and support. We negotiated hard and could get the Insurance almost matched. Spoke to VP Sales even to get an extra 5K discount. It was a tough bargain considering it was a recent facelift. Below are the final details of the car:As the White color was not in stock, so booking was made and the car was dispatched on 5th Dec from Chennai with a tentative arrival date of 15th Dec. Deepak gave me the VIN number and screenshots of the DMS system to track my car on regular intervals. However, to our surprise, the car arrived at the dealer's yard on 12th Dec and we planned to take delivery on 15th Dec. However, my wife\u2019s grandfather passed away on 13th Dec and we had to defer everything till the rituals were done. Finally, we decided on the 22nd Dec delivery date. On Friday, 20th Dec, asked Deepak that I wanted to do PDI in their stockyard and he gave me the location and connected me with the person responsible. Their stockyard is at Multi-level basement parking of Botanical Garden Metro Station, Noida. Reached there at 1pm and the person there took the car out in the sun and assisted me in checking everything. With My Team-Bhp PDI checklist with me plus my past experience, I was able to complete it in 1 hour. The odometer had 21 Kms which was ok with me. Gave a green signal to dealership and on 21st Dec paid balance amount of 4.5 lakhs plus Rs 21,239 for extended warranty. Also, asked bank officials to release the loan amount so that tax invoice and other formalities can be done. As 21st Dec was Saturday, Deepak and I completed all the formalities of signing of documents, demo, RTO invoice, Tax invoice, Fastag, etc. I wanted 22nd Dec to be free so that my family can enjoy the Car Delivery moment.Asked Deepak to get the Hyundai Alcazar seat covers installed which I confirmed to him last night. As I wanted the fitting to be done in front of me, I reached the dealership at 10:30am. Got the fitting done and was happy with the helpful nature of the people. They made sure work is perfect. In the meantime, Deepak handed over all the receipts to me, got the Bluelink activated. I was also coordinating with my wife and sister about their arrival at the showroom. They reached around 1:30pm and everything was ready by then. Car was thoroughly cleaned, parked in the delivery bay. Deepak was making sure that everything was perfect and it was indeed perfect. We exchanged pleasantries. We gifted Deepak a Ganesha idol and sweet box. He was overwhelmed with the gesture. Clicked lots of pictures as memories and departed by 2:30pm. Went straight to the nearby Indian Oil Petrol pump and got 5 litres petrol free. Also, got the full tank done. It was after so many years that I had to ask the attendant to fill petrolBefore Delivery Day at the dealershipGood Morning. Waiting patiently for seat covers fitment.Seat covers being fit. Don't want fabric seats to get soiled.Cleaning and decoration done, waiting to be parked in delivery bayLook at the smiles on everybody's faceGifting Ganeshaji to Deepak for the good luckI am hungryMandatory Pooja.

Hyundai why spoil the partyPetal shaped alloys. They are direct pick from last gen AlcazarQuad White LED headlamp setup is decent for night driving. Yet to test in foggy conditions1.5 litre turbo petrol is butter smooth and Hyundai has done a fabulous job. Clutch is very light and smooth and the gears are slick. The gears have short throws. Putting it in reverse gear is different for me and I am always fearful that I should slot correctly. Upshifting from 1st to 2nd to 3rd is tricky as I am getting used to the new gear lever. Downshifting is easy however, absence of downshifter on screen does put a bit of strain and dropping gear from 6th to 4th or 3rd is something I need to learn. So, it's a mental thing which I am pretty sure I will get used to in a few days.In the city, driving is easy and comfortable. However, I have felt that as speed comes in single digits and revs hover around 900-1000 rpm, the car gives jerks when picked in 2nd gear, so I have to drop to 1st gear to keep revs in check. Even though I have never stalled the car, it gives me a feeling and I have to press the accelerator pedal a bit more to keep moving. Turbo lag is thus very evident in 2nd gear.On highways, the engine comes to full glory. It can touch speeds of 80+ km/hr in a short while in 3 gear and one has to quickly upshift to 6th gear to keep the revs under 2000 rpm. In 6th gear at speeds of 90 km/hr, revs settle at 1900 rpm and the engine keeps chugging smoothly. It is very easy to pick the car back from speeds of 50 to 90 km/hr and 1100 to 1900 rpm in 6th gear without any fuss. No drama, whatsoever.There is so much power available for pulling loads and overtakes and I never felt uncomfortable and different than driving my Duster. I am very confident that being a turbo engine, the car has enough power to pull a full load on hills without any hesitation. Only a visit to Mussoorie or Nainital will confirm it.Right now, the car speedo hovers at 450 kms out of which 360 kms are highway, 43 kms are before taking delivery of the car and rest in the city.In the city, I am getting a mileage of around 11 kmpl with 100% AC on Auto.Also, I went 180 kms each way to my hometown. While going I was alone with just one bag. While returning, it was a boot full with the 3rd row down and my father by my side. While going, I got an average of 18.8 kmpl and while returning got 16.5 kmpl. These figures are when I was driving with AC on Auto for the whole journey and doing 80-90 speeds. Occasionally, I did use Cruise Control at 85 or 90 speeds which definitely helped in better mileage.I believe these are decent numbers as of now, considering the car is still in breakin period and I am sure the numbers will go up after 1st service.I have driven many cars like I said and watched countless videos and can say that Duster is on top of my list when it comes to driving, handling and suspension. Now, after driving Alcazar, I can say that it matches the Duster very closely in all three aspects. Being Hyundai, NVH levels are so good that it's hard to hear anything from outside. Due to great insulation, both wind and road noise are cut-off.Steering feels one size smaller compared to Duster\u2019s but gives great feedback. Being EPS, at slow speeds, steering is light enough to assist in tight situations and parking is also very easy. On highway speeds, it gets enough weight to bring confidence but it\u2019s not on-par with Duster\u2019s steering weight at highway speeds. The Duster's steering is heavier and gives more confidence.Car swallows bumps and potholes easily at slow speeds and does not unsettle but I could feel rumble strips on my pedals. Also, I have noticed that if I have to change gear while going on white rumble strips, I find difficulty in slotting gears and the gear change is not smooth. So, I wait for some more seconds and then change them. Turning radius is a bit large compared to the Duster and I have to do 3 point turns unlike in my Duster but due to light steering, it becomes very easy to take u-turns.The car is stocked with 215/60 R17 JK Lux tyres and I believe they are doing a very good job.

            "content": "BHPian WillyWonka recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nHello everyone, here is my experience of buying Honda Amaze and ownership review after 6 months.\n\nBackground:\n\nI'm a bike person (was a proud owner of Yamaha RX135 ), was never much into cars. Used public transport extensively even for daily commutes of 20+kms in Pune (unbelievable, right?) for many years. Was someone who would justify using Ola/Uber over owning a car. But COVID and the way OLA/Uber operates now (series of very bad experiences) changed my mind.\n\nInitially I kept my budget limited to 5L since, for me car is a necessity / convenience rather than a luxury. WagonR was my first choice. But as I started learning about cars through Team-BHP (major contribution), YouTube videos etc. realized the shortcomings of entry segment cars (nothing wrong with them; they are good cars for their segment / price points). So, I moved to next segment - Tiago to Altroz to Nexon and couple of more to finally settle down with Amaze.\n\nSelection criteria:\n\nI wanted a family car (3 adults, 2 kids) which is convenient for sr citizen as well. A car which would be used mostly over weekends for visits to nearby places in radius of 50-100 kms. So, the selection was based on following parameters:\n\nReliability - want to keep the car for minimum 10 years\n\nSafety\n\nRear Seat comfort, big boot\n\nCar with smooth and calm engine for sedate driving\n\nLow maintenance\n\nChoices:\n\nTata Cars - Tiago, Altroz, Nexon were good on Safety but have reliability, engine and boot space issues. In fact, at one point, I decided to go for Nexon but then it's next edition came and I found it too overpriced.\n\nNever liked Punch as it feels cramped from inside.\n\nMaruti - considered Brezza and Ertiga but the variant I liked were beyond my budget.\n\nKia and Hyundai - Didn't gave much consideration due to safety concerns\n\nMahindra - XUV300 - issues with rear seat comfort, comparatively smaller boot\n\nHonda - though I was not a car person but always liked Honda city which unfortunately was out of my budget. So settled for Honda Amaze VX CVT.\n\nChose CVT as wifey would also drive and for her automatic is a more comfortable choice over manual. Amaze, ticked almost all boxes - a smooth, comparatively silent and reliable engine, haven't heard many horror stories with regards to servicing, has overall good rear seat comfort, spacious boot and a 4* safety. It doesn't have lot's of features which many new cars offer but I don't really feel need of those fancy features. Not a fan of sunroof. The only grouse I've about Honda amaze is the average audio a system and lack of navigation feature (they removed it). I can live with wired Android auto.\n\nBudget Rs 11.15L (on road) in Maharashtra\n\nVisits and experience with Honda:\n\nIn Feb-2024 - Visited the Arya Honda showroom in Nagpur. It's the only option we've in the city. I was immediately attended by Mr. Neeraj. The experience was really good from day1. He explained everything in detail, answered all the queries properly. I saw few demo cars. Overall, it was a good experience. I came back with a quotation.\n\nIn the same month visited Maruti and TATA showrooms as well.\n\nFirst week of Mar-2024 - Deliberated over available options and made up my mind to buy Honda Amaze. The Honda guys didn't offer me any discounts (other than what was given by Honda - corporate ~20k and cash ~3k) though; not even a car perfume\n\nTook wifey along with me the next weekend to choose the car color. The dealership asked for couple of thousands more for silver color. I'm not sure if Honda charges extra for a particular color. But we wanted Grey so didn't fuss much over it. I had an option of buy insurance from outside. Took online quotations with me. Dealership agreed to match it (1-2k extra); I went with them. We asked for delivery to be done on the day of GudiPadwa (Marathi new year) which was a month away from that day; they agreed.\n\nGot a call from dealership in 2 weeks informing about arrival of car. Visited the showroom and completed PDI. Found everything ok.\n\nDelivery: Since it was day of GudiPadwa - the showroom was short on staff and had many deliveries. We were given time of 11am. Reached there on time but had to wait for an hour to get the delivery. We were given a box of sweets and a plant as gift\n\nExperience:\n\nInitial few weeks went without much of driving. Our first long trip was 600km return journey with a driver. Experience was nice except for few occasions where car almost bottomed out in potholes. we were three adults on rear seat and suspensions felt a little uncomfortable. The average we got was 13.5kmpl. By the time I was back from trip it was time for first servicing. I raised both the points (average and suspension) to service station guy. He assured that problems will be gone after 2nd servicing.\n\nAfter first servicing, me and wifey started taking the car out in the mornings and over the weekends. It felt very smooth and comfortable within city. The steering feels heavy in slow speeds but gets light as the speed increases.\n\nMade few short trips of around 100km journey to villages and jungle with not so good roads. And there is a noticeable difference in rear seat comfort now than what it used to be before 1st service. My mother liked the way car drives and the comfort she feels in the rear seat. Only issue with rear seat is - it's not for 3 adults. It'll be a little cramped with three adults on long journeys.\n\nWe recently finished our (Nagpur-Shegaon) 750 km long journey out of which majority was on the expressway. Around 100 km journey happened on narrow internal roads. The expressway part was awesome. Maintained speed between 80-90kmph. Touched 100 rarely. It was a very planted drive till 90. Beyond that I couldn't feel confident.\n\nIn Vx model Honda give LED lights. Throw of light is adequate. I tested them at night in ghats of a wildlife sanctuary and didn't face any issues at all.\n\nServicing:\n\nI've done initial 2 free services so far. Got free pick-up and drop both the times.\n\nI was at the servicing station for 2nd servicing. The attendants were prompt - explained things properly. Took 2-3 hours to finish the job.\n\nMileage: Initially I used to get 13 - 14 kmpl for city/highway/mixed drive. After second servicing it increased to 17-18 kmpl. In my recent trip I could get upto 21 kmpl. (all numbers are taken from MID)\n\nThings need improvement:\n\nAudio system\n\nBoot and car doors feel light.\n\nPaint quality can be improved\n\nFollowing features are bare minimum at this price range which should be added:\n\nRear adjustable headrests\n\nRear AC vents\n\nAuto dimming rearview mirrors\n\nCruise control (it's not there in automatic but available in manual)\n\nHonda should add Navigation (maps) and please remove the 'Web Links' feature (it's one of the worst connectivity options / features I've come across in the industry)\n\nUnder body protection for engine\n\nTo summarize, it has been a good experience so far:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

The study reveals that Subaru has overtaken the Japanese car giant and now holds the top spot on the list.\n\nConsumer Reports base their study on data collected from over 3,00,000 automobiles sold between 2000 to 2025. The overall reliability score is an average of several individual criteria such as owner satisfaction, safety rating, expected reliability & road test results. The study also only considers car brands that offer \"sufficient data\" for at least two of their current models.\n\nSubaru received the highest reliability score of 68/100, just passing Lexus & Toyota in 2nd and 3rd positions, respectively. Lexus had an average score of 65/100 while Toyota scored 62/100.\n\nThe study states that the reason Subaru managed to outscore Toyota & Lexus is the sharing of components across their model range. Steven Elek, who oversees Auto Data Analytics at Consumer Reports, stated, \"Subaru\u2019s cars share many reliable components. This commonality means that when Subaru redesigns a vehicle, it can make fewer incremental changes by carrying over dependable systems. This reduces the risk of new problems.\"\n\nConsumer Reports also stated that this year's study had the highest number of hybrids and electric vehicles than ever before. The study stated, \"This year\u2019s survey results have more data on hybrids and electric vehicles than ever before, revealing how newer technology\u2019s teething pains start to dissipate after two or three years. These findings reinforce why it\u2019s best to wait a couple of years before buying an all-new model.\"\n\nComing back to the list, Honda & Acura complete the top-5 most reliable car brands list, scoring 59/100 and 55/100, respectively. Other brands in the top 10 include Mazda, Audi, BMW, Kia & Hyundai.\n\nSource: Consumer Reports",

As I mentioned at the top, investors clearly had a preference for the big four banks in 2024 and bid them up to record highs.\n\nWeaker commodity prices, concerns over Chinese economic growth, cost inflation in the mining sector, and the failed takeover of Anglo American (LSE: AAL) also weighed on sentiment.\n\nWill things be better in 2025?\n\nGoldman Sachs is likely to see 2024's weakness as a buying opportunity for investors in 2025.\n\nA recent note reveals that its analysts have a buy rating and $47.40 price target on BHP's shares. This implies potential upside of 19% for investors from current levels.\n\nIt also expects a fully franked dividend of approximately $1.58 per share in FY 2025. Based on the current BHP share price of $39.81, this equates to a dividend yield of approximately 4%.\n\nThis boosts the total potential 12-month return on offer with the miner's shares to approximately 23%.\n\nCommenting on its buy recommendation, the broker said:",

It is mated with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed CVT.\n\nSource: Rushlane",

            "content": "BHPian amyntor recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nIt's been an eventful past couple of weeks.\n\nBoth the Duke and myself were eager to get back on the road after a one month hiatus. So, as soon as I got the rim replaced I planned for a 3 day trip to the eastern ghats.\n\nAndhra Pradesh -> Odisha -> Chattisgarh -> Andhra Pradesh\n\nThis is an often overlooked region when it comes to tourism or road trips but every kilometre of this stretch is decorated with lush green landscapes, jungles and waterfalls waiting to be discovered and explored.\n\nSome pics from the trip:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA feline friend that took a liking to me.\n\n\n\nSunrise at Deomali, Odisha\n\n\n\n\n\nChitrakote waterfalls in Chattisgarh. This is a horseshoe waterfall and often called the \"Niagara Falls of India\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days after I got back home, I was involved in an unfortunate crash. I was doing about 50-60 kmph on a four lane road and suddenly a guy on a old Pulsar crossed into my lane from an intersection without even looking for oncoming traffic and then braked suddenly after he saw me. I had no time to react or dodge him by steering to the left. So, I did the best thing I thought I could do in that instance. Braked as hard as I could to drop my speed and hit his front tire. He fell to this other side and I crashed side ways. I wore my boots and riding gloves like I always do and got out scratchless. The Duke did great too. Left leg guard took the brunt of the impact. The clutch lever and the gear lever got scraped a bit. And surprisingly, not a scratch on the handlebar.\n\nNormally, I would call it a sad reality of the Indian roads and move on but this guy insisted that it was my fault that I couldn't brake and caused the accident. I was particularly cranky that morning as my body hadn't had its fill of caffeine. So, what started as a quick ride to buy some grounded coffee powder turned into a two hour argument with some eager bystanders joining in. After our patience ran out and everyone had to go to work, the other party accepted their mistake, I paid to get the Pulsar's bent handle fixed, we shook hands and left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a different note, I ordered a BMC Air Filter and it arrived yesterday to my doorstep. I installed it last night, ran the engine in idle for five minutes and went for a 30 kilometre ride today.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. The low-end feels much smoother\n\n2. The jerky/snatchy feel from the first two gears also seems to be gone\n\nThe Duke is able to breath freely. I'm not sure if the difference is amplified because the old filter got super dirty and is at the end of its life, but I'll take it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it for this post.\n\nOh and how could I forget this stat. The bike turned one year and the current odometre reading is: 27607 kilometres\n\nRead BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Learn More\n\nASX-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a great tool for Aussies to utilise for international diversification beyond ASX shares. Another benefit is the income that ETFs can provide.\n\nSome of the ASX's biggest companies are known as ASX dividend shares, including BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), and ANZ Group Holdings Ltd (ASX: ANZ).\n\nHowever, a strong rally of ASX bank shares in 2024 has lowered the overall dividend yield. At the end of November 2024, the dividend yield of the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) \u2014 a fund that tracks the S&P/ASX 300 Index (ASX: XKO) \u2014 was 3.4%.\n\nThere are other share markets out there that can also be good income options. Let's look at two geographic-based ASX ETFs that offer comparable and pleasing dividend income.\n\nBetashares FTSE 100 ETF (ASX: F100)\n\nThe purpose of this ASX ETF is to provide exposure to a portfolio of 100 blue-chip companies on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nI'd describe a good number of these businesses as global companies, such as Astrazeneca, Shell, HSBC, Unilever, Relx, BP, British American Tobacco and Diageo. While they are listed in London, they generate earnings from across the world.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the F100 ETF is that it trades on a pleasingly low price/earnings (P/E) ratio, enabling a good dividend yield. According to BetaShares, the F100 ETF had a forward P/E ratio of 11.5x at the end of November 2024, compared to 21.8x for the VAS ETF.\n\nAccording to BetaShares, the 12-month distribution yield from the F100 ETF was 3.5% at the end of November 2024.\n\nBetashares India Quality ETF (ASX: IIND)\n\nI believe getting exposure to the Indian economy could be a smart move for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Australian Treasury projects that the Indian economy will see an average annual growth rate of 6% over the next two decades thanks to improving productivity.\n\nNot every Indian business is going to be high-quality, just like on the ASX or any other share market. So, this fund is focused on owning just the high-quality Indian companies.\n\nCompanies must rank well on three factors to make it into the portfolio: high profitability, low leverage, and high earnings stability. When you put those factors together, it's not surprising to me that the IIND ETF has returned an average of 10.1% per year since August 2019 \u2013 a solid return.\n\nAccording to BetaShares, this fund's forward P/E ratio was 24x as of 29 November 2024, reflecting the expected growth potential of holdings like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Hindustan Unilever.\n\nDespite the higher earnings valuation, this ASX ETF still offered a 12-month distribution yield of 3.4% at 29 November 2024.",

Loved the drive.\n\nThe cabin is silent, road noise is minimal. Experienced ADAS for the first time and it worked as expected on well marked lanes. ADAS can also be helpful in stop-n-go traffic. ADAS can come to a complete stop and resume driving from a standstill once I confirm with a button press on the steering wheel. The visibility from the driver seat is great all-around. The 360 degree camera resolution is not the best, but should be manageable I guess. The ventilated seats made little to no difference. It should be more powerful, or maybe just this TD vehicle has a issue with its ventilated seats. The car lacks Wireless Android Auto. Not sure if this is a hardware limitation or software one. Could not find this same infotainment in any other Toyota. I would love to have ambient lighting all around the cabin on the door panels. This would have helped the car feel more premium inside the cabin.\n\nThe SA was great. Just the fact that Madhuban Toyota is not ready to negotiate on the Hycross. The SA said that we cannot choose selective accessories nor I can ask them to remove the acccessories Kit and TGloss from the quotation. Also, they are ready to take the booking amount and the down payment as well on a CC without any extra charges. I might just go ahead and pay the 50K booking amount.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Brand new Bilstein B6 set for front\n\nThe previous B6 bought from Pete's had gotten harder and eventually lost their gas in June. Since then, the B4s have been doing their duty which has been great. The main difference/advantage that B6 offers is the super-quick rebound action which means the car doesn't sway side to side at all. This would be felt like a 'harsh' ride or lateral jerk due to such a high rebound rate. The feel is very subjective and to me, once bitten nothing else would do The new B6s are 55mm since I have an upgraded brake set-up. The rear B6 set has been doing fine since 2018.\n\n2. Brand new Michelin Pilot Sport 5\n\nLast time when I upgraded the wheels to 18 incher Lensos, I had to make do with the Bridgestone Potenza in 245 45 R18 as I always wanted Michelins which weren't available in any of the sizes I wanted. The Primacy 4 on my previous 17 inchers were superb in terms of ride comfort, braking etc. I needed a 50 or 55 profile but with 18 inchers, there isn't enough space in the front wheel well. Got some trimming done (at Grid7 who were kind enough to spare a person and equipment for 3 hours for the job with me) in the front wheel well and tried out the following:\n\nPirelli 235 55 R18 (rubbed on even slight turning)- rejected\n\nMichelin Primacy 245 50 R18 (rubbed too)- rejected\n\nMichelin Primacy 235 50 R18 (very faint touch on full turn)- rejected\n\nMichelin Pilot Sport 5 225 50 ZR18 - this had to be the tyre to be driven on the new B6s and the driver in me has no real complaints though\n\nThe Yeti feels faster, and my goodness, the combination PS5 + B6 is unmatched.\n\n3. Full suspension refit\n\nAt Lotus Automobile in Kochi (my trusted FNG). On complete dismantling, they found none of the bushed and rods needed replacement. The Yeti OE parts are robust as the existing ones are better than the aftermarket alternatives and hence decided to put them all back. Nothing replaced at all. These guys know what they do and I trust them completely.\n\n4. Graphene annual service @Grid7\n\nAlso did some detailing on the panel around the fog lights. Got the blackening done to the fog light assembly too. Looks even better now.\n\n5. OBDeleven\n\nIt has arrived and I know how important it is to have one in-house with a stage -3 Skoda in hand. Installed the app and basic scan et all is quite easy.\n\nHaven't done any long trips yet! Will be back in 2 weeks and will look to do a few then.

            "content": "BHPian SidharthaN recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nIts been close to a month of me owning the 2024 Swift VXI AGS. Lack of time to pen down an ownership report, here are some observations post an ownership month.\n\nSince its a new car I read through a lot of posts, discussions, debates on Swift vs Tata Punch vs Hyundai Exter vs Baleno vs Fronx. My first car was a Hyundai I10 Magna 1.2 which was driven for 7 years and 75000 kms. My second car was a Tata Zest 1.3 Quadrajet Diesel which was driven for 8 years and 1.30,000 kms, and with the Swift have clocked close to 2000 kms on the odo. With all the criticism thrown at the Swift I still consider its a good buy, not because I am an owner now, but because of factors like drive feel, features, handling dynamics, nature of the engine, etc.\n\nI think the 3 cylinder engine has been criticized the most. Whether one is driving within city limits or majority of highways, expressways, most have a fixed speed limit of 100 kmph. There are folks who do not heed the same and probably have higher cruising speeds. But curbs have become smarter now. The speed detectors send a challan when you zoom past by even 5 kmph, I paid a total pending challan amount of 10000 when I exchanged my car, all for overspeeding. So let us consider the max speed will be 100 kmph on highways and 20-80 kmph in cities. Across this range the 1.2 Z series is completely at pace with oodles of torque and driveability. The engine feels peppy and smooth even considering I own the AMT, where head nods, lag is minimal as per competition. I had taken test drive of AMT versions of Triber, Kiger, Grand I10 Nios. Renault felts even sluggish, Hyundai felt boring, whereas the Swift feels lively and eager to move. The creep function is better with the Hill hold functional. There are hardly any noise/vibes felt in the cabin, unless someone is nitpicky. Suspension is new and tuned a bit stiff to ease out the undulations. The steering feedback is light, and the car is eager to change direction with minimal input. I have never been a Maruti/Tata/Hyundai fanboy but have spent enough time driving vehicles from them. Frankly Tata does not have anything exciting in their stable barring the 1.5 Diesel and upwards. Hyundai has turbo engines on offer at compromises of mileage.\n\n\"Kitna deti hai\" adage is something a lot have moved ahead of considering rising disposable incomes. But for a common middle class person like me a mileage of 24 kmpl extracted from a 2000 kms run Swift is more than what I would want, coming from a 1.3 MJD and used to Diesel mileage figures. Generally majority of one's time spent behind the wheel is in bumper to bumper traffic, or densely populated highways. Where in gods name will you enjoy the thrill of power from the engine considering the highway speeds are capped to 100 kmph. Aspirational features, sun roof, etc are good but on the road 100% concentration is trying to save yourself from the mayhem offered and to reach the destination in one piece. If half of my life behind the wheels is spent dealing with these conditions, I might save money on fuel costs to invest in my family's future.\n\nThe SUV look alike craze, I still do not get it. GC is sometimes a myth. Drive in Himachal and an Alto will blow all misconceptions to smithereens. I have driven extensively pan India and have no two thoughts about how the highways throw a mix at you, but do you actually need a 15 lakhs car when a 8 lakh car can do the same job. Yes comfort might be better, but not by gigantic standards. The Pseudo SUV segment provides seating space equivalent to 5 seaters with blown out body proportions, body roll in some cases, and probably better visibility but at an exorbitant price tag. Kiger AMT and Nissan Magnite AMT are selling at the correct price point contrary to Venue, Nexon, Brezza. Also footprint is equivalent to a hatchback.\n\nA low slung traditional hatchback offers a drive experience which is unmatched. My experience stems from driving Polo GTI, Punto Abarth, 2 generations of Swift's, Altroz Diesel, and Hyundai I20 N-Line. I never experienced the same fun in bigger traditional SUV's or even the sub 4 meter sedans. The traditional sedans are almost passe now. Gone are the days when you could push the pedals of a low slung remapped Civic and listen to the aural pleasure of the engine thrum.\n\nAlso matter of fact a consumer with a less than 10 lakhs budget is forced to look at the CSUV segment, there are not many choices available apart from them. Hence in the entire context if someone is looking for a family car, with sporty looking exteriors, and interiors, and is mileage conscious Swift can be definitely considered. The AMT is actually good in contrast to the entire criticism throw at it.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Car is little over 7 months old and did not realize how this car munched 10k kms so quickly. I did a few highway drives and has been family favorite for short drives to town.\n\nGave it for service at Bharath motors. I asked them to do what is mentioned by Suzuki, which includes oil change, filters etc. Bill came to around 2.2K .\n\nIssues noticed:\n\nCrackling roof when driving on a sunny day.\n\nRear parking sensor conked off, replaced under warranty.\n\nOther observations:\n\nWith other powerful cars in garage, I expected the engine to be a downer initially. But now with 10K, find it pretty good. Yes it does not have the punch for a quick overtake, yet is pretty comfortable to drive all day at 100-110. The engine feels quite refined now like other Suzuki's and redlining 1.5 NA is quite fun.\n\nThe MT gearbox is fantastic. My other MT is the Hilux. While the shifts of Hilux are much better, the one in Jimny is decent and has short throws. The clutch is much lighter too. Above all this, the Jimny needs minimal gear changes. Car doesnot stall at 30-35KM/Hr in 5th Gear. Car takes ghat roads like Sampaje in 3rd gear without much fuss. The Hilux in comparison, needs more shift.\n\nI have been driving different cars over dreaded Shiradi ghat over last 20+ years. This handles the bad road the best. Even the Endeavour does not come close. Slot into 3rd gear and Jimny flies off on these bad stretch. On the flipside come 4 lane, the soft suspension feels a bit underwhelming especially when the surface is uneven.\n\nAfter driving through slush, at times, there is a noise as if the muck is rubbing against the brake rotor, the noise goes away after driving on tarmac for few hundred meters.\n\nIn City car happily potters around in 3rd gear. Even road humps can be easily taken in 3rd gear. Compact dimension is a boon. For shopping, quick visit to farm this is perfect.\n\nPaint quality is strictly average. Already has scratches and Nexa blue is difficult to keep clean.\n\nFuel efficiency is good , have to see if there any improvement post oil change. So far get 10-12KMPL in city/town and 15-16 on highways.\n\nLarge turning radius is annoying. Sometimes people watch in amusement, such a compact car but why am I taking multiple attempts to make a simple u turn!\n\nWhile the car does not have the road presence, still catches quite a few eyeballs. Boxy design, compact dimension, low seller means not so many on roads.\n\nFind the Jimny:\n\nWider set of tires will make it look even better:\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Got the grips from Lanesplit, seamless experience as always.\n\nThe bike had gotten dirty last weeks weekend ride, I have not posted anything about it because I am waiting on someone else to post some long overdue update in their thread they have forgotten that they have.\n\nSo dropped the bike off for washing and chain maintenance (I gotta get a paddock here for my flat ) and tossed in the domino grips too for a quick install.\n\nHere are the results\n\nThe initial impression is that the grips are definitely thinner than OEM grips, the first few meters of usage itself you feel that you feel more of whats happening on the road, less damping rubber material means more feedback, which also means it will bring in more vibration as well, it'll be interesting to see how I gauge the difference over a longer ride.\n\nWhile I had the option of getting the A450 which was recommended by a friend who has used both the A010 and the A450 extensively I decided to try the A010 post trying it out on the Daytona, I just loved the feel and grip it provides, while the A010 is known to wear out much faster which is not a surprise because of how soft and thin the grip is, next, I'll be getting the A450 instead.\n\nCheers\n\nKrishna\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Put 2 cable ties to the existing harness (sorry I did not take this photo) and routed the cable under the main carpet and to the side of the centre console gap. So the wiring looks neat.\n\nI formatted the SD-Card using the application SD Memory Card Formatter for Windows/Mac provided by the SD Card Association as my SD-Card got corrupted according to the dashcam few hours after the installation. The dashcam will also ask for format using the ZenVue app. The videos are stored in separate folders normal recording, emergency recording and parking recording. I also updated the firmware of the dashcam as the old firmware could be the reason for the SD-Card corruption. Now used this dashcam for few days and no SD-Card corruption.\n\nThe dashcam lady will speak in case of the following:\n\nFormat the SD-Card\n\nSD-Card corrupted\n\nStart recording\n\nStop recording\n\nEmergency recording (even when going on the rumble strips)\n\nMy request to all car manufacturers is to provide a USB Type-A power source of 5V 1.5A near the rear view mirror with a auto timer of 1 to 2 hours and auto set battery voltage cut-off so that we can use any dashcam of our choice and will be able to use the parking mode also.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Learn More\n\nWhile ASX large-cap shares dominated the top 10 most popular stocks of 2024, a young defence company in the industrials sector was the favourite investment of the year.\n\nAccording to data from the online trading platform Stake, DroneShield Ltd (ASX: DRO) was the most bought ASX share of the year among its users.\n\nDroneshield develops and sells hardware and software that detects enemy drones.\n\nThe Droneshield share price rose from a closing value of 37 cents on 29 December 2023 (the last day of trading for the year) to 76.5 cents on 31 December 2024.\n\nThe data is based on overall trading volumes from 1 January to 23 December 2024 and excludes exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nSamy Sriram, a market analyst at Stake, has provided her analysis of the year for each of the top 10 most bought ASX shares below.\n\n10 ASX shares that investors bought most in 2024\n\nThe most bought ASX shares in order of popularity among Stake customers are listed below.\n\nDroneShield Ltd (ASX: DRO)\n\nAmid a tumultuous year for the Droneshield share price, the company attracted the highest trading volume among Stake platform investors in 2024.\n\nThe stock rallied strongly to a record high of $2.72 in July, then fell 75% as short positions increased.\n\nHowever, the business made gains throughout the year, as Sriram notes:\n\nGrowing demand from governments for DroneShield's AI-powered tech drove revenue growth; several US government contracts were awarded in 2024. The firm said in October it had a $42 million contracted backlog of work and a $1.1 billion sales pipeline. Two capital raisings in 2024 secured $235 million to fund research and build inventories \u2026\n\nThe ASX industrial share rose by 106.75% in 2024.\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)\n\nThe BHP share price fell 21.54% in 2024 as lower demand for iron ore from China weakened commodity prices. BHP shares closed at $39.55 apiece yesterday.\n\nSriram says BHP continued to pursue its copper ambitions in 2024, joining Lundin Mining Corp to successfully acquire Filo Mining, which has copper assets in South America.\n\nBHP also made several offers to buy Anglo American plc, which were rebuffed.\n\nThe company suspended operations at its Nickel West mine in Western Australia due to weak nickel prices. This decision will be reviewed in 2027.\n\nSriram says:\n\nThe miner is targeting FY25 iron ore production of 282 million to 294 million tonnes which could signal potential revenue growth, dependent on iron ore prices and global demand.\n\nFortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG)\n\nThe Fortescue share price also fell in 2024 due to weaker iron ore prices. The ASX mining share closed at $18.25 apiece yesterday, down 37.1% for the year.\n\nThroughout the year, several changes were made in upper management personnel. Fortescue also scaled back its hydrogen ambitions and cut 700 jobs.\n\nSriram says Fortescue is targeting FY25 iron ore production of 190 million to 200 million tonnes at a cost of US$18.50 to US$19.75 a tonne.\n\nPilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS)\n\nThis ASX lithium share was one of the most shorted stocks of 2024, as lithium prices remained weak in an oversupplied market.\n\nThe Pilbara Minerals share price closed out the year at $2.19 apiece, down 44.6%.\n\nAccording to Sriram:\n\nDespite weak lithium prices, the company commenced a feasibility study on its P2000 project. The pre-feasibility study, released in June, showed its Pilgangoora operations could be expanded to 2 million tonnes a year. Pilbara also made a $560 million acquisition of Latin Resources Ltd (ASX: LRS), which owns the Salinas lithium project in Brazil. The transaction is expected to be completed in February 2025.\n\nZip Co Ltd (ASX: ZIP)\n\nZip was among the comeback stories of 2024, with the share price hurtling 366.1% higher to close at $2.96 on Tuesday.\n\nA series of positive financial reports led to a resurgence of confidence in the ASX buy now, pay later share.\n\nCo-founder Larry Diamond stepped down as a director and chair of Zip's US business in December.\n\nWoodside Energy Group Ltd (ASX: WDS)\n\nThe Woodside share price fell in 2024 due to weaker LNG and oil prices amid various geopolitical tensions. On Tuesday, the ASX energy share closed at $24.60, down 20.8% for the year.\n\nSriram said 2024 was \"marked by dealmaking\" for Woodside:\n\nWoodside paid US$900 million in July to acquire Tellurian and its Driftwood LNG project on the Gulf of Mexico. It paid US$2.35 billion for the OCI Clean Ammonia project in Texas. It also sold stakes in its Scarborough project which is nearing completion: a 15.1% stake to JERA and a 10% stake to LNG Japan.\n\nAppen Ltd (ASX: APX)\n\nAppen shares rallied big-time in 2024 on the back of rising demand for generative artificial intelligence.\n\nThe data sourcing and annotation provider conducted a $65 million capital raise in late 2024 to strengthen its balance sheet and provide working capital for new AI-related work.\n\nThe company announced a return to underlying EBITDA profitability in 3Q FY24 largely due to cost-cutting. The Appen share price rose by 319% in 2024 to close at $2.64 on Tuesday.\n\nWoolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW)\n\nIt was a difficult year for the ASX 200's biggest consumer staple share, which fell 18% over the 12 months to close at $30.49 on 31 December.\n\nSriram summarises the key points:\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched legal action in the Federal Court, claiming Woolworths (and Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL)) made false claims about price discounts. New CEO Amanda Bardwell also had to front a Senate inquiry into food prices. The retailer's sales recently took a hit from industrial action at its distribution centres.\n\nMineral Resources Ltd (ASX: MIN)\n\nThe Mineral Resources share price fell to a four-year low of $29.51 in September. The ASX mining share closed out the year at $34.25 per share, down 51.1% over the 12 months.\n\nWeak iron ore and lithium prices, as well as investors' concerns about debt, contributed to the fall.\n\nSriram says:\n\nMines were placed on care and maintenance, projects were delayed and workers were let go to save costs. The sale of a stake in the Onslow Iron haul road and its energy assets to Hancock Prospecting provided cash.\n\nThe company was mired in controversy toward the end of 2024 as it investigated personal tax evasion allegations involving its founder and CEO, Chris Ellison.\n\nEllison described his actions as \"an error of judgement\" and stepped down as CEO in November. He will remain as managing director until a new one is appointed.\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA)\n\nCBA shares enjoyed a remarkable rally, which made the ASX 200 bank share one of the most expensive in the world. CBA also overtook BHP as the most valuable share on the ASX 200.\n\nThe CBA share price lifted from a closing value of $111.80 on 29 December 2023 to $153.25 on 31 December 2024. CBA stock hit a record high of $161.37 per share last month.\n\nSriram sums up the year for CBA:\n\nAustralia's largest bank added 110,000 business transaction accounts and 500,000 retail transaction accounts in FY24 \u2026",

The car still shows a 360 degree view even when the side view mirrors are folded in - which surprisingly doesn't happen in the BMW.\n\n2. Had opportunity to sit behind a few times - and honestly the ride is simply sublime! It is far more comfortable than the 6GT.\n\n3. The Burmester audio system is fantastic. Still to figure out how to pair the headphones with the rear entertainment screens though. Seems a bit complicated - but once done should be good.\n\n4. The car though huge - now seems easily manageable - maybe now I have gotten used to the size.\n\n5. The Mercedes Me app is quite good. You can lock/unlock the car without the key, you can roll up/down the windows from anywhere - and it informs you every time someone unlocks/locks the car as well.\n\n6. Inspite of the space inside - fitting 2 6 footers behind each other is not as easy as I imagined it would be.\n\nOver all - I am now learning to appreciate this car more than the initial impressions. Not such a bad buy after all\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

As India\u2019s best-selling scooter, the Activa 125 now faces off against its key competitor, the TVS Jupiter 125. While TVS has updated the Jupiter 110, we delve into whether the Jupiter 125, its flagship model, can hold its ground against the 2025 Activa 125.\n\n2025 Honda Activa 125 vs TVS Jupiter 125: Engine Specs\n\nThe 2025 Activa 125 is powered by an upgraded 123.92cc, single-cylinder engine that is now OBD2B compliant. It produces 8.3 bhp of power and 10.5 Nm of torque, mated to a CVT automatic gearbox. The scooter also comes with an idling stop system aimed at improving fuel efficiency.\n\nImage: Honda\n\nIn comparison, the TVS Jupiter 125 features a 124.8cc single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that delivers 8 bhp at 6,500 rpm and 10.5 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm. Like the Activa 125, the Jupiter 125 also uses a CVT gearbox for smooth, automatic gear shifting.\n\nSpecifications Honda Activa 125 TVS Jupiter 125 Engine 123.92 cc 124.8 cc Power 8.3 bhp 8 bhp Torque 10.5 Nm 10.5 Nm Ground Clearance 162 mm 163 mm 2025 Honda Activa 125 vs TVS Jupiter 125: Engine Specs\n\n2025 Honda Activa 125 vs TVS Jupiter 125: Features\n\nHonda has equipped the updated Activa 125 with a host of new features, making it even more tech-forward. The most notable upgrade is the introduction of a 4.2-inch TFT screen, replacing the older analogue LCD instrument cluster. This display is controlled via a joystick on the handlebar for seamless navigation. The screen offers three adjustable brightness settings and toggles between day and night modes for optimal visibility. The scooter is also equipped with connected technology through the Honda RoadSync Duo app, which allows users to access features like turn-by-turn navigation, call and SMS alerts, and music control. Additionally, the Activa 125 now features a USB Type-C charging port, a side-stand engine cut-off for added safety, and a start/stop switch for convenience.\n\nTVS Jupiter 125 (Image: TVS)\n\nThe TVS Jupiter 125, meanwhile, comes with a fully digital instrument cluster that displays key information like speed, fuel level, trip meter, and connected tech.

More about this and the 007 version later.\n\n\n\nSome information on the 2CV, stolen from various internet sources:\n\n\n\nQuote: The Citro\u00ebn 2CV (French: deux chevaux, pronounced [d\u00f8 \u0283(\u0259)vo], lit. \"two horses\", meaning \"two taxable horsepower\") is an economy car produced by the French company Citro\u00ebn from 1948 to 1990. Introduced at the 1948 Paris Salon de l'Automobile, it has an air-cooled engine that is mounted in the front and drives the front wheels.\n\n\n\nConceived by Citro\u00ebn Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise the large number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and straightforward, utilitarian bodywork. The 2CV featured overall low cost of ownership, simplicity of maintenance, an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering 6.6 kW, 9 hp), and minimal fuel consumption. In addition, it had been designed to cross a freshly ploughed field with a basket full of eggs on the passenger's seat without breaking them, because of the great lack of paved roads in France at the time; with a long-travel suspension system, that connects front and rear wheels, giving a very soft ride.\n\n\n\nOften called \"an umbrella on wheels\", the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads, and until 1955 even stretched to cover the car's trunk, reaching almost down to the car's rear bumper. Michelin introduced and first commercialised the revolutionary new radial tyre design with the introduction of the 2CV.\n\n\n\nBetween 1948 and 1990, more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, making it the world's first front-wheel drive car to become a million seller after Citro\u00ebn's own earlier model, the more upmarket Traction Avant, which had become the first front-wheel drive car to sell in similar six-figure numbers. The 2CV platform spawned many variants; the 2CV and its variants are collectively known as the A-Series. Notably these include the 2CV-based delivery vans known as fourgonnettes, the Ami, the Dyane, the Acadiane, and the Mehari. In total, Citro\u00ebn manufactured over 9 million of the 2CVs and its derivative models.\n\n\n\nA 1953 technical review in Autocar described \"the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford\". In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a \"car like no other\". The motoring writer L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as \"the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car\", and a car of \"remorseless rationality\".\n\n\n\nMany countries have their own pet name. In the Netherlands, it is eend (duck), and in Belgium geit (goat). In the UK it is known by at least three different pet names; Tin Snail, Dolly and Upside-down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs luck would have it, there is a Citroen 2CV museum in Andijk, the Netherlands. Just around the corner from my good friend and spanner mate Peter. Those of you who follow some of my threads will have read about us and our Spideristi friends doing at least one annual Alfa Spider trip together. As luck would have it, all of us happened to be around on the last Sunday of the year. This museum opens only on the last Sunday of every month. So we decided to meet up at the museum and have lunch afterwards at Peter's place.\n\n\n\nThis museum is the private collection of Edwin Groen. His collection consist of more than 300 Eenden and also quite a few other interesting mostly French cars. I have concentrated on the 2CVs for this thread.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.eendenmuseum.nl\n\n\n\nIt is really a unique collection as you will see! This is the first view as you enter the museum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are endless rows of 2CVs. Each with an unique story.

Which meant my three sisters got in the back seat and I would sit in the front on my mum's lap. No seat belts, no airbags, no crumple zone and both my parents chain smoking. My dad had a roof rack that held most of our luggage. But he had not secured it well enough. So it blew off, somewhere near Arnhem on our way to Germany. A \"wegenwacht in one of these 2CVs came to the rescue. He managed to pile some of the luggage in his car. But those little cars were pretty much crammed with tools and parts. So some of the luggage went on top of my sisters. Next he drove us to a shop that sold us a new roof rack.

But they never did well in a crash. or like this one, a tree fell onto it. Made several newspapers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe museum has a couple of these little alleys with shops from the 60-70s. Very nice. Including a nice collection of car models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure if the Citroen 2CV was ever sold in India. I doubt it somehow, as this was one of the early cheap cars for the masses in Western Europe.However, most petrol heads would be familiar with this little iconic car. To date, it still has a substantial hard core of devotees. It is also a car that brings a smile to people's faces. It is the least macho-threatening car on the road. Many Western folks of my age will have owned one or at least driven one. It has featured in many movies, the most prominent being the James Bond movie \"For Your Eyes Only.\"If you haven't seen that movie, have at least a look at the 2CV chase scene! It shows the 2CV's incredible corner handling.The 2CV used in the movie is a 2CV6 but with the engine of a Citroen GS. These cars were not known for being fast. More about this and the 007 version later.Some information on the 2CV, stolen from various internet sources:I owned a 2CV at some point. I think it was the 3rd or 4th car I ever owned. It did not last very long, as it was so rotten when braking that the doors flew open due to the flexing of the chassis! A common problem with older 2CVs.Many countries have their own pet name.

            "content": "BHP\u2019s Rashpal Bhatti has again been named in this year\u2019s edition of Lloyd\u2019s List\u2019s One Hundred People, an annual assessment of the most influential people in the global shipping industry.\n\nRashpal, who recently took on the role of Group Procurement Officer after nine years as Vice President of Maritime and Supply Chain Excellence, was ranked 50th in the top 100 list. This is up from 69th last year, and the third consecutive year he has been named in the list, in addition to 2017.\n\nIn an article highlighting Rashpal\u2019s achievements, Lloyd\u2019s List noted that he has bookmarked his tenure with the BHP Maritime team with multiple industry- and world-first decarbonisation initiatives, creating a strong leadership narrative for BHP Maritime across the industry and among our peers.\n\nOne of the most recent in this list is BHP\u2019s expression-of-interest for an ammonia value chain for the maritime industry, launched in 2023 to assess \u2013 for what we believe is the very first time in the world \u2013 the use of ammonia as a \u201clow to zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u201d[1] fuel for maritime. In line with BHP\u2019s decarbonisation targets, goals and commitments, the intent is usage of low to zero GHG emission ammonia as a marine fuel within this decade, starting with an iron ore Green Corridor[2] for our well-established iron ore trade route between Western Australia and China.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that low to zero greenhouse gas emissions ammonia will play a very significant role in the decarbonisation of the shipping industry. We have no doubt that other charterers and organisations would look to ammonia as a strong step towards net zero.\u201d Rashpal told the publication.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest dry bulk charterers, BHP moved about 300 million tonnes of iron ore, coal and copper over some 1,500 voyages in FY2024.\n\nDecarbonisation is a key pillar of the Maritime team\u2019s strategy, in line with BHP\u2019s commitment to become a more sustainable and resilient business, with a long-term Scope 3 emissions target to achieve net zero by 2050 for the GHG emissions from all shipping of BHP products[3].\n\nEarlier, in July 2024, together with our partners Pan Pacific Copper and Norsepower, we completed the retrofit installation of a rotor sail onboard the M/V Koryu, leveraging wind-assisted propulsion technology to reduce GHG emissions, when wind conditions are favourable, from maritime transportation between Chile and Japan.\n\nThis followed the world\u2019s first launch in 2022 of the first of what is now five dual-fuelled liquefied natural gas (LNG) Newcastlemax vessels within our time-chartered fleet and earlier, the first marine biofuel trial on an ocean-going vessel in Singapore in 2021.\n\n[1] Low to zero GHG emissions (for shipping) means capable of between 81 per cent to 100 per cent lower GHG emissions intensity (gCO2-e/joule) on a well-to-wake basis compared to conventional fossil fuels used in shipping. Well-to-wake means inclusive of the GHG emissions across the entire process of fuel production, delivery and use onboard vessels.\n\n[2] A Green Corridor is a specific shipping route where the economics, infrastructure, and logistics of low to zero GHG emissions shipping are more feasible and rapid deployment can be supported by targeted policy and industry action.\n\n[3] Subject to the widespread availability of carbon neutral solutions to meet our requirements, including low to zero GHG emission technologies, fuels, goods and services.",

City drives are also smooth, have driven in extensive traffic but never felt any jerkiness with the gearbox, maybe accelerator modulation is the key here. Keep a light foot and it will not try to change gears often. This 1.5L turbo engine combined with a 7 DCT is a very refined combo. The one time I felt the jerkiness with gear changes were when we started an uphill climb for the first time just after crossing Punjab but after that it was a smooth experience in Himachal. On open highways this engine will never feel underpowered and there\u0092s always power available on a slight tap of accelerator.\n\n\n\nHave driven in normal and sports mode till now and - mind you, once you start driving in sports mode, normal mode will start to feel lethargic and the kick-down acceleration is ADDICTIVE. Maybe that\u0092s the reason I have not yet tried Eco mode yet.\n\n\n\nRide quality -\n\n\n\nComing from Tata Zest and Volkswagen Polo I didn\u0092t find suspension to be uncomfortable as both the previous cars had balanced and stiff suspensions. During delivery checked the tyre pressure and surprisingly it was 34 PSI and I kept it like that only. Drive SLOW on undulations and speed bumps and you are good to go. It takes on expansion joints and rumble strips much better than Zest and Polo but on mountain roads if you attack a corner at high speeds you'll surely make your passengers on the rear seats uncomfortable with motion sickness.\n\n\n\nADAS -\n\n\n\nAs most of my drives were on highways and expressways, I used ADAS features like LFA, ACC and they work as expected. I wish they had provided a dedicated button for FCA to turn it on or off on the go. BCW also helps a lot to avoid vehicles (two wheelers which normally shadows your car) in your blind spot. LKA is aggressive and avoiding potholes becomes difficult so I have kept it off. SEW is also a great add on. My final verdict on ADAS is it's not a gimmick but a great add-on in terms of passive safety, it surely helps in increasing the situational awareness of driver but for first couple hundred kilometres the continuous beeps will be a distraction for sure if you are new to ADAS.\n\n\n\nFit and Finish -\n\n\n\nWhile making the decision of which car to buy, me and my fiancee explored various options including VW Virtus, Skoda Slavia, Verna, Creta and one or the other option was missing something. The German sisters lack the luxuriousness in interiors that is expected at this price range. Verna\u0092s ground clearance does not give a sense of comfort for our roads and Creta\u0092s top variant price was a little on the higher end with omission of some features as compared to Seltos. With X line\u0092s sage green interiors, soft touches and piano black inserts - we get the feel of the premium paid for it.\n\n\n\nLooks -\n\n\n\nKia is known for its unique styling and good looks but on the top of it with Seltos X Line, it has done a really fine job. X line introduced in Aurora Black Pearl colour was one of the factors which inclined me towards this model of Seltos as Graphite Matte finish would have been harder to maintain. Also, the fact that X line comes with all black grille and no silver/chrome inserts makes it look stealthy and powerful. In short, there is nothing more I could have asked for in the exteriors of Seltos X Line variant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo chrome definitely adds to the stealthy looks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful sage green interiors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior ambience during night\n\nConvenience -\n\n\n\nWell here I think Seltos scores much better than the competition. What people often perceive as gimmicks i think they do help in making your drive convenient. I have listed some features below which i find useful and makes my drive comfortable.\n\nSeat ventillation\n\n360 deg camera\n\nDual zone climate control\n\nHeads up display\n\nADAS\n\nUV cut glasses\n\nSunglass holder\n\n2nd row window shades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDual climate control is much needed when you and your partner's comfortable temperature is different\n\nWhat could have been better\n\nHeadlight -\n\nIt\u0092s BAD. My 2016 Tata Zest with projector headlamps worked much better. I find the low beams non existent when there's glare coming from oncoming vehicles with their high beams on. Have to choose between driving with high beams or not able to see the road ahead of me.\n\n\n\nWired apple carplay and android auto -\n\nI don\u0092t mind the wired connection but at this price point getting the option for wireless is not too much to ask for.\n\n\n\nDriver seats memory function-\n\nWith the convenience of electric seats it\u0092s a great miss to not include memory function. Me and my fiancee takes turns driving it and with memory function changing drivers mid drive would have been very convenient.\n\n\n\nSeat comfort-\n\nAs highlighted by members I am also finding it difficult to find a sweet spot for seat position. Most of the drives so far have been long ones and I feel discomfort in my right leg. While en-route Gurgaon to Udaipur I was driving alone and every 2 hour I felt the need to stretch my legs just because of the discomfort. I feel pain in my right knee and hamstring. Any suggestions for what can be done about this? My height is 5\u00924 and yet to find the root cause for this discomfort.\n\nRandom experiences worth sharing\n\nI wanted to take the delivery of vehicle with HSRP number plate but due to delay from RTO end I got my number plated on the next day of delivery. Went to the dealership the next day and handed over the car keys for fixing of number plates while I was waiting inside the showroom. Also Kia connect had to be activated that day so after the installation of number plate SA asked me to come inside the car for activation of KIA connect and after the process was completed we headed home. Here\u0092s the twist - after parking at home, I searched for the keys to lock the car but it was not in my pocket. The car was meeting all 3 conditions indicating the keys were inside it. I thought it must have slipped out of my pockets so searched everywhere in the car but couldn\u0092t find it. After searching for an hour or so, went back to the dealership and they found it in 5 minutes. Guess what - it was placed in the sunglass holder by the SA. Takeaway - if you are new to keyless entry system, fix a place where you always keep the keys.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of delivery I asked the SA to disable FCA, he told me it\u0092s already disabled and I took his word for it. Couple days later when we were cruising on highway speeds and during an overtake manoeuvre (was overtaking a truck moving in the middle lane from right and there was a bike in front of us in the right most lane so I planned a quick swerving manoeuvre). FCA warning flashed with continuous beeps and luckily I quickly changed lanes and it was limited to just a warning and no emergency braking. After reaching our destination I checked the settings and saw that FCA was enabled. Disabled it and thanked our stars that we didn\u0092t experienced emergency braking in the middle of highway.\n\n\n\n\n\nwith continuous beeps and luckily I quickly changed lanes and it was limited to just a warning and no emergency braking. After reaching our destination I checked the settings and saw that FCA was enabled. Disabled it and thanked our stars that we didn\u0092t experienced emergency braking in the middle of highway. Did a little efficiency run of about 200 kms while the ODO was still at 450 kms, surprisingly I was able to eek out 18.5 kmpl which is impressive for car this size and the engine which was still in its break in period. Speed during this were in the range of 60-80 kmph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMID showing average of 18.5kmpl\n\n\n\n\n\nGot the oil change and lube oil filter replacement done at 2700 km. Costed around 1700 bucks and 3 hours of my time, KIA Udaipur needs to up their game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have ordered a VIOFO A229 plus from USA. My friend will be carrying it for me in February. Getting it 10K cheaper from there so decided to take the risk of getting it from USA and i already had a word with my SA about it and they will help me with the installation part. Decided just to use it by plugging in 12V DC adapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in Himachal the inevitable happened. Managed to scrape the rear quarter panel and rear door with an iron rod which was placed just on the side of a very narrow road which was completely in my blind spot. I think I was over relying on 360 deg camera and as soon as the front sensors kicked in I turned the steering wheel fully to drivers side to save it from the protruding branches and the rear side of car came in contact with a iron rod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt happened nearby this location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily there was no dent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter light polishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter touch up with black paint as suggested by Anish(5C Car Care, Gurugram), he was kind enough to do this all complimentary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater beading in action, this was when coating was in curing stage and i was not supposed to wash it\n\nWill end this report with some parting shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast edited by Mariner_sky : 1st January 2025 at 19:39 .",

            "content": "BHP whistleblower James Joseph has come forward with a raft of allegations against the Big Australian, one of which he says exposes clandestine negotiations with former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to turn Hunter Valley coal mines into lakes. Michael West reports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very careful if I was you\u201d. BHP whistleblower James Joseph was warned on the afternoon of June 5, 2024 by a fellow BHP executive about coming forward with allegations against his company, implicating BHP\u2019s most senior executives and directors.\n\nA year prior, Joseph had come forward with a litany of allegations against The Big Australian; from corporate malfeasance and competition law breaches to the cover-up of investigations, bullying and harassment and failing to report serious injury to the NSW safety regulator in accordance with mining regulations.\n\nThis follows news earlier this month of a class action by Jan Saddler\u2019s law firm against BHP and Rio Tinto for widespread sexual harassment in the workplace which alleges the companies used confidentiality agreements to stop female employees from speaking about sexual harassment at work.\n\nInstead of being protected as a whistleblower however, the 39-year old HR executive endured what he describes as \u201cextreme retaliation\u201d: death threats, a break-in at his home, the \u2018cold shoulder\u2019 at work, a large number of job declines for lesser positions, withholding of urgent medical care and relentless workplace and legal bullying. It is the sort of payback familiar to other whistleblowers who have chosen to come forward.\n\nThere is no allegation here that BHP itself was specifically involved in these acts. The ecosystem of Big Coal is expansive, embracing a satellite of corporations, unions, lobby groups, labour hire companies and insurers. And at a time when the coal sector is in the twilight of its existence, the vested interests are as powerful as ever.\n\nIn his last 6 months of employment, James Joseph was even instructed to only speak to BHP legal representatives (Herbert Smith Freehills), who took over the handling of the \u2018Ethics Point Investigation\u2019 into his allegations.\n\n\u201cIt was a completely unheard of approach,\u201d he says. As an HR boss himself, the most senior in NSW, Joseph was well acquainted with the tactics of corporations managing prickly situations with employees. \u201cI had led 200 investigations himself in various roles with BHP\u201d.\n\nHe had recorded, and agonised over reporting the myriad of breaches as a whistleblower for some time but it was a private visit to the Mt Arthur mine site by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in December 2022 which he says was the final straw.\n\nThe Turnbull visit\n\n\u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the Turnbull visit. Alarm bells started going off. Confidential visits on a mine site do not exist; everything needs to be logged in the operational visitor log book. I realised it was untoward when a fellow colleague expressed their concern about knowledge of the visit ever \u2018getting out\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere is no allegation here of wrongdoing by Turnbull. He is a private citizen, an investor pursuing a corporate deal with BHP. Rather, it was the failure by the mining giant to adhere to its own safety regulations which concerned Joseph.\n\nMining companies take safety seriously. \u201cThey are strict,\u201d he told MWM. \u201cIf there is an explosion, a wall collapse, fire, flooding or any type of accident at a mine site, the company is accountable. It has to account for everybody on site. So the concept of an undisclosed visit \u2026 we should never have them\u201d.\n\nFrom conversations with his peers, Joseph subsequently became aware that BHP was in negotiations with Turnbull over a plan for energy transition at Mt Arthur, one of the largest coal mines in the country. At that time the modification was yet to be submitted to the NSW Planning Dept.\n\nMt Arthur and Hunter Lakes\n\nThe mooted project is vast, a plan to turn the mine into lakes and deploy pumped hydro along with solar and wind farms to transition the coal mine into an enormous renewable energy hub. If it proceeds, it may be the biggest infrastructure in Australian history. The secrecy worried Joseph too. Malcolm Turnbull has a property in the vicinity but BHP does not own the land; it is a mining lease, and there is no talk of a tender.\n\nLocated just south of Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley, Mt Arthur is the biggest coal mine in NSW, stretching 7,000 hectares, churning out some $2B a year in income from thermal coal alone.\n\nDue to close in 2030, the BHP board and management have been deliberating about the future of the site, as has the entire industry, amid the inexorable transition to renewables. This is no secret, but what is a secret is the actual plan for the multi-billion-dollar mine site rehabilitation.\n\nThe pumped hydro plan has been mooted to the local community, that is to turn the Hunter into lakes, and fill the residual mining voids with water. But it is not just about renewable energy. The lakes could be recreational too, a tourist attraction with water skiing and boating.\n\nIt is a similar project to what is happening in East Germany where old coal district of north-eastern Saxony is becoming the largest chain of artificial lakes in Europe.\n\nWhy the secrecy?\n\nBut the issue according to Joseph is the secrecy, planning sequencing and suspiciously termed \u2018community consultation\u2019. There is no tender, no modification approval (yet), no finalised public proposal. But apparently there is a lot going on behind the scenes. And here is the rub.\n\nConcerned about proper process, Joseph came forward with his allegations. \u201cAnd what happened? I went home for the weekend and spoke to my wife about it, and others. And I knew that if I didn\u2019t blow the whistle, I was as bad as them. I just thought it was shady\u201d.\n\nHe believes the board of BHP must have approved the plan. \u201cWe can\u2019t prove that but it is in their Risk & Audit Committee charter [approving site visits] who, would you believe it, is also the same committee that overseas Whistleblower reports.\n\nEven a colleague who shared the office next to Joseph urged him to inform her if he blew the whistle saying \u201cJames if you do report it, let me know, there are a few \u2018higher ups\u2019 I will need to inform\u201d. Joseph never spoke to this colleague again (and now is forbidden to) under legal instruction.\n\n\u201cA BHP Asset President would never bring a VIP like Turnbull onto site without higher ranking executives being aware because it would constitute a breach of conflict of interest (policy). The Board would probably be involved,\u201d he says.\n\nBHP\u2019s Beijing scandal\n\n\u201cWhy Board level? In 2015, we got done for corrupt dealings in regard to our foreign government dealings, associated with the 2008 Beijing Olympics. [It was a breach of] the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\u201d\n\nThe Beijing saga was a global embarrassment for the mining giant. The company was hit with a $US25m fine by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bribery scandal occurred under then chief executive Marius Kloppers. BHP had treated 60 government officials and their spouses to luxury hotel accommodation at the Beijing Olympics \u2013 most of them from Asia and Africa \u2013 in an attempt to entice foreign government and regulatory approval for mining projects.\n\nKloppers\u2019 successor Andrew Mackenzie had to clean up the mess and expressed deep regret. \u201cThat was 7 years later,\u201d says Joseph. And the aftermath left BHP scarred, and particularly sensitive to reputation damage.\n\n\u201c[As a result] they set up the Risk & Audit Committee specifically to deal with these matters \u2013 to demonstrate to the market that they were on top of it. The committee has experienced almost complete turnover over the course of Joseph\u2019s internal investigation, and is now chaired by former KPMG Audit executive, Michelle Hinchliffe.\n\nJoseph claims the investigation has not been properly executed. \u201cKey witnesses were never interviewed\u201d, he says. \u201cIt was a cover-up\u201d.\n\n\u201cBHP\u2019s charter says any government official or VIP must be approved for site visits. At the time Turnbull was also a board member at Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Future Industries, he was later appointed chair of International Hydropower Association and is a former Prime Minister, indeed the political architect of the troubled Snowy Hydro 2.0 project. He clearly should have been approved for a site visit\u201d.\n\nTurnbull stepped down from the board of the Fortescue subsidiary in January 2023. Did Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest know of the BHP visit? This is unclear. And if so, was Fortescue involved in the BHP plan for this new energy transition?\n\nDid they know a whistleblower might come forward? Joseph had come forward internally prior to the community engagement sessions, prior to the modification application (submitted 14 months later), and only three weeks after a visit of NSW Minister Courtney Houssos to Mt Arthur.\n\nBiggest project in Australia\u2019s history?\n\nThe sheer scale of the proposed transition deal makes it a sensitive issue. If you use Snowy Hydro as an example, that\u2019s already at $12B from original price estimates of $2B.\n\nThen there is the immense regulatory challenge; the environmental and First Nations\u2019 approvals which would be required to flood the area, potentially putting indigenous heritage under water. The community engagement feedback seems to be a mixed bag.\n\nJames Joseph knew in April 2023 that confidential pumped hydro talks were underway. \u201cI was accountable for shaping the NSW workforce strategy as HR manager and I was kept in the dark. Now I know why they never wanted to have this conversation or share the information with myself and other managers, because what they were doing was questionable \u2013 amounting potentially to competition breaches.\u201d\n\nThen there is the political sensitivity. China is at the vanguard of pumped hydro technology yet the political implications of doing such a large deal with the Chinese, let alone any foreign group, are significant. China already has its foot on a lot of assets in the Hunter Valley including mining and wineries.\n\nBHP has significant sway with the Coalition and Turnbull has cultivated strong ties with Labor and is a major new energy investor so a joint venture is plausible.\n\nBut for expert opinion\n\nEcologist and water scientist Peter Hughes says the Lakes proposal is a pipe-dream, at least the recreational part.\n\n\u201cWith the Lakes proposal and the use of the mine voids, I\u2019ve reviewed at least 4 proposals and every few years the NSW Minerals Council does a report. There is no new data. I\u2019ve seen proposals that all of the mine voids can be used. It\u2019s not viable for any recreational use and never will be.\n\n\u201cThe groundwater in the Hunter is highly saline and very high in heavy metals. It\u2019s highly toxic for animals. I\u2019ve written letters to them explaining this to them. In Germany it is different. The groundwater must be much cleaner, and there\u2019s high rainfall.\n\nHughes, who worked 25 years with the NSW EPA and done Environmental Impact assessments on every coal mine in the Hunter Valley and written most of the Environment Protection Licences.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for pumped hydro. There was a CSIRO report into the potential for pumped hydro which found it plausible. All you need is a hill more than 100m high. We\u2019ve put the kibosh on the recreational proposal at least four times. Pumped hydro is potentially viable but they have a major problem with it \u2013 the water quality. The water is highly corrosive which would clog up the machinery. So technically I think it is unlikely.\n\n\u201cI would say they are trying it on again. They have probably submitted again to the EPA but it\u2019s a dog with fleas.\u201d\n\nTo ever get it approved, says Hughes, they would have to get DA consent under EP&A Act, an Environment Protection Licence from the EPA, Water Access Licenses under Water Management Act, and possibly Aboriginal relic destruction licences from NPWS.\n\nTo make the water quality viable, what they would have to do is put it through a purification plant before they pump it back up the hill to the turbine. We are talking about a reverse osmosis desalination plant which is extremely expensive and power hungry. It could eat up the majority of the power which the pumped hydro plant is producing.\n\nIt\u2019s an uphill battle. And not just for BHP but all the Hunter Valley mines. \u201cThis is why they have been quietly trying to sell their mines,\u201d says Peter Hughes. \u201cThe license says that they have to return the land to its pre-mining state. This is an enormous impediment; it involves billions in rehabilitation costs.\n\n\u201cThis is why they keep running it up the flagpole\u201d. It allows them to go into negotiations with buyers and say we have got all the NSW ministers on board. This guy (James Joseph), it\u2019s no wonder they didn\u2019t want him around\u201d.",

Learn More\n\nAre you on the hunt for new additions to your income portfolio?\n\nIf you are, then it could pay to listen to what analysts are saying about the two ASX 200 dividend shares in this article.\n\nThey have recently been named as buys by analysts and tipped to offer attractive dividend yields and major upside potential. Here's what they are saying:\n\nBHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP)\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs continue to believe that mining giant BHP could be an ASX 200 dividend share to buy.\n\nBHP is of course one of the world's largest miners with operations across a range of commodities, including iron ore, potash, nickel, and copper.\n\nGoldman Sachs likes the miner due to its growing exposure to copper. It explains:\n\nWe remain bullish on copper due to ongoing supply side challenges and increasing demand and expect BHP's copper EBITDA to increase by ~US$3bn to ~US$10bn by FY26E (~45% of group EBITDA). Under our base case, copper EBITDA is expected to reach US$14bn by FY35E and ~US$19bn with all copper growth, at GSe long run copper of US$4.44/lb (real $, from 2028).\n\nThe broker believes this will support the payment of fully franked dividends of 99 US cents (A$1.59) per share in FY 2025 and US$1.08 (A$1.73) per share in FY 2026. Based on the current BHP share price of $39.84, this equates to dividend yields of 4% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nGoldman has a buy rating and $47.40 price target on BHP's shares. This suggests that upside of almost 20% is possible for investors from current levels.\n\nSmartgroup Corporation Ltd (ASX: SIQ)\n\nAnother ASX 200 dividend share that analysts are tipping as a buy is Smartgroup.\n\nIt is a leading employee benefits, end-to-end fleet management, and software solutions provider.\n\nBell Potter is feeling very bullish about Smartgroup and feels that its shares are being seriously undervalued by the market. Commenting on its buy rating, the broker said:\n\nOur favourable investment view is predicated on: (1) defensive customer segments with strong forecast occupational growth within the disability and aged care services; (2) the Electric Car Discount Bill (2022) which exempts new energy vehicles from Fringe Benefits Tax; and (3) a greater availability and selection of new energy vehicles, particularly in the mid-to-large Sports Utility segment.\n\nAs for income, the broker is forecasting fully franked dividends of 59.7 cents in FY 2025 and then 62.7 cents in FY 2026. Based on its current share price of $7.70, this means big potential dividend yields of 7.75% and 8.15%, respectively.\n\nBell Potter has a buy rating and $10.00 price target on its shares. This implies potential upside of 30% for investors.",

            "content": "Pancham Senior - BHPian\n\n\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2009 Location: Kolkata/NCR Posts: 1,837 Thanked: 3,125 Times\n\nRe: Spiti Snow Drive (2024) in my stock Suzuki Jimny MT Part 3: The trip starts, finally\n\n\n\nThe trip dates were December 21-28 ex-Chandigarh. I had slowly started preparing for the trip. I went to Decathlon to buy a few gears. I had the clothes to endure the cold but my down jacket had worn off. Additionally, I needed layers - so bought a few warm inners, a warm track pant and a cool down jacket. All of these served me very well during the trip. The idea was to layer up as much as possible - something everybody knows - but the magnitude of cold we were about to face in Spiti was something I had never experienced. I had been to the Everest Base Camp in 2017 but this trip in December was going to be even colder. With self-prep done, I decided to turn to my car. I already had some basic equipment - jump start cables, tire inflator, tire puncture kit, etc. I checked for snow chains but since there was no forecast for snow, I decided to skip it (big mistake). I was also going to buy a two rope but OLT2019 told me they will have it so no need to worry. I also carried a lot of food, a sleeping bag and gallons of water - just in case we get stuck and have to spend a night or two in the car. With the basics sorted it was time to leave for Chandigarh.\n\n\n\nTravel tip: For extreme trips like these, always go prepared. We learned it the hard way (more on this later). Always prepare a list of things to take - (i) clothes, (ii) food and water, (iii) items to prep your car. Preparing for a trip can also be fun. Going over-prepared is always better. Since I was going with a group, I saw a lot of people come to Spiti in this weather without knowing what Spiti was a month back - and hoping to experience something similar to going to Shimla. Also, remember mother nature is a zillion times more powerful than us so do not try to screw around with her - be humble and do not overstep or else she will bite back.\n\n\n\nDay 0: Gurgaon to Chandigarh\n\n\n\nWith the trip starting on December 21, I had to reach Chandigarh a day earlier. I left Gurgaon at around 12:30pm and reached my AirBnB in Chandigarh at around 7pm (I had to take a work call on my way so stopped for a while). It was a smooth fast drive with minimal traffic despite being a Friday. Chandigarh is one of those cities I love. The city has a strange vibe that somehow manages to pull the right strings in my heart. Not sure what is it about the city - but there is something special. Perhaps an old long-lost love? Who knows? Now back to the trip before I start romanticizing the city.\n\n\n\nThe AirBnB was recommended by a colleague and it was fantastic. Located in Sector 16, an old generation typical house in Chandigarh with dogs and a lawn, it was very cozy. The host was known so we had a great chat for whatever little time I was there. Also, by evening Day 0, I had no clue where the OLT2019 group is meeting. I called up the contact and he asked me to wait. I was a bit worried hoping all this was not a scam. Eventually, they created a group late at night and asked us to meet at 9:30am in Sector 47C next day.\n\n\n\nWait, before we start - I was given an interesting assignment.\n\n\n\nBefore we get into the details of the trip, let me share an interesting task I was assigned with for the trip. One of my dear colleagues (senior to me) had visited Spiti back in 2016. He had clicked some wonderful photographs of locals. He requested me to carry some of those photos and see if I could hand them over to them. The interesting bit was that I had to find the people in the photographs. The only clue I had was the file name which denoted the name of the village or location where the photo was taken. These pictures were taken in Kaza, Chicham bridge, Komic, Key Monastery, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: Chandigarh to Rampur: Getting to know the group\n\n\n\nThe day started with breakfast and me cuddling Duke, one of the several dogs at the AirBnB.\n\n\n\nHere, Duke is seen inspecting my car before leaving for the trip - he liked what he saw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- 10 guests (6 males and 4 females) + 1 guide/driver/coordinator (named Ajay)\n\n- 4 cars: One Jimny owned by yours truly, two rented Thars (HP and CH registered) organized by OLT2019 and one white Fortuner which was the lead car and can also be driven by guests (there were three from Kerala who could drive the car).\n\n\n\nImportant thing to note is: there is only one person - Ajay (good guy) from OLT2019 side. That is it. He will be our guru, guide and driver for the rest of the trip. This was his second trip to Spiti and has never done it in snow.\n\n\n\nAbout the Thars: The CH Thar was relatively new and had 26k kms on the ODO. The HP one was 52k Kms run and a little more run down - but both looked pretty good from the outside. The Fortuner was old and was 4X2 (highlighting this for later).\n\n\n\nFinally, after much delay, we start for Rampur at 11am. We are given walkie-talkies to communicate with the other vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nODO at the start of the trip in Chandigarh.\n\n\n\nThe drive from Chandigarh was initially pretty uneventful. We were confused about whether to go as convoy, or if we could overtake the lead car or should we stay in a pack. We were told not to overtake the lead car for some weird reason. Once we crossed the HP toll where you need to pay cash (like, lol), everyone went on their own. The Thars clearly went ballistic, and overtook all the cars and went ahead. The Fortuner was driven by Akash (from Kerala) and I was in the Jimny pottering behind the cars.\n\n\n\nJimny almost ended my trip on Day 1\n\n\n\nJust as we were settling in, something very strange happened with me. Neeraj (one in the CH Thar) and I decided to stop at the Starbucks near Solan. He had reached earlier and I reach a little later and was looking for a parking spot. Anyone who has seen this Starbuck outlet would know that you climb up to it and then there is a downward slope exiting to the main road. There was no space to park except for near the exit which was a downward slope. I decided to reverse my way to park in that slope and my Jimny sloped. I stalled the car. Then the worst thing happened. The infamous phenomenon of Jimny brakes becoming hard was experienced by me for the first time. I don't remember the exact sequence of events. I don't remember if I managed to start the car by then - with the brakes hard I started to roll down the slope towards the main road. Within a few seconds I was down without much control. Now, you might ask why didn't I slot it into first gear. This is where my memory fails - did I eventually start the car and slot it into first gear or did I roll down with the engine shut - I cannot recall. I almost crashed into an incoming Scorpio. Thankfully, the Scorpio veered right and saved both of us. I got a few gaalis from the Scorpio driver but I was extremely confused about the brake becoming hard all of a sudden. I had read about it but was not sure it was this bad. I was scarred. This lowered my confidence. Everything happened within a few seconds and I was sure I did whatever I could. I did stop obviously.\n\n\n\nA bit shaken with what just happened I went inside the Starbucks, ordered my latte and sat down to chill for a bit. Called Bhpian Samba and he gave some useful advice (to check the brakes before starting off) which I conveniently forgot to follow.\n\n\n\nFrom Starbucks, we started again and stopped at a small cafe called Stargaze for lunch. This is where we started to get introduced to the other members of the group. We had one couple from Mumbai (CH Thar - this was Team Mumbai), four friends from college from Pune and Hyderabad (HP Thar - this was Team Pune), and three college friends from Kerala (Team Kerala) and myself (Team Calcutta). The team names were assigned for communication over the walkie.\n\n\n\nWe started and again the cars were not together. Team Kerala was way ahead followed by Pune. Mumbai and Calcutta were together. We hit the Shimla traffic and were stuck for a good 1.5 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were very late to Rampur. We decided to take it easy. We stopped a few times but later sped up as our ETA to Rampur was showing 10pm. Pune and Kerala had already reached and since it was Day 1, they were waiting for us to have dinner together.\n\n\n\nThe temperature was falling and the lowest we got was 0 degrees while crossing Narkanda. We got super excited seeing zero degrees. We reached our stay for the night - KC Regency at around 10pm.\n\n\n\n\n\nRampur, in general is not very impressive. Situated at 1000m above sea level - there is nothing scenic about Rampur. The ghastly site of construction of new houses and building on the side of the mountain visible from the hotel room bothered me. We had a good dinner and slept off early. Ended the day adding 257kms to the ODO. Man! it is getting cold I thought (sigh, little did I know what was in store for us in the days ahead).\n\n\n\nP.S: This was the last day we could take a bath. The trip dates were December 21-28 ex-Chandigarh. I had slowly started preparing for the trip. I went to Decathlon to buy a few gears. I had the clothes to endure the cold but my down jacket had worn off. Additionally, I needed layers - so bought a few warm inners, a warm track pant and a cool down jacket.

The idea was to layer up as much as possible - something everybody knows - but the magnitude of cold we were about to face in Spiti was something I had never experienced. I had been to the Everest Base Camp in 2017 but this trip in December was going to be even colder. With self-prep done, I decided to turn to my car. I already had some basic equipment - jump start cables, tire inflator, tire puncture kit, etc. I checked for snow chains but since there was no forecast for snow, I decided to skip it (big mistake). I was also going to buy a two rope but OLT2019 told me they will have it so no need to worry. I also carried a lot of food, a sleeping bag and gallons of water - just in case we get stuck and have to spend a night or two in the car. With the basics sorted it was time to leave for Chandigarh.For extreme trips like these, always go prepared. We learned it the hard way (more on this later). Always prepare a list of things to take - (i) clothes, (ii) food and water, (iii) items to prep your car. Preparing for a trip can also be fun. Going over-prepared is always better. Since I was going with a group, I saw a lot of people come to Spiti in this weather without knowing what Spiti was a month back - and hoping to experience something similar to going to Shimla. Also, remember mother nature is a zillion times more powerful than us so do not try to screw around with her - be humble and do not overstep or else she will bite back.With the trip starting on December 21, I had to reach Chandigarh a day earlier. I left Gurgaon at around 12:30pm and reached my AirBnB in Chandigarh at around 7pm (I had to take a work call on my way so stopped for a while). It was a smooth fast drive with minimal traffic despite being a Friday. Chandigarh is one of those cities I love. The city has a strange vibe that somehow manages to pull the right strings in my heart. Not sure what is it about the city - but there is something special. Perhaps an old long-lost love? Who knows? Now back to the trip before I start romanticizing the city.The AirBnB was recommended by a colleague and it was fantastic. Located in Sector 16, an old generation typical house in Chandigarh with dogs and a lawn, it was very cozy. The host was known so we had a great chat for whatever little time I was there. Also, by evening Day 0, I had no clue where the OLT2019 group is meeting. I called up the contact and he asked me to wait. I was a bit worried hoping all this was not a scam. Eventually, they created a group late at night and asked us to meet at 9:30am in Sector 47C next day.Before we get into the details of the trip, let me share an interesting task I was assigned with for the trip. One of my dear colleagues (senior to me) had visited Spiti back in 2016. He had clicked some wonderful photographs of locals. He requested me to carry some of those photos and see if I could hand them over to them. The interesting bit was that I had to find the people in the photographs. The only clue I had was the file name which denoted the name of the village or location where the photo was taken. These pictures were taken in Kaza, Chicham bridge, Komic, Key Monastery, and so on.The other small challenge was to get the photos printed in Chandigarh. So I found Capital Studio in Sector 22 and quickly went to get them printed before the shop closed. I printed 12 photographs and headed back to the AirBnB for a good night sleep excited for what lay ahead.The day started with breakfast and me cuddling Duke, one of the several dogs at the AirBnB.Here, Duke is seen inspecting my car before leaving for the trip - he liked what he saw.Given that this was a group trip with a bunch of strangers I did not want to be late. We were given no information about the number of cars, people who were travelling, etc. I had requested for a single sharing room for extra cost which OLT2019 had agreed to. I reached Sector 47C at 9:45am to find nobody. I waited. Then I see a black Thar pull up and a young couple get down. They were from Mumbai. They were also part of the group. We text in the group that we have reached. The coordinator whom we have been talking is based in Kolkata - he was not joining the group. I decided to go fuel up and left to find a gas station. I return after 30 minutes and there was nobody. Finally after sometime we see another black Thar and an old 2010ish white Fortuner turn up. So here is the deal - the group turned out to be as follows:- 10 guests (6 males and 4 females) + 1 guide/driver/coordinator (named Ajay)- 4 cars: One Jimny owned by yours truly, two rented Thars (HP and CH registered) organized by OLT2019 and one white Fortuner which was the lead car and can also be driven by guests (there were three from Kerala who could drive the car).Important thing to note is: there is only one person - Ajay (good guy) from OLT2019 side. That is it. He will be our guru, guide and driver for the rest of the trip. This was his second trip to Spiti and has never done it in snow.About the Thars: The CH Thar was relatively new and had 26k kms on the ODO. The HP one was 52k Kms run and a little more run down - but both looked pretty good from the outside. The Fortuner was old and was 4X2Finally, after much delay, we start for Rampur at 11am. We are given walkie-talkies to communicate with the other vehicles.ODO at the start of the trip in Chandigarh.The drive from Chandigarh was initially pretty uneventful. We were confused about whether to go as convoy, or if we could overtake the lead car or should we stay in a pack. We were told not to overtake the lead car for some weird reason. Once we crossed the HP toll where you need to pay cash (like, lol), everyone went on their own. The Thars clearly went ballistic, and overtook all the cars and went ahead. The Fortuner was driven by Akash (from Kerala) and I was in the Jimny pottering behind the cars.Just as we were settling in, something very strange happened with me. Neeraj (one in the CH Thar) and I decided to stop at the Starbucks near Solan. He had reached earlier and I reach a little later and was looking for a parking spot. Anyone who has seen this Starbuck outlet would know that you climb up to it and then there is a downward slope exiting to the main road. There was no space to park except for near the exit which was a downward slope. I decided to reverse my way to park in that slope and my Jimny sloped. I stalled the car. Then the worst thing happened. The infamous phenomenon of Jimny brakes becoming hard was experienced by me for the first time. I don't remember the exact sequence of events. I don't remember if I managed to start the car by then - with the brakes hard I started to roll down the slope towards the main road. Within a few seconds I was down without much control. Now, you might ask why didn't I slot it into first gear. This is where my memory fails - did I eventually start the car and slot it into first gear or did I roll down with the engine shut - I cannot recall. I almost crashed into an incoming Scorpio. Thankfully, the Scorpio veered right and saved both of us. I got a fewfrom the Scorpio driver but I was extremely confused about the brake becoming hard all of a sudden. I had read about it but was not sure it was this bad. I was scarred. This lowered my confidence. Everything happened within a few seconds and I was sure I did whatever I could. I did stop obviously.A bit shaken with what just happened I went inside the Starbucks, ordered my latte and sat down to chill for a bit. Called Bhpian Samba and he gave some useful advice (to check the brakes before starting off) which I conveniently forgot to follow.From Starbucks, we started again and stopped at a small cafe called Stargaze for lunch. This is where we started to get introduced to the other members of the group. We had one couple from Mumbai (CH Thar - this was Team Mumbai), four friends from college from Pune and Hyderabad (HP Thar - this was Team Pune), and three college friends from Kerala (Team Kerala) and myself (Team Calcutta). The team names were assigned for communication over the walkie.We started and again the cars were not together. Team Kerala was way ahead followed by Pune. Mumbai and Calcutta were together. We hit the Shimla traffic and were stuck for a good 1.5 hours.We were very late to Rampur. We decided to take it easy. We stopped a few times but later sped up as our ETA to Rampur was showing 10pm. Pune and Kerala had already reached and since it was Day 1, they were waiting for us to have dinner together.The temperature was falling and the lowest we got was 0 degrees while crossing Narkanda. We got super excited seeing zero degrees. We reached our stay for the night - KC Regency at around 10pm.Rampur, in general is not very impressive. Situated at 1000m above sea level - there is nothing scenic about Rampur. The ghastly site of construction of new houses and building on the side of the mountain visible from the hotel room bothered me. We had a good dinner and slept off early. Ended the day adding 257kms to the ODO. Man! it is getting cold I thought (sigh, little did I know what was in store for us in the days ahead).P.S: This was the last day we could take a bath.

Some anti-social elements had stolen all 4, which meant that we could not go ahead with paint any further. The bumper corners had to be sourced, bent into shape to fit the car and align everything properly before we could cover the car in shiny, new paint.\n\nFor the front end, we managed to adapt Tata 207 parts and were able to make it look quite close to original. However, the rear bumper, being unique to this car and quite rare in the market, was a pain to source. Mr. Sandeep Sharma managed to get me a rear LHS part and was kind enough to send it across from Mumbai. After a couple of months of fruitless attempts to find a rear RHS unit, we decided to have one fabricated locally, using the LHS one as a reference.\n\nThe fabricator managed to do a pretty decent job in my opinion. The shape isn\u2019t perfect, but I think a little bit of putty would be able to make it look quite a lot like the original.\n\nHopefully, there wouldn\u2019t be any more roadblocks. Fingers crossed.\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

At each stage, Brambles earns daily hire fees for its pallets and crates.\n\nBHP shares\n\nBHP Group (formerly known as BHP Billiton) is a diversified natural resources company founded in 1885 that produces commodities for energy use and manufacturing.\n\nBHP\u2019s core business lines are mineral exploration and production. BHP\u2019s assets, operations and interests are separated into three focus areas: copper and related minerals (e.g. gold, uranium, silver, zinc, etc.); iron ore; and coal (i.e. metallurgical and energy). While these categories make up the bulk of revenue and profit, the company is also diversifying into other areas such as fertiliser.\n\nBHP shares have long been viewed as a reliable dividend-paying investment and are a common member of Australian share portfolios. It\u2019s also one of the largest companies in Australia so if you own an ASX 200 ETF or LIC, or even have money in superannuation, chances are you already have some exposure to BHP shares.\n\nBXB share price valuation\n\nWe would consider BXB to be a \u2018mature\u2019 or \u2018blue-chip\u2019 business, so some of the metrics that could be worth considering include the debt/equity ratio, average yield, and return on equity, or ROE. These measures give us a sense of the company\u2019s debt levels, their ability to generate returns from their assets, and their ability to consistently return profits to shareholders.\n\nFor FY24, Brambles Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 81.8%, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nOver the last 5 years, BXB has delivered an average dividend yield of 2.7% per year. This is important to note if you\u2019re looking for income from your investments.\n\nFinally, in FY24, BXB reported an ROE of 25.6%. For a mature business you generally want to see an ROE of more than 10%, so BXB clears this hurdle.\n\nIn FY24, BHP Group Ltd reported a debt/equity ratio of 45.3%, meaning the company has more equity than debt.\n\nAs for dividends, since 2019 BHP has achieved an average dividend yield of 6.9% per year, and in FY24 reported an ROE of 19.7%\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are only a small selection of metrics and don\u2019t give us enough information to value the business or make an investment decision.

I managed to find a rugged factory spec gem that I couldn\u2019t be happier with. The journey to finding it was as exciting as owning it now. Prices here are extremely high and many of the Jeeps I came across were heavily abused or modified.\n\n\n\nI surfed the internet relentlessly. Finally, I stumbled upon a listing for a Mahindra CL 500 MDI 2004 in Rajasthan. The photos and description were promising, and I decided to investigate it further. The first step was to make an advance payment so that I will not lose the opportunity. Moreover, since I\u2019m currently based in Russia, I couldn\u2019t inspect the Jeep myself. At this time my brother kindly stepped in to help. He traveled to Rajasthan, inspected the vehicle thoroughly, and confirmed that it was in excellent condition, and we can move forward with the deal.\n\n\n\nThis Jeep was a factory spec model, not heavily used or abused something I was specifically looking for. It had run 140K as per the meter said. But it can be little bit more since the meter was not working at this time. It had an interesting history as it was previously owned by a DGP, Director General of Police. But something was unusual, the registration was covering the period 2004-2024, which usually should be 2004-2019 (15 years of registration validity). If someone know about the rules for police vehicle registration validity all over India or in Rajasthan please share. The current owner had bought it earlier this year, and we negotiated the price to 2.85 lakh rupees, which I found reasonable. In Kerala, it would cost me around 4.5 to 5.5 lakh rupees.\n\n\n\nI also sought help from the owner to get it serviced because my brother was planning to drive it all the way. So spent around 20K for it which includes, engine oil, transmission oil, and differential oil replacements. The odometer and speedometer, which were not working, were fixed. All the lights were inspected and repaired to ensure everything was functional. The leaf spring set was restored to its original condition. The wipers and combination switch were replaced with new ones.\n\n\n\nOnce the deal was finalized, my brother embarked on the adventure of driving it all the way from Rajasthan to Kerala. The journey spanned six days, during which he also enjoyed a leisure trip. The transportation costs came to around 40K which included approximately 15K for diesel, 5K for tolls, and other personal expenses. I managed to secure 3474, which matches the numbers on my Toyota Fortuner and Maruti SB308. It was worth every rupee to see that familiar number plate on my new Jeep. The registration process in Kerala, including the number booking, cost me around 18K including agent commission.\n\n\n\nNow it\u2019s home, I\u2019m overjoyed with my decision to purchase this Jeep. The robust build, unique history, and the work I\u2019ve put into it makes it a prized addition to my garage. I can\u2019t wait to take it on more adventures and share updates.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions, especially on any further enhancements or upgrades I could consider for this beauty.

The bulk of the retreat came in the first quarter, although prices went on to hit the lowest since 2022 in September.\n\nElsewhere, the LMEX Index of the six main base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange headed for a modest annual gain of 5%, with softer Chinese demand offset by flashes of supply stress in copper and zinc.\n\nPrices were mixed on Tuesday, with zinc up 0.4% at $3,031.50 a ton, and tin \u2014 the strongest gainer over the year \u2014 down 0.7% to $29,085 a ton.\n\nIron ore was little changed at $100.45 a ton at 11:09 a.m. in Singapore, while yuan-priced contracts in Dalian were flat and steel contracts in Shanghai were lower.\n\n--With assistance from Winnie Zhu.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "BHPian sc15523 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nI learnt riding at the age of 10 (in 1996) and since then I have been riding for the past 24 years & ridden appx 3 lakh kms and have been fortunate to ride my dad\u2019s bike & also own a few bikes in this long run starting from KB100, Caliber 115, Caliber Croma & LML Freedom (all Dad\u2019s Bike) and then CBZ, Pulsar 220 & Mahindra Mojo (My Own).\n\nAfter Owning \u201cMahindra Mojo\u201d for 9 long years (driven around 70k kms & went across the country), I finally made up my mind for my next big upgrade. And this time I was gunning for a twin-cylinder engine. I had RE in my mind considering the smooth & affordable twin-cylinder they had in their portfolio. My choice was clearly between 2 REs \u2013 Interceptor 650 & Super Meteor 650. After taking multiple test rides of both the bikes, I decided to go ahead with the \u201cSuper Meteor 650\u201d considering the riding comfort at least better than Interceptor (IMHO).\n\nThe SM650 met all my expectations including the smooth vibe free engine, sleek gearbox, riding posture, looks & customization options except the stiff rear suspension, but I found alternative to that as well. In Apr\u201924, I finally booked my bike with \u201cChopada Motors, Wagholi, Pune\u201d. There was a waiting period of close to 3 months which I was okay with. Exactly after 3 months, the dealership confirmed the arrival of my bike, and they were very generous for allowing me to do the PDI along with their team. I have also opted for a few RE Accessories to be installed in my bike at the time of delivery. Then comes the D-Day of my bike\u2019s delivery \u2013 17th Jul\u201924.\n\nI along with my better half, 2-yr old boy, my elder brother & my friend went to take the delivery. The delivery process was seamless. The Sales Manager briefed the entire process & also explained the RE Connected App.\n\nSince 17th Jul\u201924, I have driven 10k kms (availed 3rd Service with 4 months of delivery), and the bike has performed flawlessly. It is extremely smooth at triple-digit speeds, with no vibrations at all. I am extremely satisfied with the bike.\n\nMajor Rides Completed:\n\nPune \u2013 Badrinath \u2013 Pune: 4000 kms in 7 days (separate review to be followed)\n\nPune \u2013 Rourkela \u2013 Pune: 4700 kms in 2 weeks (Hometown visit)\n\nPros:\n\nVibe free Engine\n\nSmooth Gearshifts\n\nComfortable riding position\n\nSuper stable & well-balanced at triple-digit speeds\n\nVibe free body\n\nCons:\n\nStiff Rear Suspension (Upgraded to Aftermarket)\n\nModifications/Accessories/Upgradation done:\n\nRear Suspension: Replaced the OEM Suspension with Hagon\u2019s Rear Shock Absorbers (Imported from Hitchcock Motorcycles, UK) \u2013 Costed 51K\n\nTop Box (52 ltrs) from Trek & Ride\n\nZana Top Rack\n\nFront Brake Master Cylinder Guard from Zana\n\nRear Brake Master Cylinder from Zana\n\nWindshield Extender from Prospec\n\nMaddock Foglamps (Installed with the handlebar)\n\nBark Buster Handguard\n\nGrip Puppies\n\nRPM Meter from Daytona (Imported from Hitchcock Motorcycles, UK) \u2013 Costed 13K\n\nSeat Modified according to my sitting posture\n\nComplete PPF \u2013 Costed 15K\n\nAccessories from RE:\n\nSide Panniers\n\nFront Windshield\n\nTouring Foot Pegs\n\nFog Lamps\n\nReview of Hagon\u2019s Rear Suspension:\n\nI have driven appx 5k kms with the upgraded rear suspension. I can vouch for this suspension. Although they are expensive, frankly speaking, the decision was right. Travel is way more than the OEM shock absorber and the ability to absorb shock is superb. It doesn\u2019t transmit shocks to the rider or the pillion, how rough the road is. Very smooth even of concrete surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nWith most brokers taking a break over the holiday period, research notes are few and far between right now.\n\nBut don't worry because listed below are three recent broker buy recommendations that still have plenty of upside potential.\n\nHere's why brokers think these ASX shares are in the buy zone:\n\nBellevue Gold Ltd (ASX: BGL)\n\nAccording to a note out of Bell Potter, its analysts initiated coverage on this gold miner's shares with a buy rating and $1.95 price target. Bell Potter rates the company highly due to the high-grade Bellevue Gold Project in Western Australia. The broker highlights that management has outlined plans to expand gold production at the project to ~250kozpa in FY 2028. The good news is that Bell Potter believes the company could achieve its growth ambitions. Particularly given that there is considerable additional exploration prospectivity in extensions to structures that host the current resource, and potentially, in repeat structures, deeper in the broader Bellevue Lode system. Bell Potter believes that success could underpin significant share price upside. The Bellevue Gold share price is trading at $1.12 on Monday morning.\n\nIluka Resources Limited (ASX: ILU)\n\nA note out of Goldman Sachs revealed that its analysts retained their buy rating and $7.70 price target on this mineral sands producer's shares. This was in response to the release of an update on funding for its Eneabba Rare Earth refinery in Western Australia. Goldman Sachs was pleased with the additional $400 million of government funding for the project. It notes that this is a significant positive milestone for Iluka. Especially as it believes that the Eneabba Rare Earth refinery will be a strategic and highly valuable Western World critical mineral asset. It will also be only the fifth refinery of its kind outside of China. And despite all this, Goldman points out that the market is pricing in almost no value to the rare earth refinery nor the Wimmera rare earth project. The Iluka share price is fetching $5.05 on Monday.\n\nWiseTech Global Ltd (ASX: WTC)\n\nAnother note out of Goldman Sachs revealed that its analysts retained their buy rating and $138.00 price target on this logistics solutions company's shares. This was in response to news that WiseTech Global has downgraded its guidance at its annual general meeting. It notes that this was caused by the delay of the launch of the new Container Transport Optimization platform. And while Goldman has updated its estimates to reflect this delay, it still expects a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth in FY 2026. Goldman is forecasting revenue growth of 21% in FY 2025 and then 28% the year after. The WiseTech Global share price is trading at $120.66 on Monday.",
