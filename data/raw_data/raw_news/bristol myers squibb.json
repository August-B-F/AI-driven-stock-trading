Biovelocita II (BV II) expands Sofinnova\u2019s biotech acceleration strategy, extending beyond Italy to include the United Kingdom, Denmark, and France.\n\nThe \u20ac165 million ($180 million) is part of the broader \u20ac1.2 billion funding that Sofinnova disclosed at the start of this month. Since the launch of Biovelocita, the fund has examined more than 300 projects and made multiple investments into new companies across Europe.\n\n\u201cBiovelocita has seen significant growth between its first and second iterations,\u201d Graziano Seghezzi, managing partner of Sofinnova Partners, told BioXconomy.\n\n\u201cLaunched in 2015 as Italy\u2019s first biotech accelerator, BV I raised \u20ac15 million, while BV2 grew more than tenfold to \u20ac165 million,\u201d he explained. \u201cBV I\u2019s portfolio companies collectively secured over \u20ac80 million in funding, with a focus on rare diseases, diabetes, oncology, and cellular senescence. A key example is Enthera, BV I\u2019s first graduate, now a clinical-stage company and the largest VC-backed Series A in Italy, raising over \u20ac70 million and attracting major international investors like AbbVie Ventures and Roche Venture Fund.\u201d\n\nRelated:Sofinnova and Medicxi talk M&A, patent cliffs, and China\n\n\u201cAnother graduate, Alia Therapeutics, is also advancing toward clinical-stage development,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe Sofinnova Biovelocita strategy provides scientific founders a thorough, hands-on approach in combination with financial support, direct management, financial support, and access to the VC\u2019s infrastructure and network.\n\nSeghezzi said the European life science investor firm expects to back 10\u201315 biotech companies that are \u201ctackling significant unmet medical needs.\u201d Additionally, he placed emphasis on expanding Sofinnova\u2019s partnerships with \u201ctop centers\u201d such as \u201cGustave Roussy, leading university, and research hospitals.\u201d This, in combination with \u201ca strong relationship with pharma, will play a key role in driving these companies forward.\u201d\n\nSeghezzi shared the stage with Francesco De Rubertis, co-founder and partner at Medicxi, at BIO-Europe Spring in Milan, Italy, the day before BV II was announced.

            "content": "Healthcare is a defensive sector that is more resilient to economic downturns than most others. That's one of several reasons it is home to solid dividend stocks, including Pfizer (PFE -0.65%) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.18%), two of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world. In addition to their strong income profiles, both drugmakers look incredibly cheap at their current levels, making them excellent picks.\n\nRead on to find out why dividend seekers can confidently add Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb to their portfolios.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nPfizer has encountered some issues in recent years. Sales of its coronavirus products fell off a cliff, and some of the company's older products are no longer the growth drivers they once were. As a result, the stock has lagged the market, but the sell-off might be a bit overdone. Pfizer's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.9 looks dirt cheap compared to the healthcare industry's average of 17.2. Pfizer looks attractive at these levels, considering its prospects.\n\nThe company is putting the small fortune it earned thanks to its coronavirus efforts to work. The drugmaker significantly expanded its pipeline in the past three years and boasts investigational products across a range of therapeutic areas. Pfizer's work in oncology looks especially promising -- the company's pipeline features almost 60 programs in this field, including many in late-stage studies.\n\nPfizer plans to launch several blockbuster oncology drugs in the next few years. The company is also looking to join the weight loss market with a GLP-1 candidate, danuglipron. Meanwhile, Pfizer's COVID-19 portfolio is still generating strong sales and was largely responsible for the company's revenue moving in the right direction last year. Pfizer's top line in 2024 was $63.6 billion, 7% higher than the previous fiscal year.\n\nBetween Pfizer's lineup (including its coronavirus products) and deep pipeline, the company's business still looks robust. Further, due to the steep drop in its shares for the past few years, Pfizer's forward yield looks juicy at 6.7% -- the S&P 500's average is 1.3%. Pfizer has continued to increase its payouts despite the issues it has faced. The pharmaceutical giant will rebound eventually as its recent investments pay off. Long-term, income-oriented investors should consider scooping up its shares while they remain down.\n\n2. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb has encountered significant patent cliffs in the past few years, but the company has come out of these troubles just fine. Last year, the drugmaker's revenue increased by 7% to $48.3 billion.\n\nBristol Myers has dealt with patent cliffs the old-fashioned way -- by developing newer products that are now helping drive solid growth. That includes Reblozyl, a medicine for anemia in beta-thalassemia patients that was first approved in 2019. Reblozyl now generates well over $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nSome of the company's legacy medicines are still making massive contributions, including anticoagulant Eliquis and cancer drug Opdivo. What happens when these products also lose patent protection? Bristol Myers will go through a period of declining sales, but it will recover. Since Reblozyl in 2019, the company has earned approval for over half a dozen other brand-new medicines that are slowly gaining prominence.\n\nBristol Myers also has a deep pipeline that features 50 clinical compounds in development -- some are new ones that have never earned approval for any indication. For instance, Bristol Myers is testing iberdomide in several clinical trials in myeloma patients. Golcadomide, another compound in development, is being studied in B-cell lymphoma.\n\nBristol Myers should succeed in launching brand-new medicines in the next few years. And in the long run, patent cliffs won't sink its prospects. They haven't before. Meanwhile, the drugmaker offers a forward yield of 4.20% and routinely raises its dividends. Further, Bristol Myers' forward P/E of 8.9 looks more than reasonable.\n\nWhile the market has been volatile and could sink even more, investors don't need to wait for that to find bargains, thanks to attractively valued dividend stocks like Bristol Myers and Pfizer.",

            "content": "Final guidance published today recommends lisocabtagene maraleucel (also known as liso-cel or Breyanzi, made by Bristol Myers Squibb) as a treatment option for people with large B-cell lymphoma whose cancer has not responded to initial treatment or has returned within 12 months.\n\nThis innovative therapy could benefit nearly 600 people annually in England, marking a significant advancement in lymphoma care.\n\nFor patients whose lymphoma has not responded to standard treatments, lisocabtagene maraleucel offers a promising new option. This first-of-its-kind therapy reprograms a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer. Clinical trials have shown it to be particularly effective for those whose cancer has either not responded to initial treatment or returned within 12 months.\n\nThe treatment involves collecting a patient's T-cells, which are then modified in a laboratory to specifically target and destroy cancer cells. These engineered cells are reinfused as a single treatment, with the potential to provide long-term benefits.\n\nDirector of Medicines Evaluation at NICE, Helen Knight, said:\n\n\u201cFor people living with this aggressive blood cancer, and their families, today's announcement offers real hope. These aren't just statistics \u2013 each person who will benefit from this treatment is someone's parent, child, partner or friend.\u201d\n\nPatient experts from Blood Cancer UK and Lymphoma Action have welcomed the decision, noting that the treatment can be administered in an outpatient setting. This approach minimises costly hospital stays and potentially improves the quality of life for patients and their families.\n\nToday's positive recommendation follows a consultation after an initial draft negative recommendation in October 2024. The decision was reversed after Bristol Myers Squibb offered an improved commercial arrangement to the NHS on the \u00a3297,000 list price per individual treatment.\n\nThe treatment will be available through routine commissioning, with NHS England required to make funding available within 90 days. In the interim, funding will be provided by the Cancer Drugs Fund.\n\nImage credit: iStock",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other most undervalued biotech stocks to invest in.\n\nTrump\u2019s Tariffs and the Pharma Sector\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss Trump\u2019s tariffs and their effects on the American pharma sector. Although he was unsure of the intention behind these tariffs, he opined that the pharma industry was not all that special when compared to verticals such as industrials and technology, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nThe tariffs thus encompass the grander plan surrounding how the pharmaceutical industry fits into scaling up domestic manufacturing. A majority of pharma and biotech companies have a significant presence in the US. However, some questions still stand, such as whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America.\n\nHolz was unclear about the answers to these questions, but he believed that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. Further discussing the scenario, he said that boosting manufacturing facilities and capacities from scratch is not an easy endeavor, as it takes considerable years to reach a point where companies can domestically produce at a high rate. Therefore, the impact of tariffs on the production capacity and on-shoring of pharma companies remains fuzzy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 11 Best Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe further discussed the potential impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs and the performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on the 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

            "content": "[Last updated on March 19, 2025]\n\nThe R&D layoff trend shows no signs of slowing as we move through March, with significant cuts announced across pharmaceuticals, automotive, tech hardware, and AI startups. March has been especially challenging for European automakers, with Porsche AG announcing one of the largest cuts so far this year (3,900 workers). On March 12, the luxury car manufacturer and VW subsidiary unveiled plans to eliminate approximately 3,900 jobs as part of a multi-year efficiency push. The firm has already trimmed about 1,900 positions through early retirements and voluntary departures. Another 2,000 roles are set to be eliminated as fixed-term contracts expire. These cuts come as Porsche\u2019s operating profit tumbled roughly 23% in 2024. A \u201cchallenging market\u201d remains in the words of the company. Continental AG has also announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs to be eliminated by 2026 while GM noted that it would cut half of its staff from its Cruise division.\n\n2025 R&D LAYOFFS BY INDUSTRY (as of March 19, 2025) Industry Total Layoffs % of Total Energy 13,158 24.5% Tech & Software 8,260 15.4% Automotive & Autonomous 7,900 14.7% Semiconductors 5,200 9.7% Other 4,984 9.3% Hardware 4,500 8.4% Life Sciences & Healthcare 3,747 7.0% Research 2,497 4.7% Aerospace 2,427 4.5% Retail & Consumer 632 1.2% AI & Robotics 267 0.5% Construction Tech 114 0.2% TOTAL 53,686 100.0% Note: The above tally is not exhaustive, but represents a considerable amount of data-gathering from a range of data sources.\n\nBiopharma: Big Pharma optimizes as smaller biotechs struggle\n\nMarch has seen major pharmaceutical companies implementing significant workforce reductions as part of broader cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives. Bristol Myers Squibb continues its ongoing $2 billion cost-reduction plan with 223 layoffs at its New Jersey R&D facility, effective between May and August 2025. Meanwhile, Novartis is cutting roughly 464 positions across two sites\u2014closing its San Diego gene therapy production facility (34 jobs) while trimming nearly 430 roles at its East Hanover, NJ headquarters.\n\nThese larger pharma companies are trimming operations to focus resources on priority projects, following smaller biotechs that made more drastic cuts in January and February as funding remained tight.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: 223 R&D positions cut in New Jersey\n\n223 R&D positions cut in New Jersey Novartis: 464 employees affected across San Diego and East Hanover sites\n\n464 employees affected across San Diego and East Hanover sites Major biotech restructurings continue: Building on February\u2019s cuts at firms like Spotlight Therapeutics (complete shutdown) and Third Harmonic Bio (50% reduction)\n\nTech hardware consolidates amid AI pivot\n\nEnterprise hardware giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced on March 6 its plan to eliminate about 2,500 jobs\u2014approximately 5% of its global workforce. CEO Antonio Neri indicated these cuts will roll out over the next 12-18 months as part of a broader efficiency initiative. The reductions will affect significant R&D divisions in computing architecture, networking, and enterprise systems as HPE reallocates resources toward growth areas like AI and cloud services.\n\nThis follows February\u2019s cuts at Hewlett-Packard (2,000 employees) affecting R&D teams across computing hardware, printing technology, and materials science divisions, and semiconductor manufacturers like Onsemi and NXP, which each announced cuts of thousands of positions.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise: 2,500 positions (5% of workforce)\n\n2,500 positions (5% of workforce) Hewlett-Packard: 2,000 roles in R&D (from February)\n\n2,000 roles in R&D (from February) Semiconductors feel pressure: Following February\u2019s Onsemi (2,400 jobs) and NXP (1,800 jobs) announcements\n\nFollowing February\u2019s Onsemi (2,400 jobs) and NXP (1,800 jobs) announcements Google: 25,000 staff offered buyouts in Platforms & Devices division.\n\n25,000 staff offered buyouts in Platforms & Devices division.

Microsoft: Layoffs, $80 billion AI data centers.\n\nAI startups not immune\n\nEven as major tech companies pivot toward AI, smaller AI-focused startups are making strategic cuts to extend runway and focus resources. D-ID, an Israeli AI company specializing in creative media tools and face anonymization technology, laid off 22 employees (25% of its workforce) on March 10. Despite having raised $48 million to date, the Series B-funded company is streamlining operations to focus on its core computer vision and generative AI R&D.\n\nThis follows February cuts at other AI firms like Logically (40 employees, 20%) and Hugging Face (10 employees, 4%), indicating that even companies in high-growth sectors are being cautious about headcount and burn rates.\n\nD-ID: 22 employees (25% of workforce)\n\n22 employees (25% of workforce) AI sector adjustments: Following layoffs at Logically, Hugging Face, and Tabnine in February\n\nThe wave of R&D-focused layoffs that began in January continues unabated into March, suggesting a fundamental recalibration of innovation spending across multiple industries. Companies are increasingly selective about which research projects receive funding, with many citing the need to align R&D investments with near-term commercial potential or core strategic priorities.\n\nAerospace: Streamlining for survival\n\nAerospace, which faces high R&D costs and competition, is consolidating. Consider Boeing\u2019s layoff of 400 employees from its moon rocket program on February 8, 2025, linked to delays in NASA\u2019s Artemis mission. Then there\u2019s Blue Origin, which on February 13, 2025, cut 1,400 jobs (10% workforce), while Eviation Aircraft announced large-scale layoffs on February 14, 2025 (numbers undisclosed). Other cuts, like Pratt & Whitney\u2019s engineering layoffs on January 29, 2025 (tied to engine issues and cost overruns), and ZIN Technologies\u2019 27 R&D roles cut on January 14, 2025, show a sector streamlining to survive. While NASA was facing a planned 10% reduction, many workers appear to have been spared, according to Space.com.\n\nBoeing: 400 layoffs from SLS program.\n\n400 layoffs from SLS program. Blue Origin: 1,400 jobs cut (10% workforce).\n\n1,400 jobs cut (10% workforce). Eviation: (undisclosed)\n\nBiopharma: Pruning for focus\n\nBiopharma, especially biotech, continues to face significant layoffs in early 2025, with some companies often cutting 20\u2013100% of staff. For instance, Spotlight Therapeutics shut down entirely on February 20 (40 employees) after disappointing preclinical data. Third Harmonic Bio cut 50% of staff on February 12, 2025, to focus on THB335, while Encoded Therapeutics reduced 29% (60 employees) on February 14, prioritizing ETX101. Larger players like Novartis are also cutting, with 140 layoffs in New Jersey on February 18. Additionally, X4 Pharmaceuticals reduced its workforce by 30%, and Inventiva recently laid off roughly 50% of its employees to concentrate on its lead candidate. Zentalis axed 40% of its staff to prioritize cancer drug trials, while IGM Biosciences laid off 73% of employees after halting autoimmune programs. Even advanced CRISPR-focused startups such as Scribe Therapeutics cut 50% of its staff (30 employees), underscoring how the current funding crunch and rising interest rates are hitting R&D-heavy companies across the sector.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics: 100% layoffs (40 employees), shutdown after failed trials.\n\n100% layoffs (40 employees), shutdown after failed trials. Third Harmonic Bio: 50% staff cut, focus on THB335.\n\n50% staff cut, focus on THB335. Novartis: 140 layoffs in sales, protecting R&D budgets.\n\nEnergy sector retools\n\nIn the gritty reality of 2025\u2019s energy sector, the numbers don\u2019t lie: it\u2019s shedding jobs faster than any R&D-heavy sector we\u2019ve tracked so far this year. Chevron\u2019s sizable axe, poised to chop 8,000 to 10,000 positions\u201415\u201320% of its global workforce\u2014by 2026, looms over the horizon like a storm cloud, driven by a $3 billion cost-cutting blitz amid legal tangles over its Hess acquisition and crumbling refining margins. Across the Atlantic, BP has already slashed 4,700 roles (8.5% of its workforce, including 3,000 contractors) by mid-January, chasing $2 billion in savings as part of its own survival playbook. These aren\u2019t isolated stumbles\u2014SolarEdge in Tel Aviv eliminated 400 jobs in its fourth round of layoffs on January 6, battered by weak demand and excess inventory, while California\u2019s Aurora Solar let go of 58 staffers on January 10, a smaller but telling cut in solar tech R&D. Some of these moves come as companies juggle allocating funds to energy-transition R&D while sustaining core fossil-fuel operations.\n\nChevron: Planning on cutting 15\u201320%.\n\nPlanning on cutting 15\u201320%. BP: Cut 8.5% of its workforce in January.\n\nCut 8.5% of its workforce in January. SolarEdge: Eliminated 400 roles, while Aurora Solar laid off 58.\n\nAutomotive: Pivoting from full autonomy\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on tech and aerospace, major automotive players are also trimming R&D in 2025. General Motors, for example, cut roughly 50% of the staff at its Cruise self-driving car unit (estimated 1,000 employees) after hitting regulatory and technical roadblocks with robotaxis. The changes appear to be part of a broader shift away from full electrification and fully autonomous projects in favor of more incremental driver-assist features that can be commercialized sooner. Ford and Stellantis have likewise scaled back certain autonomous R&D efforts, citing slower-than-expected market adoption and high development costs. Ford cut 200 employees from its autonomous vehicle division, while Stellantis let go of 150 workers tied to its self-driving partnerships.\n\nGeneral Motors (Cruise): 50% of staff cut (1,000 employees, est.).\n\n50% of staff cut (1,000 employees, est.). Ford: 200 layoffs from autonomous vehicle division.\n\n200 layoffs from autonomous vehicle division. Stellantis: 150 layoffs tied to self-driving partnerships.\n\nOther Sectors: Robotics, construction tech and public R&D\n\nThe wave of layoffs extends beyond the major industries highlighted. Robotics firms like Teradyne cut 140 jobs (10% of its robotics division), while construction tech company ICON laid off 114 employees (25% of staff) as it pivoted to robotic automation. Even public-sector R&D is not immune, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) preparing to cut 497 probationary staff, including 74 postdocs and a significant portion of its CHIPS for America program, as part of broader federal budget constraints. These cuts, alongside planned reductions at agencies like the National Science Foundation (potentially up to 50%), would threaten a considerable share of federally funded research and development.\n\nTeradyne: 140 layoffs (10% of robotics division).\n\n140 layoffs (10% of robotics division).

Additionally, Century is expanding its capabilities in manufacturing sciences and operations to support these initiatives.\n\nCapital Management: Since inception, Century Therapeutics has raised approximately $666 million in net proceeds from equity sales. In 2024, the company issued 4,084,502 shares through an at-the-market offering, raising $18.4 million, and conducted a private placement of 15,873,011 shares, generating $60 million. The company also repaid its $10 million loan with Hercules Capital in May 2023, reducing interest expenses. As of December 31, 2024, Century had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $220.1 million.\n\nFuture Outlook: Century anticipates needing additional financing to fund operations, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization of product candidates. The company plans to finance its operations through existing cash, future equity or debt financings, and potential collaborations. Century aims to become a fully integrated biotechnology company, focusing on off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancers, with a vision to transform patient lives.\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nFinancial and Operational Risks: Century Therapeutics has a limited operating history and has incurred significant losses since inception. It expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and requires additional funding to finance operations. The company has never generated revenue from product sales and may never achieve profitability.\n\nProduct Development and Commercialization Risks: The business is highly dependent on the success of its lead product candidate, CNTY-101, and other product candidates. The company is early in its development efforts, and its success depends on advancing product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approval, and ultimately commercializing them.\n\nTechnological and Manufacturing Risks: Utilizing CAR-iNK and CAR-iT cells represents a novel approach to immuno-oncology treatment, and the company must overcome significant challenges in developing, commercializing, and manufacturing its product candidates. The manufacture and distribution of iPSC-derived cell product candidates are complex and subject to numerous risks.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: The company relies on third parties for the manufacture of some product candidates and is beginning to operate its own manufacturing facility. Operational issues with these facilities could delay development plans. Additionally, the company must comply with evolving regulatory requirements, which may change and impact its development timeline.\n\nMarket and Economic Risks: Century Therapeutics is exposed to market risks, including the potential delisting of its common stock from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with listing standards. The trading price of its shares has been highly volatile, and the company may face challenges in raising additional capital due to market conditions.\n\nIntellectual Property Risks: The company's success depends on obtaining, protecting, maintaining, and enforcing its intellectual property rights. It does not currently own issued patents for some product candidates, and any termination of license agreements could result in the loss of key components for its platforms.\n\nStrategic and Competitive Risks: The company may explore strategic collaborations that may not materialize or may require relinquishing important rights. It also faces competition in the clinical investigation of cell therapies, which could impact its ability to enroll patients and execute clinical trials.\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis: Management acknowledges the challenges in achieving profitability and the need for additional funding. The company plans to continue advancing its iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms and expanding its clinical development efforts. It is also focused on establishing its own manufacturing capabilities and exploring strategic collaborations to enhance its competitive position.\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk: The company is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in the trading price of its common stock and potential delisting from Nasdaq. It also faces risks related to raising additional capital in volatile market conditions, which could impact its financial performance and growth strategy.\n\nSEC Filing: Century Therapeutics, Inc.

After accounting for inflation, this growth has declined by over a tenth (11%). In the same period, the NHS budget grew by a third in real terms (33%). [5/6]\n\nUnfortunately, the UK\u2019s decade of disinvestment in medicines and vaccines has left the NHS lagging international peers in terms of access to and use of innovative treatments.\n\nEngland has slipped from being the first for the availability of new medicines (compared to other countries in Europe) to ninth in under ten years. One year after launch, the use of medicines in England is only 52% of the average of comparator nations, rising to 62% five years post-launch [7].\n\nThe UK has also fallen from fourth to tenth place in the global rankings for the number of phase III trials it hosts, below similar European countries like Spain (3rd), Germany (6th) and Italy (7th).\n\nThe UK\u2019s share of global R&D investment has fallen from 7.3% to 5.7% over three years. This represents the fastest decline of any European G7 nation but also highlights the significant growth in global investment and the opportunity for the UK to attract international mobile investment [8].\n\nRichard Torbett, Chief Executive of the ABPI, said: \u201cThe government has rightly identified life sciences as a critical growth sector for the economy, but unless these excessive payment rates are addressed, the UK will not see the growth and investment we all want, and the UK will continue to slip behind our peers. We need an urgent commitment from the government to work with industry to get the UK back to an internationally competitive position.\u201d\n\nAgreements between the government and the pharmaceutical industry to support NHS access to medicines have existed since the founding of the NHS, with the latest agreement signed in 2023 called Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines, Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG).\n\nThe latest deal was explicitly intended to bring payment rates back to an internationally competitive level after rates had soared to 21.2% in 2023 from an average of 7 per cent between 2014-2021. VPAG payment rates for newer medicines did fall in 2024 to 15.1%, however, in 2025, they have again soared to 23.5% for newer medicines, with companies still paying 10.6%-35.6% for older products.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the fact that the spending and payment assumptions, carefully considered by both sides when the VPAG agreement was negotiated over a year ago, are now very different to the original predictions.\n\nThe NHS has received more funding from the government than was assumed to be the case in 2023 during VPAG negotiations. Greater funding has led to more NHS activity and, ultimately, a greater demand for medicines, which must be paid for by the industry.\n\nTo fix the problem, the ABPI is calling for the allowed growth agreed in the Scheme to be adjusted to reflect recent increases in NHS funding, and linked to future adjustments each year based on the latest planned NHS budget.\n\nFor the Voluntary Scheme to become sustainable, it needs to move away from a hard growth cap. Fairly sharing the costs and benefits of growth in medicine spending between government and industry will help restore the scheme in the long-term and return the UK to international competitiveness.\n\nQuotes from industry leaders:\n\nRussell Abberley, General Manager of Amgen UK & Ireland, said: \u201cThe VPAG Progress Report highlights the significant and acute challenges faced by the life sciences sector in the UK. In December 2024, the government announced that the VPAG payment rate for newer medicines would be set at 22.9% for 2025, well above expectations and putting sector growth and investment at risk. Global boardrooms are closely monitoring developments, concerned that the UK is further exacerbating its position as an international outlier. It is, therefore, crucial that government acts decisively to partner with industry to resolve this issue.\n\n\u201cIndustry remains committed to working with government, at pace and with urgency, in the run-up to the scheme\u2019s Autumn review. Together we must identify solutions that bring the Scheme back on track to meet its original objectives. Without government\u2019s partnership, our shared vision of making the UK a global life sciences hub will remain unrealised: impacting industry sustainability, the delivery of NHS transformation plans, and ultimately the government\u2019s plan for economic growth.\u201d\n\nTom Keith Roach, President, AstraZeneca UK, said: \"We are committed to working with the government to support UK science, boost investment, drive growth and deliver the productivity gains that are available through better health. However, the commercial environment needs to reflect the level of ambition the government has for the sector and we need to see a substantive and long term commitment to improvement as a key plank of the life sciences strategy\u201d\n\nKylie Bromley, Vice President and Managing Director of Biogen UK, said: \u201cThe size of the rebates and their unpredictability have had a major impact on our work in the UK and our investment here. We would love to celebrate the positive parts of the UK\u2019s life sciences ecosystem, but they are often over-shadowed by the fact that we are a noticeable international outlier for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nVani Manja, Country Managing Director and Head of Human Pharma Boehringer Ingelheim UK & Ireland, said: \u201cThe UK government needs to move away from considering innovative medicines as a cost to the economy and recognise them as a critical driver of better population health and improved productivity. Aligning government priorities for improving health and growing the economy could help ensure the pharmaceutical industry continues to invest in the UK.\u201d\n\nGuy Oliver, General Manager for Bristol Myers Squibb UK and Ireland, said: \"The current VPAG rate for 2025 is leaving UK patients increasingly behind those in comparable countries. The UK life-sciences industry is in decline, with fewer clinical trials, a decrease in the launch of innovative medicines, cuts to partnerships supporting the NHS, and workforce reductions across the sector. At BMS, we have had to make these difficult decisions, which contradict the government's ambition to collaborate with industry and foster growth.\n\n\u201cThe penalising and unpredictable nature of this revenue clawback makes it incredibly challenging to plan effectively and position the UK market attractively within global organisations. The UK lags far behind more dynamic markets in the competitive global race for investment. BMS is driven by our mission of bringing innovative medicines to the patients who need them, and it is deeply concerning that UK patients are missing out.\"\n\nLaura McMullin, General Manager, Daiichi Sankyo UK, said: \u201cDaiichi Sankyo is proud of our decades long commitment to the UK. It has been a privilege to collaborate with the NHS in supporting tens of thousands of patients across several disease areas. However, the stark reality is that it has been increasingly difficult for patients to get our medicines on the NHS and to conduct R&D here in recent years. Further clawbacks on medicine revenues will only impact the sector\u2019s appetite for investment further. This is neither in the interest of patients nor economic growth.\u201d\n\nPeter Wickersham, Vice President and General Manager, Gilead Sciences UK & Ireland, said: \u201cLife sciences companies are rapidly losing confidence in the UK as an attractive and predictable place to do business. A clear aim of the 2024 VPAG scheme is to drive access to medical innovation and growth of the UK life sciences sector. Yet this recent sharp and unexpected increase in the VPAG rate adds to the existing negative perception of the UK within global boardrooms and makes it harder to manage a successful UK business for many companies. The government must work with industry to address these commercial challenges as a priority, so that we can create a life sciences environment that fosters innovation and delivers better health outcomes for UK patients.\u201d\n\nRoz Bekker, Managing Director UK & Ireland, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, said: \u201cAt Johnson & Johnson we share the government\u2019s ambition to drive growth and innovation in life sciences to benefit patients and the country. However, there is a clear disconnect between this vision and the reality, which is locking the UK medicines market into managed long-term decline.\n\n\u201cA thriving life sciences ecosystem relies on a balanced, predictable and sustainable commercial environment. One that fosters innovation and ensures patients benefit from the best available treatments.\n\n\u201cA steep rise in the VPAG rate to 22.9%, coupled with an already challenging access environment, does not point towards a country that values innovation. Instead, it compromises product launches, jobs, UK investment in R&D and manufacturing. This effective tax on revenue, stands in stark comparison with that of Germany at 7% and Ireland at 9%.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need adjustments to bring rates back into line with international comparators. This will support the UK\u2019s return to a position of international competitiveness and critically, safeguard equitable access to innovative medicines for patients in the UK.\n\n\u201cAs a large UK investor, Johnson & Johnson is committed to working together with the government to help the UK realise its full potential, delivering for patients today and in the future.\u201d\n\nDoina Ionescu, Merck\u2019s General Manager for Healthcare in the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe new VPAG scheme was designed to balance medicines\u2019 costs for the NHS whilst encouraging growth and investment in the UK pharmaceutical industry. However, with a 2025 VPAG rate of 22.9%, this scheme, like its predecessor, continues to deter investment and prevent growth. The new scheme\u2019s rates remain unaffordable and will have an enormous impact on the resilience and outlook of medium sized companies such as Merck Serono, hampering our ability to discover innovative medicines and deliver them to patients. The new government has committed to improving healthcare and driving industry growth, but to do this they must address these VPAG rates and return the pharmaceutical industry to an internationally competitive position that will unlock investment and truly improve patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nBen Lucas, Managing Director for MSD in the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG) is a mutual challenge for the life sciences sector and government at a time when we have a shared ambition to drive better health outcomes and economic growth. We believe there is a real opportunity to drive transformational change in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) as we seek to meet this ambition and it transforms to a department that enables workforce productivity and economic growth. By working together to find a solution to the current challenges with the voluntary scheme, we believe that we can realise the ambitions of the Life Sciences Sector Plan and 10-Year Plan for the NHS, so that we maximise the benefits of medicines and vaccines to the NHS and population health, and ultimately restore the original intentions of the VPAG for the benefit of patients, the NHS, and the economy.\"\n\nJohan Kahlstr\u00f6m, Country President and Managing Director, UK & Ireland, Novartis, said: \u201cThe UK has rightly recognised the potential of life sciences as a key driver of economic growth. Making the UK a more attractive destination for life sciences requires a strong ecosystem where the value of innovation is adequately recognised. However, long-term underinvestment in medicines leading to unexpectedly high VPAG rebate rates, together with a challenging access and uptake environment, are making the UK increasingly uncompetitive in the race for global investment. The UK is lagging when compared to global competitors like the US, China, and Japan including lower investment in R&D, a smaller share of global clinical trials, and longer approval times for new medicines. Considering the value and growth stimulated by the industry and Novartis, we expect to see health and life sciences genuinely prioritised by the government. Urgent action is required to reverse this decline and provide the foundations needed for investment, growth and improved health of the UK population.\u201d\n\nJohn McGinley, Pfizer UK Country President and Managing Director, said: \u201cThe unexpected escalation in the VPAG rate to 22.9% is incompatible with the UK government\u2019s ambitions to be a global life sciences leader and accelerate innovation for UK patients. To secure investment, innovation, and improved health outcomes, we need an internationally competitive environment. We urge the government to work with industry to find a sustainable, long-term solution that supports both the NHS and the UK\u2019s future as a life sciences powerhouse.\u201d\n\nKaren Lightning-Jones, Market Access Director at Roche, said: \"At present, the VPAG scheme is not working in a way that is consistent with the government's ambition to encourage growth and investment from the UK life sciences sector. We hope that the upcoming review point later this year is an opportunity to consider this, especially the impact on international competitiveness and the ambition to reduce the rate over the course of the scheme.\"\n\nRippon Ubhi, Sanofi UK & Ireland Country Lead & General Manager, Specialty Care, said: \u201cThe UK is a significant outlier when it comes to low investment in medicines innovation and this needs to change if we want UK patients to access the best treatments, to be economically active and to present less demand on the NHS. Companies also won\u2019t invest when signals are negative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve committed to a deal that gives the UK time to return to international competitiveness, but this year\u2019s rate is a backward step following unprecedented growth in medicines usage and against a backdrop of increased investment in the NHS that included no investment in medicines. We need to work together to get back on a path to growth.\u201d\n\n\u015eeyda Atadan Memi\u015f, General Manager of Takeda in the UK & Ireland, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s clawback rate is now significantly higher than similar schemes in other countries, which sends a negative message to global boardrooms and is directly contradictory to the government\u2019s economic growth mission. This tax is compounded by the challenging environment for business, which has made the UK an outlier for Takeda.\n\n\u201cIf the UK is to realise the vision that will be set out in the upcoming Industrial Strategy and Life Science Sector Plan, we call on the government to urgently collaborate with industry to bring the UK\u2019s rebate back in line with international comparators. Taking action to avoid a similar situation for industry in future years is a pivotal step to enabling the full potential of the life sciences sector as a key partner to supporting the NHS, improving patient outcomes and driving economic growth.\u201d\n\nNico Reynders, General Manager, UCB UK & Ireland, said: \u201cThe VPAG has been put in place to help advance innovation in the UK healthcare system. We look forward to achieving a system where this innovation is rewarded and stimulated enabling patients in the UK to have access to the best treatments possible for their condition, in line with other European countries.\u201d",

MRT-2359 is an investigational, orally available GSPT1-directed MGD, discovered and developed by Monte Rosa Therapeutics.\n\nDiscover which therapies are expected to grab the molecular glues market share @ Molecular Glues Market Report\n\nMolecular Glues Market Dynamics\n\nA novel approach using native mass spectrometry has significantly advanced the understanding of stabilization mechanisms of covalent molecular glues by enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple protein species, shedding light on complex mechanisms at play. Research is increasingly focusing on the binding sites and protein interactions critical in cancer cells, as molecular glues show promise in circumventing drug resistance and improving cancer therapy outcomes.\n\nOngoing developments in medicinal chemistry aim to enhance the rational drug design of molecular glues, particularly their interaction with the immune system and their potential as small molecule drugs. Novel screening techniques, such as high-throughput screening and DNA-encoded libraries, are expected to expedite the discovery of effective molecular glues.\n\nHowever, the complexity of protein-protein interactions makes identifying effective candidates challenging, requiring significant time and resources. Ensuring specificity is crucial to avoid off-target effects and adverse reactions, which is essential for the safe use of molecular glues in clinical settings. While molecular glues hold substantial potential, gaining the trust of healthcare professionals will require educating them about their mechanisms and demonstrating solid proof of their effectiveness to support integration into everyday care.\n\nDespite advances in protein science, understanding compound-mediated protein\u2013protein binding, such as IMiDs binding to CRBN, remains limited, underscoring the need for detailed knowledge of these interfaces to design and develop effective molecular glues as new medicines.\n\nMolecular Glues Treatment Market\n\nAlthough many potential molecular glue compounds are being identified through drug discovery methods, only a few have advanced to clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness in treating diseases. Even fewer molecular glue therapies have secured regulatory approval and reached the market. However, companies and research organizations focused on molecular glue drug discovery are developing pipelines of therapeutics that are moving toward clinical evaluation.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb has successfully brought molecular glue compounds to market. Notable examples include POMALYST (pomalidomide), approved by the US FDA in 2013 for treating multiple myeloma, and REVLIMID (lenalidomide), approved in 2017 for multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and mantle cell lymphoma. Novartis has also introduced a molecular glue therapy, MEKINIST (trametinib), which was approved in 2017 for melanoma treatment.\n\nThe rational design of molecular glues is still in its early stages, but it represents a growing area of interest for innovative companies that are combining AI-driven methods with existing databases of molecular glue structures. A key focus is improving the understanding of degrons\u2014protein elements that serve as recognition signals for ubiquitin ligases, triggering protein degradation.\n\nEfforts are also underway to identify new ubiquitin ligases. Currently, cereblon is the most prominent ligase associated with molecular glue discovery. However, there are over 600 known human ubiquitin E3 ligases, some of which may offer cell-type specificity\u2014an important factor in reducing off-target effects in future molecular glue therapies.\n\nWhile most molecular glue degraders target intracellular proteins, there is growing interest in extending this approach to extracellular and membrane-bound proteins, which could open up new therapeutic possibilities.\n\nLearn more about the FDA-approved molecular glues @ Molecular Glues Drugs\n\nKey Emerging Molecular Glues and Companies\n\nThe emerging drug pipeline for molecular glues targeted therapies is diverse and includes several promising candidates, such as Iberdomide, Mezigdomide, and Golcadomide (Bristol Myers Squibb), SP-3164 (Salarius Pharmaceuticals), NST-628 (Nested Therapeutics), MRT-2359 (Monte Rosa Therapeutics), and others.\n\nMezigdomide is a powerful modulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing cereblon (CRL4-CRBN), with potential immunomodulatory and anticancer properties. The company is testing the drug in various clinical trials across different lines of therapy for treating NDMM and RRMM. The first approval of mezigdomide is expected by 2026\u20132027, with data from the Phase III SUCCESSOR-1 and SUCCESSOR-2 trials anticipated by 2026.\n\nNST-628 is an innovative, fully brain-penetrant, non-degrading pan-RAF/MEK molecular glue that targets the RAF and MEK nodes within the RAS-MAPK pathway. In preclinical studies, NST-628 showed antitumor activity and good tolerability when used alone or in combination with other treatments. In March 2024, the FDA approved the IND application for NST-628 to treat patients with advanced solid tumors carrying genetic alterations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. The study is expected to be completed by November 2029.\n\nMRT-2359 is a potent, selective, and orally available investigational molecular glue degrader (MGD) that promotes the interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase component cereblon and the translation termination factor GSPT1, resulting in the targeted breakdown of the GSPT1 protein. MYC transcription factors (c-MYC, L-MYC, and N-MYC) are well-known drivers of human cancers, sustaining high protein translation levels that fuel uncontrolled cell growth and tumor progression.\n\nIn December 2024, Monte Rosa Therapeutics reported that the dose-escalation phase of its Phase I/II trial of MRT-2359 showed a favorable safety profile and effective GSPT1 degradation with a 21-day-on, 7-day-off dosing regimen in heavily pretreated solid tumor patients. Additional clinical data from the Phase I/II study, including biomarker and activity insights, are expected in Q1 2025.\n\nThe anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the molecular glues market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the molecular glues market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo know more about molecular glues clinical trials, visit @ Molecular Glues Treatment Drugs\n\nMolecular Glues Overview\n\nMolecular glues are small molecules that promote or stabilize protein\u2013protein interactions, often leading to targeted protein degradation or functional modulation. Unlike traditional small-molecule inhibitors, which typically block protein activity, molecular glues work by facilitating the interaction between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This results in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the target protein. Molecular glues are highly attractive in drug discovery because they enable the targeting of proteins that were previously considered \"undruggable\" due to a lack of suitable binding pockets or catalytic activity. By promoting proximity between two proteins, they essentially hijack the cell's natural protein degradation machinery to eliminate disease-causing proteins.\n\nMolecular glues have gained significant attention in cancer therapy, particularly in the development of selective degraders for oncogenic proteins. One of the most well-known examples is the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like thalidomide, which recruit the E3 ligase cereblon to degrade transcription factors involved in hematological cancers. Beyond cancer, molecular glues are being explored for treating neurodegenerative diseases and immune disorders. Their ability to target proteins involved in complex cellular pathways makes them versatile tools in precision medicine. Advances in structural biology and chemical biology have accelerated the discovery of novel molecular glues, highlighting their potential to reshape the therapeutic landscape.\n\nMolecular Glues Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nThe indication-wise eligible cases of melanoma in the US comprised nearly 105,000 in 2024.

Sofinnova Partners, a leading European life sciences venture capital firm based in Paris, London, and Milan, addresses this challenge by providing crucial funding, operational expertise, and access to a vast network of industry professionals. This comprehensive support helps startups overcome financial and operational obstacles to bring their innovations to market.\n\nToday, the firm announced the final close of Sofinnova Biovelocita II.

It now encompasses France, the United Kingdom, and Denmark, with plans to expand to additional European countries.\n\nHow Sofinnova Partners bridges the innovation gap in life sciences\n\nSofinnova Partners traces its roots to Sofinnova SA, established in 1972 in Paris with support from several French financial institutions, notably Cr\u00e9dit National. The venture capital firm was founded to create an \u201cAmerican-style\u201d venture capital operation in France. Its focus on breakthrough therapies, such as BioClec\u2019s work on Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Forth Therapeutics\u2019 fibrosis treatments, demonstrates its commitment to transforming healthcare.\n\nThe firm brings together global professionals with deep scientific, medical, and business expertise. With offices in Paris, London, and Milan, Sofinnova Partners is a hands-on company builder throughout the life sciences investment chain, from the seed stage to later phases. This approach leverages over a decade of expertise in startup acceleration, biotech, and MedTech, which has proven instrumental in creating pioneering ventures.\n\nToday, Sofinnova Partners manages over \u20ac4 billion in assets, backed by 50 years of experience supporting more than 500 companies and creating market leaders worldwide.\n\nBiovelocita II Fund: Over 300 projects and several investments\n\nLed by Partners Gabriella Camboni, Matthieu Coutet, Alex Leech, and Zhizhong Joel Yao, Sofinnova Biovelocita II stands as the largest pan-European biotech accelerator, dedicated to creating, building, and managing the next generation of biotech startups.\n\nSince its launch, the Biovelocita II Fund has evaluated over 300 projects and made several key investments across Europe, advancing cutting-edge biotechnology innovation. Notable newly established companies include BioClec, focused on breakthrough Alzheimer\u2019s therapies; Forth Therapeutics, a University of Edinburgh spin-out developing next-generation precision therapeutics for fibrosis; and Signadori Bio, a novel cell therapy platform developed from Gustave Roussy Institute research.\n\nGraziano Seghezzi, Managing Partner of Sofinnova Partners, stated: \u201cBuilding on the success of Biovelocita I in Italy, we have developed a pan-European strategy and assembled a world-class team to create and manage companies across the European biotech ecosystem. The strong response from our pharmaceutical partners and the fact that we exceeded our fundraising target underscores the demand for such an approach. This achievement highlights our commitment to fostering biotech innovation, supporting visionary entrepreneurs, and shaping the future of healthcare.\u201d\n\nAs Sofinnova continues to support entrepreneurs and drive innovation, its position as a leader in European venture capital will strengthen further.

The disease is considered incurable, with patients often relapsing following front-line therapy and their prognosis worsening after each subsequent relapse.\n\nBMS\u2019 Breyanzi is made from patients\u2019 own T cells, which are collected and genetically re-engineered to become CAR T cells that are then delivered via infusion as a one-time treatment.\n\nEmma Charles, senior vice president, Europe Region, BMS, said: \u201cWhile significant advancements have been made in the last two decades, there still remains unmet need for patients. Newer treatments for FL, like Breyanzi, have shown impactful results in clinical trials, with the opportunity to deliver lasting results in the routine care setting.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes just days after BMS received EC approval for its dual immunotherapy combination in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.\n\nOpdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) was authorised for use as a first-line treatment for adults with unresectable or advanced cases of the disease after results from the late-stage CheckMate-9DW trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival with the combination compared to investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib.",

Their pipeline includes immune-modulatory antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, and vaccine adjuvants.\n\nProduct Pipeline: The company's pipeline features several immunotherapy assets, including botensilimab (a CTLA-4 blocking antibody) and balstilimab (a PD-1 blocking antibody), both of which are in various stages of clinical trials for different cancer types.\n\nStrategic Partnerships: Agenus has established strategic partnerships with companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Betta Pharmaceuticals, UroGen Pharma, Gilead Sciences, Incyte Corporation, and Merck to advance its product development and commercialization efforts.\n\nClinical Trials: The company is actively conducting clinical trials for its lead candidates, botensilimab and balstilimab, in combination and as monotherapies, targeting various cancers including metastatic colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma.\n\nRegulatory Designations: In April 2023, the combination of botensilimab and balstilimab received Fast Track designation from the FDA for treating certain types of metastatic colorectal cancer, highlighting the potential of these therapies in addressing unmet medical needs.\n\nSubsidiary Operations: MiNK Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Agenus, focuses on developing allogeneic invariant natural killer T cell therapies, with ongoing clinical trials in gastric cancer and viral acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nVaccine Adjuvant Development: SaponiQx, another subsidiary, is advancing the development of QS-21 STIMULON, a saponin-based adjuvant used in vaccines, with efforts to create a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process.\n\nManufacturing Capabilities: Agenus has in-house capabilities for antibody manufacturing, including a facility in Berkeley, California, which supports the production of clinical-grade materials for its antibody programs.\n\nFuture Outlook: The company plans to focus resources on the development, registration, and commercialization of its botensilimab/balstilimab program, with potential expansion into additional cancer indications and strategic partnerships to support these efforts.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Collaborations: Agenus Inc. has focused on strategic partnerships and collaborations to advance its immuno-oncology portfolio. Key initiatives include collaborations with companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and Gilead to develop and commercialize novel therapies. The company has also launched SaponiQx to innovate in vaccine adjuvant discovery and design, partnering with Ginkgo Bioworks to develop saponin products. Additionally, MiNK Therapeutics, a subsidiary, is expanding its clinical programs and has secured private placement financing to support the development of its CAR-iNKT cell therapy.\n\nCapital Management: Agenus has engaged in several capital management activities, including the sale of future royalties and milestones to Ligand Pharmaceuticals, which provided $75 million in gross proceeds. The company has also executed at-the-market offerings, raising $37.5 million through the sale of common stock. Additionally, Agenus has a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Ligand, which involves a synthetic royalty on net sales of botensilimab and balstilimab. The company has also managed its debt, with $35.2 million in principal outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n\nFuture Outlook: Agenus plans to continue its strategic focus on partnerships and collaborations to support its operations and advance its product candidates. The company is in discussions with various entities to secure additional funding necessary for its botensilimab/balstilimab registration and launch strategy. Despite current liquidity challenges, Agenus expects to explore additional out-licensing agreements, asset sales, and equity securities sales to support its ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nFinancial Risks: The company faces significant financial risks due to its history of net losses and the expectation of continued losses in the future. The need for additional capital is critical, as failure to secure financing could impede the development and commercialization of product candidates. The company\u2019s reliance on raising capital through equity offerings, debt financings, and strategic partnerships may lead to dilution of existing stockholders and operational restrictions.\n\nDevelopment and Clinical Risks: The development of the company\u2019s product candidates, particularly botensilimab and combination therapy programs, is fraught with uncertainty. Clinical trials may reveal adverse events or lack of efficacy, and difficulties in patient enrollment could delay progress. The company\u2019s limited resources are strained by the simultaneous advancement of multiple product candidates, which could hinder successful development.\n\nRegulatory Risks: Regulatory risks are significant, as the approval process is lengthy and uncertain. The company may face challenges in obtaining regulatory approval for its novel molecular entities, and even if approved, products may not achieve market acceptance or could be subject to unfavorable pricing regulations.\n\nManufacturing and Supply Chain Risks: Manufacturing and supply chain risks are also prominent. The company\u2019s own manufacturing infrastructure is costly and time-consuming to build and qualify, and any challenges could result in insufficient quantities of drug candidates.\n\nLiquidity and Market Risks: Management acknowledges the need for additional capital to fund operations and complete clinical development. The company\u2019s cash resources are projected to satisfy liquidity requirements only through the second quarter of 2025, highlighting the urgency of securing further financing. Management is focused on streamlining operations to prioritize lead programs, but this strategy carries the risk of missing opportunities with other product candidates. The company is exposed to market risks, including the volatility of financial markets and economic conditions, which could impact its ability to raise additional funds. Geopolitical tensions, such as the conflicts in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, add to the uncertainty and could adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and stock price. Additionally, the company\u2019s obligations under promissory notes and finance leases could materially affect liquidity if not managed properly.\n\nSEC Filing: AGENUS INC [ AGEN ] - 10-K - Mar. 17, 2025",

            "content": "2seventy bio investors were understandably happy this past week when Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) agreed to acquire its partner in developing the blockbuster multiple myeloma drug Abecma\u00ae (idecabtagene vicleucel), 2seventy bio, for approximately $286 million.\n\nThe pending deal sent 2seventy shares soaring 77%. However, BMS shares slipped 6.5% this week on news of the acquisition, sliding from $63.11 the day before the announcement to $59.01 at Friday\u2019s closing bell.\n\nWhy have BMS investors been anything but positive about acquiring 2seventy?\n\nThe answer stems from uncertainty over how competitive Abecma will continue to be in the multiple myeloma space given an existing blockbuster rival and the prospect of a new competitor drug coming next year. Both of them, like Abecma, fight multiple myeloma by targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA).\n\nAccording to BMS, Abecma generated a total of $406 million in worldwide product revenue, most of which consisted of $242 million in U.S. revenue. Worldwide revenue for Abecma fell 14% from 2023 overall, which despite a 44% jump in ex-U.S. revenues could not make up for declining U.S. revenue. However, U.S. revenue remained within 2seventy\u2019s guidance to investors of between $240 million and $250 million.\n\nU.S. commercial revenue is split between 2seventy and BMS, which said U.S. revenue fell 32% from 2023. Even more sobering for Abecma, BMS took a $122 million impairment charge for the drug during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company\u2019s Form 10-K annual report for 2024, which said the move was \u201cprimarily resulting from a reduced cash flow forecast due to the evolving competitive landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impairment charge represented a full write-down of the asset,\u201d BMS added.\n\nThe competitive landscape is now dominated by Carvykti\u00ae (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), the BCMA-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy co-marketed by Janssen Biotech (Johnson & Johnson) and Legend Biotech. Carvykti finished 2024 with more than twice the annual sales of Abecma\u2014$963 million in worldwide sales, up nearly double (93%) from $500 million in 2023.\n\nBroader label\n\nA key reason why Carvykti enjoys greater sales is its broader prescribing label compared with Abecma. While both drugs were approved for earlier than fourth line treatment of multiple myeloma last year, Abecma can only be prescribed for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in patients previously treated with two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\n\nCarvykti, however, is indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and are refractory to lenalidomide.\n\n\u201cBy the end of this year, we fully expect that two-thirds or maybe three-quarters of our revenue will come in from second to fourth line,\u201d Legend Bio CEO Ying Huang, PhD, told analysts on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call Tuesday. \u201cTherefore, we think we\u2019re very well positioned to enter into 2026 because by then, the large overwhelming majority of our revenue mix will come in from the second to fourth line.\n\nJefferies equity analyst Kelly Shi, PhD, predicts sales of Carvykti will nearly double again this year. \u201cWe see sales growth momentum to continue in 2025, reaching $1.9B (+92% [year over year]), driven primarily by strong 2-4 L demand and manuf[acturing] expansion,\u201d Shi wrote in a research note.\n\nAt peak year, J&J expects Carvykti peak sales to exceed $5 billion, CFO Joseph Wolk said last year, though Morgan Stanley has projected approximately $8 billion for the drug, vs. about $5 billion for Abecma.\n\nBut as a few other analysts noted in research notes this past week, the competitive landscape in multiple myeloma may change significantly next year, when Kite, a Gilead company, and Arcellx are expected to launch their own BCMA-targeting multiple myeloma treatment.\n\nThat treatment is anitocabtagene autoleucel (\u201canito-cel\u201d), a BCMA-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy that uses Arcellx\u2019s novel binder (or CAR) known as the D-Domain. Kite and Arcellx reason that anito-cel is effective because its small size (8 kilodaltons) facilitates high T-cell transduction and expression, resulting in more CAR positive cells and more CARs expressed per T cell.\n\nPositive preliminary data\n\nAt the American Society of Hematology 2024 Annual Meeting (ASH 2024), held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, Arcellx presented positive preliminary data from 58 patients in the registrational Phase II pivotal iMMagine-1 trial (NCT05396885), showing a 95% overall response rate (ORR) and a 62% complete response/stringent complete response rate (CR/sCR) at a median follow-up of 10.3 months.\n\nEven more impressive: Of the 39 patients evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, 36 (92%) achieved MRD negativity at least to the level of 10-5. Patients also showed a Kaplan\u2013Meier-estimated six-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 90% with individual patients ranging from 77% to 96%. The patients\u2019 overall survival (OS) rate was 95%, with individual patients ranging from 85% to 98%.\n\nAn earlier Phase I study in 38 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had \u22653 prior lines of therapy demonstrated ORR of 100%, a CR/sCR rate of 76%, and an estimated 24-month PFS rate of 56%. Both the Phase I and Phase II trials showed no reports of patients with delayed neurotoxicity, cranial nerve palsies, Guillain Barre syndrome, or Parkinsonian-like symptoms, the researchers added.\n\n\u201cThus far, anito-cel has an efficacy profile in line with market leader Carvykti, and movement neurotoxicity (MNT) safety profile in line with Abecma\u2014threatening Abecma\u2019s niche as the option for patients who want to avoid the risk of MNTs like Parkinsonism,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Daina M. Graybosch, PhD, cautioned in a research note.\n\n\u201cAny acquirer still has to consider market uncertainty with Kite/Arcellx\u2019s expected 2026 launch of a third BCMA CAR-T, anito-cel,\u201d added Graybosch. She downgraded the firm\u2019s rating on 2seventy from \u201cOutperform\u201d to \u201cMarket Perform\u201d and lowered its 12-month price target from $9 to $5 a share.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Matt Phipps, PhD, wrote in a research note that the competitive landscape wasn\u2019t enough to short-circuit BMS\u2019 acquisition of 2seventy, but was reason for concern.\n\n\u201cHeadwinds for Abecma\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see little risk to the [BMS-2seventy] deal, but also acknowledge the headwinds for Abecma given the competitive landscape in multiple myeloma, and therefore do not believe this materially changes the outlook for the company,\u201d Phipps wrote, referring to BMS. He reiterated the firm\u2019s \u201cMarket Perform\u201d rating on BMS shares.\n\nSami Corwin, PhD, Phipps\u2019 colleague at William Blair who is also a biotech analyst, noted separately that Kite and Arcellx are expected to release updated results from iMMagine-1 \u201cwhich we believe will be a significant catalyst for the stock and could further de-risk a future regulatory submission.\n\nCorwin said the interim data presented for anito-cel seen in iMMagine-1 last fall were comparable to Janssen\u2019s Phase Ib/II CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) assessing Carvykti, completed in 2022\u2014but with \u201cclear safety benefits\u201d that included lower cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) rates, and death rates attributable to treatment.\n\nOther positives for Arcellx, she wrote, was its partnership with Kite given its abilities as a strategic partner and the economics of the collaboration.\n\nThe companies announced their collaboration in December 2022, with Kite at the time agreeing to pay Arcellx $225 million in upfront cash, a $100 million equity investment, and other unspecified payments tied to milestones.\n\nIn November 2023, the companies expanded their collaboration to include lymphomas, with Kite agreeing in return to pay Arcellx an additional upfront non-dilutive cash payment of $85 million and another equity investment of $200 million, plus additional milestone payments that include advancement of a lymphoma program and a possible future license by Kite to Arcellx\u2019s ACLX-001 multiple myeloma program based on Arcellx\u2019s ARC-SparX platform.\n\nThe companies could generate even more money with an expanded label for anito-cel.\n\n\u201cAlthough the near-term focus for anito-cel will center around the potential launch in the late-line setting, we think expansion into the early-line setting could shortly follow if the companies leverage MRD-negativity as a surrogate endpoint in the iMMagine-3 study for accelerated approval,\u201d Corwin added.\n\nLeaders and laggards",

The pharmaceutical industry is no stranger to illegal practices and scandals involving shady businesses, leading to more money. Some of the largest drug companies have faced backlash for price hikes, lying to the public and FDA, unsavory business practices, and misleading data. Here are ten of the largest pharmaceutical scandals.\n\nRelated: 10 Business Scandals So Big They Shook the Economy\n\n10 Pfizer Celebrex Scandal\n\nCelebrex study shows less risk to heart health than expected\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nIn 2012, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was cherry-picking safety data for Celebrex. A lawsuit against the company revealed that research executives falsely represented data to fool the medical community about how effective the anti-arthritis drug was. The one-year study showed that Celebrex was no safer than other anti-inflammatory drugs. Still, the six-month data from the same study showed that the drug was safer on the stomach. Researchers promoted the six-month data to claim that the drug was superior to others, such as ibuprofen.\n\nDocuments revealed emails between researchers and executives that prove Pfizer officials used strategic decisions to make the data appear better. Celebrex was one of the most profitable drugs from Pfizer, but the company was forced to pay out more than $164 million to settle an investor class action lawsuit. The company still denied any wrongdoing.[1]\n\n9 EpiPen Scandal\n\nEpiPen Price Increase: Scandal Or Just Business?\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe EpiPen has literally been a lifesaver for many people suffering from a deadly allergic reaction. The product only cost Mylan about $1 to manufacture an EpiPen two-pack, but the company took advantage of the vital product. They decided to raise the price from $100 to more than $600 for consumers.\n\nIn their first five years of owning EpiPen, Mylan spent almost $8 million in lobbying to make their product mandatory in schools, and soon it was permitted or required in most states. Then, they lobbied to make a law that gave financial incentives to states requiring EpiPen. Once the government was on the hook, Mylan continued to raise the price until it toppled $600.\n\nAn investigation was launched into the large price hike, but Mylan defended the increase due to improvements made to the product. Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to resolve claims that the company avoided paying rebates owed primarily to Medicaid by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic drug.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Merck Vioxx Scandal\n\nThe Vioxx Scandal: Merck\u2019s Release of New Drug Despite Knowing Its Dangers to Users | SLICE EXPERTS\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nVioxx was a popular drug used to reduce pain and inflammation, and Merck, its manufacturer, had hoped to prove that the anti-inflammatory drug would reign superior over other similar drugs. The drug appeared to be doing its intended job, but studies revealed it was linked to an increase in strokes and heart attacks. The studies eventually led to a voluntary recall of the drug.\n\nThe FDA approved the drug in 1999 after data showed a low risk of cardiovascular illness. Studies then began showing the risks that Vioxx was having on patients, but Merck continued to claim that the studies were flawed. The FDA failed to act after seeing proof of the dangers the drug was causing, leading to rumors that Merck and the FDA were covering up potential health concerns. The disaster eventually led to fines and lawsuits.[3]\n\n7 Rochester Drug Cooperatives Opioid Scandal\n\nFeds: Fmr. Rochester drug company execs kept selling opioids to shady pharmacies\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe opioid epidemic centers on the rapid increase in abuse and overdose deaths attributed to drugs classified as opioids. Opioids are highly effective for treating pain, but they pose a risk of being addictive and could lead to overdose deaths. More than 600,000 Americans died from opioid use from 1999 to 2021. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors were blamed by the government for their role in fueling the epidemic, and soon, they would pay for their roles.\n\nRochester Drug Cooperative (RDC), a pharmaceutical wholesale distributor, was the first to be accused of drug trafficking as part of the opioid crisis. They were accused of shipping massive amounts of highly addictive drugs to pharmacies that they knew were illegally dispensing them. RDC admitted to drug trafficking and was soon shut down and declared bankruptcy.\n\nLaurence Doud, CEO of RDC, was later sentenced to 27 months in prison for his role in the crisis. The U.S. attorney claimed that Doud cared more about his paycheck than preventing opioids from making their way to people struggling with addiction.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Valeant Scandal\n\nThe Valeant Fraud Explained\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nValeant rightfully received anger from everyone over the dramatic drug price hikes at its firms, and this led to a federal prosecutor\u2019s investigation into the way the company priced and distributed its drugs. The price of drugs such as Isuprel, Isoprenaline, and Nitropress was rising before Valeant purchased them, but they then boosted Isuprel by six-fold and Nitropress four-fold after acquiring them.\n\nIn 2016, former executives Gary Tanner and Andrew Davenport were charged with running kickback schemes, and they were accused of conspiring to set up Philidor as a place to distribute their drugs. Former CEO Michael Pearson was investigated for possible fraud earlier in the year. Valeant has always conducted business in a shady manner, and price gauging their customers was only a piece of the pie.[5]\n\n5 Questcor Price Hike Scandal\n\nBig Pharma Greed Knows No Bounds As Infant Medication Increases By Nearly 100000%\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nQuestcor Pharmaceuticals is responsible for one of the largest drug price hikes in American history. Two whistleblowers from the company claimed that Questcor bribed doctors to increase sales of its drugs. The strategy was to help boost the sales of H.P. Acthar Gel, a drug that is known for treating a rare infant seizure disorder. The $40 vial of the medication in 2000 rose to around $39,000 in less than 10 years, almost a 97,000% increase.\n\nThe whistleblowers revealed that the company did everything from lying to the Food and Drug Administration to offering bribes if it led to more sales. The price increase led to more than $1 billion in annual sales for Questcor. About 25% of Acthar sales went through Medicare, and revenue from Medicare went from about $50 million in 2011 to $725 million by 2018. Not only were they hiking the price for individuals, but they were also robbing the government.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Merck MMR Scandal\n\nMarch 9, 2025 Cover Story MMR Whistleblower\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe MMR vaccine protects against Measles, Mumps, and Rubella and is usually administered in two doses to infants and young children in America. The MMR vaccine by Merck has also quietly been part of a scandal for the past 25 years. Merck faced a potential product recall of the vaccine in 1999 because the product might have been defective. The problem arose when the FDA found a potency issue with the vaccine. The live virus in the vaccine that makes the shot work was dying off due to the vaccine sitting on shelves for too long.\n\nMerck started \u201coverfilling\u201d by putting more of the virus into the vaccine to hope it would last longer, but the virus was still dying off too fast. The FDA hit Merck with two warnings for failing to report vaccine doses that might not meet potency requirements.\n\nLab workers for the company said they were told to change the date for it to look better. They ultimately filed a whistleblower lawsuit for taxpayer fraud. The case dragged on for years but was later dismissed before trial. Merck has denied any wrongdoing, but questions have been raised about whether the vaccine\u2019s potency has led to outbreaks among vaccinated people.[7]\n\n3 Roche Fraud Scandal\n\nRoche Obesity Pill Study: What Are the Side Effects of the Weight-Loss Drug?\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nRoche Pharmaceutical Group failed to properly report thousands of potential side effects that led to illnesses and death. The European Commission investigated allegations that the drug company failed to provide accurate details on the side effects of 19 medications. The initial reports showed that Roche could have been fined around $685 million for failure to report.\n\nAfter years of inspections, the European Commission closed the case after Roche worked diligently to remediate the deficiencies quickly and enhance their medical compliance. Even though the outcome was expected to be worse for the company, thousands of deaths may still be linked to the company for hiding their side effects.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Abilify Scandal\n\nAbilify: The Drug That Seriously Harms Your Impulse Control Center\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company were collaborative partners in the development and commercialization of Abilify, an antipsychotic medication used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. An investigation by 43 states was launched to look into the marketing of Abilify for off-label uses. They alleged that Bristol-Myers Squibb promoted the drug for unapproved uses, especially for elderly patients with dementia.\n\nA medication guide from Otsuka stated that the medication could produce an increased risk of death in elderly people with dementia. Bristol-Myers Squibb denied any wrongdoing, but they did agree to marketing restraints. The company also paid $19.5 million to settle the allegations that they promoted Abilify for unapproved uses and misled doctors about the potential dangers of the antipsychotic medication.[9]\n\n1 Pharma Bro Scandal\n\nMartin Shkreli: The Pharma Bro Scandal \u2013 Greed, Controversy & Justice\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nOne of the most well-known pharmaceutical scandals involves the infamous and hated \u201cPharma Bro.\u201d Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, was given the nickname after he was to blame for jacking up the price of medication. Daraprim was a medication that treated a rare parasitic disease that attacked cancer patients, AIDS patients, and pregnant women. The price of Daraprim rose from $13.50 a pill to about $750.\n\nShkreli said his decision to jack up the price was capitalism at work. Still, his choice sparked outrage all around America. In 2015, he was arrested on securities fraud charges related to hedge funds he was involved with, and the next day, he resigned as CEO of the company. He was convicted of the crime and was given a seven-year prison sentence. Shkreli was also ordered to return $64.6 million in profits that his former company gained by raising the price of Daraprim.[10]\n\nfact checked by Darci Heikkinen",

The LTE trial included the 52-week POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 studies, involving 1,221 participants who received a 6mg daily dose of open-label Sotyktu.In February 2025, Vyne Therapeutics initiated a randomized Phase Ib clinical trial by dosing the first participant with VYN202, an oral therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study includes three dosing groups to evaluate the treatment's safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability. Participants will receive either 0.25mg, 0.5mg, or 1mg doses of VYN202, or a placebo, administered once daily over a 12-week period.In December 2024, Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) announced findings from the POETYK PsA-1 (IM011-054) and POETYK PsA-2 (IM011-055) Phase 3 trials assessing the efficacy and safety of Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Both studies achieved their primary endpoint, demonstrating a significantly higher percentage of Sotyktu-treated patients attaining an ACR20 response-indicating at least a 20% improvement in disease signs and symptoms-after 16 weeks of treatment compared to placebo.In October 2024, InnoCare Pharma has reported that its Phase II clinical trial of the Tyrosine Kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor ICP-488 for psoriasis treatment achieved the primary endpoint. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ICP-488 in adult Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.In August 2024, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced that Otezla Registered (apremilast) is now available in the U.S. for pediatric use. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Otezla for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 6 and older, weighing at least 20 kg (44 lb), and who are suitable candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

Despite drug development advances in the past decade, patient survey data suggest that moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris is being undertreated.\n\nFor further information on the market impact by therapies, download the Psoriasis Vulgaris sample @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Therapeutic Scenario\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Overview\n\nPsoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder characterized by red, scaly, and inflamed plaques that commonly appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly triggers rapid skin cell turnover, causing an excessive buildup of skin cells.\n\nThe exact cause remains unknown, but genetics, immune dysfunction, and environmental factors play key roles. Psoriasis vulgaris Triggers include stress, infections, medications (e.g., beta-blockers, NSAIDs), smoking, alcohol, and cold weather.\n\nCommon Psoriasis vulgaris symptoms include itching, burning, and skin cracking, which can significantly impact quality of life. Some patients also develop psoriatic arthritis, causing joint pain and stiffness.\n\nPsoriasis vulgaris Treatment options range from topical therapies (steroids, vitamin D analogs), phototherapy, systemic medications (methotrexate, cyclosporine), and biologic drugs targeting inflammatory pathways like TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-23 inhibitors.\n\nWhile no cure exists, lifestyle modifications, such as moisturizing, stress management, and avoiding triggers, help manage symptoms. Early diagnosis and personalized treatment are crucial for minimizing flares and improving skin health.\n\nFor severe cases, biologics have revolutionized treatment, offering long-term control and better patient outcomes. Regular follow-ups with dermatologists and rheumatologists ensure effective disease management.\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nAs per the assessment of DelveInsight, Psoriasis is the most common inflammatory disease in the United States, affecting as many as 8 million Americans and this number is expected to increase during the study period.\n\nAs per DelveInsight's estimates, the total diagnosed prevalent cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris in the US are estimated to be more than 6 million in 2021, the highest among the 7MM and are predicted to increase during the study period (2019-2032).\n\nIt is observed that about 80-90% of people living with psoriasis experience Psoriasis Vulgaris and approximately 20% of people suffering from Psoriasis have moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris.\n\nThe Psoriasis Vulgaris Market report offers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2019-2032 in the 7MM segmented into\n\nTotal Prevalent Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nGender-specific Prevalent Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nAge-specific Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nSeverity-specific Prevalence of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nKeen to learn how Psoriasis Vulgaris Epidemiological Trends are going to appear in 2032 for the 7 MM, Download @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Prevalence\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Outlook\n\nAlthough Psoriasis Vulgaris cannot be permanently cured, therapeutic interventions for localized Psoriasis Vulgaris should begin with patient education and the use of topical corticosteroids with or without coal tar or calcipotriene. Thereafter, anthralin or tazarotene, alone or in combination with steroids, can be used following first-line treatment failure or subsequent loss of response to first-line therapy. Alternatively, if control is difficult to achieve or disease is widespread, phototherapy, with and without drugs such as psoralen or retinoids, may be required.\n\nThere are many FDA-approved Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment therapies available in the market. Some of these include Skyrizi produced by AbbVie which was approved by the FDA in April 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Ilumya is manufactured by Sun Pharma (also known by its generic name tildrakizumab-asmn), it was FDA approved in March 2018 for moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment in adults.

Other FDA-approved and currently marketed Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment drugs include Cimzia by UCB, Inc., Taltz (ixekizumab) by Eli Lilly and Company, and Cosentyx (secukinumab) by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and Otezla (apremilast) from Amgen.\n\nThe dynamics of the Psoriasis Vulgaris market are anticipated to change in the coming years owing to the improvement in the research and development activities for efficient treatment options to be available in the market. It includes several Psoriasis Vulgaris pipeline therapies such as DMB-3115, Deucravacitinib, BAT2306, and others under investigation by key Psoriasis Vulgaris market players such as Meiji Seika Pharma, Dermavant Sciences, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Bio-Thera Solutions, Amgen, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, UCB Pharma, and many others.\n\nDiscover more about therapy set to grab substantial Psoriasis Vulgaris market share @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Treatment Market\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Dynamics\n\nDelveInsight's analysts estimate that the Psoriasis Vulgaris market is poised to show significant growth in the coming years, mainly attributed to increasing cases, recent drug approvals, and the anticipated launch of novel therapies during the forecast period.\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Driver\n\nAlthough topical agents help in providing symptomatic relief, they neither mitigate disease progression nor cure the disease.

            "content": "Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY \u2013 Research Report), the Healthcare sector company, was revisited by a Wall Street analyst yesterday. Analyst Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley maintained a Sell rating on the stock and has a $37.00 price target.\n\nTerence Flynn has given his Sell rating due to a combination of factors related to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s current and future prospects. One of the primary concerns is the company\u2019s reliance on Cobenfy, particularly in the context of its high exposure to loss of exclusivity in the latter part of the decade. Although the upcoming ARISE trial data for Cobenfy as an adjunctive therapy in schizophrenia is anticipated, Flynn believes that the more significant catalyst for the stock will be the Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis (ADP) data expected later.\n\nThe projections for Cobenfy\u2019s sales, including its use in monotherapy and adjunctive settings, are substantial, but the success of these projections heavily depends on future trial outcomes. Flynn notes that if the ARISE trial results are negative or if the drug\u2019s tolerability is less favorable, it could hinder its uptake. Additionally, the necessity for a second ADP trial for approval adds uncertainty to the drug\u2019s future success. These factors contribute to Flynn\u2019s cautious stance and the Sell rating for Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this biopharmaceutical company have returned +10% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.2% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Bristol Myers belongs, has gained 2.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Bristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of +135.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +487%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.07 indicates a change of -10% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Bristol Myers is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb Acquires Cancer Cell Therapy Partner 2seventy Bio in $286M Deal\n\nby Bernice Lottering Share To\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is taking full control of ABECMA\u2014its blockbuster multiple myeloma cell therapy\u2014by acquiring its partner, 2seventy bio, in a $286 million deal. 2seventy bio, which spun off from Bluebird Bio in 2021, has ABECMA as its last remaining asset. Currently, BMS (NASDAQ: BMY) and 2seventy share U.S. commercialization of the therapy, but this buyout gives BMS full ownership as it navigates an increasingly competitive multiple myeloma market. The acquisition could also help push forward innovation in cancer cell therapy.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb Acquires 2seventy Bio in $286M Deal, Paying $5 Per Share with a 78.5% Premium\n\nBMS is set to fully acquire 2seventy bio in a $286 million deal, taking complete control of ABECMA, their top-selling CAR T cell therapy for multiple myeloma. The move comes after a turbulent three years for 2seventy, which spun off from Bluebird Bio in 2021. Once led by Bluebird\u2019s longtime CEO Nick Leschly\u2014who dubbed himself as \u201cchief kairos officer\u201d\u2014the company shifted focus exclusively to ABECMA last year under current CEO Chip Baird. BMS, already responsible for ABECMA\u2019s manufacturing and ex-U.S. commercialization, is now bringing the entire operation in-house as competition in the multiple myeloma space heats up.\n\n2seventy\u2019s financial struggles paved the way for this deal. The company posted a $217.57 million net loss in 2023 on just over $100 million in revenue, prompting major cost-cutting moves, including a 40% workforce reduction in September 2023, followed by another 14% cut (around 30 jobs) in early 2024.\n\nUnder the terms announced Monday night, BMS will pay $5 per share, a 78.5% premium over 2seventy\u2019s closing price but a sharp drop from its $38 debut price in 2021. Factoring in 2seventy\u2019s cash reserves, the net deal value stands at $102 million. \u201cA year ago, 2seventy decided to focus entirely on unlocking the value of ABECMA,\u201d said CEO Chip Baird, emphasizing the therapy\u2019s potential to extend time for multiple myeloma patients. Now, with BMS taking the reins, the pharma giant aims to push cell therapy innovation even further.\n\nAbecma Received FDA Approval in 2021 for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma After Four or More Lines of Therapy\n\nABECMA, a BCMA-directed genetically modified autologous T cell therapy, originally won FDA approval in 2021 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more lines of therapy. A label expansion last year lowered the threshold to two prior treatments, broadening its reach.\n\nIn 2021, 2seventy Bio spun off from Bluebird Bio, inheriting its cancer cell therapies and $442 million in funding. This followed ABECMA\u2019s approval as the first CAR T-therapy for multiple myeloma, though its early lead was quickly challenged when Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech gained FDA approval for CARVYKTI. CARVYKTI is now the only BCMA-targeted treatment approved by the U.S. FDA for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after just one prior line of therapy.\n\nLast year, the FDA expanded ABECMA\u2019s approval to include third-line treatment for multiple myeloma, broadening its market potential. However, this decision came alongside CARVYKTI\u2019s expanded approval for second-line use in multiple myeloma. While CARVYKTI holds this advantage, it is associated with a movement disorder side effect, which has not been observed with ABECMA.\n\nAs the competition in the multiple myeloma treatment space intensifies, ABECMA faces additional pressure from emerging therapies targeting the same BCMA protein. It competes not only with CARVYKTI but also with Gilead Sciences and Arcellx\u2019s candidate, anitocabtagene autoleucel (anito-cel), which is expected to reach the market next year. Like ABECMA and CARVYKTI, anito-cel targets BCMA. Anito-cel has shown promising efficacy in late-line multiple myeloma, with results that analysts say rival those of CARVYKTI. What sets anito-cel apart, however, is its potentially improved safety profile, particularly in reducing delayed neurotoxicity, such as Parkinsonism. This advantage could position anito-cel as a compelling alternative for patients seeking safer treatment options, challenging ABECMA\u2019s niche.\n\nBMS Aims to Strengthen ABECMA\u2019s Position in Multiple Myeloma with Ongoing Clinical Trials and Acquisition\n\nWith the acquisition expected to close in Q2 2025, BMS aims to leverage its resources to solidify ABECMA\u2019s position in the growing multiple myeloma market. Showing more potential, ABECMA\u2019s clinical development program includes ongoing studies, KarMMa-2 and KarMMa-3, focusing on earlier lines of treatment for multiple myeloma. \u201cWe believe ABECMA will continue to benefit from BMS\u2019 experience and resources to ensure this important therapy reaches the patients who need it,\u201d said 2seventy CEO Chip Baird.\n\nBolstering its clinical portfolio, BMS struck a deal with BioArctic AB at the end of last year to advance the development of anti-amyloid-beta antibody treatments. Under the agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb will oversee the global development and commercialization of the investigational drugs BAN1503 and BAN2803, along with related products.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other best pharma stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhy is China the Talk of the Town in the Pharma Industry?\n\nThe US pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a distinct trend never seen before with large American pharma companies continually looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior.\n\nExperts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nAlthough the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe talked about the potential performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cOn February 20, Emily Field, Head of European Pharma Research at Barclays, appeared on CNBC to discuss the dynamics of the pharmaceutical sector, the impact of US tariffs, and the performance of obesity drugs. She believed the industry may not underperform this year, at least in the first half. However, there are still several questions surrounding the performance of obesity drugs, as major players in the domain have exhibited contrasting previous year performance. Talking about the tariffs, she said that their materialization poses a big open question for the pharmaceutical sector as some companies assemble their products in the US after manufacturing them abroad. Manufacturing costs are thus pretty low for these companies, which is a significant point to consider when determining the impact of tariffs. She believed that absorbing the additional cost of the tariffs would be very manageable for these companies. The market has reached the tail-end of the earnings season, and the situation hasn\u2019t come up much on earnings calls over this quarter.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 25 pharma stocks.

            "content": "Under terms of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is acquiring 2seventy bio at a price of $5 per share \u2013 an 88% premium \u2013 totaling approximately $286 million.\n\nWith the definitive agreement, BMS will gain full ownership of Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel), a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2021 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.\n\nThe autologous therapy is made using a patient\u2019s own T-cells, which are collected and separated by apheresis, before being engineered to include a new gene that facilitates targeting and killing myeloma cells based on a modified lentivirus.\n\nIn 2024, Abecma pulled in $406 million, including $242 million in US sales. Year-on-year, US sales were down 32%, though international sales were up 44% to $164 million. Until now, BMS and 2seventy have been working under a co-development, co-promotion, and profit share agreement.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nHow we got here\n\nDevelopment of Abecma originated from a partnership between two different companies: Celgene and bluebird bio.\n\nBMS paid $74 billion to acquire Celgene in 2019 (deal announced in January, closed in November) in the largest pharma M&A deal of the last 25 years. 2seventy, meanwhile, was an oncology-focused entity spun out from cell and gene therapy (CGT) developer bluebird bio ahead of Abecma\u2019s approval in 2021.\n\nHowever, despite being just one of a handful of companies that have seen CAR-T commercial success, 2seventy has had its fair share of problems over the past few years.\n\nIn 2023, considering lower-than-expected Abecma sales, the firm cut 40% of its workforce, slashed its internal pipeline, and gated at-risk investments in its non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) programs in efforts to help free up $130+ million.\n\nAnd last year, 2seventy continued slimming down its pipeline, first selling preclinical and clinical stage assets to Regeneron for an upfront payment of $5 million and then selling both its hemophilia A program and its in vivo gene editing technology megaTAL technology to Novo Nordisk for $40 million. Both deals were intended to release cash and increase focus on Abecma.\n\n2seventy\u2019s journey coincides with a similar fate at bluebird. Despite several successes in gene therapy approvals \u2013 Zynteglo (beti-cel), Skysona (eli-cel), and Lyfgenia (lov-cel) \u2013 the firm has struggled to keep itself afloat.\n\nThe firm first looked at reducing its operational costs in 2021 through the sale of its Durham, North Carolina lentiviral vector manufacturing facility to contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Resilience for $110 million. Since then, bluebird announced plans to cut around 25% of its workforce in September 2024 to reduce spending and extend its cash runway came ahead of Q3 2024 results that saw a decline of $12.3 million year-on-year in net revenue.\n\nThe firm has also struggled in Europe due to pricing issues, which led to the firm ceasing operations in the continent in August 2021, after it claimed it encountered barriers to bringing therapies to European patients that were \u201cproven to be insurmountable.\u201d\n\nAs such, bluebird was snapped up by private equity (PE) firms Carlyle and SK Capital Partners last month for under $30 million. And while the price was deemed \u201chighly discounted,\u201d the decision was described as \u201cthe best path forward.\u201d bluebird CEO at the time Andrew Obenshain said: \u201cAs our financial challenges mounted, it became clear that securing the right strategic partner was critical to maximizing value for our stockholders and ensuring the long-term future of our therapies.\u201d",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb is acquiring 2seventy bio, a deal that gives the pharmaceutical giant full control over the partnered cancer cell therapy Abecma as that product faces headwinds in a competitive multiple myeloma market.\n\nAccording to deal terms announced Monday night, BMS will pay $5 in cash for each share of 2seventy. That represents a 78.5% premium to 2seventy\u2019s closing stock price on Monday, but it\u2019s a far cry from the company\u2019s $38 per share price when it debuted four years ago. The deal values 2seventy at $286 million, or $102 million taking into account the cash reserves it will bring to BMS.\n\nAbecma is an autologous cell therapy that was initially developed by Bluebird Bio and was later partnered with BMS. In 2021, 2seventy spun out as a standalone, publicly traded company, taking Bluebird\u2019s cancer cell therapies along with $442 million to support them. The spinout happened months after Abecma became the first CAR T-therapy approved for treating multiple myeloma. But that first mover advantage was short lived, as partners Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech won FDA approval in 2023 for Carvykti, a CAR T-therapy for multiple myeloma. Meanwhile, supply chain constraints presented BMS and 2seventy with manufacturing challenges for Abecma.\n\nSponsored Post Tackling Messy Provider Data with an NPI-Forward Approach Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.\n\nLast year, the FDA expanded Abecma\u2019s approval to include third-line treatment of multiple myeloma, which expands the market for the product. But that decision was made alongside the expanded approval of Carvykti to second-line use in multiple myeloma. Despite this advantage, Carvykti is associated with a movement disorder side effect that has not been reported with Abecma.\n\nMore cell therapy competition could be coming. Arcellx has Phase 2 data showing its CAR T-therapy, anito-cel, has efficacy comparable to Carvykti and a safety profile comparable to Abecma. Anito-cell is being developed under a partnership with Gilead Sciences, which brings its cell therapy experience and manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nBMS and 2seventy share equally in the profits and losses from sales of Abecma in the U.S. The product generated $402 million in revenue in 2024, a 14% decline from sales in the prior year, according to BMS\u2019s annual report. While sales around the world are growing, in the U.S. \u2014 the largest market for Abecma \u2014 sales declined. BMS\u2019s profit-sharing cost last year was $43 million. In the fourth quarter of 2024, BMS recorded a $122 million impairment charge for Abecma \u201cprimarily resulting from a reduced cash flow forecast due to the evolving competitive landscape,\u201d the annual report stated. BMS said this charge represented a full write-down of the asset.\n\nAbecma is the lone remaining asset from 2seventy\u2019s spinout from Bluebird. Last year, 2seventy sold its preclinical and early clinical cell therapy pipeline to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, then sold hemophilia assets to Novo Nordisk. Those transactions followed a corporate restructuring that cut R&D expenses and focused the business on commercialization of Abecma. Meanwhile, Bluebird has struggled to commercialize its three FDA-approved gene therapies. Last month, Bluebird agreed to an acquisition that takes the cash-strapped company private.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nBMS\u2019s 2seventy acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. In a note sent to investors Tuesday, Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch wrote that the deal signals modest confidence in the near-term profit potential of Abecma. Also, acquiring the biotech spares BMS the obligation of sharing profits related to the cell therapy. Graybosch noted that 2seventy CEO Chip Baird stated at an investor conference last week that his company\u2019s move toward profitability makes it attractive to larger companies. But Graybosch said it\u2019s unlikely another company will step in with another offer.\n\n\u201cWhile we agree that Abecma will build in profitability this year, we also believe the uncertainty in future revenue streams would be an overhang for any larger company considering an acquisition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see little to no value in 2seventy for any company looking to build a cell therapy business, as 2seventy already divested its R&D assets to Regeneron and Novo Nordisk, and [Bristol Myers Squibb] manufactures and commercializes Abecma.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Bristol Myers Squibb",

The all-cash offer values 2seventy\u2019s shares at $5 apiece. That represents a roughly 88% premium to their $2.66 closing price on March 7, but amounts to a small fraction of their worth only a few years ago.\n\nThe deal hands Bristol Myers the rights to the multiple myeloma cell therapy Abecma that it doesn\u2019t already own. The treatment came to market in 2021 and generated $406 million in sales for Bristol Myers last year. But the pharmaceutical giant paid $43 million in profit-sharing costs in 2024 through a longstanding deal that gives 2seventyBio half of U.S. Abecma sales.\n\nThe buyout marks the end of a difficult road for 2seventy, which in 2021 launched with an approved product, hundreds of millions of dollars and a pipeline of cell therapies, but has since watched its value erode.\n\n2seventy was created by Bluebird, a pioneering gene therapy maker and a leader in the field\u2019s renaissance last decade. Bluebird went public in 2013 and, in the ensuing years, advanced a pipeline of gene therapies for rare diseases as well as cell therapies for cancer. Both efforts yielded approved products, with Bluebird ultimately bringing to market three gene therapies in addition to Abecma.\n\nBluebird, however, hit a number of delays developing its treatments. It also had high operational costs and struggled to grow sales, a reflection of the challenges facing cell and gene therapy biotechs. Bluebird chose to split into two businesses in 2021, arguing at the time that each company could focus more intensely on their respective area.\n\n\u201c[I]t is clear to us that the two businesses are best served by independent leadership and teams to drive distinct strategic and operational objectives,\u201d Nick Leschly, the former CEO of Bluebird and 2seventy, said in a 2021 statement.\n\nBut both biotechs would continue to spiral downward. The split came as a once booming market for biotech petered out, making it hard for companies to raise money. Bluebird couldn\u2019t boost sales enough to turn a profit, leading to a cash crunch so dire it was forced to sell itself last month to avoid defaulting on debt. 2seventy, meanwhile, restructured and sold off its development pipeline to Regeneron and Novo Nordisk in a bid to focus exclusively on Abecma.\n\nEven that plan has proven difficult to execute. Abecma\u2019s launch was initially hamstrung due to tight supply. And since then, Abecma\u2019s sales have been dwarfed by those of Carvykti, a rival treatment developed by Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech that generated nearly $1 billion last year.\n\nAnother multiple myeloma cell therapy from Gilead Sciences and Arcellx is nearing market, too, further threatening Abecma\u2019s standing.\n\nBristol Myers is now tasked with reversing that trend, though its offer is indicative of only \u201cmodest confidence in the near-term profit potential\u201d of Abecma, wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger.\n\n\u201cThe strategic rationale for this acquisition is clear and today\u2019s announcement represents the culmination of the journey for 2seventy,\u201d said CEO Chip Baird, in a statement. \u201cI would like to express my deep gratitude for current and past 2seventy team members and more broadly the dedicated community of patients, scientists, providers and partners that helped take cell and gene therapy from a complicated idea to reality for patients.\u201d\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the second quarter.",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb is stepping in to buy its Abecma partner 2seventy bio for $286 million, ending the biotech\u2019s tumultuous journey as a singular cancer-focused cell therapy company.\n\n2seventy bio entered the market in May 2021, when it was spun out of bluebird bio, taking with it the BMS-partnered CAR-T therapy Abecma. The treatment became the new company\u2019s sole focus. The medicine had been approved just months earlier\u2014in March that year\u2014becoming the industry\u2019s first BCMA-targeted CAR-T treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Abecma is BMS\u2019 second CAR-T therapy, following in the footsteps of the CD19-targeting Breyanzi, approved in February 2021 for large B-cell lymphoma.\n\nSince its initial approval, the partners have successfully pushed Abecma into earlier treatment settings, with the FDA in April 2024 allowing its use in patients who had undergone at least two prior lines of therapy. That same year, BMS reported $406 million in sales for Abecma worldwide, but just $43 million was turned over to 2seventy as part of the profit-sharing arrangement, as per the pharma\u2019s year-end SEC filing.\n\n\u201cThe strategic rationale for this acquisition is clear and today\u2019s announcement represents the culmination of the journey for 2seventy bio. We believe that Abecma will continue to benefit from BMS\u2019 experience and resources to ensure this important therapy is delivered to patients who need it,\u201d 2seventy CEO Chip Baird said in a Monday evening statement.\n\nBaird told BioSpace in October 2024 that 2seventy was \u201ctantalizingly close\u201d to reaching cash break even after two tough years marred by layoffs, pipeline reorganizations and regulatory challenges. The company sold off its pipeline to Regeneron in January 2024 for just $5 million upfront, leaving analysts wondering how the remaining company would generate growth.\n\nThe buyout comes just weeks after bluebird agreed to go private in a $29 million deal with two private equity firms. The deal was a stunning\u2014if inevitable\u2014end for a company that pioneered gene therapies. Bluebird had been facing a cash crunch with a runway that was ending after the first quarter, despite putting up a fight with the FDA to earn a coveted priority review voucher it could sell.\n\nThe decision from BMS reflects executives\u2019 recent pledge to be on the lookout for deals to help strengthen its portfolio, as expressed by CEO Chris Boerner last month during a fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call. In a flash note on Monday evening, analysts at Leerink Partners said that the decision to acquire 2seventy bio would help BMS cut \u201cfuture profit-sharing costs in Abecma.\u201d\n\nSuch a move would be in-line with the pharma\u2019s recent savings push. In April 2024, BMS launched what it called a \u201cstrategic productivity initiative,\u201d with the goal of lowering expenditure by $1.5 billion through 2025. The cost-cutting campaign included around 2,200 layoffs last year, alongside a minimization of management layers. BMS last month bumped up the savings target by $2 billion through 2027.\n\nBMS is currently facing loss of exclusivity for three of its top-performing assets, including the cancer therapies Yervoy and Opdivo, key patents for which will expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively. Its best-selling blood thinner Eliquis, which brought in more than $13 billion, will also become open to generic competition in 2026.\n\nThe 2seventy deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will see BMS buy all outstanding shares of the Cambridge biotech for $5 apiece, a purchase price that represents an 88% premium to 2seventy bio\u2019s closing price on Friday.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is contingent on several customary conditions, including antitrust clearances and that a majority of shareholders tender their shares. The Board of Directors of 2seventy bio has unanimously recommended that stockholders back the buyout.",

            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2seventy bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSVT), today announced a definitive merger agreement under which Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) (\u201cBMS\u201d) will acquire all of the outstanding shares of 2seventy bio at a price of $5.00 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $286 million, or $102 million net of estimated cash. The deal represents an 88% premium to the closing price of $2.66 on March 7, 2025.\n\n\u201c A year ago, 2seventy decided to exclusively focus on unlocking the value of Abecma, with the goal of delivering more time for people living with multiple myeloma and maximizing value for all stakeholders,\u201d said Chip Baird, chief executive officer, 2seventy bio. \u201c The strategic rationale for this acquisition is clear and today\u2019s announcement represents the culmination of the journey for 2seventy bio. We believe that Abecma will continue to benefit from BMS\u2019 experience and resources to ensure this important therapy is delivered to patients who need it. I would like to express my deep gratitude for current and past 2seventy team members and more broadly the dedicated community of patients, scientists, providers and partners that helped take cell and gene therapy from a complicated idea to reality for patients.\u201d\n\nTransaction Details and Path to Completion\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, BMS will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of 2seventy bio at a price of $5.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. 2seventy bio\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that 2seventy bio stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of 2seventy bio\u2019s common stock and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Following the successful closing of the tender offer, BMS will acquire all remaining shares of 2seventy bio common stock that are not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price in the tender offer of $5.00 per share.\n\nFollowing the completion of this transaction, 2seventy bio\u2019s common stock will no longer be listed for trading on Nasdaq.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the merger agreement, certain stockholders of 2seventy bio owning approximately 5.3% of the outstanding shares of 2seventy bio\u2019s common stock have entered into tender and support agreements pursuant to which they have agreed to tender all of their owned shares in the offer.\n\nAdvisors\n\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to 2seventy bio, and Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel.\n\nABECMA U.S. INDICATION\n\nABECMA is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\n\nU.S. Important Safety Information\n\nBOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, PROLONGED CYTOPENIA and SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. Do not administer ABECMA to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.\n\nNeurologic Toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with ABECMA. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.\n\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS) including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities.\n\nProlonged Cytopenia with bleeding and infection, including fatal outcomes following stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery, occurred following treatment with ABECMA.\n\nT cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including ABECMA\n\nABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS.\n\nWarnings and Precautions:\n\nEarly Death: In KarMMa-3, a randomized (2:1), controlled trial, a higher proportion of patients experienced death within 9 months after randomization in the ABECMA arm (45/254; 18%) compared to the standard regimens arm (15/132; 11%). Early deaths occurred in 8% (20/254) and 0% prior to ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively, and 10% (25/254) and 11% (15/132) after ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively. Out of the 20 deaths that occurred prior to ABECMA infusion, 15 occurred from disease progression, 3 occurred from adverse events and 2 occurred from unknown causes. Out of the 25 deaths that occurred after ABECMA infusion, 10 occurred from disease progression, 11 occurred from adverse events, and 4 occurred from unknown causes.\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. Among patients receiving ABECMA for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (N=349), CRS occurred in 89% (310/349), including \u2265 Grade 3 CRS (Lee grading system) in 7% (23/349) of patients and Grade 5 CRS in 0.9% (3/349) of patients. The median time-to-onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 27 days), and the median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 63 days). In the pooled studies, the rate of \u2265Grade 3 CRS was 10% (7/71) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 5.4% (13/241) for patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells.\n\nThe most common manifestations of CRS (greater than or equal to 10%) included pyrexia (87%), hypotension (30%), tachycardia (26%), chills (19%), hypoxia (16%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, ARDS, atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, renal failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HLH/MAS.\n\nIdentify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS.\n\nOf the 349 patients who received ABECMA in clinical trials, 226 (65%) patients received tocilizumab; 39% (135/349) received a single dose, while 26% (91/349) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 24% (82/349) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Almost all patients who received corticosteroids for CRS also received tocilizumab. For patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 76% (54/71) of patients received tocilizumab and 35% (25/71) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. For patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 63% (152/241) of patients received tocilizumab and 20% (49/241) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CRS.\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of CRS and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.\n\nNeurologic Toxicities: Neurologic toxicities, including immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS), which may be severe or life- threatening, occurred concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS following treatment with ABECMA.\n\nIn patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity occurred in 40% (139/349), including Grade 3 in 4% (14/349) and Grade 4 in 0.6% (2/349) of patients. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 to 148 days). The median duration of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 123 of 139 (88%) patients and median time to resolution was 5 days (range: 1 to 245 days). One-hundred and thirty four out of 349 (38%) patients with neurotoxicity had CRS. The onset of neurotoxicity during CRS was observed in 93 patients, before the onset of CRS in 12 patients, and after the CRS event in 29 patients. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 5.6% (4/71) and 3.7% (9/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively. The most frequent (greater than or equal to 5%) manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy (21%), headache (15%), dizziness (8%), delirium (6%), and tremor (6%).\n\nAt the safety update for KarMMa-3 study, one patient developed fatal neurotoxicity 43 days after ABECMA. In KarMMa, one patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff.\n\nCerebral edema has been associated with ABECMA in a patient in another study in multiple myeloma. Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 3 parkinsonism have occurred after treatment with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma.\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion and treat promptly. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time.\n\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 2.9% (10/349) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA, with a median onset of 6.5 days (range: 4 to 10 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Five patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction and cytopenia.\n\nIn KarMMa-3, one patient had Grade 5, two patients had Grade 4 and two patients had Grade 3 HLH/MAS. The patient with Grade 5 HLH/MAS also had Grade 5 candida sepsis and Grade 5 CRS. In another patient who died due to stroke, the Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved prior to death. Two cases of Grade 3 and one case of Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved.\n\nIn KarMMa, one patient treated in the 300 x 106 CAR-positive T cells dose cohort developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS. In another patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, HLH/MAS was contributory to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved.\n\nHLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines.\n\nABECMA REMS: Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at www.AbecmaREMS.com or contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA.\n\nInfections: ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion.\n\nIn all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, infections (all grades) occurred in 61% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 21% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 7%, bacterial infections in 4.3%, and fungal infections in 1.4% of patients. Overall, 15 patients had Grade 5 infections (4.3%); 8 patients (2.3%) with infections of pathogen unspecified, 3 patients (0.9%) with fungal infections, 3 patients (0.9%) with viral infections, and 1 patient (0.3%) with bacterial infection.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines.\n\nFebrile neutropenia was observed in 38% (133/349) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.\n\nViral Reactivation: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice.\n\nProlonged Cytopenias: In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, 40% of patients (139/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 42% (145/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. In 89% (123/139) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 76% (110/145) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 1.9 months. Five patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 62% (44/71) and 56% (135/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively.\n\nMonitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia: In all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 13% (46/349) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dL after infusion in 37% (130/349) of patients treated with ABECMA.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion occurred in 45% (158/349) of patients treated with ABECMA. Forty-one percent of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post-ABECMA for serum IgG <400 mg/dL.\n\nMonitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dl. Manage appropriately per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis.\n\nUse of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or after ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA.\n\nSecondary Malignancies: Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. In KarMMa-3, myeloid neoplasms (four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and one case of acute myeloid leukemia) occurred in 2.2% (5/222) of patients following treatment with ABECMA compared to none in the standard regimens arm at the time of the safety update. The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasm from ide-cel infusion was 338 days (Range: 277 to 794 days). Three of these five patients have died following the development of myeloid neoplasm. One out of the five cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy.\n\nT cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including ABECMA. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes.\n\nMonitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing of secondary malignancy.\n\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.\n\nAdverse Reactions: The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) include pyrexia, CRS, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections \u2013 pathogen unspecified, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, nausea, headache, chills, upper respiratory tract infection, encephalopathy, edema, dyspnea and viral infections.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS and Medication Guide.\n\nAbout Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio\n\nAbecma is being jointly developed and commercialized in the U.S. as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion, and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have taken a backseat in the market as technology and AI-driven equities have soared to record highs. However, analysts at Ned Davis Research believe that a more challenging macroeconomic landscape this year could create opportunities for dividend stocks to regain momentum.\n\nAmid concerns about economic growth and uncertainty surrounding former President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been turning to defensive strategies. In this environment, dividend stocks have proven resilient, offering both stability and attractive passive income. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a history of at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has climbed by over 5.3% in 2025. In contrast, the broader market has declined by nearly 1.7%, as of the close of March 7.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nWhile analysts remain cautious about the market\u2019s ability to sustain its recent gains, dividend stocks have increasingly drawn their attention for several reasons. According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nThe report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb is building up to a label expansion for Sotyktu, with positive late-stage results from the POETYK PsA-2 study pointing to the potential of its TYK2 inhibitor in psoriatic arthritis.\n\n54.2% of patients in the treatment arm saw at least a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms at 16 weeks, versus 39.4% in the placebo arm. The treatment difference was statistically significant, hitting a p-value of 0.0002, according to the pharma\u2019s news release. The data were presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in Orlando, Florida.\n\nSotyktu also hit the trial\u2019s key secondary endpoints related to disease activity. Patients treated with the TYK2 blocker experienced greater improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis versus placebo and had better disability and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nSotyktu was safe and well-tolerated overall, and its adverse event profile in POETYK PsA-2 was similar to what had been established in prior trials.\n\nEdgar Charles, vice president and senior global program lead of Early & Late Development Immunology at BMS, in a statement called these findings \u201cpromising,\u201d adding that they point to the \u201cpotential of Sotyktu as an oral therapy and the first TYK2 inhibitor that may be able to address significant unmet needs of patients living with psoriatic arthritis.\u201d\n\nSotyktu is an orally available blocker of the TYK2 protein, a member of the broader JAK family of proteins that plays a mediator role in various cytokine pathways. The drug was first approved in September 2022 for plaque psoriasis, with the company at the time touting Sotyktu as the first oral innovation in the indication in almost 10 years.\n\nSotyktu has a cleaner safety profile than other JAK inhibitors. At the time of its approval, Jonathan Sadeh, senior vice president of Immunology and Fibrosis Development at BMS, told BioSpace that Sotyktu\u2019s adverse event profile \u201cis very different from the current oral standard of care and from the class of JAK inhibitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our trials, we didn\u2019t see the same side effects of anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, liver dysfunction or lipid dysfunction, that are typically associated with that class,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Sotyktu is playing in a crowded space, and even with this safety edge, BMS\u2019 drug still faces stiff competition and looming challengers. In August 2023, for instance, almost a year after Sotyktu\u2019s approval, a report from Spherix Global Insights found that Amgen\u2019s oral drug Otezla\u2014which incidentally Amgen acquired from BMS subsidiary Celgene\u2014\u201chas been successful at protecting its corner of the market, without losing any material share\u201d to Sotkytu.\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco biotech Alumis in June 2024 went public to help bankroll the late-stage development of its lead TYK2 inhibitor ESK-001, positioning it as a rival to Sotyktu.\n\nRecently, Alumis signed a merger agreement with fellow immune player Acelyrin to combine their resources and expertise. The combined entity will continue developing ESK-001, targeting moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus.",

(Credit: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company)\n\nBristol Myers Squibb has secured authorisation from the European Commission (EC) for the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) as a first-line therapy for adult patients diagnosed with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\nThe approval is based on findings from the CheckMate -9DW clinical trial, which demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival (OS) for patients administered the Opdivo-Yervoy combination.\n\nFindings from the trial indicated a median OS of 23.7 months in patients receiving this dual therapy, compared to 20.6 months for those treated with either lenvatinib or sorafenib.\n\nThe hazard ratio stood at 0.79, with a p-value of 0.018, underscoring statistical significance. Additionally, an overall response rate (ORR) of 36.1% was noted, compared to 13.2% in the comparator group.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb vice president and Opdivo global programme lead Dana Walker said: \u201cThe European Commission\u2019s approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the value of dual immunotherapy and represents an important new treatment option that may extend survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\u201cThis approval marks a critical milestone in our commitment to improving outcomes for patients with liver cancer. We look forward to bringing this new first-line treatment option to patients in the European Union.\u201d\n\nOpdivo is designed as an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1), facilitating an enhanced immune response against tumors.\n\nYervoy acts as a monoclonal antibody that disrupts cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), aiding in T-cell activity regulation. In combination, these therapies stimulate T-cell activation and proliferation, enhancing anti-tumor responses.\n\nThis clearance by the European Commission extends across all EU member states and includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. It complements existing approvals for Opdivo-based treatments targeting various tumour types across Europe.\n\nLast August, the US Food and Drug Administration accepted Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s supplemental biologics license application for the combination as a potential initial treatment for adults with unresectable HCC. A Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date has been designated for 21 April 2025.\n\nPreviously, in 2020, accelerated approval was given by the FDA for this combination as a second-line treatment option for advanced HCC, informed by Phase 2 CheckMate -040 study outcomes.",

The POETYK PsA-2 trial met its primary endpoint, with a significantly greater proportion of Sotyktu-treated patients achieving ACR20 response (at least a 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of disease) compared with placebo at Week 16 (54.2% versus 39.4%, respectively; p=0.0002). The overall safety profile of Sotyktu through 16 weeks of treatment was consistent with that established in a Phase 2 PsA clinical trial and Phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new data, which represent the first disclosure of data for the Phase 3 POETYK trials in PsA, are being presented as a late-breaking abstract (#66894) at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida taking place March 7-11, 2025.\n\n\u201cGiven the complex, multifaceted and heterogenous nature of psoriatic arthritis, there continues to be a significant need for safe and effective oral treatments,\u201d said Philip Mease, MD, director of rheumatology research at Swedish Medical Center/Providence St. Joseph Health and clinical professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle. \u201cThese results are particularly encouraging because they support the potential for Sotyktu to impact both joint and skin symptoms, as well as patient-reported quality of life outcomes. Combined with a well-tolerated safety profile, these data show Sotyktu may serve as an important new treatment option for these patients.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, treatment with Sotyktu met important secondary endpoints across PsA disease activity at Week 16, demonstrating improvement across clinical signs and symptoms, extra-articular manifestations and patient-reported outcomes. Significantly more Sotyktu-treated patients achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response compared with placebo. Treatment with Sotyktu also resulted in significantly greater improvements from baseline in the patient-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) compared with placebo (\u22120.32 versus \u22120.21, respectively; p=0.0013).\n\nIn the POETYK PsA-2 trial, no new safety signals were identified. In the placebo, Sotyktu and apremilast arms, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 54.7%, 62.8% and 73.3% of patients, respectively, and serious AEs in 1.0%, 1.9% and 3.8%, respectively. AEs led to discontinuation in 1.3%, 2.2% and 10.5% in the placebo, Sotyktu and apremilast arms, respectively. Apremilast was included as a safety reference arm in the PsA-2 trial with no formal statistical comparisons planned for efficacy.\n\n\u201cThese promising new data demonstrate the potential of Sotyktu as an oral therapy and the first TYK2 inhibitor that may be able to address significant unmet needs of patients living with psoriatic arthritis,\u201d said Edgar Charles, MD, vice president and senior global program lead, Early & Late Development Immunology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cFurthermore, these results support our belief in the capability of Sotyktu in rheumatic conditions and reflect our ongoing commitment to developing medicines for people living with immune-mediated diseases.\u201d\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will work with key investigators to present additional data from the Phase 3 POETYK PsA program at upcoming medical congresses this year and looks forward to discussing these results with health authorities.\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients, investigators and clinical trial sites who participated in POETYK PsA-2.\n\nAbout the Sotyktu Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Trial Program\n\nThe Phase 3 Sotyktu psoriatic arthritis (PsA) program includes two Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety in adults 18 years of age and older with active PsA: POETYK PsA-1 (IM011-054; NCT04908202) and POETYK PsA-2 (IM011-055; NCT04908189).\n\nPOETYK PsA-1 enrolled approximately 670 patients with active PsA who were not previously treated with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD na\u00efve). POETYK PsA-2 enrolled approximately 730 patients with active PsA who were bDMARD na\u00efve or had previously received TNF\u03b1 inhibitor treatment. Both trials include a 52-week treatment period comprised of a placebo-controlled treatment period through Week 16, followed by a reallocation and continued active treatment period from Week 16 to Week 52. POETYK PsA-2 also included an apremilast safety reference arm.\n\nThe primary endpoint of both trials was the proportion of participants achieving an ACR20 response at Week 16. Important secondary endpoints were also assessed at Week 16 across measures of PsA disease activity.\n\nPatients in both trials completing 52 weeks of treatment are potentially eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study.\n\nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated, heterogenous disease with multiple musculoskeletal and skin manifestations, including inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis (inflammation where tendon or ligament attaches to the bone), dactylitis (swelling of finger and toe joints) and psoriatic skin and nail lesions. Up to 30 percent of patients with psoriasis will develop PsA. In addition to the loss of physical function, pain and fatigue caused by PsA, the disease can significantly impact the mental and emotional well-being of patients. Patients with PsA are also at increased risk of serious comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, depression and anxiety.\n\nAbout Sotyktu (deucravacitinib)\n\nSotyktu (deucravacitinib) is an oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action, representing a new class of small molecules. It is the first selective TYK2 inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Bristol Myers Squibb scientists designed Sotyktu to selectively target TYK2, thereby inhibiting signaling of interleukin (IL)-23, IL-12 and Type 1 interferons (IFN), key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated diseases. Sotyktu achieves a high degree of selectivity by binding to the regulatory domain of TYK2, resulting in allosteric inhibition of TYK2 and its downstream functions. Sotyktu selectively inhibits TYK2 at physiologically relevant concentrations. At therapeutic doses, Sotyktu does not inhibit JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3.\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Pursuing Bold Science in Immunology to Transform Patients\u2019 Lives\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u2014 transforming patients\u2019 lives through science. For people living with immune-mediated diseases, the debilitating reality of enduring chronic symptoms and disease progression can make simple tasks and daily life a challenge. Driven by our deep understanding of the immune system that spans over 20 years of experience, we continue to pursue bold science as we work to deliver life-changing medicines that elevate new standards of care across rheumatology, dermatology and pulmonology. Our sequential immunotherapy research framework aims to address the root cause of disease by controlling inflammation, resetting the immune system and promoting immune homeostasis with the goal of achieving transformational efficacy. By continuously pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, we strive to bring forward tailored approaches, treatments and combinations that may lead to durable remissions, improved quality of life and functional cures. Our collaborations with patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and researchers inform our patient-centric approach as we aim to break efficacy ceilings and deliver what matters most \u2014 the promise of living a better life.\n\nSOTYKTU U.S. INDICATION\n\nSOTYKTU\u00ae (deucravacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\n\nLimitations of Use:\n\nSOTYKTU is not recommended for use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\nSOTYKTU is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to deucravacitinib or to any of the excipients in SOTYKTU.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nHypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema have been reported. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue SOTYKTU.\n\nInfections: SOTYKTU may increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been reported in patients with psoriasis who received SOTYKTU. The most common serious infections reported with SOTYKTU included pneumonia and COVID-19. Avoid use of SOTYKTU in patients with an active or serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating SOTYKTU in patients:\n\nwith chronic or recurrent infection\n\nwho have been exposed to tuberculosis\n\nwith a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection\n\nwith underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.\n\nClosely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing, have appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiated and be closely monitored. Interrupt SOTYKTU if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not resume SOTYKTU until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.\n\nViral Reactivation\n\nHerpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex) was reported in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Through Week 16, herpes simplex infections were reported in 17 patients (6.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 1 patient (0.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Multidermatomal herpes zoster was reported in an immunocompetent patient. During PSO-1, PSO-2, and the open-label extension trial, the majority of patients who reported events of herpes zoster while receiving SOTYKTU were under 50 years of age. The impact of SOTYKTU on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Consider viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with SOTYKTU. If signs of reactivation occur, consult a hepatitis specialist. SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n\nTuberculosis (TB): In clinical trials, of 4 patients with latent TB who were treated with SOTYKTU and received appropriate TB prophylaxis, no patients developed active TB (during the mean follow-up of 34 weeks). One patient, who did not have latent TB, developed active TB after receiving 54 weeks of SOTYKTU. Evaluate patients for latent and active TB infection prior to initiating treatment with SOTYKTU. Do not administer SOTYKTU to patients with active TB. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering SOTYKTU. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of SOTYKTU in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during treatment.\n\nMalignancy including Lymphomas: Malignancies, including lymphomas, were observed in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with SOTYKTU, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer) and patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment with SOTYKTU.\n\nRhabdomyolysis and Elevated CPK: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with an increased incidence of asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis compared to placebo.\n\nDiscontinue SOTYKTU if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.\n\nLaboratory Abnormalities: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with increases in triglyceride levels. Periodically evaluate serum triglycerides according to clinical guidelines during treatment. SOTYKTU treatment was associated with an increase in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter in patients with known or suspected liver disease according to routine management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt SOTYKTU until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded.\n\nImmunizations: Prior to initiating therapy with SOTYKTU, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccination. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with SOTYKTU. The response to live or non-live vaccines has not been evaluated.\n\nPotential Risks Related to JAK Inhibition: It is not known whether tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, overall thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. SOTYKTU is not approved for use in RA.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nMost common adverse reactions (\u22651% of patients on SOTYKTU and more frequently than with placebo) include upper respiratory infections, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, herpes simplex, mouth ulcers, folliculitis and acne.\n\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nPregnancy: Available data from case reports on SOTYKTU use during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Adverse Event reporting line at 1-800-721-5072.\n\nLactation: There are no data on the presence of SOTYKTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. SOTYKTU is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for SOTYKTU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SOTYKTU or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nHepatic Impairment: SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nSOTYKTU is available in 6 mg tablets.\n\nPlease see U.S. Full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide, for SOTYKTU.\n\nAbout Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.

            "content": "It's a clash between the world's largest beverage company and an emerging competitor.\n\nIn one corner, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) has a long history of rewarding shareholders with steady growth and rising profitability, propelling the stock to a 16% return over the past year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nOn the other side, shares of the once high-flying Celsius(NASDAQ: CELH) have lost their fizz amid a string of lackluster quarterly earnings. A reset in company expectations has driven the stock down a staggering 74% from its 52-week high.\n\nShould investors stick with the proven industry leader, or can the energy drink phenomenon regain its pop? Let's discuss whether Coca-Cola or Celsius is the better stock to buy now.\n\nThe case for Coca-Cola\n\nThe allure of Coca-Cola as an investment stems from its iconic and globally recognized brand. From its traditional focus on soft drinks, Coca-Cola today is more diversified than ever, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands across categories like sports drinks, flavored water, juices, and dairy products. That ability to innovate with new concepts to adapt to changing consumer tastes is a big part of the company's continued success. Beyond the economy's ebb and flow, there's a good chance this company will be around for the next 100 years.\n\nFor the full year ended Dec. 31, 2024, organic revenue climbed by 12% from 2023, through higher unit volumes and pricing initiatives. Notably, the company even gained market share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry last year, with developing and emerging markets also representing important growth drivers.\n\nIts increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) on a currency-neutral basis was even stronger, up 17% year over year, reflecting a premiumization of its sales mix that has helped lift margins. For 2025, Coca-Cola expects another banner year, targeting organic revenue growth between 5% and 6% alongside an 8% to 10% EPS increase.\n\nInvestors are confident in the company's ability to execute its growth strategy and consolidate global market share, and they have plenty of reasons to buy and hold Coca-Cola for the long run.\n\nThe case for Celsius\n\nCelsius has capitalized on consumers seeking healthier beverage options, with its fitness-focused sugar-free energy drinks proving highly popular as sales climbed 319% between 2021 and 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, 2024 marked a setback in the company's trajectory, with annual revenue of $1.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, up just 3%. Management cited an inventory glut at its main distributor, PepsiCo, which impacted the timing of large orders, to explain the slowdown leading to 2024 EPS of $0.70, down 10% from 2023.\n\nDespite the disappointing 2024, Celsius maintains overall solid fundamentals with its trends at the retail level, suggesting its product portfolio continues to resonate with consumers.\n\nPerhaps the company's biggest development is its recently announced acquisition of Alani Nu, a fast-growing specialty energy drink brand targeted toward women. Celsius believes the combined company will unlock significant synergies and strengthen its position in functional energy drinks.\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, Celsius is projected to post EPS of $0.96 this year, marking a 37% rebound compared to 2024, as total revenue surges by more than 30%. Those figures are particularly compelling, considering that the stock is trading at a forward P/E of 27, down from as high as 130 last year. While Celsius still commands a modest premium to Coca-Cola and its forward P/E of 24, the spread could be justified given Celsius' more robust outlook for 2025.\n\nBy this measure, the best reason to buy Celsius stock may hinge on viewing 2024's weakness as temporary, with a strong recovery on the horizon.\n\nDecision time: I'll take a sip of Celsius\n\nChoosing between Coca-Cola and Celsius is a tough call, as I'm bullish on both stocks. Coca-Cola defines the classic blue chip investment with its 3% dividend yield, while Celsius may have more growth potential as it expands internationally.\n\nIf forced to choose just one stock to buy now, I'd favor Celsius with the prediction that it will outperform in 2025 as its turnaround strategy gains traction. Investors comfortable navigating the ups and downs of the market could consider a small position in Celsius within a diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Analysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA pharmacy shelves stocked with pharmaceutical drugs awaiting distribution.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 8.83\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based pharmaceutical industry company. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $12.34 billion, reflecting a 7.5% increase from the previous year. Its Growth Portfolio performed exceptionally well, with revenue climbing 21% to $6.4 billion. This strong performance was driven by rising demand for key treatments such as Reblozyl, Breyanzi, and Camzyos, which saw annual sales growth of 71%, 125%, and 101%, respectively.\n\nBy the end of the year, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) maintained a solid financial position with over $10.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As one of the best dividend stocks, BMY has consistently paid dividends for 93 years and has raised its payouts for 16 consecutive years. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.62 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.12%, as of March 6.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) remains focused on developing new molecular entities while strategically acquiring businesses to enhance its research and development capabilities. This approach strengthens its competitive position, fosters innovation, and reinforces its leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. The company was a part of 88 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2024, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $3.2 billion.\n\nOverall, BMY ranks 5th on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BMY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

The trial met its primary endpoint, with a significantly higher proportion of Sotyktu-treated patients achieving a 20% improvement in disease signs and symptoms compared to placebo at Week 16. The data, presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, also highlighted Sotyktu's consistent safety profile and its potential as a new treatment option for PsA patients.\n\nPositive Aspects\n\nSotyktu demonstrated a significant improvement in PsA symptoms, achieving the primary endpoint of the trial.\n\nThe safety profile of Sotyktu was consistent with previous trials, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nSecondary endpoints showed improvements in clinical signs, symptoms, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nSotyktu is the first TYK2 inhibitor showing potential to address unmet needs in PsA treatment.\n\nNegative Aspects\n\nAdverse events were reported in a higher percentage of Sotyktu-treated patients compared to placebo.\n\nThere is a need for further data to confirm long-term safety and efficacy.\n\nPotential risks related to TYK2 inhibition, such as infections and malignancies, require careful monitoring.\n\nFinancial Analyst Perspective\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the positive results from the POETYK PsA-2 trial could enhance Bristol-Myers Squibb's market position in the immunology sector. Sotyktu's success in addressing PsA could lead to increased market share and revenue growth, especially given the significant unmet needs in this therapeutic area. However, investors should remain cautious about potential regulatory hurdles and the competitive landscape, which could impact the drug's commercial success.\n\nMarket Research Analyst Perspective\n\nThe successful trial results for Sotyktu position Bristol-Myers Squibb as a key player in the PsA treatment market. The drug's unique mechanism as a TYK2 inhibitor offers a novel approach to managing PsA, potentially attracting patients seeking alternatives to existing therapies. The market for PsA treatments is expected to grow, driven by increasing prevalence and demand for effective oral therapies. Sotyktu's approval and adoption could significantly influence market dynamics and patient preferences.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the primary endpoint of the POETYK PsA-2 trial?\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving an ACR20 response at Week 16.\n\nWhat are the key findings from the trial?\n\nSotyktu-treated patients showed significant improvement in PsA symptoms compared to placebo, with a consistent safety profile.\n\nWhat is Sotyktu's mechanism of action?\n\nSotyktu is a selective TYK2 inhibitor that targets key cytokines involved in immune-mediated diseases.\n\nWhat are the potential risks associated with Sotyktu?\n\nPotential risks include infections, malignancies, and laboratory abnormalities, requiring careful monitoring.\n\nRead the original press release here.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

            "content": "Princeton: Bristol Myers Squibb has announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\u201cThe European Commission\u2019s approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the value of dual immunotherapy and represents an important new treatment option that may extend survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, Opdivo global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThis approval marks a critical milestone in our commitment to improving outcomes for patients with liver cancer. We look forward to bringing this new first-line treatment option to patients in the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe decision is based on results from the CheckMate -9DW study, which were presented at the 2024 American Society of Oncology (ASCO ) Annual Meeting , the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. Results showed that dual immunotherapy treatment with Opdivo plus Yervoy led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), the clinical trial\u2019s primary endpoint. In the trial, 85% of patients in the comparator arm were treated with lenvatinib and 15% were treated with sorafenib. The median OS was 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.8\u201329.4) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to 20.6 months (95% CI: 17.5\u201322.5) with the investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib (HR: 0.79 (0.65\u20130.96); p=0.018). The OS benefit was observed across clinically relevant patient subgroups. The trial also showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 36.1% (95% CI: 31-41.5) compared to 13.2% (95% CI: 9.8-17.3; P<0.0001) of patients treated with lenvatinib or sorafenib and a deeper response with Opdivo plus Yervoy . The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nThis approval by the EC for Opdivo plus Yervoy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced HCC is valid in all 27 member states of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In addition to approval in HCC, Opdivo- based options are also approved for treatment of multiple tumor types in the EU.\n\nIn August 2024, the U.S. FDA also accepted the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Opdivo plus Yervoy as a potential first-line treatment option for adult patients with unresectable HCC and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of April 21, 2025. The combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy was granted accelerated approval as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC by the U.S. FDA in 2020 based on results from the Phase 2 CheckMate -040 trial.",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb Presents Late-Breaking Data from Phase 3 POETYK PsA-2 Trial Demonstrating Superiority of Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) Compared with Placebo in Adults with Psoriatic Arthritis\n\n\n\n\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced positive data from the pivotal Phase 3 POETYK PsA-2 trial (IM011-055) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The POETYK PsA-2 trial met its primary endpoint, with a significantly greater proportion of Sotyktu-treated patients achieving ACR20 response (at least a 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of disease) compared with placebo at Week 16 (54.2% versus 39.4%, respectively; p=0.0002). The overall safety profile of Sotyktu through 16 weeks of treatment was consistent with that established in a Phase 2 PsA clinical trial and Phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis clinical trials.\n\nThe new data, which represent the first disclosure of data for the Phase 3 POETYK trials in PsA, are being presented as a late-breaking abstract (#66894) at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida taking place March 7-11, 2025.\n\n\"Given the complex, multifaceted and heterogenous nature of psoriatic arthritis, there continues to be a significant need for safe and effective oral treatments,\" said Philip Mease, MD, director of rheumatology research at Swedish Medical Center/Providence St. Joseph Health and clinical professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle. \"These results are particularly encouraging because they support the potential for Sotyktu to impact both joint and skin symptoms, as well as patient-reported quality of life outcomes. Combined with a well-tolerated safety profile, these data show Sotyktu may serve as an important new treatment option for these patients.\"\n\nAdditionally, treatment with Sotyktu met important secondary endpoints across PsA disease activity at Week 16, demonstrating improvement across clinical signs and symptoms, extra-articular manifestations and patient-reported outcomes. Significantly more Sotyktu-treated patients achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response compared with placebo. Treatment with Sotyktu also resulted in significantly greater improvements from baseline in the patient-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) compared with placebo (?0.32 versus ?0.21, respectively; p=0.0013).\n\nIn the POETYK PsA-2 trial, no new safety signals were identified. In the placebo, Sotyktu and apremilast arms, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 54.7%, 62.8% and 73.3% of patients, respectively, and serious AEs in 1.0%, 1.9% and 3.8%, respectively. AEs led to discontinuation in 1.3%, 2.2% and 10.5% in the placebo, Sotyktu and apremilast arms, respectively. Apremilast was included as a safety reference arm in the PsA-2 trial with no formal statistical comparisons planned for efficacy.\n\n\"These promising new data demonstrate the potential of Sotyktu as an oral therapy and the first TYK2 inhibitor that may be able to address significant unmet needs of patients living with psoriatic arthritis,\" said Edgar Charles, MD, vice president and senior global program lead, Early & Late Development Immunology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \"Furthermore, these results support our belief in the capability of Sotyktu in rheumatic conditions and reflect our ongoing commitment to developing medicines for people living with immune-mediated diseases.\"\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will work with key investigators to present additional data from the Phase 3 POETYK PsA program at upcoming medical congresses this year and looks forward to discussing these results with health authorities.\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients, investigators and clinical trial sites who participated in POETYK PsA-2.\n\nAbout the Sotyktu Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Trial Program\n\nThe Phase 3 Sotyktu psoriatic arthritis (PsA) program includes two Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety in adults 18 years of age and older with active PsA: POETYK PsA-1 (IM011-054; NCT04908202) and POETYK PsA-2 (IM011-055; NCT04908189).\n\nPOETYK PsA-1 enrolled approximately 670 patients with active PsA who were not previously treated with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD na\u00efve). POETYK PsA-2 enrolled approximately 730 patients with active PsA who were bDMARD na\u00efve or had previously received TNF? inhibitor treatment. Both trials include a 52-week treatment period comprised of a placebo-controlled treatment period through Week 16, followed by a reallocation and continued active treatment period from Week 16 to Week 52. POETYK PsA-2 also included an apremilast safety reference arm.\n\nThe primary endpoint of both trials was the proportion of participants achieving an ACR20 response at Week 16. Important secondary endpoints were also assessed at Week 16 across measures of PsA disease activity.\n\nPatients in both trials completing 52 weeks of treatment are potentially eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study.\n\nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated, heterogenous disease with multiple musculoskeletal and skin manifestations, including inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis (inflammation where tendon or ligament attaches to the bone), dactylitis (swelling of finger and toe joints) and psoriatic skin and nail lesions. Up to 30 percent of patients with psoriasis will develop PsA. In addition to the loss of physical function, pain and fatigue caused by PsA, the disease can significantly impact the mental and emotional well-being of patients. Patients with PsA are also at increased risk of serious comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, depression and anxiety.\n\nAbout Sotyktu (deucravacitinib)\n\nSotyktu (deucravacitinib) is an oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action, representing a new class of small molecules. It is the first selective TYK2 inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Bristol Myers Squibb scientists designed Sotyktu to selectively target TYK2, thereby inhibiting signaling of interleukin (IL)-23, IL-12 and Type 1 interferons (IFN), key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated diseases. Sotyktu achieves a high degree of selectivity by binding to the regulatory domain of TYK2, resulting in allosteric inhibition of TYK2 and its downstream functions. Sotyktu selectively inhibits TYK2 at physiologically relevant concentrations. At therapeutic doses, Sotyktu does not inhibit JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3.\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Pursuing Bold Science in Immunology to Transform Patients' Lives\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision ? transforming patients' lives through science. For people living with immune-mediated diseases, the debilitating reality of enduring chronic symptoms and disease progression can make simple tasks and daily life a challenge. Driven by our deep understanding of the immune system that spans over 20 years of experience, we continue to pursue bold science as we work to deliver life-changing medicines that elevate new standards of care across rheumatology, dermatology and pulmonology. Our sequential immunotherapy research framework aims to address the root cause of disease by controlling inflammation, resetting the immune system and promoting immune homeostasis with the goal of achieving transformational efficacy. By continuously pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, we strive to bring forward tailored approaches, treatments and combinations that may lead to durable remissions, improved quality of life and functional cures. Our collaborations with patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and researchers inform our patient-centric approach as we aim to break efficacy ceilings and deliver what matters most ? the promise of living a better life.\n\nSOTYKTU U.S. INDICATION\n\nSOTYKTU\u00ae (deucravacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\n\nLimitations of Use:\n\nSOTYKTU is not recommended for use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\nSOTYKTU is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to deucravacitinib or to any of the excipients in SOTYKTU.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nHypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema have been reported. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue SOTYKTU.\n\nInfections: SOTYKTU may increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been reported in patients with psoriasis who received SOTYKTU. The most common serious infections reported with SOTYKTU included pneumonia and COVID-19. Avoid use of SOTYKTU in patients with an active or serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating SOTYKTU in patients:\n\nwith chronic or recurrent infection\n\nwho have been exposed to tuberculosis\n\nwith a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection\n\nwith underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.\n\nClosely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing, have appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiated and be closely monitored. Interrupt SOTYKTU if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not resume SOTYKTU until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.\n\nViral Reactivation\n\nHerpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex) was reported in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Through Week 16, herpes simplex infections were reported in 17 patients (6.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 1 patient (0.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Multidermatomal herpes zoster was reported in an immunocompetent patient. During PSO-1, PSO-2, and the open-label extension trial, the majority of patients who reported events of herpes zoster while receiving SOTYKTU were under 50 years of age. The impact of SOTYKTU on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Consider viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with SOTYKTU. If signs of reactivation occur, consult a hepatitis specialist. SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n\nTuberculosis (TB): In clinical trials, of 4 patients with latent TB who were treated with SOTYKTU and received appropriate TB prophylaxis, no patients developed active TB (during the mean follow-up of 34 weeks). One patient, who did not have latent TB, developed active TB after receiving 54 weeks of SOTYKTU. Evaluate patients for latent and active TB infection prior to initiating treatment with SOTYKTU. Do not administer SOTYKTU to patients with active TB. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering SOTYKTU. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of SOTYKTU in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during treatment.\n\nMalignancy including Lymphomas: Malignancies, including lymphomas, were observed in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with SOTYKTU, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer) and patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment with SOTYKTU.\n\nRhabdomyolysis and Elevated CPK: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with an increased incidence of asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis compared to placebo.\n\nDiscontinue SOTYKTU if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.\n\nLaboratory Abnormalities: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with increases in triglyceride levels. Periodically evaluate serum triglycerides according to clinical guidelines during treatment. SOTYKTU treatment was associated with an increase in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter in patients with known or suspected liver disease according to routine management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt SOTYKTU until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded.\n\nImmunizations: Prior to initiating therapy with SOTYKTU, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccination. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with SOTYKTU. The response to live or non-live vaccines has not been evaluated.\n\nPotential Risks Related to JAK Inhibition: It is not known whether tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, overall thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. SOTYKTU is not approved for use in RA.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nMost common adverse reactions (?1% of patients on SOTYKTU and more frequently than with placebo) include upper respiratory infections, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, herpes simplex, mouth ulcers, folliculitis and acne.\n\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nPregnancy: Available data from case reports on SOTYKTU use during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Adverse Event reporting line at 1-800-721-5072.\n\nLactation: There are no data on the presence of SOTYKTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. SOTYKTU is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SOTYKTU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SOTYKTU or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nHepatic Impairment: SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nSOTYKTU is available in 6 mg tablets.\n\nPlease see U.S. Full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide, for SOTYKTU.\n\nAbout Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) plus Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\u201cThe European Commission\u2019s approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the value of dual immunotherapy and represents an important new treatment option that may extend survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, Opdivo global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThis approval marks a critical milestone in our commitment to improving outcomes for patients with liver cancer. We look forward to bringing this new first-line treatment option to patients in the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe decision is based on results from the CheckMate -9DW study, which were presented at the 2024 American Society of Oncology (ASCO\u00ae) Annual Meeting, the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. Results showed that dual immunotherapy treatment with Opdivo plus Yervoy led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), the clinical trial\u2019s primary endpoint. In the trial, 85% of patients in the comparator arm were treated with lenvatinib and 15% were treated with sorafenib. The median OS was 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.8\u201329.4) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to 20.6 months (95% CI: 17.5\u201322.5) with the investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib (HR: 0.79 (0.65\u20130.96); p=0.018). The OS benefit was observed across clinically relevant patient subgroups. The trial also showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 36.1% (95% CI: 31-41.5) compared to 13.2% (95% CI: 9.8-17.3; P<0.0001) of patients treated with lenvatinib or sorafenib and a deeper response with Opdivo plus Yervoy. The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nThis approval by the EC for Opdivo plus Yervoy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced HCC is valid in all 27 member states of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In addition to approval in HCC, Opdivo-based options are also approved for treatment of multiple tumor types in the EU.\n\nIn August 2024, the U.S. FDA also accepted the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Opdivo plus Yervoy as a potential first-line treatment option for adult patients with unresectable HCC and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of April 21, 2025. The combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy was granted accelerated approval as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC by the U.S. FDA in 2020 based on results from the Phase 2 CheckMate -040 trial.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators for their important contributions to the Phase 3 CheckMate -9DW clinical trial.\n\nAbout CheckMate -9DW\n\nCheckMate -9DW is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label clinical trial evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib monotherapy in adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.\n\nA total of 668 patients were randomized to receive Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 1mg/kg plus Yervoy 3mg/kg Q3W for up to four doses, followed by Opdivo monotherapy 480mg Q4W) infusion, or single agent lenvatinib or sorafenib taken orally in the control arm. 85% of patients in the comparator arm were treated with lenvatinib and 15% were treated with sorafenib. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and time to symptom deterioration. The study was not designed to independently compare Opdivo plus Yervoy vs. lenvatinib or Opdivo plus Yervoy vs. sorafenib.\n\nAbout Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nLiver cancer is the third most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 90% of global cases. HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, where effective treatment options are limited and are usually associated with poor outcomes.\n\nUp to 70% of patients experience recurrence within five years, particularly those still considered to be at high risk after surgery or ablation. While most cases of HCC are caused by hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections, metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are rising in prevalence and expected to contribute to increased rates of HCC.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo\u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nAbout Yervoy\n\nYervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types.\n\nINDICATIONS\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated as neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, followed by single-agent OPDIVO\u00ae as adjuvant treatment after surgery.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (\u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab) and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%).\n\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).\n\nOPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 8% (35/456), including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (4.2%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.5%), and Grade 2 (4.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients, including Grade 3 (2.2%) and Grade 2 (1.9%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, hypophysitis occurred in 9% (42/456), including Grade 3 (2.4%) and Grade 2 (6%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, hypophysitis occurred in 4.4% (29/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (0.9%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%).

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nIn addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.\n\nSome ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\n\nInfusion-Related Reactions\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30- minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.\n\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.\n\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\n\nIn randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.\n\nLactation\n\nThere are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.\n\nSerious Adverse Reactions\n\nIn Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268).

Additionally, Lupin Limited, Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited, and Baxter International Inc. are actively involved in expanding treatment options for patients suffering from Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nZollinger Ellison Syndrome Market Trends\n\n\n\nThe industry is evolving rapidly, driven by technological innovations and advancements in various practices. As continuous research uncovers new insights across sectors, several key trends are emerging, shaping the future direction of the market. These trends are expected to significantly influence the landscape, improving outcomes, enhancing precision, and expanding access to advanced solutions across products, therapies, and services.\n\nRising Adoption of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)\n\nThe market is witnessing increased usage of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, for managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome. PPIs are considered the first line of treatment, given their ability to effectively reduce gastric acid production. With ongoing advancements in drug formulations, these inhibitors are becoming more efficient in controlling symptoms, thereby driving demand. The growing prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders is also contributing to the increased use of PPIs worldwide.\n\nIncreasing Focus on Personalised Treatment Approaches\n\nAs medical research progresses, personalised treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome is gaining traction. Healthcare providers are increasingly focusing on tailored therapies, where treatment is designed based on a patient's specific genetic makeup and disease progression. This trend has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly, with therapies being adjusted to maximise effectiveness. As the global healthcare industry shifts towards precision medicine, personalised approaches are becoming a cornerstone in rare disease management.\n\nEmergence of Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures\n\nWith advancements in medical technologies, minimally invasive surgical procedures are emerging as a crucial trend in the treatment of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. These procedures, particularly for removing gastrin-producing tumours, offer benefits such as reduced recovery times, fewer complications, and improved patient comfort. As patient demand for less invasive options grows, healthcare providers are increasingly adopting advanced surgical techniques, contributing to the overall growth of the market.\n\nGrowing Investments in Rare Disease Research\n\nGovernments and pharmaceutical companies are making substantial investments in research related to rare diseases, including Zollinger Ellison syndrome. The rising focus on developing novel therapeutic interventions for rare conditions is accelerating the discovery of new drugs and improving diagnostic methodologies. This increased funding is expected to drive innovations in treatment options, offering more effective solutions for patients and expanding the market over the coming years.\n\nIncreased Use of Combination Therapies\n\nThe use of combination therapies, involving both medication and surgical interventions, is becoming more common in the management of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. By combining different treatment modalities, healthcare providers can achieve better control over the disease's progression, improving patient outcomes. This trend is expected to drive demand for multi-faceted treatment approaches as patients seek comprehensive solutions that offer long-term relief.\n\nExpanding Role of Online Pharmacies\n\nThe growing adoption of e-commerce platforms for pharmaceutical products is transforming the distribution of treatments for Zollinger Ellison syndrome. Online pharmacies are gaining popularity due to the convenience they offer, allowing patients to easily access medications such as PPIs and other therapies. This trend is particularly notable in regions where access to specialised medical treatments may be limited, and it is expected to play a significant role in expanding access to care globally.\n\nMarket Drivers\n\nRising Prevalence of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome: The increasing incidence of Zollinger Ellison syndrome, a rare disorder characterised by excessive gastric acid secretion, is driving demand for effective treatment options. This rise is likely linked to better diagnostic methods and heightened awareness of the condition, encouraging growth in the market as more patients seek specialised care.\n\nAdvancements in Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): Ongoing developments in proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as improved drug formulations that enhance the effectiveness and duration of acid suppression, are boosting market growth. These advancements are making treatments more accessible and effective, leading to higher adoption rates among healthcare providers and patients alike.\n\nImproved Diagnostic Techniques: Technological advancements in diagnostic methods for Zollinger Ellison syndrome, such as endoscopic ultrasound and imaging techniques, are enabling early and accurate detection. This improvement in diagnosis is driving demand for targeted treatments, as early intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes and disease management.\n\nIncreasing Healthcare Expenditure: Rising healthcare spending across developed and developing regions is positively impacting the market for Zollinger Ellison syndrome treatments. Governments and healthcare providers are allocating more resources towards rare diseases, allowing for better access to advanced treatments and medications, which is supporting the growth of the market.\n\nGrowing Focus on Rare Diseases: There is an increasing global emphasis on researching and addressing rare diseases, including Zollinger Ellison syndrome. Government initiatives, combined with support from pharmaceutical companies, are fostering innovation in this sector, with new drugs and treatment approaches being developed to meet the unique needs of patients suffering from this condition.\n\nChallenges\n\nHigh Cost of Treatment: The treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome, particularly when it involves advanced medications and surgeries, can be prohibitively expensive for many patients. This high cost acts as a barrier to accessing care, especially in lower-income regions, which poses a significant challenge to market growth despite the availability of effective therapies.\n\nLimited Awareness in Developing Regions: Awareness of Zollinger Ellison syndrome remains limited in many developing countries, where healthcare systems may not prioritise rare diseases. This lack of awareness among both healthcare providers and patients leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, thereby hindering market growth and preventing patients from receiving timely care.\n\nAdverse Side Effects of Medications: While proton pump inhibitors and other treatments are effective in managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome, they may also cause adverse side effects in some patients, including gastrointestinal disturbances and long-term nutrient deficiencies. These side effects can deter patients from adhering to prescribed treatments, limiting market expansion.\n\nComplexity of Disease Management: Managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome often requires a combination of medications, surgeries, and ongoing monitoring, making treatment complex and time-consuming. This complexity can lead to non-compliance among patients, particularly those with co-morbidities, creating a challenge for healthcare providers in ensuring consistent and effective disease management.\n\nStringent Regulatory Approvals: The development and approval of new therapies for Zollinger Ellison syndrome face stringent regulatory scrutiny to ensure safety and efficacy. This can delay the introduction of innovative treatments into the market, slowing down potential advancements in patient care and limiting the availability of cutting-edge therapies.\n\nFuture Opportunities\n\nDevelopment of Targeted Therapies: There is significant potential for pharmaceutical companies to develop targeted therapies that address the unique needs of Zollinger Ellison syndrome patients, particularly in the areas of gastrin-secreting tumour management.\n\nExpanding Healthcare Infrastructure in Emerging Markets: The growth of healthcare infrastructure in emerging markets, such as Asia Pacific and Latin America, presents opportunities for increased access to diagnostics and treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nIncreased Research Funding for Rare Diseases: Government and private sector initiatives focused on rare diseases are likely to increase research funding, creating opportunities for the development of innovative treatments for Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nPersonalised Medicine: The rise of personalised medicine, which tailors treatment based on individual patient profiles, offers significant opportunities to improve outcomes for Zollinger Ellison syndrome patients through customised therapeutic approaches.\n\nGrowing Role of Online Pharmacies: With the expansion of digital healthcare services, online pharmacies are expected to play a more prominent role in the distribution of Zollinger Ellison syndrome medications, increasing patient access to treatments in remote regions.\n\nZollinger Ellison Syndrome Market Segmentation\n\nMarket Breakup by Treatment\n\nMedication\n\nEsomeprazole\n\nDexlansoprazole\n\nLansoprazole\n\nOmeprazole\n\nPantoprazole\n\nRabeprazole\n\nSurgery\n\nCancer Therapies\n\nChemotherapy\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nMarket Breakup by Distribution Channel\n\nHospital Pharmacy\n\nRetail Pharmacy\n\nOnline Pharmacies\n\nOthers\n\nMarket Breakup by Region\n\nUnited States\n\nEU-4 and the United Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nJapan\n\nIndia\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 250 Forecast Period 2024 - 2032 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.4 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2032 $2 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.5% Regions Covered Global\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/7q0o5z\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group.

Valued at a market cap of $121.4 billion, the company offers products for oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience, and other areas.\n\nCompanies valued at $10 billion or more are typically classified as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and BMY fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the drug manufacturers \u2013 general industry. The company\u2019s strengths stem from its strong R&D pipeline, high-performing drugs like OPDIVO and Eliquis, and strategic acquisitions that expand its portfolio. BMY leverages solid patent protection, a global presence, and expertise in biologics and cell therapy to drive sustained growth and innovation.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThis biopharmaceutical leader is trading 2.1% below its 52-week high of $61.10, achieved on Jan. 27. It has gained 1.7% over the past three months, outpacing the broader Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI) 3.9% loss over the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, BMY has rallied 15.4% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming DOWI\u2019s 11.5% return. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of BMY are up 5.8%, compared to DOWI\u2019s 1.1% gain over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its bullish trend, BMY has been trading above its 200-day moving average since mid-July 2024, with some fluctuations, and has remained above its 50-day moving average since late February.\n\nOn Feb. 6, shares of BMY plunged 3.8% after its Q4 earnings release, despite delivering better-than-expected Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.67 and revenues of $12.3 billion. Its revenue grew 7.5% year-over-year, fueled by strong performance from its growth portfolio and higher Eliquis sales, though partially offset by a decline in legacy portfolio revenues. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS fell 1.8% from the prior year quarter.\n\nWhat primarily disappointed investors was BMY\u2019s 2025 guidance, which fell short of expectations. The company expects adjusted EPS between $6.55 and $6.85 and total revenue of approximately $45.5 billion, factoring in a nearly $500-million negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nBMY has outpaced its rival, Amgen Inc.\u2019s (AMGN) 14.4% gain over the past 52 weeks but has underperformed AMGN\u2019s 21.5% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nLooking at BMY\u2019s recent outperformance, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 25 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $59.90 suggests a marginal premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

In January 2025, Zai Lab Limited announced that China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) had accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for KarXT to treat schizophrenia in adults. The NDA submission is supported by the results from a Phase 1 China Pharmacokinetics (PK) study, the Phase III China study (ZL-2701-001), and data from the global EMERGENT clinical programs.\n\nIn October 2024, Zai Lab Limited announced positive topline results from the company\u2019s Phase III multi-center trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline and trospium chloride) in China. Consistent with previous global studies, the registrational bridging trial met its primary endpoint, with KarXT demonstrating a statistically significant 9.2-point reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score compared to placebo at Week 5 (-16.9 KarXT vs. -7.7 placebo, p=0.0014).\n\nIn August 2024, In a recent study, the investigational drug PIPE-307 effectively induced OPC differentiation and remyelination in MS donor human brain tissue and an animal model and restored lost function in an MS mouse model.

These antagonists can be classified based on their target receptors into muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists. Muscarinic antagonists, such as atropine and scopolamine, block the muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) found in the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to effects like pupil dilation, decreased glandular secretion, and reduced smooth muscle contraction. They are used in various medical conditions, including bradycardia, motion sickness, and overactive bladder.\n\nNicotinic antagonists, such as tubocurarine and hexamethonium, block nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) at neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia, resulting in muscle relaxation or autonomic blockade, respectively. These drugs are commonly used as muscle relaxants during anesthesia or to manage hypertension.\n\nAChR antagonists have significant clinical relevance but also come with potential side effects due to their widespread effects on the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Muscarinic antagonists can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and cognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients. Nicotinic antagonists, particularly those affecting the neuromuscular junction, can lead to paralysis and respiratory depression if administered in excessive doses.\n\nDespite these risks, they remain critical in medical practice, from treating respiratory conditions like COPD (with ipratropium) to managing anesthesia-induced paralysis in surgery. Research into selective AChR antagonists is ongoing, with efforts to develop more targeted therapies that minimize systemic side effects while effectively modulating cholinergic signaling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more about acetylcholine receptor antagonist drugs @ Acetylcholine Receptor Antagonists Analysis\n\nA snapshot of the Pipeline Acetylcholine Receptor Antagonist Drugs mentioned in the report:\n\nDrugs Company Phase Indication RoA AXS-05 Axsome Therapeutics III Agitation, Alzheimer Disease Oral COBENFY Bristol Myers Squibb III Psychotic disorders Oral BNC210 Bionomics III Anxiety disorders Oral AD-109 Apnimed III Obstructive Sleep Apnea Oral CBT-009 Cloudbreak Therapeutics Phase I/II Progressive Myopia Eyedrop aqueous solution\n\nLearn more about the emerging acetylcholine receptor antagonists @ Acetylcholine Receptor Antagonists Clinical Trials\n\nAcetylcholine Receptor Antagonists Therapeutics Assessment\n\nThe acetylcholine receptor antagonists pipeline report proffers an integral view of the emerging acetylcholine receptor antagonists segmented by stage, product type, molecule type, and route of administration.\n\nScope of the Acetylcholine Receptor Antagonists Pipeline Report\n\nCoverage : Global\n\n: Global Therapeutic Assessment By Product Type: Mono, Combination, Mono/Combination\n\nMono, Combination, Mono/Combination Therapeutic Assessment By Clinical Stages: Discovery, Pre-clinical, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III\n\nDiscovery, Pre-clinical, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III Therapeutics Assessment By Route of Administration: Oral, Parenteral, Intravenous, Subcutaneous, Topical\n\nOral, Parenteral, Intravenous, Subcutaneous, Topical Therapeutics Assessment By Molecule Type : Monoclonal antibody, Peptides, Polymer, Small molecule, Gene therapy\n\n: Monoclonal antibody, Peptides, Polymer, Small molecule, Gene therapy Key Acetylcholine Receptor Antagonists Companies : Axsome Therapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bionomics, Apnimed, Seefunge Pharmaceutical Technology, Vyluma, Santen Pharmaceutical, CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Suven Life Sciences Limited, Nobelpharma, Cloudbreak Therapeutics, Neurocrine Biosciences and others.\n\n: Axsome Therapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bionomics, Apnimed, Seefunge Pharmaceutical Technology, Vyluma, Santen Pharmaceutical, CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Suven Life Sciences Limited, Nobelpharma, Cloudbreak Therapeutics, Neurocrine Biosciences and others.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 17\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 4.16%\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is an American pharmaceutical industry company. It continues to prioritize the development of new molecular entities while leveraging strategic acquisitions to strengthen its research and development capabilities. This strategy enhances its competitive edge, drives innovation, and reinforces its standing in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 17%.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) reported $12.34 billion in revenue, marking a 7.5% increase from the previous year. Its Growth Portfolio delivered particularly strong results, with revenue rising 21% to $6.4 billion.

While we acknowledge the potential of BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BMY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(KSQ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel treatments for solid tumors, including engineered tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (eTIL\u00ae) programs, today announced the appointment of Kristen Hege, M.D., to the company\u2019s Board of Directors. Dr. Hege brings to KSQ\u2019s board more than 20 years of leadership experience in oncology and cell therapy research and development, including the advancement of multiple programs of varying modalities through to clinical proof of concept, and in the case of cell therapy, to FDA approval.\n\n\u201cKristen brings deep industry and clinical experience to our board. Her insights and counsel will be incredibly valuable as we continue to move our lead eTIL programs through clinical studies and advance our additional cell therapies toward the clinic,\u201d said Qasim Rizvi, Chief Executive Officer at KSQ and CEO-Partner at Flagship Pioneering. \u201cOn behalf of the board and our entire team I want to welcome her to KSQ.\u201d\n\nDr. Hege commented: \u201cKSQ\u2019s eTIL platform holds tremendous potential to improve upon existing TIL therapies. eTIL have the potential to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and control the growth of solid tumor malignancies by targeting two powerful brakes on the immune system that restrain tumor-recognizing T cells, including TIL. This approach could fundamentally change how we treat solid tumors. I look forward to supporting the team in our shared effort to positively impact cancer patients with CRISPR-edited cell therapies.\u201d\n\nDr. Hege retired from Bristol Myers Squibb in March of 2023. In her role as SVP Early Clinical Development, Hematology, Oncology & Cell Therapy at BMS, she was responsible for advancing a pipeline of small molecules, biologics and cell therapies from first-in-human studies through clinical proof of concept. While there, she led the 2Seventybio (formerly bluebird)-partnered BCMA CAR-T cell program (Abecma) in multiple myeloma from inception through FDA approval. Prior to BMS she held a similar role at Celgene, as well as executive roles in biotech at Cell Genesys, Cellerant, and Theraclone.\n\nDr. Hege spent nearly three decades as a clinical faculty member in the division of hematology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), most recently as Clinical Professor of Medicine. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of Mersana Therapeutics, Adaptimmune, Kelonia and EvolveImmune and served on the Board of Directors of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) from 2016-2019. She also holds advisory roles at cTRL, Moonlight, Dispatch, Cartography, Neomorph, Kamau and Generate:Biomedicines. Dr. Hege received her M.D. at UCSF and her internal medicine and hematology/oncology subspecialty training at Harvard and UCSF, respectively.\n\nAbout eTIL\u00ae\n\nKSQ-001EX, an engineered tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (eTIL) therapy in which TIL are edited to inactivate the SOCS1 gene, and KSQ-004EX, an eTIL therapy in which TIL are edited to inactivate the genes encoding SOCS1 and Regnase-1, have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of solid tumors. In preclinical studies, both therapies demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor function in solid tumor models refractory to PD-1 as well as enhanced persistence and memory formation. Both therapies are manufactured by CTMC using KSQ\u2019s ExPRESS\u2122 process.\n\nAbout KSQ Therapeutics\n\nKSQ Therapeutics is advancing a pipeline of tumor- and immune-focused drug candidates to treat cancer across multiple drug modalities, including targeted therapies, adoptive cell therapies, and immunotherapies. KSQ\u2019s proprietary CRISPRomics\u00ae discovery engine enables genome-scale, in vivo-validated, unbiased target discovery across broad therapeutic areas.

            "content": "Bristol-Myers Squibb recently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share on its common stock, reinforcing its ongoing strategy to return value to shareholders. This announcement correlates with the company\u2019s 3% price increase last week, distinguishing itself amid broader market declines fueled by tariff-related concerns. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 dropped 1.8% as investors reacted to new U.S. tariffs and subsequent global trade tensions, BMY's steady commitment to dividends likely provided a counterbalance, boosting investor confidence. Financial sector stocks saw a downturn, but BMY's position in healthcare helped mitigate exposure to these specific industry pressures. Across the market, volatility persisted due to economic concerns and policy uncertainties, yet Bristol-Myers Squibb's positive movement during this period underscores the stability and appeal of its shareholder-centric initiatives. The overall market decline of 2.5% highlights the significance of BMY's relative outperformance in this challenging situation.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings on Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nNYSE:BMY Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen Bristol-Myers Squibb deliver a total return of 24.36% when accounting for share price and dividends. This period was marked by significant operational and financial developments. A key event was the acquisition of MyoKardia for US$13.1 billion in October 2020, expanding their cardiovascular portfolio. Operational success was complemented by several drug approvals, including Breyanzi for lymphoma and Opdivo for esophageal cancer. Despite reporting an increasing net loss in recent earnings, the company's strong revenue growth in segments like pharmaceuticals has supported its performance.\n\nMoreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb maintained attractive dividend yields, albeit sometimes not fully covered by earnings, reflecting their emphasis on shareholder returns. On the regulatory front, their pipeline saw positive momentum with approvals from FDA and EMA, particularly for treatments in oncology, which is key for their revenue. Over the past year, BMY outperformed both the US pharmaceuticals industry and US market, highlighting its resilience against broader industry pressures.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Gold Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nDividends are a key component of the investment market, with nearly 80% of companies in the broader market distributing payments to shareholders. However, maintaining steady dividend increases is a difficult achievement. Only about 13% of companies in the index qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nAccording to data from Abrdn, it was noted that between December 2002 and December 2022, companies that either increased or initiated dividends achieved a compounded return of 10.68%. In contrast, firms that reduced or discontinued their dividends saw a significantly lower return of 2.70%. In addition, it was highlighted that companies not paying dividends also lagged behind dividend growers, generating a return of 9.25% over the same timeframe.\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is an American pharmaceutical industry company. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $12.34 billion, reflecting a 7.5% increase compared to the same period the previous year. The company\u2019s Growth Portfolio performed particularly well, with revenue climbing 21% to $6.4 billion. This growth was driven by strong demand for key treatments, including Reblozyl, Breyanzi, and Camzyos, which saw annual sales increases of 71%, 125%, and 101%, respectively.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) remains focused on advancing new molecular entities while also pursuing strategic acquisitions to bolster its research and development capabilities. This approach enhances its competitive positioning, fosters innovation, and solidifies its presence in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) ended the year with more than $10.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company is considered as one of the best dividend stocks, having consistently paid dividends for 93 years and increasing its payouts for 16 consecutive years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.18%, as of February 27.\n\nOverall BMY ranks 4th on our list of the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. PFE, headquartered in New York, discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products. With a market cap of $149.8 billion, the company offers medicines, vaccines, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products for oncology, inflammation, cardiovascular, and other therapeutic areas.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and PFE perfectly fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the general drug manufacturers industry. PFE thrives on its strong product lineup, including popular vaccines and blockbuster drugs. With a commitment to research and development, Pfizer continues to invest in innovation, ensuring a steady stream of new products. International sales make up nearly half of its revenue, highlighting its global reach and competitive standing in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nActive Investor: FREE newsletter going behind the headlines on the hottest stocks to uncover new trade ideas\n\nDespite its notable strength, PFE slipped 16.8% from its 52-week high of $31.54, achieved on Jul. 30, 2024. Over the past three months, PFE stock gained 2.7%, underperforming the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF\u2019s IHE 5.7% gains during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of PFE dipped 1.1% on a YTD basis and declined 1.3% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming IHE\u2019s YTD gains of 10.9% and 5.9% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, PFE has been trading below its 50-day moving average since October 2024, experiencing some fluctuations. The stock is trading below its 200-day moving average since November 2024.\n\nPFE has seen underperformance due to declining sales of COVID-19 products and upcoming patent cliffs for top-selling products like Eliquis. The launch of generic versions of Eliquis in 2028 could significantly impact revenue. The company is also set to lose exclusivity on other blockbuster products like Ibrance, contributing to lower revenue and a drop in share price.\n\nOn Feb. 4, PFE shares closed down more than 1% after reporting its Q4 results. Its adjusted EPS $0.63 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.48. The company\u2019s revenue was $17.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street forecasts of $17.5 billion. PFE expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.80 to $3, and expects revenue in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion.\n\nIn the competitive arena of general drug manufacturers, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY has taken the lead over PFE, showing resilience with a 5.9% gain on a YTD basis and a 17.7% uptick over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish on PFE\u2019s prospects. The stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 22 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $30.47 suggests a potential upside of 16.1% from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The latest scientific achievement in the partnership has triggered a research payment of US $20 m to Evotec, enabling further development of a promising pre-clinical programme in neurodegeneration.\n\nSince the initiation of their strategic neuroscience collaboration in December 2016, Evotec and Bristol Myers Squibb have been working together to identify disease-modifying treatments for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.

In March 2023, the companies reaffirmed their commitment by extending and expanding the collaboration for an additional eight years.\n\nDr. Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec, commented:\n\n\"This latest achievement further underscores the strength of our collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb and the impact it has for jointly building a strong pipeline in neurological diseases. Our continued success highlights the unique commitment and reinforces our shared mission to deliver truly innovative treatment options for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. With another high-potential program advancing towards clinical development, we are taking yet another important step in our pursuit of breakthrough therapies.\"\n\nAbout Evotec SE\n\nEvotec is a life science company with a unique business model that delivers on its mission to discover and develop highly effective therapeutics and make them available to the patients.

This grant will help us provide critical support to individuals in crisis, particularly those experiencing severe socioeconomic challenges such as homelessness, while fostering stronger collaboration among hospitals, treatment programs, and community resources.\u201d\n\nKey project activities for the first year include:\n\n\u25cf Developing formal agreements with local hospitals;\n\n\u25cf Recruiting dedicated care managers and clinical staff, including a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner;\n\n\u25cf Delivering clinical services such as psychiatric evaluations and treatment plans; and\n\n\u25cf Assessing community members\u2019 overall life conditions and employing appropriate interventions.\n\nThe initiative also emphasizes deepening partnerships with local organizations and peer support networks. Continuous feedback from stakeholders will ensure the delivery of culturally responsive and accessible solutions that are tailored to the unique needs of Essex County community members.\n\nKatie Kena, LCSW, Senior Director, will serve as the Project Director for this transformative initiative. With extensive experience in behavioral health and care coordination, Kena is committed to advancing Integrity House\u2019s mission to provide equitable access to high-quality care for all. Katie oversees the Integrity Certified Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC), a one-stop resource for individuals experiencing mental illnesses and substance use disorders.

This 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consists of three parallel cohorts. Participants are assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive either 270 mg or 450 mg of efzofitimod, or a placebo, administered intravenously once a month for a total of six doses. The trial aims to enroll up to 25 SSc-ILD patients and is actively recruiting at multiple sites across the U.S.The market for Systemic Sclerosis-associated Lung Disease is expected to experience significant growth, driven by increased adoption of existing treatments, the anticipated introduction of one-time gene therapies, and heightened awareness.Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a condition marked by fibrosis, vasculopathy, and inflammation, affecting multiple organs and systems with serious prognostic implications. When SSc impacts the lungs, it can lead to pulmonary complications such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Patients with SSc face a high risk of developing ILD as a complication, which can result in lung inflammation and scarring, ultimately leading to respiratory failure.Among global markets, the United States holds the largest share of the Systemic Sclerosis-associated Lung Disease market, surpassing the EU4 nations (Germany, Spain, Italy, France), the United Kingdom, and Japan.The higher prevalence of SSc-ILD in females in the U.S. is attributed to the increased occurrence of systemic sclerosis in women, likely influenced by genetic and hormonal factors.Severity-specific data indicates that moderate cases of SSc-ILD are significantly more common than severe cases.As per DelveInsight analysis, the Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease market is anticipated to witness growth at a considerable CAGRStrategise your business goals by understanding market dynamics @ Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease Market Landscape [Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease OverviewSystemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a condition marked by fibrosis, vasculopathy, and inflammation, affecting multiple organs. When the lungs are involved, it can lead to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Although the exact cause of SSc-ILD remains uncertain, a combination of environmental, immune, and genetic factors is believed to play a role. Patients with SSc are highly susceptible to developing ILD, which may cause lung inflammation and scarring, ultimately leading to respiratory failure.Diagnosing Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD) primarily involves identifying ILD on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest in individuals with known SSc while excluding other potential causes of lung disease. A thorough clinical assessment, including an evaluation of respiratory symptoms, is essential for all newly diagnosed SSc patients to detect lung involvement as early as possible. Early identification is critical, as ILD significantly contributes to both morbidity and mortality in this patient population.Do you know the treatment paradigms for different countries?

Access DelveInsight\u2019s in-depth Gastric Cancer Pipeline Analysis for a closer look at promising breakthroughs @ Gastric Cancer Clinical Trials and Studies\n\nGastric Cancer Emerging Drugs\n\nTislelizumab: BeiGene\n\nTislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc\u03b3R on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to Fc\u03b3R on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene\u2019s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers. The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved tislelizumab in six indications. Including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy, for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, and for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China. Currently the drug is registered for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nCatumaxomab: Linton Pharm Co. Ltd.\n\nCatumaxomab was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2009 for the treatment of malignant ascites. It is a bispecific antibody that binds to EpCAM (the epithelial cell adhesion molecule) on the tumor cell--and CD3 on the T cell, recruits immune accessory cells through Fc\u03b3R binding at the same time. Catumaxomab kills tumor cells by engaging T cell and accessory cell mediated cytotoxicity and has the potential to induce long-term vaccinal effects which has been verified in animal models. Currently, Catumaxomab is being evaluated in clinical trials for both advanced gastric cancer and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Currently the drug is in Phase III stage of development for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nTivumecirnon: RAPT Therapeutics\n\nTivumecirnon is a small molecule CCR4 antagonist designed to block the migration of regulatory T cells (Treg) specifically into tumors, but not healthy tissues. Treg represent a dominant pathway for downregulating the immune response, generally correlate with poor clinical outcomes and may limit the effectiveness of currently available therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Tivumecirnon may restore naturally occurring antitumor immunity alone and may synergize with a variety of both conventional and immune-based therapies, such as radiation, chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, immune stimulators, cancer vaccines and adoptive T cell therapy. Currently the drug is in Phase II stage of development for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nDKN-01: Leap Therapeutics\n\nDKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the activity of the Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein, a modulator of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling, a signaling pathway frequently implicated in tumorigenesis and suppressing the immune system. DKK1 has an important role in tumor cell signaling and in mediating an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment through enhancing the activity of myeloidderived suppressor cells and downregulating NK ligands on tumor cells. DKN-01 has received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Currently the drug is in Phase II stage of development for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nVenadaparib: Idience\n\nVenadaparib (IDX-1197) is a potent PARP inhibitor that prevents the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) and promote the conversion of SSB to double-stranded breaks (DSB), which ultimately leads to synthetic lethality in cancer cells. IDX-1197 is under clinical development targeting multiple solid tumors as a monotherapy (including maintenance) and for combination with other anti-cancer agents. Currently the drug is in Phase I stage of development for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nBDC-4182: Bolt Biotherapeutics\n\nBDC-4182 is Bolt\u2019s next-generation ISAC candidate targeting Claudin 18.2, a novel target in oncology, with programs in development for the treatment of gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer and pancreatic cancer. Currently the drug is in Preclinical stage of development for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nThe Gastric Cancer pipeline report provides insights into\n\nThe report provides detailed insights about companies that are developing therapies for the treatment of Gastric Cancer with aggregate therapies developed by each company for the same.\n\nIt accesses the Different therapeutic candidates segmented into early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage of development for Gastric Cancer Treatment.\n\nGastric Cancer Companies are involved in targeted therapeutics development with respective active and inactive (dormant or discontinued) projects.\n\nGastric Cancer Drugs under development based on the stage of development, route of administration, target receptor, monotherapy or combination therapy, a different mechanism of action, and molecular type.\n\nDetailed analysis of collaborations (company-company collaborations and company-academia collaborations), licensing agreement and financing details for future advancement of the Gastric Cancer market.\n\nGet a detailed analysis of the latest innovations in the Gastric Cancer pipeline.

            "content": "There's been a major selloff in Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. ( ) shares in the week since it released its annual report, with the stock down 27% to US$4.24. The results overall were pretty much dead in line with analyst forecasts; revenues were US$164m and statutory losses were US$1.28 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nAfter the latest results, the twelve analysts covering Iovance Biotherapeutics are now predicting revenues of US$449.1m in 2025. If met, this would reflect a huge 174% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 33% to US$0.82. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$455.0m and US$0.88 per share in losses. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in analyst sentiment with the latest consensus release, given the upgrade to loss per share forecasts for this year.\n\nEven with the lower forecast losses, the analysts lowered their valuations, with the average price target falling 8.2% to US$21.08. It looks likethe analysts have become less optimistic about the overall business. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Iovance Biotherapeutics, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$34.00 and the most bearish at US$10.00 per share. With such a wide range in price targets, analysts are almost certainly betting on widely divergent outcomes in the underlying business. As a result it might not be a great idea to make decisions based on the consensus price target, which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the . The analysts are definitely expecting Iovance Biotherapeutics' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 174% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 103% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 20% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Iovance Biotherapeutics is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

            "content": "AI Revolution In Biotech\n\nNo sector is left unchanged by the power of AI and digital modeling, and Biotech is no exception.\n\nThis is because biology is by far the most \u201cmessy\u201d of hard sciences. Chemistry or physics can deal with very controlled environments, pure compounds, etc. Biology has to contend with preexisting extremely complex and constantly changing systems. Also, when analyzing just one protein, biochemists look at thousands or millions of atoms. So, it can get really hard to predict every possible chemical reaction.\n\nBig data, AI models, and digitalization are creating conditions for a knowledge revolution in biotech research.\n\nThe first age of biomedicine was to shoot in the dark and see what worked.\n\nWe are now firmly established in the age of genomics, where we can focus on specific targets, like one defective gene.\n\nWith the incoming digital revolution, we can replicate complete proteins, cells, or even entire organs and bodies in a virtual environment.\n\nWhat Will It Change?\n\nA big part of why genomics and precision therapies are taking over \u201ctraditional\u201d chemical drugs has been a very poor success rate for new drugs in the last decade.\n\nMaybe one can produce an FDA-approved drug for ten thousand candidate drugs. Every step of the way needs to be tested in the laboratory, in live cells, animal,s or humans.\n\nThis often represents one to two decades of lost time, as well as many, many billions of dollars down the drain.\n\nShooting blind is not a viable plan anymore for drug discovery. This is why researchers need digital predictive models to forecast before any physical testing if a drug is a good candidate.\n\nSo, it is not surprising that drug discovery is at the forefront of the business model of most AI biotech companies.\n\nNew methods like machine learning allow the software to \u201cguess\u201d the most likely answer using a probabilistic method instead of a fully \u201cmechanical\u201d/algorithmic method.\n\nLike most machine learning technology, a lot of work was done during a full decade, with only the experts in the field really paying attention.\n\nThe true revolution that made it recognized in the mainstream was in 2020 when Alphabet/Google DeepMind solved a 50-year-old challenge on protein folding . The program has since modelized most of the known proteins of all living organisms, and Google is creating a new company, Isomorphic Laboratories , to help identify new drugs .\n\nTop 5 AI and Digital Biotech Companies\n\nFor investors, Google might be a great play on AI in general, but the biotech aspect will be a tiny segment in a very large company. So, this article will review publicly listed companies that are solely dedicated to the topic of AI and Virtual Biology.\n\nFor the same reason, we will not look at companies involved in AI hardware, like Nvidia and its genomics library Parabricks .\n\n(the companies are ranked by market capitalization at the time of the writing of this article)\n\nRoivant Sciences Ltd. ROIV +0.38% )\n\nThe company specializes in acquiring biotech startups and boosting their chances of achieving commercialization through subsidiaries called -vant (as each will have \u201cvant\u201d as the last part of their name).\n\nPart of these acquisitions was the purchase of Silicon Therapeutics for $450M . Thanks to a supercomputer and custom computing hardware, Silicon Therapeutics is developing new molecules. This added to a preexisting AI biotech stack portfolio, VantAI .\n\nRoivant also owned the \u201cvant\u201d Datavant, a big data solution for healthcare, selling to hospital pharmaceutical companies, insurance, etc\u2026 with regulation-compliant and privacy-respecting procedures.\n\nOther \u201cvant\u2019s\u201d are also data or digital simulation-oriented, like the \u201cAccurate All-Atom Physics-Based Simulations\u201d of Psivant . Or the clinical trial intelligence software/platform Lokavant .\n\nStill, most of the company's income derives from pharmaceutical sales of approved products.\n\nOverall, Roivant can be a way to play the data side of biotech, not only digital biology but also medical records, clinical trials, etc\u2026.; while at the same time touching on other innovative medicine, especially for skin care, with Vtama for psoriasis .\n\nThe company specializes in physics-based models to find the best possible molecule for a given goal, balancing out conflicting metrics like potency, solubility, half-life, synthesizability, etc\u2026\n\nIt also uses machine learning, but the addition of a physics-based model allows it to be tested in entirely novel fields for which no data set exists to \u201ctrain\u201d the AI. This allows Schr\u00f6dinger to go from 1 billion potential molecules to just 8 solid candidates in a matter of days, exclusively through digital calculation.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger signed with Bayer a 5-year collaboration agreement in 2020 for revenue of $10M . The idea of the agreement is to use Schr\u00f6dinger technology together with Bayer in-silico prediction models.\n\nAnother recent partnership is with Lilly, with up to $425M in total milestone payments for successful discovery.\n\nPast collaborations included Takeda, Sanofi Bristol Myers Squibb, and other smaller pharmaceutical companies.\n\nOverall, Schr\u00f6dinger is building a growing portfolio, including more and more proprietary and fully-owned molecules. While not pre-revenue, the company is still not profitable, focusing on expansion and R&D spending to improve its technology.\n\nThe company is also looking at expanding toward new segments beyond drug discovery, like complex biopharmaceuticals or even materials like chemicals, batteries, or polymers.\n\nInvestors will want to keep an eye on the new collaborations, as they will reflect the advances of Schr\u00f6dinger's technology, as assessed by the leaders in the industry, as well as possible success in expanding the core technology to new markets.\n\nExscientia plc EXAI +0% )\n\nThe company is using AI to develop precision therapies . It runs a \u201cfull stack\u201d AI drug discovery technology with dedicated software at every stage of the drug discovery process.\n\nExscientia\u2019s technology reduces 70% of the time required for going from a biological target to finding a corresponding drug and an 80% more capital process.\n\nThis resulted in 4 compounds in early clinical stages, 30 programs in total, and $6.5B in revenues from milestones with partners. The main focus has been oncology (cancer) and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe company is in a very comfortable financial position for an early-stage drug discovery company, with $625M in Q3 2022, for a net cash burn of just $15M.\n\nThis might be an interesting option for investors looking at a well-established AI drug discovery company with a very large cash runway and multiple ongoing partnerships for extra safety.\n\nAbsci Corporation ABSI +0.65% )\n\nThe company was founded in 2011, with locations in Vancouver, New York, and Zug, Switzerland. It has added to its initial technology the IP of 2 AI-biology acquisitions in 2021, Totient (antibodies) and Denovium (cell lines).\n\nThe company is mostly focused on antibody design, creating new from scratch antibodies (\u201cde novo antibodies\u201d), and testing them in laboratories in a 6-week process.\n\nThey were the first, in March 2023, to be able to design a functional antibody without any pre-existing data, a method also called \u201czero-shot .\u201d\n\nAbsci has established collaboration with Merck (total of $610M in upfront fees and future milestone potential payment) and Astellas for new product discovery, as well as a partnership with Nvidia to improve the hardware architecture behind Absci technology .\n\nAbsci is still at an early stage but has shown tremendous potential and innovation potential already. Investors in the company will need to be on board with the \u201cnothing is impossible\u201d ethos of the company and its brilliant founder and hope for the recent collaboration agreements to be the first in a long series.\n\ne-therapeutics is focused on developing in-silico new RNAi (RNA interference) therapies. It hopes that combining emerging technology, RNAi, and computational drug discovery will give it a significant edge over its competitors.\n\nIt is also monetizing the discovery on its platform with other pharmaceutical companies, of which the largest is the large blue chip Novo Nordisk.\n\nThe company is at a very early pre-revenue stage and had to raise \u00a313.5 million in the summer of 2022. The company registered a net loss of \u00a32.8 million in H1 2022m for a cash balance at the time of \u00a321.8 million.\n\nInvestors in e-therapeutics will need to keep an eye on the cash available and hope for new discoveries and partnerships' revenues to turn the company profitable ultimately.\n\nBuilding A Digital Biology Portfolio\n\nThis is a difficult sector to invest in, as it combines 2 very complex technologies: AI + advanced biotechnology. This makes it pretty much a \u201cblack box\u201d for investors, even if they have some expertise in one of the 2 fields.\n\nIn addition, most of the companies in the sectors are focused on the same markets, mostly small molecule discoveries and antibody designs, with maybe cell lines as well.\n\nSo diversification would make for a safer investing strategy because very few people will be able to be sure to have picked the \u201cwinner.\u201d In addition, the market is expected to grow very quickly, at a CAGR of 45% between 2022 and 2027 .\n\nSo, widespread exposure is more likely to catch this growth without overly relying on specific mathematical models or methods in a very quickly changing and competitive arena.",

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1.59% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 1.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.63%.\n\nShares of the biopharmaceutical company witnessed a loss of 0.57% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Medical sector with its loss of 0.63% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.42%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Bristol Myers Squibb will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Bristol Myers Squibb is projected to report earnings of $1.53 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 134.77%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $10.69 billion, reflecting a 9.94% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $6.77 per share and revenue of $45.59 billion, indicating changes of +488.7% and -5.6%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Bristol Myers Squibb. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 4.07% downward. Bristol Myers Squibb is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Bristol Myers Squibb has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.69 right now. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 21.57 for its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, BMY's PEG ratio is currently 2.17. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. BMY's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.49 as of yesterday's close.",

Its stock price has climbed to $58.28, representing a healthy 18.8% increase. This run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\n\nIs there a buying opportunity in Bristol-Myers Squibb, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s free.\n\nWe\u2019re glad investors have benefited from the price increase, but we don't have much confidence in Bristol-Myers Squibb. Here are three reasons why BMY doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Is Bristol-Myers Squibb Not Exciting?\n\nFounded in 1887, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops medicines to treat cancer, immune disorders, and cardiovascular conditions.\n\n1. Lackluster Revenue Growth\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a stretched historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 2.3% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.\n\n2. Shrinking Adjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. It also removes various one-time costs to paint a better picture of normalized profits.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 30.2 percentage points over the last five years. This raises an eyebrow about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Its adjusted operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 10.8%.\n\n3. EPS Trending Down\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\n\nSadly for Bristol-Myers Squibb, its EPS declined by 24.7% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 13.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. With its shares beating the market recently, the stock trades at 8.5\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $58.28 per share). While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is big given its shaky fundamentals. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at the most dominant software business in the world.\n\nStocks We Would Buy Instead of Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling.

The drug, called ulixacaltamide, is being tested as treatment for essential tremor. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is laying off 223 more employees in Lawrence Township, N.J., according to a WARN notice. The cuts, which have effective dates stretching from May to August, follow plans revealed earlier this month to lay off 67 workers in New Jersey. Each of those restructuring moves are part of a cost-cutting initiative Bristol Myers announced last year and has since broadened in the hopes of saving $2 billion in annual expenses by the end of 2027. In an email to BioPharma Dive, a spokesperson said the affected employees were previously notified and that the WARN notice\u2019s effective dates reflect their final days of employment. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nEli Lilly will hunt for molecular glue drugs together with Magnet Biomedicine, the companies said Friday. The deal hands Magnet up to $40 million in upfront and near-term milestones, as well as an equity investment.

Magnet is making molecular glues, a type of drug that forces two proteins together to modify or eliminate harmful proteins. \u201cIn the world of oncology and immunology, providing tissue specificity and targeting hard-to-drug proteins is really where our glue technology is going to make its mark,\u201d Magnet CEO Brian Safina said in an interview. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nZevra Therapeutics has sold a priority review voucher for $150 million to an unspecified buyer, capitalizing on the regulatory \u201cfast pass\u201d that it won upon Food and Drug Administration approval of its medicine Miplyffa for Niemann-Pick disease type C. The deal follows a flurry of sales of other vouchers, which now seem to regularly fetch $150 million or so after a long stretch during which their value dropped to around $100 million.

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMuch of the recent buzz in the schizophrenia space has been around Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy, which last year became the condition\u2019s first newly approved therapy in decades.\n\nBut even with the added option, schizophrenia patients are likely to continue cycling through drugs as they grapple with difficult side effects and varying levels of efficacy. Because of these unique treatment dynamics, there\u2019s still room for next-generation options of existing medications to shake up the field \u2014 and that\u2019s where Teva Pharmaceuticals sees an opportunity.\n\nIn 2023, the pharma giant won an FDA nod for its schizophrenia drug Uzedy, which pulled in higher-than-expected revenue of $117 million last year. Rather than offering patients a new molecule, Uzedy\u2019s breakthrough is tied to its method of delivery.\n\nHeather DeMyers, VP, U.S. innovative marketing medicines, Teva Permission granted by Permission granted by Teva\n\nDeveloped with a technology Teva licensed from Medincell called SteadyTeq, Uzedy offered the first long-acting subcutaneous form of the decades-old Johnson & Johnson medicine risperidone. The slow-release formulation, which can be taken once a month or once every two months, is designed to keep patients on the medication for longer \u2014 a hefty challenge in schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cWe know that approximately 80% of patients experience multiple relapses over the first five years of treatment,\u201d said Heather DeMyers, Teva\u2019s vice president of U.S. innovative marketing medicines. \u201cSo when we look at different types of innovative solutions, we look at adherence.\u201d\n\nThe company is now looking to repeat that success with the up-and-coming schizophrenia drug TEV-\u2019749, which, like Uzedy, is a subcutaneous long-acting form of a common schizophrenia medication \u2014 in this case, olanzapine.\n\n\u201cOlanzapine has been out for 30+ years, but what\u2019s different here is that we\u2019ve used our experience with Uzedy [to] again control the release, which helps patients reach an optimal treatment quickly but also it can help reduce challenges related to adherence and relapse,\u201d DeMyers said.\n\nPositive late-stage results for TEV-\u2019749 have been rolling in since last year.\n\nTeva\u2019s larger plan\n\nOverall, Teva\u2019s CNS pipeline is set to play a starring role in the company\u2019s quest to drive growth by leaning on four pillars: its generics and biosimilars business, where Teva has long been a powerhouse; operations; branded drugs; and innovative medicines.\n\nThis so-called \u201cPivot to Growth\u201d plan helped the company\u2019s revenue jump 6% to $16.54 billion last year.\n\nIn addition to Uzedy, Teva\u2019s innovative medicines portfolio was propelled by sales for Austedo, which skyrocketed 34% last year. The drug scored its first FDA nod in 2017 for a Huntington\u2019s disease indication, has since been approved for a nervous system disorder called tardive dyskinesia, and is now on track to hit $2.5 billion in revenue by 2027, the company said.\n\nLater this year, Teva will have a better sense of whether TEV-\u2019749 could be its next big hit on the mental health scene.\n\nInterim late-stage results for TEV-\u2019749 published in 2024 showed the drug met its efficacy endpoint at eight weeks, which was measured using the common Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Critically, there were no incidences of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome in the treatment\u2019s phase 1 study.\n\nAlthough rare, PDSS can be life threatening, DeMyers said, and other long-acting treatments carry a black box warning for the side effect. If data from the later-stage studies show no incidence of PDSS, the improved safety profile would differentiate TEV-\u2019749 on the market.\n\nTeva and Medincell announced earlier this month that they\u2019ve completed the phase 3 trial for TEV-\u2019749. DeMyers said Teva expects to evaluate full results from the study later this year and then assess if and when it will file for regulatory approval.\n\nTeva has yet to offer potential sales guidance for TEV-\u2019749, but DeMyers noted that the oral version of olanzapine currently has about 20% market share in schizophrenia.\n\nThe company is also one of several developing longer-acting schizophrenia medications, including Lyndra Therapeutics, which released positive results from its late-stage study of a weekly oral version of risperidone last year.\n\nAnd although approximately 3.5 million Americans are currently living with the condition, the stigma surrounding schizophrenia can often delay diagnosis or contribute to low medication adherence \u2014 a key reason long-acting medications could make a mark.\n\n\u201cSome patients don't want to take an injection or take a pill every day because it reminds them they have the disease,\u201d DeMyers said. \u201cThat\u2019s why a long-acting option like this could potentially be really different, especially with our subcutaneous technology.\u201d",

An additional 16 patients with previous brain-directed therapy, neurologic symptoms, or leptomeningeal disease were assigned to receive nivolumab alone. Patients in the combination group received four doses of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks over 12 weeks, followed by nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients in the nivolumab group and the nonrandomized group received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Maintenance nivolumab was changed to 480 mg every 4 weeks in a protocol amendment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nKey Findings\n\nMedian follow-up was 7.6 years. Intracranial responses occurred in 51% of the combination group, 20% of the nivolumab-alone group, and 6% of the nonrandomized nivolumab group.\n\nIntracranial progression-free survival at 7 years was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29%\u201363%) in the combination group, 15% (95% CI = 6%\u201339%) in the nivolumab group, and 6% (95% CI = 1%\u201342%) in the nonrandomized nivolumab group.

Upfront ipilimumab plus nivolumab should be the standard of care for patients with melanoma brain metastasis; a trial investigating the role of stereotactic surgery in this new paradigm is ongoing.\u201d\n\nGeorgina V.

Looking forward, IMARC Group expects the 7MM to reach USD 17.6 Billion by 2035, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 4.85% during 2025-2035. The psychosis market is growing highly, mainly because of the growing diagnosed cases and awareness of the condition. There has been progress in diagnostic equipment and increased awareness that has resulted in earlier diagnosis and treatment. Improved efficacy with lesser side effects in new antipsychotic medications is the most important driver of this growth. Government support and mental health initiatives are also contributing, along with increasing investments in research and development for better therapeutic solutions. The market is further shaped by the growing demand for personalized treatments and long-acting injectable therapies. In addition, the rise of telemedicine and digital mental health platforms is making treatment more accessible and convenient for patients. This comprehensive approach is helping to address the needs of a wider patient base, pushing the psychosis market to expand rapidly.\n\nTo get more information on this market, Request Sample\n\nRising Prevalence of Psychotic Disorders: Driving the Psychosis Market\n\nThe psychosis market is growing in line with the increases observed in psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. As this trend becomes more common, the need for effective treatments rises- medications, therapeutic interventions, and support systems-in aging populations and in urban areas with more diagnoses. New drugs especially the novel antipsychotics are developed to reduce the side effects, thus growing the market. Another factor contributing to the rising demand in the market is enhanced awareness and early diagnosis, which allows them to manage their conditions well. The rise in psychotic disorders among younger populations also calls for specialized treatments. Moreover, global health organizations and governments are prioritizing mental health, which has led to greater investments in research and development, further supporting the growth of the psychosis market.\n\nDevelopment of Novel Therapies and Pharmacological Treatments: Contributing to Market Expansion\n\nThe psychosis treatment market is primarily growing due to the discovery of new therapies and pharmacological treatments. As scientific studies about the biological causes of psychotic disorders are being advanced, researches are currently focusing on creating more effective treatment interventions that target specific disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disease. The introduction of newer drug classes, such as atypical antipsychotics and agents that target both dopamine and serotonin receptors, is improving treatment outcomes while reducing side effects seen with older medications. In addition, the emergence of personalized medicine with the support of pharmacogenomics is allowing doctors to give better customized treatments with better results. Early intervention has also gained greater importance, particularly in the initial stages of psychosis, which delays the progression of the condition. More awareness regarding mental health and reduced stigma associated with it also increases the demand for these new treatments. These factors and new drug mechanism studies are some factors that might bring about significant growth in this market for treating psychosis, along with an intent on improving patients' quality of life and prevention of relapse.\n\nMarketed Therapies in Psychosis Market\n\nAbilify (Aripiprazole): Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka Pharmaceutical\n\nAbilify (Aripiprazole) is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. It works by modulating dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain to help reduce symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. Abilify helps restore balance to neurotransmitters, improving mood, cognition, and behavior in patients with psychotic disorders.\n\nRisperdal (Risperidone): Janssen\n\nRisperdal (Risperidone), developed by Janssen, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar mania. It functions by regulating neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, in the brain. This helps to reduce psychotic symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and agitation, while also enhancing mood and cognitive function.\n\nZyprexa (Olanzapine): Eli Lilly and Company\n\nZyprexa (Olanzapine) developed by Eli Lilly and Company is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

It targets the muscarinic M4 receptor to improve cognitive and behavioral symptoms while potentially reducing side effects associated with traditional dopamine-based therapies. The drug has shown promising results in Phase 2 clinical trials for adults with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.\n\nDrug Name Company Name MOA ROA NBI-1117568 Neurocrine Biosciences Muscarinic M4 receptor agonists Oral\n\n\n\nDetailed list of emerging therapies in Psychosis is provided in the final report\u2026\n\nLeading Companies in the Psychosis Market:\n\nThe market research report by IMARC includes a profound analysis of the competitive landscape present in the market. Various dominant companies operating around the globe have been on a spree to advance the integrated psychosis management platform present in the market. A few of the companies include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, among others. These companies are driving psychosis market innovation through constant research, diagnostic tools, and growing products for psychosis market that meets the growing demand.\n\nKey Players in Psychosis Market:\n\nThe key players in the psychosis market who are in different phases of developing different therapies are Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Vanda Pharmaceuticals, ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly, Karuna Therapeutics, Luye Pharma, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Neurocrine Biosciences, Sumitomo Pharma, and others.\n\nRegional Analysis:\n\nMajor markets for psychosis are in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Japan. In line with IMARC's estimates, the patient population for psychosis is highest in the United States and, concurrently, is its biggest market in terms of therapy. New breakthroughs in the area of psychosis have concentrated their efforts on strategies of early diagnosis and treatment. Advances in brain mapping have identified essential areas, the hippocampus first among them, where psychosis-related changes may take their start; earlier interventions at this stage open up new treatment possibilities. Therapies involving avatars were developed to bring patients face to face with a controlled virtual situation in which distressing voices confront them, effectively reducing symptoms of psychosis. Early intervention programs targeting individuals who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis are also proving effective in improving long-term outcomes, thus underlining the importance of timely and specialized care. These breakthroughs are changing the landscape of psychosis treatment, offering hope for more effective management and better patient outcomes.\n\nRecent Developments in Psychosis Market:\n\nIn September 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves Cobenfy, which has the combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride, as an oral capsule preparation for adults that treats schizophrenia, which is an antipsychotic drug unlike all other predecessors since its long use standard-of-care, since it works targeting the cholinergic receptors while other antipsychotic medications are focused at dopamine receptors.\n\nIn August 2024, Neurocrine Biosciences conducted a Phase 2 clinical study on NBI-1117568, or NBI-'568, in adults suffering from schizophrenia. The drug demonstrated positive results in the clinical trial. NBI-'568 is the first experimental oral muscarinic M4 selective agonist being developed to treat schizophrenia.\n\nIn June 2024, Luye Pharma announced that it had received an Establishment Inspection Report from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), confirming that the manufacturing facility for Paliperidone Palmitate Extended-Release Injectable Suspension (LY03010) successfully passed a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI). The inspection resulted in a No Action Indicated (NAI) status, meaning no FDA-483 observations were issued.\n\nIn April 2024, Vanda Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted approval for Fanapt (iloperidone) to treat psychosis in adults, particularly for acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This approval was based on findings from a Phase 3 clinical trial, which was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled.\n\nKey information covered in the report\n\nBase Year: 2024\n\nHistorical Period: 2019-2024\n\nMarket Forecast: 2025-2035\n\nCountries Covered\n\nUnited States\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nJapan\n\nAnalysis Covered Across Each Country\n\nHistorical, current, and future epidemiology scenario\n\nHistorical, current, and future performance of the psychosis market\n\nHistorical, current, and future performance of various therapeutic categories in the market\n\nSales of various drugs across the psychosis market\n\nReimbursement scenario in the market\n\nIn-market and pipeline drugs\n\nCompetitive Landscape:\n\nThis report offers a comprehensive analysis of current psychosis marketed drugs and late-stage pipeline drugs.\n\nIn-Market Drugs\n\nDrug Overview\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nRegulatory Status\n\nClinical Trial Results\n\nDrug Uptake and Market Performance\n\nLate-Stage Pipeline Drugs\n\nDrug Overview\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nRegulatory Status\n\nClinical Trial Results\n\nDrug Uptake and Market Performance\n\nAbout Us:\n\nIMARC Group is a global management consulting firm that helps the world\u2019s most ambitious changemakers to create a lasting impact.

            "content": "Payal Sheth [00:00]: It is in our human nature to want to know the outcome of an endeavor before we begin. Are we going to be successful? Are we going to fail? Our belief and confidence that our actions are going to translate into success is what keeps us going as human beings. That is also the primary, yet elusive goal in drug discovery. How can we predict, before years of testing, what molecules are actually going to translate into medicines of the future?\n\nMike Ellis [00:38]: Drug discovery has been described as trying to find a needle in a haystack. That analogy falls a little bit short because we don't exactly know what the needle looks like. We understand what we ultimately want to happen therapeutically in a human, but trying to understand what molecule we should go and make, that's the needle that we're looking for. And it's within a vast opportunity space of millions of molecules. It's a bit miraculous that, that we ever discover the molecule that is safe and effective.\n\nMike Ellis [01:11]:\n\nTypically what has occurred in the past is it has been a funnel-based approach of drug discovery, where it's widest at the top and gets narrower as molecules progress. And we'll start with many, many molecules. And then working our way through and narrowing as we go, to ultimately arrive at what we believe is a single molecule that should move forward into clinical development. There are many, many, many possibilities of what could be created in the lab. We have to have thick skin. We have to be persistent. And it's a multi-year process.\n\nPayal Sheth [01:43]: Antibody generation used to be a very empirical, very labor intensive process. In fact, it would take us anywhere from 9 to 12 months to generate the first pool of antibodies. And it would further limit the number of programs that we could work on and the candidates that we could progress from a drug discovery standpoint. The longer that we have to wait for the development processes, the longer the patients have to wait for these transformative medicines. Over the past 10 to 15 years, advances in recombinant DNA technologies has allowed us to shrink our timelines for antibody generation.\n\nPayal Sheth [02:15]: It is very exciting to be a scientist in this era. We're experiencing a convergence built on decades of advances in different scientific disciplines. Convergence of lab-based scientists, working with computational scientists, the sheer amount of data sets that we have that's accessible to us, the compute power, the AI machine learning infrastructure, and algorithms are fueling our predictive power in a way that was completely unprecedented even a few years ago.\n\nPayal Sheth: [02:48]: We're using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the large molecule space to help us prioritize molecules for synthesis and generation that have the highest probability of success. This is removing a lot of redundant work in our organization. It's allowing us to work on more programs, and it's allowing us to accelerate existing programs. We're continuously learning from that perspective. As we generate more data sets, we're updating our models to reflect these updated data sets so that they can become better in terms of predictive outcomes.\n\nMike Ellis [03:19]: We have moved from a funnel where every molecule is treated the same upfront to now saying, each molecule is unique, each molecule can have its own path for decision making. And that dramatically accelerates the process. We're going in the lab, and we're making things that have a higher probability of meeting the criteria that we're setting out for. And so that's a time saving, that's an energy saving that accelerates our drug discovery process.\n\nPayal Sheth [03:53]: At Bristol Myers Squibb, we have a long history of using novel technologies in order to accelerate our drug discovery processes and improve our chances for success. We have integrated AI, machine learning, and the human component as a part of our drug discovery fabric. We view these technologies as an extension of our labs. There's a cultural component to embracing the mindset of combining human as well as computational aspects of drug discovery. And it is these synergies that's allowing us to ensure that we are not losing sight of what we already have in terms of extensive experience in drug discovery, but also the world that we live in that has incredible computational capabilities and that fuel our predictive molecule invention aspirations.\n\nMike Ellis [04:41]: We are applying what we call our predict first strategy across our small molecule portfolio. We are predicting before we synthesize on the majority of the molecules that we go into the lab and create. Just a few years ago, we were predicting maybe 5% of the molecules. It's also allowed us to move from a funnel-based approach to a tailored, dynamic screening strategy. We are seeing at this point, measurable and meaningful impact to the rate of progression and the quality of progression of our programs. And that's what we're motivated by. We want to bring more medicines to more patients faster.\n\nMike Ellis [05:31]: Today we have the greatest predictive power at the earliest phases of testing. This is where we have the most data. I believe that as we move forward in the future, that we will improve our predictive power in the later stages of the discovery and development process, that we will be able to predict safety, that we will be able to predict developability and other aspects that today we just don't have as much data.\n\nPayal Sheth [05:59]: Typically, drug discovery timelines have been in the scale of decades. And it has been incredibly hard to truncate those timelines. For us to be able to leverage predictive molecule invention upfront allows us to accelerate drug discovery in a way that increases our chances of progressing the best molecules.\n\nPayal Sheth [06:16]: I've always been a dreamer as a kid. I imagine a world where we could create and design biotherapeutics molecules in silico using our sequence and structural models that are anchored around experimental data sets to get to the therapeutic much faster. And the shorter these timelines, the better the patients are positioned in having access to these transformative therapies in the future.",

Samples were washed extensively and immediately acquired on a BD LSRFortessa X20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed with the FlowJo software v.10.8 (BD Biosciences).\n\nPhenoCycler\u2013Fusion tissue imaging and analysis\n\nAntibodies targeting tumor and non-tumor cells in the TME were conjugated to short DNA oligonucleotides and titrated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Akoya Biosciences)43. Antigens shown in this study include the following: CD14 (AKYP0079, 1/200 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), CD11c (AKYP0051, 1/400 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), CD141 (AKP0124, 1/200 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), CD3 (AKYP0062, 1/200 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), CD8 (AKYP0028, 1/200 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), CD4 (AKYP0048, 1/200 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), GzmB (AKYP0086, 1/100 dilution, Akoya Biosciences), FOXP3 (AKYP0086, 1/100 dilution, Akoya Biosciences) and S100B (1/200 dilution, cat. no. 42397, Cell Signaling Technology). Initial T cell quantification was performed using the HALO AI v.3.6 image analysis platform with default artificial intelligence-based cell sequencing and manual gating of T cell phenotypes. Subsequent broad immunophenotyping was performed with cell segmentation in StarDist using the DAPI channel (cytoplasm segmentation was estimated using a morphological dilation of 5 \u00b5m); cell phenotyping for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was performed using the machine learning classifier in QuPath v.0.4.4 (ref. 44). Cell neighborhood enrichment analysis was performed using a graph-based connectivity algorithm with the squidpy Python package45. Cell proximity in spatial neighborhoods was quantified with a permutation-based test (1,000 default) by comparing the spatial location of cell types and their relative distances.\n\nTCR pan-clonality assay\n\nDNA target amplification (200 ng genomic DNA input), partial digestion, barcoding of amplicons and purification were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Oncomine Human Immune Repertoire user guide for TCR pan-clonality assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The barcoding set consisted of the IonTorrent Dual Barcode Kit 1\u201396 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Target amplification was for 31 cycles.\n\nPurified libraries were quantified with quantitative PCR (qPCR) using an Ion Library TaqMan Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the Oncomine Human Immune Repertoire user guide. A 1/100 dilution of each sample library was analyzed in each case. qPCR was performed using a QuantStudio 7 Pro qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in standard run mode (Oncomine Human Immune Repertoire user guide). Individual barcoded libraries were diluted to a final concentration of 50 pM in nuclease-free water using Eppendorf DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Sigma-Aldrich). For each sequencing chip, equal volumes (5 \u00b5l) of 12 diluted library samples were combined on ice. Subsequently, 25 \u00b5l of the pooled libraries were used for template preparation and chip loading.\n\nThe sequencing workflow consisted of template preparation and sequencing chip loading on an Ion Chef instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific), sequencing on an Ion GeneStudio S5 plus system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by data analysis. Planned sequencing runs were based on the Oncomine TCR Pan-Clonality Assay using the Torrent Suite software v.5.18.1. The kits used for each planned sequencing run were an Ion 550 Kit\u2013Chef, Ion S5 Sequencing Kit and Ion 550 chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing data were automatically uploaded to the Ion reporter software v.5.18.4 for analysis using the Oncomine TCR Beta-SR and Gamma-SR\u2013w1.4\u2013DNA Single Sample workflow. Multi-sample analysis was based on join CDR3 nt.\n\nClonotypes were defined using V, J and CDR3 amino acid sequences from the TCR\u03b2 and TCR\u03b3 clone summaries from Thermo Fisher Scientific Ion Torrent targeted next-generation sequencing assay. Nonproductive clonotypes, based on the \u2018functionality\u2019 field, were excluded from the analysis. The productive clonotype frequency was calculated based on the total number of reads for a clonotype divided by the total number of productive reads in the sample. Clonotype diversity Shannon entropy (H) was calculated based on the clonotype abundances in each sample using H = \u2212\u03a3pi \u00d7 ln(pi), where pi is the proportion of sequence i relative to the total N sequences46. Maximum Shannon diversity was calculated as ln(total clonotypes). The Shannon equitability or evenness was calculated as H/(max diversity).\n\nDistribution of clonotypes in each sample\n\nClonotypes were ranked according to their frequency, from largest to smallest, using min_rank from the dplyr R package (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)47. The min_rank approach gives every tie the same (smallest) value. The cumulative frequency for the ranked clonotypes in each sample was calculated using the cumsum function from base R. Data analysis was performed in R v.4.3.0 (21 April 2023 release) using RStudio v.4.3.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.0/, ref. 48) with the following R packages: tidyverse v.2.0.0 (ref. 49); ggpubr (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/index.html); ggsci v.3.0.0 (https://github.com/nanxstats/ggsci); lemon v.0.4.9 (https://github.com/stefanedwards/lemon); and UpSetR v.1.4.0 (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=UpSetR).\n\nProximity extension assay\n\nPlasma samples collected before (day \u22124) and after treatment (days +7 and +12) were analyzed using the proximity extension assay at the Olink Proteomics facility, Uppsala, Sweden. In total, 725 immuno-oncology-related protein biomarkers (Olink Explore 384 Inflammation, Olink Explore 384 Oncology (www.olink.com)) were measured and reported as normalized protein expression values, which is an arbitrary unit on a log 2 scale, where a higher value corresponds to higher protein expression.\n\nCTC analysis\n\nA total of 7.5 ml whole-blood samples were processed using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform (RareCyte)50. Nucleated blood cells were isolated using AccuCyte (RareCyte) and spread onto eight SuperFrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slides were immunofluorescently stained on the Autostainer Link 48 (Agilent Technologies) using the following: anti-GFAP (AF488; cat. no. 560297, Becton Dickinson), anti-EGFR (PE; cat. no. FAB9577P, R&D Systems), anti-CD45 (AF750; cat. no. NBP1-79127AF750, Novus Biologicals), anti-CD66b (AF750; cat. no. FAB42462, R&D Systems) antibodies and a nuclear DAPI dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slides were then scanned on the CyteFinder HT (RareCyte) digital immunofluorescence microscope at \u00d710 magnification, with the following exposure times: 0.05 s (DAPI); 0.01 s (GFAP); 0.1 s (EGFR); and 0.1 s (CD45/CD66b). Image files were analyzed using an automated software and presented to the reviewer for CTC confirmation (CyteMapper, RareCyte). A CTC was defined as positive for DAPI and GFAP, and negative for CD45/CD66b (mean fluorescence intensity cutoff = 15).\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

The safety profile for the dual immunotherapy combination remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols, with no new safety signals identified. The study is ongoing to assess secondary endpoints, including overall survival.\n\nOpdivo plus Yervoy received approval from the U.S. FDA in July 2018 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that have progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Opdivo plus Yervoy was also approved in December 2024 in the European Union for the first-line treatment of adult patients with MSI-H or dMMR unresectable or mCRC and in October 2024 for the same indication by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).\n\nRead also: Bristol Myers Squibb gets European Commission nod for Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat colorectal cancer",

The government is instead offering to purchase drugs on terms that plaintiff is under no legal obligation to accept.\u201d \u2013 Trump DOJ brief\n\nPatient advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs (P4AD) yesterday filed its fourth amicus brief defending the Biden Administration\u2019s drug pricing reforms, which were implemented as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), this time against Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Notably, the Trump Department of Justice (DOJ) also filed a brief last week that closely tracks the Biden Admin\u2019s arguments, indicating that the new administration will continue to defend the drug pricing provisions of the IRA, in a rare demonstration of agreement with a Biden-era position.\n\nThe P4AD brief echoes previous briefs the organization has filed on behalf of patients in cases brought by Boehringer Ingelheim in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), Janssen, and AstraZeneca in the Third Circuit; and Novo Nordisk in the Third Circuit. \u201cThe IRA as a whole, and the Negotiation Program in particular, is a historic reform and a monumental victory for the millions of Americans who depend on Medicare for their essential medications,\u201d said the P4AD\u2019s latest brief. \u201cIt marks a critical shift in the system to make Medicare work for the patients it is supposed to serve instead of those who profit from it.\u201d\n\nThe IRA, enacted in 2022, was designed as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit while simultaneously lowering prescription drug prices for eligible patients. While some celebrated the bill, pharmaceutical companies and IP advocates have been strongly opposed.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the Program is to obtain medicines for Medicare beneficiaries without the need for the government to pay fair market value,\u201d BMS wrote in its opening brief last September. In addition to allegations that the IRA compels drug manufacturers to provide Medicare with \u201caccess\u201d to their leading medicines at steep discounts, effectuating an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, BMS claimed that the IRA violates its First Amendment rights by forcing medicine manufacturers, through its Negotiation Program, to express the government\u2019s political messages. By imposing monetary fines to companies that don\u2019t comply, BMS and other drug companies have argued the IRA is using coercive tactics while ignoring the constitutional rights of the manufacturers.\n\nBut the DOJ\u2019s most recent brief in the Novartis case repeats the Biden Administration\u2019s view that \u201cthe Negotiation Program does not give rise to a physical taking because it neither physically takes plaintiff\u2019s drugs nor mandates their sale. The government is instead offering to purchase drugs on terms that plaintiff is under no legal obligation to accept.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is also suing the government over the plan, has argued the program cannot be characterized as a voluntary negotiation since the affected companies would be subject to onerous excise taxes for refusing to participate and because it would have devastating consequences for patients if companies were to actually pull the affected drugs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made its initial offers to pharmaceutical companies pursuant to the IRA in February 2024. The drugs initially selected for the price negotiation program under the IRA included: Eliquis (Anticoagulant, Bristol-Myers Squibb); Jardiance (Diabetes, Lilly); Xarelto (blood thinner, Janssen); Januvia (diabetes, Merck); Farxiga (chronic kidney disease, AstraZeneca); Entresto (heart failure, Novartis); Enbrel (autoimmune diseases, Amgen); Imbruvica (Leukemia, AbbVie/Johnson & Johnson); Stelara (Crohn\u2019s disease and Ulcerative Colitis, Janssen); and Fiasp (insulin, Novo Nordisk).\n\nP4AD in a press release yesterday cited statistics showing that taxpayers would save $100 billion through 2031 as a result of the negotiation program; see an estimated out-of-pocket savings of $1.5 billion annually for people on Medicare Part D starting in 2026; that there would be \u201c656,967 fewer deaths projected over seven years due to improved treatment adherence, with nearly 94,000 lives saved annually from reduced out-of-pocket costs from Medicare negotiation\u201d; and that the projected total savings to the government from the IRA through 2031 is $237 billion.\n\nHowever, the Chamber and drug companies have argued the loss of investment confidence due to price controls will be immeasurable. The Chamber\u2019s Director of IP Policy at the Global Innovation Policy Center (GIPC), John Manchester, wrote in January 2025:\n\n\u201cPrice controls on medicines may seem like a quick fix, but they come with significant drawbacks. As evidence and experience from other countries demonstrate, price controls reduce the availability of new treatments and cures, and ultimately harm patients who rely on cutting-edge medical innovation.\u201d\n\nIn another post, Manchester cited a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that found price control policies \u201cwould have \u2018small or very small effects on prices\u2019 but would \u2018dampen the incentives\u2019 for life science manufacturers to invest in research and development.\u201d\n\nBut P4AD Executive Director Merith Basey said of the most recent lawsuit in a statement yesterday that Novartis is simply \u201cfighting to protect its monopoly pricing power.\u201d Basey added:\n\n\u201cNovartis has raked in billions of dollars from Entresto while patients are forced to make impossible choices just to afford it\u2026. This lawsuit isn\u2019t about constitutional rights \u2013 it\u2019s about corporate greed and preserving massive profits at the expense of patients.\u201d\n\nImage Source: Deposit Photos\n\nAuthor: MMPhoto21\n\nImage ID: 788956412",

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nBristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +134.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 points to a change of +488.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of -9.6% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Bristol Myers is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Dividend Stock Portfolio For Income: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other stocks to buy from dividend stock portfolio for income.\n\nThere is a common misconception that dividend stocks are primarily suited for those nearing retirement. However, this is not the case. Both experienced and retail investors have long favored dividend stocks, as they provide a steady stream of income. Unlike growth companies, dividend-paying firms distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders. While dividend investing may seem simple, successfully implementing this strategy requires thorough research and careful analysis.\n\nFinancial advisor Michael Dinich discussed dividend investing in an interview with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cWhile low-cost index funds provide easily diversified exposure to the market with minimal effort, selecting individual dividend payers demands continued research to find suitable candidates.\u201d\n\nHe further highlighted that dividend stocks serve as a reliable income source, which can either be reinvested to compound returns or used as cash for various financial needs. This makes them particularly valuable for younger investors, offering both market exposure and a consistent income stream. His insights align with the broader impact of dividend income on market returns over extended periods. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, from 1926 to July 2023, dividends contributed 32% of the monthly total return of the broader market, with the remainder driven by capital appreciation.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nA study by WisdomTree emphasized the strong income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The report suggested that focusing on dividends can significantly boost investors\u2019 dividend earnings and improve the trailing 12-month dividend yield. This approach is especially beneficial during periods of low yields and market uncertainty. Investing in dividend-weighted indexes may provide a reliable strategy for generating income in such challenging conditions.\n\nFor the past two years, dividend stocks have underperformed the broader market, largely due to increased investments in the AI sector. However, analysts remain optimistic about dividend growth, particularly as more technology companies introduce dividend policies to attract investors. According to a report by S&P Global, total US dividends are expected to rise by 7% in 2025, reaching $784 billion. In recent years, and continuing into the current fiscal year, key contributions to dividend growth have come from sectors such as energy, pharmaceuticals, financial services, banking, and REITs. The report also highlighted that the media and entertainment sector experienced a significant surge in total dividend payouts in 2024, climbing by 140%, largely driven by the dividend policies of two major companies. This upward trend is expected to continue in 2025, with the sector projected to see an 18.6% increase in dividend growth, leading the market once again.\n\nWhile regular dividends are projected to increase, variable dividends are set to decline by approximately 50%, with estimates placing the total for 2025 at $13.5 billion. Across all US sectors, variable dividends are expected to shrink, as persistent inflation and higher interest rates have limited the additional cash flow available for distribution.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to pick companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with dividend yields of around 2%, as of February 25, demonstrating robust financial standings and consistent cash flow, which are indicative of their ability to sustain reliable dividends for passive income. From these companies we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and their holdings as of Q4 2024\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based pharmaceutical industry company. It prioritizes investing in the development of new molecular entities while also acquiring companies to strengthen its research and development efforts. This strategy helps the company maintain a competitive edge, driving continuous innovation and reinforcing its leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. The stock has surged by over 15% in the past 12 months.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) reported revenue of $12.34 billion, which showed a 7.5% growth from the same period last year. Revenue from the company\u2019s Growth Portfolio saw a notable 21% increase, reaching $6.4 billion. This growth was largely fueled by strong demand for key medications, with Reblozyl, Breyanzi, and Camzyos experiencing year-over-year increases of 71%, 125%, and 101%, respectively.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) ended the year with over $10.3 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. It is one of the best stocks for a dividend stock portfolio as the company has been making regular dividend payments for the past 93 years. In addition, it has raised its payouts for 16 consecutive years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.26%, as of February 25.\n\nOverall, BMY ranks 1st on our list of stocks to buy from dividend stock portfolio for income. While we acknowledge the potential for BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BMY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Small-molecule drugs will still be the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry because they are of a lower cost, couples readily to a straightforward manufacture process, and a variety of diseases have well-established treatment plans for them. These medicines are especially useful for chronic diseases and infectious diseases. Nonetheless, we are also seeing a gradual transition to biologics and biosimilars, as they are very effective in treating complex diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. Over the forecast period, biologics products like monoclonal antibodies and gene therapies are anticipated to gain considerable traction owing to their targeted therapeutic models and capacity to cover previously untreatable conditions.\n\nBy Product\n\nIn 2023, the branded segment accounted for the largest share 66% due to the high demand for patented drugs and innovative therapies. Branded pharmaceuticals are often associated with advanced R&D, rigorous clinical trials, and strong marketing strategies, which contribute to their premium pricing and market dominance. Nevertheless, the segment of generic drugs is also growing fast, especially in emerging markets, thanks to their low price and many blockbuster drugs going off patent. The biosimilars segment is proving to be a significant growth, providing more affordable options for patients needing expensive biologics and increasing patient access to advanced treatment.\n\nBy Type\n\nIn 2023, the prescription drugs segment accounted for the largest revenue share of 88%, owing to the high dependence on prescribed drugs for treating chronic and acute diseases. These medications are necessary to treat some complex diseases for which the use of specialized medical supervision is required. Even though the over-the-counter (OTC) drugs market is growing with significant growth rate, it is growing fast because of their easy accessibility and increased self-medication for minor ailments. The growing number of over-the-counter drugs for allergy management, pain relief, and gastroenteritis is anticipated to increase segment growth during the forecast period.\n\nBy End Market\n\nIn 2023, hospitals led the end-user segment with 53% share of total market revenue. Hospitals are the main site of comprehensive treatment for acute and chronic illness, which requires a constant supply of pharmaceuticals. The increasing cases of hospital admissions as well as the rising healthcare infrastructure in developing regions also drive the demand for pharmaceutical products. Retail pharmacies and online pharmacies also play an important role as end-users, while the online pharmacy end-user type is witnessing rapid growth thanks to home delivery and growing e-commerce platform adoption.\n\nFor A Detailed Briefing Session with Our Team of Analysts, Connect with Us Now@ https://www.snsinsider.com/request-analyst/5697\n\nPharmaceutical Market Segmentation\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Molecule Type\n\nBiologics & Biosimilars (Large Molecules) Monoclonal Antibodies Vaccines Cell & Gene Therapy Others\n\nConventional Drugs (Small Molecules)\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Product\n\nBranded\n\nGenerics\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Type\n\nPrescription\n\nOTC\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Disease\n\nCardiovascular diseases\n\nCancer\n\nDiabetes\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nNeurological disorders\n\nRespiratory diseases\n\nAutoimmune diseases\n\nMental health disorders\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nWomen\u2019s health Diseases\n\nGenetic and rare genetic diseases\n\nDermatological conditions\n\nObesity\n\nRenal diseases\n\nLiver conditions\n\nHematological disorders\n\nEye conditions\n\nInfertility conditions\n\nEndocrine disorders\n\nAllergies\n\nOthers\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Route of Administration\n\nOral\n\nTopical\n\nParenteral\n\nIntravenous\n\nIntramuscular\n\nInhalations\n\nOther\n\nBy Pharmaceutical Formulation\n\nTablets\n\nCapsules\n\nInjectable\n\nSprays\n\nSuspensions\n\nPowders\n\nOther Formulations\n\nBy Pharmaceutical End Market\n\nHospitals\n\nClinics\n\nOthers\n\nRegional Insights\n\nIn 2023, North America was the most prominent revenue contributor to the global pharmaceutical market, with 45.0% of the total revenue share. This dominance of market owing to the market's advanced healthcare infrastructure, the high healthcare expenditure, and strong presence of leading pharmaceutical companies. North America dominated the market, and the U.S. is likely the largest market in this region as the region has a developed healthcare system, extensive research and development activities (R&D), supportive government policies, and a high prevalence of chronic diseases. New statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that almost 60% of adults in the U.S. have at least one chronic disease, accentuating the need for novel therapies.\n\nIn the forecast period, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to be growing with the fastest growth as it is driven by fast urbanization, increasing expenditure for healthcare as well as the extending of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities. Countries like China and India are implementing governments policies to increase health care accessibility and reduce infectious and chronic disease burdens. India's pharmaceutical industry, often referred to as the \"pharmacy of the world,\" is a major exporter of generic drugs, contributing significantly to the global market.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn 2023, Pfizer Inc. launched a new mRNA-based vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), marking a significant advancement in vaccine technology.\n\nIn January 2024, Roche received FDA approval for its novel immunotherapy drug for advanced melanoma, showcasing the growing focus on oncology treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Single-User PDF of Pharmaceutical Market Analysis & Outlook Report 2024-2032@ https://www.snsinsider.com/checkout/5697\n\nTable of Contents \u2013 Major Key Points\n\n1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) stands against other stocks that grow firmer despite mixed market sentiment.\n\nThe stock market kicked off the first trading day of the week on a lackluster note, with major indices finishing mixed as it struggled to rebound from Friday\u2019s bloodbath.\n\nThe Dow Jones was the sole gainer among the main indices, eking out a 0.08-percent gain. In contrast, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 0.50 percent and 1.21 percent, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, ten companies registered strength, albeit posting only modest gains. This article details the reasons behind their performance.\n\nTo come up with Monday\u2019s top gainers, we considered only the stocks with $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume.\n\nWhy Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Went Up On Monday?\n\nA pharmacy shelves stocked with pharmaceutical drugs awaiting distribution.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)\n\nBristol-Myers saw its share prices grow by 3.67 percent on Monday to finish at $57.88 apiece as investors cheered news of the company\u2019s submission of a supplemental biologics license to the Food and Drug Administration for its drug treatment Opdivo plus Yervoy.\n\nThe drugs are expected to become a potential first-line treatment option for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer.\n\nThe application followed the successful clinical trial that resulted in superior progression-free survival for the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination.\n\nAccording to BMY, the FDA granted the application Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review status and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of June 23, 2025.\n\nOverall, BMY ranks 10th on our list of stocks that grow firmer despite mixed market sentiment. While we acknowledge the potential of BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "An immunotherapy combination for advanced, highly mutated colorectal cancer has significantly delayed disease progression vs single-agent therapy, according to data presented at the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.1\n\nThe phase III CheckMate 8HW trial compared the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab plus the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab vs single-agent nivolumab in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair\u2013deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer. At 47 months of follow-up, median progression-free survival has not yet been reached with the dual therapy vs 39.3 months with nivolumab alone, which translated into a 38% risk reduction in disease progression or death for the combination. Authors of the study emphasized that patients in the combination arm derived longer treatment durations without compromising overall quality of life.\n\n\u201cThese results, combined with the previously reported superiority of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs chemotherapy in the first-line setting,2 establish nivolumab/ipilimumab as a new standard of care for patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer,\u201d said Thierry Andr\u00e9, MD, of Sorbonne University and Saint Antoine Hospital in Paris, who presented the findings.\n\n\n\nThierry Andr\u00e9, MD\n\nAs Dr. Andr\u00e9 explained, MSI-H/dMMR tumors account for approximately 4% to 7% of all metastatic colorectal cancer and pose a unique challenge because of their inherent molecular features and historically limited responses to chemotherapy plus targeted agents. Earlier studies demonstrated that single-agent immunotherapy, such as pembrolizumab, can yield long-lasting responses in MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer, but approximately 29% of patients in that setting had primary disease progression.\n\n\u201cCombination immunotherapy has attracted interest because dual checkpoint blockade can mount a more robust immune response,\u201d said Dr. Andr\u00e9. He noted that phase II data from CheckMate 142 suggested a benefit for nivolumab plus ipilimumab, inspiring the larger phase III CheckMate 8HW trial.\n\nStudy Methods\n\nCheckMate 8HW was designed as a randomized, international, multicenter trial for patients with advanced or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer who were naive to immunotherapy. Patients could have received up to two lines of prior therapy before trial enrollment. All participants had tumors confirmed as MSI-H/dMMR by central testing.\n\nThe trial had two primary comparisons. The first report showed nivolumab plus ipilimumab was tested against physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Previously published data from that arm showed an advantage for dual immunotherapy. This report showed the second comparison\u2014nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs nivolumab alone across all lines of treatment\u2014and this was the focus of Dr. Andr\u00e9\u2019s presentation, which was published in The Lancet.3\n\nIn total, 707 patients were allocated to these two treatment arms for a maximum of 2 years of treatment. The combination arm involved nivolumab and ipilimumab, administered intravenously, every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg, as monotherapy, every 4 weeks. In the single-agent arm, patients received nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg, as monotherapy, every 4 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (by blinded independent central review) and response rates for patients with centrally confirmed MSI-H/dMMR status. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, safety, and quality-of-life changes as measured by a global health quality instrument.\n\nKey Results\n\nWith a median follow-up of 47 months in patients with centrally confirmed MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (n = 582), median progression-free survival had not been reached in the dual-immunotherapy arm, whereas the single-agent nivolumab arm had a median progression-free survival of 39.3 months. In the overall population (n = 707), the median\n\nprogression-free survival was 54.1 months with the combination vs 18.4 months with single-agent nivolumab. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab conferred a statistically significant hazard ratio of 0.62, representing a 38% lower risk of disease progression or death.\n\nThe objective response rate also favored combination treatment: 71% vs 58% with nivolumab alone. Median duration of response could not be calculated in either arm because the majority of patients were still responding at the time of analysis, said Dr. Andr\u00e9.\n\nToxicity and Quality of Life\n\nThe dual-immunotherapy regimen did increase the incidence of treatment-related adverse events compared with single-agent nivolumab. All-grade treatment-related adverse events were reported in 81% of patients given the combination vs 71% in those given the monotherapy.\n\nGrade 3 or 4 events occurred in 22% of participants receiving both agents compared with 14% of those given nivolumab alone. Serious adverse events were reported in 18% with dual therapy and in 8% with nivolumab alone.\n\nCommon toxicities across both arms included pruritus, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, asthenia, and fatigue, with more hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency in the combination arm. The immunologic nature of the dual regimen led to more immune-mediated events with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as expected from prior experiences with checkpoint inhibitors. However, Dr. Andr\u00e9 emphasized that most adverse events remained manageable with standard immunosuppressive or supportive interventions.\n\nDespite the higher rate of severe adverse events in the combination arm, overall quality of life did not appear to suffer. Patient-reported outcomes indicated stable or improved quality of life over time, said Dr. Andr\u00e9, suggesting the benefits in disease control might offset potential toxicity burdens.\n\nAlthough future analyses will provide deeper insight into overall survival and the optimal treatment duration (2 years), the current findings confirm that a dual immunotherapy approach can be a \u201cpowerful\u201d first- or subsequent-line option for this subset of metastatic colorectal cancer, according to Dr. Andr\u00e9.\n\nExpert Point of View\n\nInvited discussant Wells Messersmith, MD, FASCO, FACP, Professor and Head, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Cancer Center, highlighted the significant results of the CheckMate 8HW study, particularly with respect to the progression-free survival curves.\n\n\n\nWells Messersmith, MD, FASCO, FACP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to see the curves almost flattened out at the end, which is exactly what we hope for with immunotherapy,\u201d said Dr. Messersmith. He noted that the dual regimen of nivolumab plus ipilimumab added approximately 13% to the response rate and achieved a hazard ratio of 0.62 compared with nivolumab alone.\n\nDr. Messersmith also emphasized that, unlike in microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, the presence of liver metastases did not appear to affect treatment outcomes in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-high) disease. \u201cFor some reason, MSI-high disease seems less influenced by liver metastases,\u201d he explained. \u201cUnderstanding that biology might help us treat MSS colorectal cancer with liver metastases more effectively down the road.\u201d\n\nAddressing safety, Dr. Messersmith observed that although dual immune checkpoint blockade came with an increased incidence of immune-related adverse events, \u201cthe toxicity price is there, but it\u2019s actually pretty low, especially for severe toxicities.\u201d He noted that most adverse events could be managed with standard interventions and that quality-of-life scores improved over time.\n\nClinical Implications and Remaining Questions\n\nReflecting on clinical practice, Dr. Messersmith shared these thoughts: \u201cIf a patient with MSI-high disease values response and higher progression-free survival, I would use low-dose ipilimumab plus nivolumab. I\u2019ll be changing what I do and use combination therapy.\u201d However, questions remain about the optimal duration, he added, with some evidence suggesting patients may not need the full 2 years of nivolumab.\n\n\u201cAt this point, you should commit at the start to either give a doublet or a singlet,\u201d Dr. Messersmith concluded. \u201cWe don\u2019t have data on escalating from one to two drugs.\u201d\n\nDISCLOSURE: This study was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb.

The FDA granted the application Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review status and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of June 23, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s milestone brings us one step closer to providing an effective dual immunotherapy treatment option to adult and pediatric patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, Opdivo global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cWe look forward to potentially bringing a new standard of care treatment option to this patient population.\u201d\n\nThe application was based on results from the three-arm Phase 3 CheckMate -8HW study demonstrating that Opdivo plus Yervoy met the dual primary endpoints of progression free survival (PFS) compared to investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first-line setting and compared to Opdivo monotherapy across all lines of therapy, as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR).\n\nInitial results were first presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, with additional results presented at the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. The safety profile for the dual immunotherapy combination remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols, with no new safety signals identified. The study is ongoing to assess secondary endpoints, including overall survival.\n\nOpdivo plus Yervoy received approval from the U.S. FDA in July 2018 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that have progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Opdivo plus Yervoy was also approved in December 2024 in the European Union for the first-line treatment of adult patients with MSI-H or dMMR unresectable or mCRC and in October 2024 for the same indication by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -8HW clinical trial.\n\nAbout CheckMate -8HW\n\nCheckMate -8HW (NCT04008030) is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone or the investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\n839 patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo monotherapy (Opdivo 240 mg Q2W for six doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 240 mg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg Q3W for four doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), or investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (BICR) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first line setting and PFS per BICR for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone across all lines of therapy.\n\nAbout dMMR or MSI-H Colorectal Cancer\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body\u2019s digestive or gastrointestinal system. CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In 2020, it is estimated that there were approximately 1,931,000 new cases of the disease; it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined.\n\nMismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5-7% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. These patients are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo\u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nAbout Yervoy\n\nYervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types.\n\nINDICATIONS\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated as neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, followed by single-agent OPDIVO\u00ae as adjuvant treatment after surgery.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (\u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab) and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%).\n\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).\n\nOPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 8% (35/456), including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (4.2%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.5%), and Grade 2 (4.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients, including Grade 3 (2.2%) and Grade 2 (1.9%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, hypophysitis occurred in 9% (42/456), including Grade 3 (2.4%) and Grade 2 (6%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, hypophysitis occurred in 4.4% (29/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (0.9%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, thyroiditis occurred in 2.7% (22/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.5%) and Grade 2 (2.2%).\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.7% (54/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) and Grade 2 (1.2%).

            "content": "Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch \u2014 an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets: The S & P 500 is basically flat in afternoon trading Monday after staging a nice comeback from its early session lows. Wall Street is trying to regain some stability in the wake of an ugly sell-off last Friday. Banks, other cyclical sectors and red-hot momentum stocks were among the hard-hit areas Friday amid concerns about slowing economic activity following a string of soft data points. The market comeback on Monday isn't getting any help from artificial intelligence-linked stocks, such as Club chip names Nvidia and Broadcom , as well as those that benefit from data center power needs, such as Club holding Eaton , GE Vernova , Vertiv and Constellation Energy . This cohort was struggling to find its footing following a TD Cowen report dated Friday, in which analysts said their channel checks indicated Microsoft had canceled some U.S. data center leases. It's unclear if Cowen's checks are related to a demand signal or Microsoft pulling back some of its OpenAI-related investments now that the upstart AI company has a new financial backer in Softbank. Analysts at Jefferies, who coincidently were with Microsoft in Australia for meetings, wrote that the company reiterated there has been no change in its capex plan or strategy. Microsoft also provided our colleagues at CNBC with a statement . \"Our plans to spend over [$80 billion] on infrastructure this [fiscal year] remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand,\" a company spokesperson said in an email, adding: \"While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.\" Bristol's a brightspot: If there's one winner from this rotation out of momentum and AI-related stocks, it's been the health-care sector. It's now the top-performing S & P 500 sector year to date on the ever-changing leaderboard. Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the standouts in the group Monday, climbing more than 3%. Part of the move is clearly due to a market rotation into defensive sectors, but we shouldn't ignore an insider buy disclosed by CEO Chris Boerner. On Thursday, Boerner purchased 2,000 shares at roughly $55 each, or about $110,000 worth of stock. The buy increases Boerner's shares in the drugmaker to 104,626. That kind of purchase is on the small side \u2014 something over $1 million would really get our attention \u2014 but it's still worth mentioning because insiders can sell for several reasons, but they really only buy for one reason : They think the stock is going higher. With its recent advance, Bristol Myers has erased some of its post-earnings losses , though it still remains more than 3% below its Feb. 5 close. Club stock ties: Shares of Alphabet are outperforming cloud computing counterparts Amazon and Microsoft after scoring a win from fellow Club name Salesforce . The two companies said Monday they expanded their strategic partnership , which includes running Salesforce's Agentforce, Data Cloud, and Customer 360 apps on Google Cloud infrastructure. Salesforce's fast-selling AI platform Agentforce will also gain access to Google's Gemini models. Google Cloud becomes the third outside deployment option for Salesforce customers. The enterprise software giant also uses Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, and its own proprietary data centers. Salesforce has committed to spend at least $2.5 billion over seven years on Google's cloud computing services, according to Bloomberg News. For reference, Alphabet's Google Cloud unit generated about $43 billion in revenue in 2024. Salesforce reports earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Up next: Club holding Coterra Energy reports after the closing bell on Monday. The two things to watch are the company's production guidance and capital expenditure budget for 2025. Both production and capex are expected to increase in 2025 due to a completed acquisition, but we still need to see a disciplined balance between the two. Management will hold its conference call at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday. Other companies reporting after the bell Monday include Diamondback Energy , Hims & Hers , Public Storage , Realty Income and Cleveland-Cliffs . Before the opening bell Tuesday, we'll hear from Home Depot . Over the past few weeks, we've seen several analysts lift their fourth-quarter same-store sales estimate but talk about 2025 being another soft year for the Club-owned retailer. Expectations should be on the lower side due to the stock's recent six-day losing streak. Other companies reporting Tuesday morning are Sempra , Keurig Dr Pepper , Kontoor Brands , American Tower and Planet Fitness . The market also will closely analyze each new data point regarding the economy due to the current concerns over slowing growth. One of the key reports Tuesday is the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which is due out at 10 a.m. ET. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

            "content": "It started with Pasteur: How Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) Help Driving Medical Innovation\n\n\n\nIn July 1885, a nine-year-old boy named Joseph Meister was taken by his desperate mother on the long way from Alsace to Paris. Seeing a scientist named Louis Pasteur, who had conducted research on rabies and other diseases, was their last hope. The boy had been bitten multiple times by a rabid dog \u2013 a certain death sentence at that time. A doctor by the name of Jacques Grancher convinced Pasteur to take the risk and attempt the impossible. Every day for ten days, Joseph received multiple doses of the vaccine. The rest, as they say, is history: He survived, paving the way for modern immunology that should save countless lives in the decades to come.\n\nThe success story of the rabies vaccine had not only a profound impact on public health, but also remains one of the most powerful examples for the importance of PPP in medical research. Louis Pasteur\u2019s research on rabies and other diseases was supported by both public and private funding \u2013 so was the establishment of the Pasteur Institute, which is still a leading center for medical research and vaccine development today.\n\nWhen collaboration becomes a NECESSITY\n\nFast forward 140 years, and public-private partnerships are still a force in advancing research and innovation in Europe and beyond. With partners like EFPIA, EuropaBio, and Vaccines Europe, the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) - formerly Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) - has been driving transformative impact across healthcare for more than 15 years, accelerating the development of breakthrough therapies for the benefit of the patients.\n\nOne of the more than 20 IHI and IMI projects BMS is involved in is NECESSITY *. The initiative focuses on Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease \u2013 a rare systemic autoimmune condition that can affect the entire body and has a massive impact on quality of life, manifesting itself not only with excessive dryness of eyes and mouth, but also fatigue, chronic pain, arthritis, neuropathies and even lymphomas.\n\nThe aim of NECESSITY, where Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) is involved in various work packages and the evidence task force, is to identify sensitive clinical endpoints that could be used in clinical trials to determine whether a new treatment works or not. Identifying biomarkers that could be used to identify specific subgroups of patients with different types of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s is also a goal of the project. As part of this PPP, an innovative clinical trial is currently underway in eight countries. and intended to validate both the newly defined endpoints and patient subgroups.\n\n\u201cOur ongoing close involvement with NECESSITY enables BMS to actively contribute to the development of novel treatments to address true medical needs for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease,\u201d says Nikolay Delev, Executive Medical Director and Immunology Clinical Development Team Lead at BMS. \u201cIn addition, we expect many of the methodologies, learnings and outcomes from NECESSITY to be useful for other autoimmune diseases as well. Experiencing the productive exchange between diverse stakeholders in this project has been truly encouraging. Collaboration is indeed a necessity if we want to advance breakthrough science!\u201d",

He has previously made controversial statements about weight-loss medications, raising concerns about future policy direction.\n\nDespite delivering strong quarterly earnings, BMY stock has struggled after issuing disappointing 2025 guidance. JPMorgan sees the dip as driven more by legacy product declines and currency headwinds than fundamental weaknesses.\n\nThe firm believes BMY has potential upside from accelerated adoption of Cobenfy (its schizophrenia treatment), new data on Alzheimer's and schizophrenia drugs, and a $2 billion cost-cutting initiative.\n\nRetail traders, however, have turned 'bearish' on BMY ahead of Friday's session, compared with 'neutral' a month ago, with Stocktwits message volume rising 14%.\n\nBMY sentiment and message volume Feb 20 | source: Stocktwits\n\nThe stock is down 2% year-to-date and trades about 10% below analysts' average price target of $61.34.\n\nJPMorgan sees Gilead as well-positioned due to its strong HIV drug portfolio and disciplined expense management.\n\nHowever, the company expects an adverse revenue impact of $1.1 billion in 2025 due to Medicare's prescription drug plan changes, which could impact its HIV business.\n\nOn Stocktwits, retail sentiment for GILD flipped from 'neutral' a month ago to 'bullish,' with message volume surging 75% ahead of Friday's session.\n\nGILD sentiment and message volume Feb 20 | source: Stocktwits\n\nThe stock has risen over 18% in 2025 and is trading at about 3% above analysts' average price target of $107.03.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan categorized Regeneron (REGN) and Merck (MRK) as \"out of favor\" names, suggesting investors are focusing on stronger core assets and upcoming launches rather than uncertainty.\n\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\n\nLatest Videos",

            "content": "Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ: BLUE) said its planned acquisition by two investment firms is, according to its board, \u201cin the best interest of stockholders\u201d\u2014but enough of them felt otherwise on Friday to have sent the company\u2019s shares plummeting 42%.\n\nThe beleaguered gene therapy developer said Friday it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by funds managed by Carlyle (NASDAQ: CG) and privately-held SK Capital Partners, partnering with a team of veteran biotech executives led by a familiar name with a long resume: David Meek is set to become CEO of the newly-private Bluebird nearly two years after he left Mirati Therapeutics, where he spent two years as CEO before the company\u2019s up-to-$5.8 billion acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS; NYSE: BMY), a deal completed in January 2024.\n\nThe investment firms are promising to give Bluebird primary capital to scale up commercial delivery of its three gene therapies, each designed to treat sickle cell disease, \u03b2-thalassemia, and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD).\n\nBluebird agreed to sell itself to Carlyle and SK Capital for up to $9.84 a share consisting of $3 a share, plus a contingent value right (CVR) per share of $6.84 cash if Bluebird\u2019s current portfolio of three FDA-approved gene therapies attains more than $600 million in total sales in any 12-month period before December 2027.\n\nAll that adds up to a deal valued at just over $29 million\u2014less than half (43%) of Bluebird\u2019s roughly $68 million market capitalization (the product of the share price and the number of outstanding shares) before the buyout was announced.\n\n\u201cGiven that [B]luebird was reaching the end of its cash runway, unlikely to achieve near-term profitability from its ongoing commercial launches, and at risk of defaulting on its loan covenants, the transition away from the public markets was likely inevitable,\u201d Sami Corwin, PhD, an analyst with William Blair, wrote Friday in a research note. \u201cHowever, the upfront acquisition price is a 57% discount to the stock\u2019s closing price on the day prior ($7.04), which has led to the stock trading down 40% during market hours.\u201d\n\nCorwin and William Blair have modeled total net sales of $282.9 million for 2025, $409.4 million for 2026, and $546.4 million for 2027.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we believe that the probability of achieving the CVR contingency is low,\u201d Corwin added.\n\nLow patient uptake\n\nLike other developers of recently approved gene therapies, Bluebird has been slow to generate demand for its products. That reflects challenges in securing reimbursement from payers stemming from the therapies\u2019 high list prices (Bluebird, like other gene therapy developers, assists patients seeking its treatments).\n\nAs of the third quarter, Bluebird said that it had achieved only 57 patient starts of treatment for its three marketed gene therapies:\n\n35 starts for Zynteglo\u2122 (betibeglogene autotemcel or beti-cel)\u2014 Indicated to treat adults and children with \u03b2-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions ($2.8 million list price)\n\nIndicated to treat adults and children with \u03b2-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions ($2.8 million list price) 17 starts for Lyfgenia\u2122 (lovotibeglogene autotemcel or lovo-cel)\u2014 Indicated to treat patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events ($3.1 million list price)\n\nIndicated to treat patients 12 years of age or older with sickle cell disease and a history of vaso-occlusive events ($3.1 million list price) Five starts for Skysona\u2122 (elivaldogene autotemcel or eli-cel)\u2014Indicated to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in boys 4\u201317 years old with early, active CALD ($3 million list price)\n\nBluebird is not alone in facing slow patient uptake.\n\nOn Friday, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) said it would halt further development and commercialization activity for Beqvez\u2122 (fidanacogene elaparvovec-dzkt), less than a year after winning FDA approval for the hemophilia B gene therapy, citing lower than anticipated demand from patients and their physicians. Since the FDA authorized the gene therapy last April, no patients were reported to have received Beqvez, which carried a list price of $3.5 million\u2014the same as the hemophilia B gene therapy Hemgenix\u00ae (etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb), co-developed by CSL (ASX: CSL) and uniQure (NASDAQ: QURE).\n\nThe Pfizer decision reflects a continued retreat from gene therapy for the pharma giant. Last month, Pfizer rang in 2025 by terminating its global collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SGMO) to co-develop giroctocogene fitelparvovec, a gene therapy candidate to treat adults with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A\u2014despite the drug generating positive results last year in the Phase III AFFINE trial (NCT04370054).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) during Q3 recorded its first product revenue from the first commercial patient infused with Casgevy\u00ae (exagamglogene autotemcel), the CRISPR-edited therapy it co-developed with CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP). Vertex reported $2 million in Casgevy revenue, which Vertex included within its $2.772 billion in product revenue for the quarter.\n\nCasgevy, which carries a $2.2 million list price, won FDA approval in December 2023 to treat sickle cell disease, and a month later received agency authorization to treat transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in patients 12 years and older. As of mid-October, 45 of the planned 75 authorized treatment centers (ATCs) have been activated in all regions of the world where Casgevy has been approved\u2014the United States, the European Union, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Canada, and Switzerland.\n\nLow buyout price\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Eric Joseph and three colleagues also noted that the buyout price was low enough to have sparked the investor selloff, with the firm having previously projected Bluebird wouldn\u2019t attain more than $600 million in sales until 2029.\n\n\u201cWith BLUE closing yesterday at $7.04, we anticipate shares to react negatively on this announcement, with the Street heavily discounting receipt of the CVR,\u201d Joseph and colleagues wrote Friday in a research note. Joseph maintained the firm\u2019s \u201cUnderweight\u201d rating on Bluebird shares.\n\nThe J.P. Morgan analysts also highlighted one positive aspect of the Bluebird buyout. As part of the deal, the company was allowed to amend its loan agreement with Hercules Capital to maintain adequate operating capital\u2014a bit of good news for Bluebird, which in November reported having cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately $118.7 million, (of which about $48 million was restricted cash) as of September 30, 2024\u2014enough to fund operations only into the first quarter of this year.\n\nBluebird secured a $175 million loan from Hercules in March 2024, then drew the first $75 million, agreeing to hold off accessing the remaining $100 million pending achievement of commercial milestones.\n\nInvestors, however, were in a less forgiving mood, sending Bluebird shares nosediving 43% to $4.004 a share at the start of premarket trading at 8 a.m. ET Friday. The stock rebounded 41% to $5.65 at the opening bell before tumbling 29% to the $4 low at 10:07 a.m. ET. Bluebird shares closed Friday at $4.08.\n\n\u201cWorth noting that Bluebird is selling itself for a fraction of the $80M former CEO Nick Leschly made from selling Bluebird stock,\u201d CNBC pharma reporter Angelica Peebles wrote Friday on X.\n\nLeschly served as Bluebird\u2019s CEO or \u201cchief Bluebird\u201d from 2010, when the company changed its name from Genetix Pharmaceuticals, to 2021, when he oversaw Bluebird\u2019s 2021 spin-out of its oncology business into 2Seventy bio, a company that Leschly initially helmed as CEO, and still oversees as chairman.\n\nThe spin-out left Bluebird with Zynteglo, Lyfgenia, and Skysona\u2014all autologous hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapies for severe genetic diseases that won FDA approval under Leschly\u2019s successor Andrew Obenshain.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re split, we have an ability just to focus on our mission, which is getting these three products to our patients,\u201d Obenshain told GEN Edge in 2021. \u201cWhat we have now is zero distractions. We have a laser focus on launching our three transformational products. We\u2019ve allocated all of our capital and management attention to our most important priorities, and those most important priorities are in severe genetic disease.\u201d\n\nFinancial woes, job cuts\n\nBut for all of Obenshain\u2019s success in leading Bluebird to bring the three gene therapies to market, Obenshain could not reverse Bluebird\u2019s financial woes despite several moves that included restructurings with job cuts: In 2022, Bluebird eliminated about 30% of its staff (an estimated 155 jobs), aiming to generate $160 million in savings over the following two years. Last September, Bluebird chopped 25% of its workforce\u201494 employees\u2014in a restructuring designed to cut its cash operating expenses by 20% and enable it to break even on cash flow in the second half of 2025. In December, Bluebird carried out a 1-for-20 reverse stock split to avoid being delisted from NASDAQ.\n\nBluebird finished the third quarter of last year with $60.808 million net loss, somewhat improved from the $87.232 million net loss of Q3 2023. The company saw its total revenue fall 14% year over year during Q3 of this year, from $12.392 million to $10.612 million, a decline Bluebird blamed on quarter-to-quarter variability in drug product infusions. However, total revenues more than doubled during Q1\u2013Q3 2024 compared with January\u2013September 2023, from $21.663 million to $45.286 million.\n\nTwo of Bluebird\u2019s three marketed gene therapies saw year-over-year product revenue gains. Zynteglo rose 13% from $4.851 million to $5.493 million in Q3 and nearly quadrupled, zooming 290% from $9.031 million to $35.212 million in January\u2013September 2024. Lyfgenia racked up $2.632 million during the third quarter, its first quarter of generating sales.\n\nHowever, Skysona product revenue fell two-thirds (66.5%) to $2.487 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $7.43 million in the year-ago quarter. During Q1\u2013Q3 2024, product revenue tumbled 40% to $7.43 million from $12.383 million a year earlier.\n\n\u201cAs our financial challenges mounted, it became clear that securing the right strategic partner was critical to maximizing value for our stockholders and ensuring the long-term future of our therapies. After an extensive review process, this acquisition represents the best path forward\u2014maximizing value for stockholders and bringing significant capital, commercial expertise, and a commitment to provide more patients the opportunity to benefit from potentially transformative gene therapies.\u201d\n\nPeebles\u2019 post on X offered one of two additional likely reasons for the investor wrath Bluebird incurred. The other is a sense of opportunities lost by the company.\n\n\u201cBitter end\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember how loved this company [Bluebird] was back in the CAR-T days when I watched my Kite and Juno get bought out. I suspect they would have been acquired long ago but said no. Now they sell themselves for -99% of what they were back then,\u201d @Biotech2k, a \u201cBiotech investor for over two decades,\u201d lamented on X. \u201cWhat a bitter end to a long disastrous company.\u201d\n\nKite Therapeutics was acquired by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) for $11.9 billion in a deal completed in October 2017. Three months later, Juno Therapeutics found a buyer in Celgene, which shelled out $9 billion for the company in a deal that closed in March 2018. A year later, Celgene itself was acquired for $74 billion by BMS, a deal completed in November 2019.\n\nIn a career stretching nearly four decades Meek, Bluebird\u2019s incoming CEO, held executive positions at Janssen Pharmaceutical Cos. of Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Endocyte, and Baxalta before serving as CEO of Ipsen, FerGene\u2014and Mirati, where he oversaw the U.S. launch of KRAS inhibitor Krazati\u00ae (adagrasib). Shortly before BMS acquired Mirati, he left the company by mutual agreement with its board after the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended rejection of Krazati, contending that its data was weaker than that of Amgen\u2019s Lumykras (sotorasib).\n\nMeek was elected chairman of rare disease drug developer Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi) in December.\n\nIn Bluebird\u2019s statement announcing the buyout, Meek said the planned investment by Carlyle and SK Capital will bring to the company the capital and commercial capabilities it needs to bring Bluebird\u2019s gene therapies to more patients, more quickly\u2014and make some positive history for the gene therapy pioneer.\n\n\u201c[B]luebird is built on an extraordinary legacy of scientific breakthroughs, and we are committed to unlocking its full potential for patients,\u201d Meek stated.\n\nLeaders and laggards",

Whether you're looking for a way to raise the stream of passive income your portfolio produces or you simply want to outperform benchmark averages, adding some dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio is a smart way forward.\n\nCompanies that commit to returning a portion of their earnings to shareholders behave differently than companies that don't have a dividend program. The differences aren't minor ones either. During the 50 years between 1973 and 2023, the dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 index produced a 9.17% average annual return, according to research from Hartford Funds. Non-dividend-paying stocks in the same index produced a paltry 4.27% average annual return over the same time frame.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAs I right this, Realty Income (NYSE: O), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Altria Group (NYSE: MO) offer an average dividend yield of 6.8%. These aren't the fastest-growing payouts you've ever seen but there's a good chance that all three businesses can continue raising distributions for at least another decade.\n\nRealty Income\n\nRealty Income is a net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that has been increasing its portfolio of commercial real estate since listing on the stock market in 1994. It's raised its monthly dividend payout every quarter of its publicly traded existence and, at recent prices, it offers a huge 5.8% dividend yield.\n\nRealty Income stock has been under pressure because, over the past five years, its dividend payout has increased by just 2.5% annually; earnings growth has been held back because interest rates shot higher in 2022 and 2023.\n\nRealty Income's dividend payout growth has been muted in recent years, but it could pick up the pace in the years ahead. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates four times in 2024 and further rate cuts are widely expected before the end of 2025.\n\nIn addition to potentially lower interest rates in the U.S., Realty Income has an attractive avenue for growth in Europe.\n\nPfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer have tumbled about 57% from a peak they set in 2021. The stock has been under pressure due to sales of COVID-19 products that declined sharply in recent years. Investors are also concerned about an upcoming patent cliff for Eliquis, a blood thinner Pfizer markets in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nAt its beaten-down price, Pfizer offers a huge 6.7% dividend yield. Earlier this year, Pfizer raised its dividend payout for the 16th consecutive year and further gains seem likely. The company reported total sales that rose by 7% last year. If we exclude declining sales of COVID-19 products, total revenue surged 12% year over year.\n\nThe first generic versions of Eliquis likely won't become available in the U.S. market until 2031. In the meantime, a slew of recently launched cancer treatments could more than offset upcoming Eliquis losses. For example, Pfizer announced this month that the Talapro-2 study proved that adding Talzenna to Xtandi improved prostate cancer patients' chance for long-term survival by 20% compared to Xtandi on its own.\n\nIn 2025, Pfizer expects adjusted earnings to come in between $2.80 and $3.00 per share. That's a lot more than it needs to meet a dividend commitment currently set at $1.72 per share. With a high yield upfront and growth drivers to push its needle forward, adding this stock to a diverse portfolio now and holding over the long run looks like a smart move.\n\nAltria Group\n\nCigarette smoking has been in decline for decades, but that hasn't stopped Altria Group from raising its dividend payout. Last August, the company that markets the Marlboro brand in the U.S. announced its 59th dividend increase in 55 years. At recent prices, the stock offers a juicy 7.7% yield and a pretty good chance for continued payout growth in the years ahead.\n\nTotal cigarettes sold in 2024 declined by 10.2%, but the powerful Marlboro brand allowed for rising prices that offset declining volume. Net of excise taxes, smokable product sales fell by just 0.8% year over year in 2024.\n\nWhile smokable product sales are declining slowly, sales of non-smokable products are driving growth for Altria Group. The company acquired the NJOY brand in 2023 and it's still one of just three e-cigarette brands authorized for sale in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nFourth-quarter NJOY consumables shipped grew 15.3% year over year. Thanks to price hikes on tobacco products and soaring NJOY sales, adjusted earnings grew 3.4% last year.\n\nManagement expects to repeat its well-understood playbook and raise adjusted earnings by 2% to 5% in 2025.

The associated price target was raised to $62.00.\n\nMohit Bansal\u2019s rating is based on a combination of factors related to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s current and future prospects. The company has achieved significant progress in launching Cobenfy, particularly in securing broad access across Medicaid and Medicare, with promising early efficacy and tolerability results. However, the need to manage placebo responses in Alzheimer\u2019s trials and the challenge of thrice-daily dosing highlight some uncertainties in their pipeline activities.\n\nAdditionally, while cost-cutting measures are expected to save $2 billion, allowing for sustainable growth, there are pressures from increased competition in the generic market, especially for drugs like Revlimid. The anticipated market dynamics and potential volatility due to decreased Medicare access and an influx of generics suggest both opportunities and risks. Therefore, these mixed factors contribute to the Hold rating, reflecting both cautious optimism and the need for careful observation of the company\u2019s performance and strategic execution.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Bernstein also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $62.00 price target.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 32 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is positive on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders buying their shares of BMY in relation to earlier this year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group.

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced the final analysis of overall survival (OS) from the Phase 3 CheckMate -816 study, which evaluated Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for adult patients with resectable (tumors \u2265 4 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS, a key secondary endpoint, compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The results build on the previously reported primary endpoints of event-free survival (EFS) and pathological complete response (pCR), which also met statistical significance.\n\nThe safety profile of Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy was consistent with previously reported studies, with no new safety signals observed.\n\n\u201cThe final analysis of overall survival in the CheckMate -816 study underscores the potential of Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy to provide a meaningful survival benefit for patients with resectable NSCLC,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, global program lead, late development, oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThis is the first and only Phase 3 study of a neoadjuvant-only immuno-oncology therapy to show a statistically significant benefit in patients with resectable NSCLC. Opdivo-based therapies have shown improved efficacy in the neoadjuvant and perioperative treatment of patients with resectable NSCLC.\u201d\n\nThe company will conduct an analysis of the updated data and plans to provide a comprehensive update on the data in a future peer reviewed setting.\n\nAbout CheckMate -816\n\nCheckMate -816 is a Phase 3 randomized, open label, multi-center trial evaluating Opdivo with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (per the 7th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging criteria), regardless of PD-L1 expression. For the primary analysis, 358 patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo 360 mg plus histology-based platinum doublet chemotherapy every three weeks for three cycles, or platinum doublet chemotherapy every three weeks for three cycles, followed by surgery. The primary endpoints of the trial are event-free survival and pathologic complete response. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, major pathologic response, and time to death or distant metastases.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo \u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nINDICATIONS\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated as neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, followed by single-agent OPDIVO\u00ae as adjuvant treatment after surgery.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (\u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab) and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%).\n\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).\n\nOPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 8% (35/456), including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (4.2%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.5%), and Grade 2 (4.1%).

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nIn addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.\n\nSome ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\n\nInfusion-Related Reactions\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30- minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.\n\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\n\nIn randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.\n\nLactation\n\nThere are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.\n\nSerious Adverse Reactions\n\nIn Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268).

            "content": "STOCKHOLM , Feb. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BioArctic AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) today announced that BioArctic and its partner Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) have received clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for BioArctic to out-license its PyroGlutamate-amyloid-beta (PyroGlu-A\u03b2) antibody program to Bristol Myers Squibb. Closing of the agreement has been completed and BioArctic will receive an upfront payment of USD 100 million .\n\nOn December 19, 2024, BioArctic announced that BioArctic had entered into a global license agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb under which Bristol Myers Squibb will become solely responsible for the development and any subsequent commercialization of BAN1503 and BAN2803 and related products worldwide. The agreement was subject to filing and clearance under U.S. Antitrust legislation (the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976), a condition which has been fulfilled, and the transaction has now closed. The finalization of the agreement triggers an upfront payment of USD 100 million to BioArctic. The license agreement further includes up to USD 1.25 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered low double-digit royalties on global product sales. BioArctic will retain an option to co-commercialize the products in the Nordic region.\n\nBioArctic's PyroGlu-A\u03b2 antibody program consists of novel antibodies targeting a specific truncated, pyroglutamate modified form of amyloid-beta. Monomers of PyroGlu-A\u03b2 are highly prone to aggregate, leading to the formation of harmful aggregates which cause debilitating cognitive and other symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. The agreement includes both the BAN1503 and BAN2803 antibodies. BAN2803 includes BioArctic's BrainTransporter\u2122 technology.\n\n\"I am very pleased that we have received clearance, allowing us to proceed with this agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb,\" said Gunilla Osswald, CEO at BioArctic. \"They share our passion for helping patients with Alzheimer's disease and we now have the possibility to explore the BrainTransporter technology's potential to advance and optimize the development of next-generation treatments for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nThe agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb is the first license agreement with the BrainTransporter technology. It specifically concerns PyroGlu-A\u03b2 antibody treatments. BioArctic has retained all other rights for use of the BrainTransporter platform. The BrainTransporter technology could be used in a number of different therapy areas for delivery of biologic molecules to the brain, giving BioArctic many potential future partnering opportunities.\n\nThis release discusses investigational uses of an agent in development and is not intended to convey conclusions about efficacy or safety. There is no guarantee that such investigational agents will successfully complete clinical development or gain health authority approval.\n\nThis information is information that BioArctic AB (publ) is obliged to disclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Plaque psoriasis occurs in up to 90% of psoriasis patients and is characterised by distinct round or oval plaques that are usually covered by silvery-white scales.\n\nDespite the availability of effective systemic therapies, BMS has reported that many patients with moderate-to-severe cases of plaque psoriasis are undertreated, untreated or dissatisfied with current treatment options.\n\nThe company\u2019s Sotyktu is designed to block the action of an enzyme that plays a role in triggering the production of substances known as cytokines, which are involved in the inflammation and other processes that cause psoriasis.\n\nThe drug is already approved in major markets to treat certain patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis after being shown to improve skin clearance, symptom burden and quality of life.\n\nCommenting on the latest results for the therapy, Edgar Charles, vice president and senior global programme lead, early and late development immunology at BMS, said: \u201cThese positive five-year results build upon the established profile of Sotyktu, a first-in-class TYK2 inhibitor, as a transformative oral treatment for psoriasis.\u201d",

Opdivo-Qvantig demonstrated a non-inferior objective response rate compared to the intravenous formulation. The safety profile of the subcutaneous formulation was similar to the intravenous formulation. However, about 8.1% of patients experienced a transient, local injection-site reaction.\n\nPhysician\u2019s Perspective\n\nNivolumab has proven effective in improving overall survival across a range of advanced cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, relapsed or recurrent Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, metastatic urothelial carcinoma, and others. Currently, it is delivered via intravenous infusion, a process that takes 30\u201360 minutes and typically requires patients to visit specialized infusion centers. Developing formulations that can be more conveniently administered could eliminate the need for frequent travel to these centers, making nivolumab more accessible to patients who face socioeconomic or geographic barriers to care.\n\nMolecular Target of Therapy\n\nNivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptors on T cells and blocks PD-1\u2019s interaction with PD-1 ligands. Interaction between PD-1 and its ligand usually suppresses the immune response to tumors. Therefore, by inhibiting this interaction nivolumab enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to recognize and attack tumor cells. Opdivo-Qvantig co-formulates nivolumab with recombinant human hyaluronidase, an enzyme that facilitates subcutaneous absorption of nivolumab.\n\nCompany History\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is an American pharmaceutical company with products in a wide range of therapeutic areas including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. The initial FDA approval for intravenous formulation of Opdivo was granted to Bristol Myers Squibb in 2014.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(24)03996-6/fulltext\n\n\u00a92025 2 Minute Medicine, Inc.

            "content": "How have previous geographic roles helped you prepare for your new role in Ireland?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m approaching my 24th anniversary with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). The majority of my career has been based in the UK, but I\u2019ve also worked in various global markets and roles.\n\nI was thrilled when I had the opportunity to work in the US. The scale of operations in the US, coupled with the diverse healthcare system, presented a unique dynamic. The pace of innovation in the US, both in technology and data availability, was remarkable. The emphasis on faster patient access and partnerships with renowned institutions was also incredible. This broader perspective will be invaluable as I now take on a role in Ireland.\n\nAs General Manager, I\u2019m focused on developing a robust strategy, leveraging the skilled and passionate team here, and ensuring Ireland continues to grow as a critical hub for BMS. My US experience has underscored the importance of developing achievable plans - whilst still aiming high - and fostering external collaboration to help enhance medicine access in Ireland. Key for me will be taking a people-first approach; ensuring the right skills are in the right positions and creating a supportive culture. Leading with a clear vision, focusing on projects that will have the greatest impact, and embracing opportunities to innovate and grow, are equally essential.\n\nWhat will be your focus in Ireland?\n\n\n\nMy time in the US gave me a closer view of BMS' enterprise-wide operations, which I\u2019m keen to integrate into our work in Ireland. Leveraging the connections and insights gained in New Jersey, I aim to unlock new opportunities while emphasizing the vital role our Irish team plays. Ultimately, my focus will remain consistent: helping to ensure Irish patients gain timely access to the medicines they need. This is a deeply personal mission for me and drives my commitment to excellence in our work.\n\nHow important is Ireland to BMS?\n\n\n\nIreland has a stellar reputation as a global biopharma hub, backed by world-class facilities, a robust regulatory environment, and strong industry-academia collaboration. These factors create a solid foundation for innovation. At BMS, our vision is to make medicines more accessible to patients worldwide, and Ireland plays a pivotal role in that mission.\n\nOur operations in Ireland include a biologics facility in Cruiserath, Dublin and external manufacturing divisions in Blanchardstown, Dublin and Shannon, County Clare. These sites exemplify our commitment to innovation and patient care. Last year, we announced a $400 million investment in a sterile drug product facility at our Cruiserath campus, slated to launch in 2026. This will not only enhance our manufacturing capabilities, but will also create around 350 jobs, reinforcing Ireland\u2019s standing as a biopharma leader.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your spare time?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m very sociable and love spending time with family and friends. Since returning to Ireland, it\u2019s been wonderful to reconnect and be present with loved ones. I enjoy the theatre, exploring cuisines, and planning European trips. Italy is high on my list, but I\u2019m also eager to explore more of Ireland. Rediscovering the evolving beauty of my home country feels like a meaningful way to connect with my roots and appreciate the country more. Dublin\u2019s vibrant restaurant scene is especially exciting. Staying active is also important, though I\u2019ve yet to reestablish my gym routine after months of travel. I\u2019m also considering taking up golf, which will hopefully provide a new outlet for relaxation.\n\nHow do these interests complement your professional work?\n\n\n\nThey provide balance and perspective. Whether travelling, exploring new cuisines, or engaging in physical activities, these interests help me recharge and maintain mental clarity. This balance is crucial for bringing my best self to work and is actively encouraged by BMS, which empowers all colleagues to show up as their best authentic selves. The company\u2019s commitment to valuing and nurturing the whole person, not just the professional, is a key reason I\u2019ve been with BMS for so long. Additionally, my curiosity about other markets often informs my professional insights, allowing me to draw parallels and identify opportunities.\n\nWhat do these opportunities look like for the future of medicine access in Ireland and beyond?\n\n\n\nBMS\u2019 vision is to transform lives through science, ensuring our innovations reach patients in need. However, medicine uptake in Ireland can often take up to two years post-approval, presenting opportunities for improvement. My goal is to work collaboratively with the government, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to reduce this gap. The government\u2019s recent pledge to introduce a National Life Sciences Strategy is encouraging, aiming to streamline medicine approval processes and, through increased investment in the sector, expand access to clinical trials and novel treatments for Irish patients \u2013 key priorities for me.\n\nDelivering on this vision requires collaboration and focus. For me, it\u2019s about advocating for equitable healthcare policies and leveraging our pipeline to meet patient needs. Success relies on three pillars: driving performance, preparing for future innovations, and empowering our people. Together, these efforts must converge on the shared goal of faster and broader patient access to transformational medicines.\n\nWhat lessons can the EU adopt from the US to improve medicine access?\n\n\n\nThe US often outpaces the EU in medicine approval times and patient access \u2013 an area where Europe could see improvement. Streamlining regulatory processes and fostering collaboration among stakeholders could shorten access timelines. This is a focus for me. I want to advocate for policies promoting health equity and ensuring underserved patients receive timely care. Faster access to medicines remains a key area where Europe can draw inspiration from the US model.",

            "content": "Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger has maintained their bullish stance on BMY stock, giving a Buy rating on February 7.\n\nDavid Risinger has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors influencing Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s future prospects. Despite the recent setback with Opdualag\u2019s Phase 3 trial for adjuvant melanoma treatment not meeting its primary endpoint, the overall outlook for the company remains promising. The adjuvant market represents a substantial opportunity, and although the trial results were not favorable, Bristol-Myers\u2019 pipeline is robust with multiple potential catalysts anticipated between 2025 and 2027.\n\nRisinger acknowledges that while the failure in the adjuvant setting may pose challenges, it does not significantly alter the bullish perspective on BMY shares. The expected peak sales of Opdualag are adjusted below consensus due to competitive pressures, yet the firm\u2019s diverse pipeline could drive growth and provide significant opportunities for the company\u2019s stock. Thus, the Buy rating is maintained based on the potential for future successes within the company\u2019s extensive research and development endeavors.\n\nBMY\u2019s price has also changed moderately for the past six months \u2013 from $49.060 to $55.970, which is a 14.08% increase.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.",

The safety profile of Sotyktu remained consistent through five years with more than 5,000 patient-years of exposure in the trial, with no new safety signals identified. In patients who were treated continuously with Sotyktu, clinical response rates were maintained from Year 1 to Year 5, including Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and static Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 (clear/almost clear).\n\nThese data were presented at the Winter Clinical Dermatology Conference \u2013 Hawaii (WCH) in Big Island, Waikoloa Village, HI taking place February 14-19, 2025.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s findings demonstrate the continued long-term safety and efficacy profile of Sotyktu, with patients maintaining skin clearance over five years,\u201d said Mark Lebwohl, MD, dean of Clinical Therapeutics at the Kimberly and Eric J. Waldman Department of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an investigator and paid consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThese results further support the role of Sotyktu, the first TYK2 inhibitor available for patients living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, as a potential oral standard of care.\u201d\n\nClinical efficacy outcomes were sustained in patients who were continuously treated with Sotyktu for PASI 75 (72.1%, Year 1; 67.3%, Year 5), PASI 90 (45.9%, Year 1; 46.3%, Year 5) and sPGA 0/1 (57.5%, Year 1; 52.6%, Year 5).\n\nThe efficacy analysis included 513 patients who received continuous Sotyktu treatment from Day 1 in the pivotal POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 trials and transitioned to the POETYK PSO-LTE trial, while the safety analysis included 1,519 patients who received at least one dose of Sotyktu during the trials. The patients in this five-year analysis completed 256 weeks of treatment. Efficacy was analyzed using the modified nonresponder imputation (mNRI) method.\n\n\u201cThese positive five-year results build upon the established profile of Sotyktu, a first-in-class TYK2 inhibitor, as a transformative oral treatment for psoriasis,\u201d said Edgar Charles, MD, vice president and senior global program lead, Early & Late Development Immunology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cAs the leader in TYK2 innovation, we continue our relentless pursuit of bold science to elevate new standards of care for the patients we serve.\u201d\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the POETYK PSO clinical trial program.\n\nAbout the POETYK PSO Clinical Trial Program\n\nPrOgram to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sotyktu (deucravacitinib), a selective TYK2 inhibitor (POETYK) PSO-1 (NCT03624127) and POETYK PSO-2 (NCT03611751) were global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of Sotyktu compared to placebo and Otezla\u00ae (apremilast), and the safety of Sotyktu, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Both POETYK PSO-1, which enrolled 666 patients, and POETYK PSO-2, which enrolled 1,020 patients, were multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated Sotyktu (6 mg once daily) compared to placebo and Otezla (30 mg twice daily). POETYK PSO-2 included a randomized withdrawal and retreatment period after Week 24.\n\nThe co-primary endpoints of both POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 were the percentage of patients who achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response and those who achieved static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear/almost clear) at Week 16 versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints of the trials included the percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 compared to Otezla at Week 16 and other measures evaluating Sotyktu versus placebo and Otezla.\n\nAcross both clinical trials and timepoints, significantly more Sotyktu-treated patients achieved a sPGA score of 0/1, PASI 75 response and PASI 90 response. Responses persisted through Week 52, as 82% (187/228) of patients who achieved PASI 75 with Sotyktu at Week 24 maintained their response at Week 52 in POETYK PSO-1. In POETYK PSO-2, 80% (119/148) of patients who continued Sotyktu maintained PASI 75 response compared to 31% (47/150) of patients who were withdrawn from Sotyktu.\n\nFollowing the 52-week POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 trials, patients could enroll in the ongoing POETYK PSO long-term extension (LTE) trial (NCT04036435) and receive open-label Sotyktu 6 mg once-daily. In the LTE trial, 1,221 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of Sotyktu. Efficacy was analyzed utilizing treatment failure rules (TFR) method of imputation, along with sensitivity analyses using modified non-responder imputation and as-observed analysis, which have been used in similar analyses with other agents.\n\nIn addition to POETYK PSO-1, POETYK PSO-2 and POETYK PSO-LTE, Bristol Myers Squibb has evaluated Sotyktu in two other Phase 3 studies in psoriasis: POETYK PSO-3 (NCT04167462) and POETYK PSO-4 (NCT03924427).\n\nAbout Psoriasis\n\nPsoriasis is a widely prevalent, chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease that substantially impairs patients\u2019 physical health, quality of life and work productivity. Psoriasis is a serious global problem, with at least 100 million people worldwide impacted by some form of the disease, including around 14 million people in Europe and approximately 7.5 million people in the United States. Nearly one-quarter of people with psoriasis have cases that are considered moderate-to-severe. Up to 90 percent of patients with psoriasis have psoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by distinct round or oval plaques typically covered by silvery-white scales. Despite the availability of effective systemic therapy, many patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis remain undertreated or even untreated and are dissatisfied with current treatments. People with psoriasis report an impact on their emotional well-being, straining both personal and professional relationships and causing a reduced quality of life. Psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities that may impact patients\u2019 well-being, including psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and depression.\n\nAbout Sotyktu (deucravacitinib)\n\nSotyktu (deucravacitinib) is an oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action, representing a new class of small molecules. It is the first selective TYK2 inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Bristol Myers Squibb scientists designed Sotyktu to selectively target TYK2, thereby inhibiting signaling of interleukin (IL)-23, IL-12 and Type 1 interferons (IFN), key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated diseases. Sotyktu achieves a high degree of selectivity by binding to the regulatory domain of TYK2, resulting in allosteric inhibition of TYK2 and its downstream functions. Sotyktu selectively inhibits TYK2 at physiologically relevant concentrations. At therapeutic doses, Sotyktu does not inhibit JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3.\n\nSotyktu is approved in numerous countries around the world for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Pursuing Bold Science in Immunology to Transform Patients\u2019 Lives\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u2013 transforming patients\u2019 lives through science. For people living with immune-mediated diseases, the debilitating reality of enduring chronic symptoms and disease progression can make simple tasks and daily life a challenge. Driven by our deep understanding of the immune system that spans over 20 years of experience, we continue to pursue bold science as we work to deliver life-changing medicines that elevate new standards of care across rheumatology, dermatology and pulmonology. Our sequential immunotherapy research framework aims to address the root cause of disease by controlling inflammation, resetting the immune system and promoting immune homeostasis with the goal of achieving transformational efficacy. By continuously pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, we strive to bring forward tailored approaches, treatments and combinations that may lead to durable remissions, improved quality of life and functional cures. Our collaborations with patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and researchers inform our patient-centric approach as we aim to break efficacy ceilings and deliver what matters most \u2013 the promise of living a better life.\n\nSOTYKTU U.S. INDICATION\n\nSOTYKTU\u00ae (deucravacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\n\nLimitations of Use:\n\nSOTYKTU is not recommended for use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\nSOTYKTU is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to deucravacitinib or to any of the excipients in SOTYKTU.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nHypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema have been reported. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue SOTYKTU.\n\nInfections: SOTYKTU may increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been reported in patients with psoriasis who received SOTYKTU. The most common serious infections reported with SOTYKTU included pneumonia and COVID-19. Avoid use of SOTYKTU in patients with an active or serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating SOTYKTU in patients:\n\nwith chronic or recurrent infection\n\nwho have been exposed to tuberculosis\n\nwith a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection\n\nwith underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.\n\nClosely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing, have appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiated and be closely monitored. Interrupt SOTYKTU if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not resume SOTYKTU until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.\n\nViral Reactivation\n\nHerpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex) was reported in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Through Week 16, herpes simplex infections were reported in 17 patients (6.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 1 patient (0.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Multidermatomal herpes zoster was reported in an immunocompetent patient. During PSO-1, PSO-2, and the open-label extension trial, the majority of patients who reported events of herpes zoster while receiving SOTYKTU were under 50 years of age. The impact of SOTYKTU on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Consider viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with SOTYKTU. If signs of reactivation occur, consult a hepatitis specialist. SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n\nTuberculosis (TB): In clinical trials, of 4 patients with latent TB who were treated with SOTYKTU and received appropriate TB prophylaxis, no patients developed active TB (during the mean follow-up of 34 weeks). One patient, who did not have latent TB, developed active TB after receiving 54 weeks of SOTYKTU. Evaluate patients for latent and active TB infection prior to initiating treatment with SOTYKTU. Do not administer SOTYKTU to patients with active TB. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering SOTYKTU. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of SOTYKTU in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during treatment.\n\nMalignancy including Lymphomas: Malignancies, including lymphomas, were observed in clinical trials with SOTYKTU. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with SOTYKTU, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer) and patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment with SOTYKTU.\n\nRhabdomyolysis and Elevated CPK: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with an increased incidence of asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis compared to placebo.\n\nDiscontinue SOTYKTU if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.\n\nLaboratory Abnormalities: Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with increases in triglyceride levels. Periodically evaluate serum triglycerides according to clinical guidelines during treatment. SOTYKTU treatment was associated with an increase in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter in patients with known or suspected liver disease according to routine management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt SOTYKTU until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded.\n\nImmunizations: Prior to initiating therapy with SOTYKTU, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccination. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with SOTYKTU. The response to live or non-live vaccines has not been evaluated.\n\nPotential Risks Related to JAK Inhibition: It is not known whether tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, overall thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. SOTYKTU is not approved for use in RA.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nMost common adverse reactions (\u22651% of patients on SOTYKTU and more frequently than with placebo) include upper respiratory infections, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, herpes simplex, mouth ulcers, folliculitis and acne.\n\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nPregnancy: Available data from case reports on SOTYKTU use during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2019s Adverse Event reporting line at 1-800-721-5072.\n\nLactation: There are no data on the presence of SOTYKTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. SOTYKTU is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for SOTYKTU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SOTYKTU or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nHepatic Impairment: SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nSOTYKTU is available in 6 mg tablets.\n\nPlease see U.S. Full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide, for SOTYKTU.\n\nAbout Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.

Participants were dosed with the study drug, Opdualag, in combination with nivolumab (brand name Opdivo), a different BMS immunotherapy that\u2019s already approved for use in this adjuvant setting. BMS said after Thursday\u2019s market close that the Opdualag and Opdivo combination did not meet the main goal of recurrence-free survival compared with Opdivo as a monotherapy.\n\nOpdualag and Opdivo are both checkpoint inhibitors, drugs that block proteins that tumors use to avoid detection by the immune system. Whereas Opdivo blocks the checkpoint protein PD-1 on T cells, Opdualag blocks a different checkpoint protein called LAG-3. In 2022, the FDA approved Opdualag as a treatment for advanced cases of melanoma, making the immunotherapy the first LAG-3 inhibitor to pass regulatory muster. For this indication, Opdualag is approved for use alongside Opdivo.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nIn the adjuvant setting, the hope was the pairing of Opdualag and Opdivo would prevent a recurrence of melanoma following surgery. BMS said safety in this study was in line with prior clinical tests of Opdualag and Opdivo. Specific details about the clinical study results were not released, but Jeffrey Walch, vice president, Opdualag global program lead at BMS, offered a possible explanation for the trial failure.\n\n\u201cPatients whose tumors are completely resected before treatment may not have sufficient antitumor T cells in place for Opdualag to have its maximal effect,\u201d Walch said in a prepared statement. \u201cHowever, Opdualag remains a standard of care in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and we continue to explore its potential across tumor types, including in non-small cell lung cancer.\u201d\n\nOpdualag generated $928 million in revenue in 2024, up 48% from the prior year. Opdivo is BMS\u2019s top cancer product, accounting for $9.3 billion in sales last year. But Opdivo\u2019s patent will expire in 2028. BMS is looking to grow revenue on multiple fronts as several key products face patent expiration in coming years.\n\nThe adjuvant setting in melanoma is a large market \u2014 twice the size of the market for first-line metastatic melanoma, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger wrote in a research note. Despite Opdualag\u2019s failure in the adjuvant study, Leerink still expects Opdualag will become a blockbuster product, reaching an estimated $1.9 billion in peak sales in 2028. But Risinger noted that this estimate is 30% below the consensus peak sales estimate of $2.6 billion in 2035, due to expected competitive pressure from fianlimab, a LAG-3 antibody in development by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Fianlimab is in late-stage development as a first-line treatment for metastatic melanoma and as an adjuvant treatment for melanoma.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nPublic domain image by Julio C.

The primary outcome of interest was recurrence-free survival, while key secondary endpoints included overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival.\n\nBMS did not provide specific data in its news release on Thursday, announcing only that Opdualag \u201cdid not meet its primary endpoint.\u201d Safety findings were consistent with what had been established in prior studies.\n\n\u201cPatients whose tumors are completely resected before treatment may not have sufficient antitumor T cells in place for Opdualag to have its maximal effect,\u201d Jeffrey Walch, Opdualag\u2019s global program lead at BMS, said in a statement, pointing to post-surgical effects as the potential reason for the failure.\n\nOpdualag, which is already approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients aged 12 and up, \u201cremains a standard of care in the first-line\u201d setting in this indication, Walch added.\n\nBMS is facing strong patent headwinds in the coming years, with key protections for Eliquis and Opdivo set to expire in 2028. The pharma has been beefing up its late-stage pipeline in order to shore up its earnings. BMS has also enacted sweeping cost cuts to help its balance sheet, including the $1.5-billion savings plan announced in April 2024 and an additional $2 billion target through 2027, revealed recently during its fourth-quarter earnings report.",

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

The safety profile of Opdualag observed in this analysis was consistent with the known profiles of nivolumab and relatlimab. In adjuvant melanoma, Opdivo(R) (nivolumab) remains a standard of care for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma. Moreover, Opdivo QvantigTM (nivolumab + hyaluronidase-nvhy), was recently approved in the U.S. as a subcutaneous option for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 17% in three years, versus a market return of about 36%. On top of that, the share price is down 5.4% in the last week. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.\n\nWith the stock having lost 5.4% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver the three years that the share price declined, Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:BMY Earnings Per Share Growth February 12th 2025\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Bristol-Myers Squibb's TSR for the last 3 years was -7.2%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",

In addition, the cohort also met a key secondary end point for complete response rate. With regard to safety, BMS noted that no new safety signals were observed in the cohort. According to BMS, r/r MZL is the fifth indication for which liso-cel has shown clinically meaningful benefit, making it the CD19-directed CAR-T product that has shown efficacy and manageable safety in the highest number of B-cell malignancies.\n\n\u201cMZL is a slow-growing cancer that, for many, has a favorable prognosis,\u201d Rosanna Ricafort, the vice president and head of Late Development Program Leadership, Hematology and Cell Therapy, at BMS, said in a statement.1 \u201cBut for those patients who relapse or become refractory, the disease can be quite aggressive, and there is a need for new effective and tolerable treatment options to address this unmet critical need. We are pleased that the TRANSCEND FL study supports the potential of Breyanzi in marginal zone lymphoma and look forward to presenting detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting.\u201d\n\nThe news is the latest in a series of recent positive updates from BMS regarding liso-cel. In January 2025, the company announced that its Type II variation application for liso-cel had received a recommendation for approval in r/r follicular lymphoma (FL) from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).2 Specifically, the recommendation, which was based on data from patients with FL treated in TRANSCEND FL, pertains to a potential indication for adults with r/r FL who have received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy.\n\n\u201cAs a company at the forefront of advancing therapies that transform outcomes for some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, CAR T-cell therapies are a significant focus of our research, and Breyanzi remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy portfolio and pipeline,\u201d Anne Kerber, senior vice president, head of Late Clinical Development, Hematology, Oncology and Cell Therapy, at BMS, said in a January 2025 statement.2 \u201cThis is another important step in our commitment to delivering Breyanzi to more patients across indications, as well as expanding into new regions, especially for diseases with continued unmet need such as r/r FL, which is considered incurable.\u201d\n\nLate last year, at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, held December 7-10, BMS presented 5-year survival data from patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) who were treated with liso-cel in the TRANSCEND-NHL-001 clinical trial (NCT02631044).3 Shortly after the conference, CGTLive\u00ae spoke with Manali Kamdar, MD, the associate professor of medicine\u2013hematology and clinical director of lymphoma services at the University of Colorado, about the key findings from the update.\n\n\u201cThe net is that in this study, the median overall survival at the 5 year mark was 27.5 months, the estimated overall survival rate at 5 years was 38%, and the median disease-specific survival was 68 months with an estimated disease-specific survival rate at 5 years of 52%,\u201d Kamdar told CGTLive. \u201cThese results underscore the curative potential of liso-cel in patients with r/r LBCL in the third line setting.\u201d\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses with insights on President Trump\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico and their impact on the car industry. Large US car manufacturers, particularly the firm that makes the F-150 truck, have their manufacturing plants based in Mexico. As a result, they can face significant disruption if import costs from the country increase in the aftermath of tariffs.\n\nHowever, while American car manufacturers are dependent on Mexico, Cramer pointed out that Japanese and South Korean car companies depend on their respective countries for imports. Since neither country has been targeted by tariffs, he wondered whether they could be next.\n\nAnother one of Trump\u2019s remarks that caught the CNBC TV host\u2019s attention was his demand that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates. The President has preferred low interest rates for quite some time, and his remarks in January that stressed that he would call on central banks worldwide to lower rates weakened the US dollar. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements, Cramer wondered \u201cis this discord or is it just a recognition that\u2019s just not the way to go.\u201d He added, \u201cI think the Treasury Secretary has won the President over in terms of the notion of, listen I\u2019ve got it under control, let me handle it, you don\u2019t need to yell at the Fed.\u201d\n\nCramer believes that simply demanding that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates might not yield any results. Referring to co-host David Faber, he shared \u201cDavid, yelling at the Fed, yelling at Jerome Powell, sucker\u2019s game. Doesn\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d Cramer believes \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t want to get in a sucker\u2019s game where he yells at the guy, and the guy then says look I really don\u2019t care what this President says. Because he doesn\u2019t like. . . . He likes fealty.\u201d\n\nAnother government official Cramer mentioned was Commerce Secretary Scott Bessent. In his previous shows, Cramer has praised Bessent and shared that he has heard good things about the Secretary. He maintained the positivity and shared:",

Credit: Rosemarie Mostelle/Shutterstock.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMS) has reported that the multi-centre Phase II TRANSCEND FL trial assessing its cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)-directed CAR T cell therapy, Breyanzi, met its primary endpoint in the marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) arm of adults with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\n\nFindings demonstrated a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d overall response rate (ORR), which is the primary outcome measure of this open-label, single-arm trial.\n\nThe trial aimed to demonstrate the therapy\u2019s safety and efficacy in this particular patient group.\n\nThe key secondary endpoint of complete response rate (CRR) was also met, with the therapy showing \u2018durable\u2019 responses along with a \u2018consistent\u2019 safety profile as per the topline analysis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb haematology and cell therapy late development program leadership head and vice-president Rosanna Ricafort said: \u201cMarginal zone lymphoma is a slow-growing cancer that, for many, has a favourable prognosis. But for those patients who relapse or become refractory, the disease can be quite aggressive, and there is a need for new effective and tolerable treatment options to address this unmet critical need.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the TRANSCEND FL study supports the potential of Breyanzi in marginal zone lymphoma and look forward to presenting detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting.\u201d\n\nBreyanzi is stated to leverage the T cells of an individual, which are re-engineered to target CD19-expressing cells and infused back into the individual as a one-time treatment. This therapy includes a 4-1BB costimulatory domain to \u201cenhance\u201d the persistence and expansion of the CAR T cells, stated the company.\n\nBreyanzi is currently approved in the US for several forms of B-cell lymphoma.\n\nBMS continues to expand its clinical development programme for the therapy, investigating its use in other types of lymphoma.\n\nThese developments follow the company\u2019s announcement in June 2024 regarding the Phase III CheckMate -9DW trial, which found that Opdivo plus Yervoy improved overall survival rates in subjects with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma as a first-line treatment.\n\nEditorial content is independently produced and follows the highest standards of journalistic integrity.

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced the Phase 2 TRANSCEND FL trial evaluating Breyanzi\u00ae (lisocabtagene maraleucel) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma met its primary endpoint in the marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cohort. Results showed Breyanzi demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall response rate (ORR) in these patients.\n\nThe study also met the key secondary endpoint of complete response rate (CRR). In the topline analysis, Breyanzi continued to demonstrate durable responses and a consistent safety profile with no new safety signals observed. This study marks the fifth cancer type in which Breyanzi has demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit, representing the broadest array of B-cell malignancies of any CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy and furthering evidence of Breyanzi\u2019s best-in-class and best-in-disease profile.\n\n\u201cMarginal zone lymphoma is a slow-growing cancer that, for many, has a favorable prognosis. But for those patients who relapse or become refractory, the disease can be quite aggressive, and there is a need for new effective and tolerable treatment options to address this unmet critical need,\u201d said Rosanna Ricafort, vice president, head of Late Development Program Leadership, Hematology and Cell Therapy, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cWe are pleased that the TRANSCEND FL study supports the potential of Breyanzi in marginal zone lymphoma and look forward to presenting detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting.\u201d\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators who are participating in the TRANSCEND FL clinical trial.\n\nAbout TRANSCEND FL\n\nTRANSCEND FL (NCT04245839) is an open-label, global, multicenter, Phase 2, single-arm study to determine the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. The primary outcome measure is overall response rate. Secondary outcome measures include complete response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival.\n\nAbout MZL\n\nMarginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is the second most common, slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about 7% of all NHL cases. Most patients with MZL are at a median age of 67 when they are diagnosed. MZL develops when white blood cells cluster together to form lumps in a person\u2019s lymph nodes or organs. MZL presents in three main forms: extranodal, which affects the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lung, comprising 60% of cases; nodal, involving the lymph nodes, 30%; and splenic, involving the spleen, 10%. Initial therapy often leads to long remissions, but relapse is common, sometimes occurring several times over many years. A small portion of MZL cases transform into diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, a more aggressive lymphoma.\n\nAbout Breyanzi\n\nBreyanzi is a CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which enhances the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. Breyanzi is made from a patient\u2019s own T cells, which are collected and genetically reengineered to become CAR T cells that are then delivered via infusion as a one-time treatment.\n\nBreyanzi is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after at least one prior line of therapy, and for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma after at least two prior lines of therapy, and for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma in adult patients who have received two or more prior lines of systemic therapy, and for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. Breyanzi is also approved in Japan and Europe for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory LBCL, and in Japan, Europe, Switzerland and Canada for relapsed and refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, and in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory patients with high-risk follicular lymphoma after one prior line of systemic therapy and in patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s clinical development program for Breyanzi includes clinical studies in other types of lymphoma. For more information, visit clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nU.S. FDA-Approved Indications\n\nBREYANZI is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of:\n\nadult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B, who have: refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy; or refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy and are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to comorbidities or age; or relapsed or refractory disease after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\n\n\nLimitations of Use: BREYANZI is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nWARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, AND SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving BREYANZI. Do not administer BREYANZI to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab with or without corticosteroids.\n\nNeurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving BREYANZI, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with BREYANZI. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.\n\nT cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including BREYANZI.\n\nBREYANZI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BREYANZI REMS.\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, which enrolled a total of 702 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), CRS occurred in 54% of patients, including \u2265 Grade 3 CRS in 3.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 5 days (range: 1 to 63 days). CRS resolved in 98% of patients with a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 37 days). One patient had fatal CRS and 5 patients had ongoing CRS at the time of death. The most common manifestations of CRS (\u226510%) were fever, hypotension, tachycardia, chills, hypoxia, and headache.\n\nSerious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, diffuse alveolar damage, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS).\n\nEnsure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of BREYANZI.\n\nNeurologic Toxicities\n\nNeurologic toxicities that were fatal or life-threatening, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. Serious events including cerebral edema and seizures occurred with BREYANZI. Fatal and serious cases of leukoencephalopathy, some attributable to fludarabine, also occurred.\n\nIn clinical trials of BREYANZI, CAR T cell-associated neurologic toxicities occurred in 31% of patients, including \u2265 Grade 3 cases in 10% of patients. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1 to 63 days). Neurologic toxicities resolved in 88% of patients with a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 to 119 days). Of patients developing neurotoxicity, 82% also developed CRS.\n\nThe most common neurologic toxicities (\u22655%) included encephalopathy, tremor, aphasia, headache, dizziness, and delirium.\n\nCRS and Neurologic Toxicities Monitoring\n\nMonitor patients daily for at least 7 days following BREYANZI infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities and assess for other causes of neurological symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated. Manage neurologic toxicity with supportive care and/or corticosteroid as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS or neurologic toxicity occur at any time.\n\nBREYANZI REMS\n\nBecause of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, BREYANZI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BREYANZI REMS. The required components of the BREYANZI REMS are:\n\nHealthcare facilities that dispense and administer BREYANZI must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements.\n\nCertified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab.\n\nEnsure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after BREYANZI infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS.\n\nFurther information is available at www.BreyanziREMS.com, or contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions\n\nAllergic reactions may occur with the infusion of BREYANZI. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n\nSerious Infections\n\nSevere infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have occurred in patients after BREYANZI infusion. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, infections of any grade occurred in 34% of patients, with Grade 3 or higher infections occurring in 12% of all patients. Grade 3 or higher infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 7%, bacterial infections in 3.7%, viral infections in 2%, and fungal infections in 0.7% of patients. One patient who received 4 prior lines of therapy developed a fatal case of John Cunningham (JC) virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 4 months after treatment with BREYANZI. One patient who received 3 prior lines of therapy developed a fatal case of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis 35 days after treatment with BREYANZI.\n\nFebrile neutropenia developed after BREYANZI infusion in 8% of patients. Febrile neutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after BREYANZI administration and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Avoid administration of BREYANZI in patients with clinically significant, active systemic infections.\n\nViral reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, 35 of 38 patients with a prior history of HBV were treated with concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. In patients with prior history of HBV, consider concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy to prevent HBV reactivation per standard guidelines.\n\nProlonged Cytopenias\n\nPatients may exhibit cytopenias not resolved for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and BREYANZI infusion. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias persisted at Day 29 following BREYANZI infusion in 35% of patients, and included thrombocytopenia in 25%, neutropenia in 22%, and anemia in 6% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts prior to and after BREYANZI administration.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia\n\nB-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving BREYANZI. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse reaction in 10% of patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia, either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion, was reported in 30% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with BREYANZI and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement as clinically indicated.\n\nLive vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following BREYANZI treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during BREYANZI treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with BREYANZI.\n\nSecondary Malignancies\n\nPatients treated with BREYANZI may develop secondary malignancies. T cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including BREYANZI. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes. Monitor lifelong for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing.\n\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines\n\nDue to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving BREYANZI are at risk for developing altered or decreased consciousness or impaired coordination in the 8 weeks following BREYANZI administration. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, for at least 8 weeks.\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS)\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. Three of 89 (3%) safety evaluable patients with R/R CLL/SLL developed IEC-HS. Time to onset of IEC-HS ranged from 7 to 18 days. Two of the 3 patients developed IEC-HS in the setting of ongoing CRS and 1 in the setting of ongoing neurotoxicity. IEC-HS was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. One patient had fatal IEC-HS and one had ongoing IEC-HS at time of death. IEC-HS is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of IEC-HS should be administered per current practice guidelines.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe most common adverse reaction(s) (incidence \u226530%) in:\n\nLBCL are fever, cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, platelet count decrease, and hemoglobin decrease.\n\nCLL/SLL are cytokine release syndrome, encephalopathy, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include neutrophil count decrease, white blood cell decrease, hemoglobin decrease, platelet count decrease, and lymphocyte count decrease.\n\nFL is cytokine release syndrome.

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this biopharmaceutical company have returned +1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Bristol Myers belongs, has gained 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Bristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +137.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 points to a change of +506.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of -10.3% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Bristol Myers is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb could soon be adding another indication to Breyanzi\u2019s label, with a topline readout from a mid-stage study on Monday pointing to the CAR T cell therapy\u2019s potential in marginal zone lymphoma.\n\nThe pharma did not provide specific data from the Phase II TRANSCEND FL trial in its press announcement, revealing only that Breyanzi met its primary efficacy endpoint, eliciting a \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful\u201d overall response rate. Breyanzi also met the trial\u2019s key secondary endpoint of complete response rate, while also demonstrating a durable response profile.\n\nAs for safety, TRANSCEND FL found Breyanzi\u2019s side effects to be consistent with what had been established in prior studies, with no new signals of concern.\n\nWith Monday\u2019s readout, Breyanzi has now shown strong clinically meaningful benefit in five cancer types, BMS wrote in its news release, claiming that this represents \u201cthe broadest array of B-cell malignancies of any CD19-direct CAR T cell therapy\u201d and further emphasizes the drug\u2019s \u201cbest-in-class and best-in-disease profile.\u201d\n\nBMS will present detailed findings from TRANSCEND FL at an upcoming medical meeting, according to Rosanna Ricafort, head of Late Development Program Leadership, Hematology and Cell Therapy.\n\nBreyanzi is one of seven CAR T therapies currently approved, alongside Abecma, also from BMS, and Johnson & Johnson and Legend Biotech\u2019s Carvykti.\n\nIn March 2024, Breyanzi became the first CAR T cell therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in the relapsed or refractory setting.\n\nBreyanzi is also indicated for large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\nThough not exactly the biggest cancer market, an approval for Breyanzi in marginal zone lymphoma could still be valuable for BMS as it faces strong loss-of-exclusivity headwinds in the coming years. Its Pfizer-partnered anticoagulant Eliquis, which brought in $13.3 billion in 2024, is set to lose key patent protections in 2026, as will its multiple myeloma drug pomalyst. Yervoy, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody indicated for many types of cancer, faces patent expirations this year.\n\nUnfortunately for BMS, its late-pipeline does not appear strong enough to offset the loss of revenue from these headwinds, according to a January 2025 report from William Blair, which noted, however, that standout assets\u2014Breyanzi, alongside the PD-1 blocker Opdivo, schizophrenia drug Cobenfy and heart drug Camzyos\u2014will help soften the blow somewhat.\n\nTo cushion its bottom line, BMS has set in motion aggressive cost-cutting programs, including a $1.5-billion savings push last year and the recently announced $2 billion realignment program through 2028.",

The opinion is based on data from the phase 2 TRANSCEND FL clinical trial (NCT04245839), which evaluated the therapy in patients with r/r indolent nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including FL. Currently, liso-cel is indicated in the EU for the treatment of adults with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and FL grade 3B (FL3B), who relapsed within 12 months from completion of, or are refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy, and for adults with r/r DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL3B who have previously received at least 2 lines of systemic therapy.\n\n\u201cAs a company at the forefront of advancing therapies that transform outcomes for some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, CAR T-cell therapies are a significant focus of our research, and Breyanzi remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy portfolio and pipeline,\u201d Anne Kerber, senior vice president, head of Late Clinical Development, Hematology, Oncology and Cell Therapy, at BMS, said in a statement.1 \u201cThis is another important step in our commitment to delivering Breyanzi to more patients across indications, as well as expanding into new regions, especially for diseases with continued unmet need such as r/r FL, which is considered incurable.\u201d\n\nAccording to data presented at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December by Franck Morschhauser, MD, PhD, professor, hematology, University of Lille and Hospital Claude Huriez, and chair, Lymphoma Study Association, the efficacy evaluable patients in TRANSCEND FL with relapsed or refractory FL treated in the third-line plus setting (n = 101) had an overall response rate of 97% (95% CI, 91.6-99.4; one-sided P <.0001) and a complete response rate of 94% (95% CI, 87.5-97.8; one-sided P <.0001).2 Furthermore, BMS stated that 75.7% (95% CI: 66.0\u201383.0) of patients were in response at 18 months posttreatment.\n\nThe Type II variation application for liso-cel was validated by the EMA August 2024.3 Notably, liso-cel had previously received accelerated approval from the FDA in May 2024 for treating adults with r/r follicular lymphoma who have received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy.4 Furthermore, the CAR-T was approved by the FDA for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma in March 2024.3 The therapy is also approved for the second-line treatment of r/r large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) in the US, Japan, and Europe, and for relapsed and refractory LBCL after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy in Japan, Europe, Switzerland, and Canada.\n\nCGTLive\u00ae recently spoke to Manali Kamdar, MD, the associate professor of medicine\u2013hematology and clinical director of lymphoma services at the University of Colorado, about the curative potential of liso-cel in third-line r/r LBCL.4 Kamdar also discussed 5-year safety data from the TRANSCEND-NHL-001 clinical trial (NCT02631044) that evaluated the therapy in B-cell NHL, pointing out that there were no new toxicity signals since the 2-year follow-up.\n\n\u201cIn the third line setting, we clearly have CAR T-cell therapy as a standard that a lot of physicians implement in the management of patients who have had 2 or more lines of treatment and have progressed with their diffuse LBCL,\u201d Kamdar told CGTLive.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

He then explained:\n\n\u201cThe treasure being companies that do better when interest rates go down like when the Fed starts cutting.\u201d\n\nUnlike the cash-rich tech giants that don\u2019t need lower interest rates, small caps benefit tremendously from falling rates. That\u2019s why investors were selling their big-tech winners from earlier in the year and cycling into cheaper small-cap stocks.\n\nJim Cramer was particularly enthusiastic about this narrative back then and said that investors should \u201ccelebrate the market\u2019s good breadth\u201d.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 29, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 29th, 2024, market close to February 4th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from July 29, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSales of Cobenfy, a new mind-stabilizing medicine, totaled $10 million in the final months of last year, results that fell in line with analyst expectations.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb, which acquired Cobenfy through its $14 billion purchase of Karuna Therapeutics, gave a first look at the medicine\u2019s launch in an earnings report released Thursday. Cobenfy comes as a capsule. It received FDA approval on Sept. 26 as a treatment for schizophrenia, then launched onto the U.S. market in late October.\n\nBy Bristol Myers\u2019 count, the number of filled Cobenfy prescriptions had climbed to around 1,000 per week by the end of January. Chief Commercial Officer Adam Lenkowsky told investors on an earnings call that the \u201claunch is really off to a strong start\u201d and the company has \u201cmade very good progress achieving our access goals.\u201d\n\nBristol Myers has, according to Lenkowsky, secured over 90% Medicaid access and 80% Medicare access. The two government insurance programs represent over 80% of the covered lives in the indication for which Cobenfy is approved, he said.\n\nSales and prescriptions are expected to grow as doctors get more comfortable with Cobenfy and as Bristol Myers works to widen use. Trials testing it against Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis and as an adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia should produce results this year and next. Farther out, Bristol Myers is planning pivotal studies in Alzheimer\u2019s cognition, bipolar I disorder and irritability caused by Autism spectrum disorder.\n\nDavid Risinger, an analyst at the investment firm Leerink Partners, predicts the launch will continue to do well over the course of this year as insurance coverage expands. In a note to clients, he wrote that recent trends in Cobenfy prescriptions \u201cindicate a strong initial launch.\u201d Risinger and his team have forecast the drug eventually generating close to $8 billion in annual sales.\n\nUnlike all other approved therapies for schizophrenia, Cobenfy calms the brain by activating certain kinds of proteins known as muscarinic receptors. In this way, Cobenfy indirectly regulates dopamine levels, which are often irregular in people with schizophrenia. It\u2019s the first truly new form of schizophrenia medication in decades.\n\n\u201cWe're out with our team educating customers on Cobenfy\u2019s differentiated profile, and we're breaking reflexive prescribing habits,\u201d Lenkowsky said. \u201cThat's going to take some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we would expect to see continued strong uptake through 2025 ... with a ramp in the back half of this year,\u201d he added. \u201cBut taken together, we are really pleased what we're seeing so far. And we plan to make this a very big product for the company over time.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Bristol Myers reported revenue of $12.3 billion for the fourth quarter and $48.3 billion for all of 2024, reflecting year-over-year increases of 8% and 7%, respectively. This year, however, the company expects revenue to decline almost 6%, to $45.5 billion. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting roughly $46.3 billion in 2025 revenue. The company also announced plans to broaden an ongoing cost-cutting initiative in a bid to save an additional $2 billion annually by the end of 2027.\n\nBristol Myers\u2019 share price was down around 2% Thursday morning, to hover around $59 apiece.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal maintained a Hold rating on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY \u2013 Research Report) yesterday and set a price target of $62.00.\n\nMohit Bansal\u2019s rating is based on several factors concerning Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s financial and strategic position. The company has announced a significant $2 billion restructuring plan aimed at reducing operational expenses, which is seen as a positive move to position the company for long-term success. Despite the missed guidance, the growth portfolio expectations remain aligned, and the operational expense reductions are expected to offset some of the financial challenges.\n\nHowever, concerns remain regarding the projected $8 billion revenue decline from 2025 to 2029, even with the potential contributions from new products like Cobenfy. The anticipated revenue from these growth products is not sufficient to completely counterbalance the expected downturn. Additionally, while there are some promising developments, such as the potential expansion of Camzyos\u2019 market, the company may need another successful asset or pipeline development to fully address the anticipated shortfall. These mixed factors contribute to the Hold rating, reflecting a cautious outlook on the company\u2019s future performance.\n\nIn another report released on February 4, Bank of America Securities also reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $63.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Reported EPS is $1.67, expectations were $1.47.\n\nOperator: Welcome to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChuck Triano: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today\u2019s call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Summit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. Earlier this morning, we posted our quarterly slide presentation to bms.com that you can use to follow along with Chris and David\u2019s remarks. Before we get started, I\u2019ll remind everybody that during this call, we will make statements about the company\u2019s future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.\n\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date, and we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We\u2019ll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2023 and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\n\nAll references to our P&L are on a non-GAAP basis. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thank you, Chuck, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As we\u2019ll discuss today, 2024 was a year of good execution across multiple fronts. Importantly, our performance last year establishes a solid foundation to continue our multiyear journey to achieve top-tier sustainable growth by the end of the decade. I will begin with some comments on our fourth quarter and full year accomplishments. Then I will speak to the promise we see with Cobenfy and the steady cadence of clinical data catalysts that will begin this year, further defining our future growth potential. I will end with an overview of our 2025 guidance. Starting on Slide 4. We closed 2024 with strong fourth quarter performance, reflecting another quarter of double-digit percentage increase for our growth portfolio.\n\nIn addition, we saw strong performance across key parts of the company and achieved notable commercial and R&D milestones. Looking at the full year, let\u2019s turn to Slide 5. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we have made executing on our multiyear plan. For the year, the growth portfolio delivered double-digit revenue growth led by BREYANZI, Krazati, Reblozyl and Opdivo. In the latter part of the year, we reestablished our presence in neuroscience with the U.S. approval and launch of Con which is the first novel mechanism for the treatment of schizophrenia in decades. We also received U.S. approval of Opdivo Quvantic in late December. This new subcutaneous formulation of nivolumab will help extend the reach and impact of our immuno-oncology franchise to patients into the next decade.\n\nThroughout 2024, operational excellence and financial discipline were top priorities for us. As part of this effort, we reallocated significant spend towards high potential growth opportunities, achieving most of our targeted $1.5 billion in savings. We expect to capture the remainder of this year. Additionally, we put considerable focus in 2024 on improving R&D productivity. As a result, we have been able to accelerate several programs in our late-stage pipeline. Notable examples include CEMZIOS, where we completed enrollment in the ODYSSEY non-obstructive HCM study 6 months earlier than expected and now anticipate top line results next quarter. With Coben, the ADEPT 2 study in Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis is expected to have a top line readout in the second half of this year versus our original expectation of 2026.\n\nThis is due to our focus on accelerating patient recruitment following the acquisition of Karuna. And with our ibertamideexcaliber trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, enrollment is complete, and we have an opportunity for a data readout this year, also ahead of schedule due to the recent addition of MRD as a co-primary endpoint. Looking ahead, we will continue to sharpen our focus on operational excellence. You saw the early steps of this strategy last year. As a continuation of that, we are taking deliberate steps to become a leaner, more focused company and have identified an additional $2 billion in savings. We expect approximately $1 billion of these savings to be realized this year and the remainder by the end of 2027. David will provide more detail shortly.\n\nThese actions are consistent with our strategy of investing in our growth portfolio and promising areas of science while maintaining financial discipline. As I\u2019ve said, this is a journey, but we\u2019re already seeing progress. I\u2019m confident the actions we are taking are the right ones that will further advance our long-term sustainable growth strategy. Turning to Slide 6. The U.S. approval of Cobintian schizophrenia was an important achievement in 2024, and the launch is off to a great start. While we\u2019re focused on delivering on the schizophrenia indication today, we see the potential for additional benefit to patients and have made strategic investments in a broad clinical development program. We expect to have important data readouts starting this year and every year thereafter for the remainder of the decade.\n\nThis year, we\u2019re initiating 7 Phase III studies across 3 indications: Alzheimer\u2019s disease agitation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease cognition and bipolar 1 disorder. And next year, we plan to begin Phase III studies in autism spectrum disorder irritability. The significant ramp-up in spending on Cobenfy illustrates our focus on continuing to invest behind key growth drivers while simultaneously maintaining financial discipline. Moving to Slide 7. We are entering a data-rich period with multiple catalysts over the next 24 months across a significant number of assets. In 2025, we have multiple important registrational catalysts, as you can see on this slide, including several that I already mentioned as well as the Cobenfy-ARIE study in adjunctive schizophrenia.\n\nThen in 2026, we expect to have registrational data for numerous potential first and/or best-in-class medicines, including Milvexian, in acute coronary syndrome and secondary stroke prevention, Admiral parent in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and mezigdamide in multiple myeloma. We also expect to have registrational data for Arlocell,our GPRC5D CAR-T in multiple myeloma and for RAISE101 in Gepnets. We believe these data readouts will further derisk the pipeline and provide meaningful insight into the future growth profile of the company. Now let me give you an overview of our 2025 guidance and how we see this year playing out on Slide 8. In terms of the top line, we estimate revenue to be approximately $45.5 billion, reflecting, as expected, the near-term impact of generics across multiple products and the continued strength of our growth portfolio.\n\nAs it relates to the bottom line, we expect our 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.85. This reflects the expanded savings program I mentioned earlier. David will provide more details on our guidance. Finally, turning to Slide 9. BMS is evolving into a fundamentally different company with a clear multiyear plan, strong execution and an accelerating pipeline. We now have a younger and more diversified growth portfolio. This includes Coben which has the potential to be a significant contributor to growth over the coming years. We have a multitude of important data readouts over the next 24 months with the potential to launch 10 or more new medicines and pursue over 30 indication expansion opportunities over the next 5 years.\n\nAnd we remain focused on the therapeutic areas where we have a long track record of success and delivering transformational medicines to patients. We are confident in the steps we are taking to reshape BMS. And by the end of the decade, we expect to have a transformed portfolio of marketed products driving top-tier sustainable growth. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid Elkins: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my review of our 2024 financial results, focusing on our fourth quarter performance. I will follow up with the introduction of our non-GAAP financial guidance for 2025 and some important considerations to help you better understand our financial outlook for this year. Our performance in 2024 is marked by focused execution on driving top line growth, generating strong cash flow and managing our cost structure. We have entered 2025 with a stronger foundation to deliver on our long-term growth strategy. Starting with Slide 11. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 9% to approximately $12.3 billion, driven by volume growth across the portfolio and higher inventory levels in the market.\n\nOur growth portfolio delivered another strong quarter with sales up 23% and represented slightly more than half of our revenue. Key brands like Reblozyl, KENZO and Optolag all achieved significant growth. Within the legacy portfolio, higher sales of Electus were offset by the expected impact of increased generic volumes across several other brands including Revlimid, ABRAXANE, SPRYCEL and POMALYST. Overall, our performance in the fourth quarter capped off a very good year for our company, making progress in building a foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Turning to product performance on Slide 12, starting with oncology. Opdivo delivered solid growth in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher volume. In 2025, we are focused on conversion and educating the U.S. market on the benefits of Opdivo Kuventeg, and we expect low single-digit growth for this product and OPDIVO taken together.\n\nWith Optolag, we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by demand in the U.S. where it remains a standard of care in first-line melanoma ex U.S. sales benefited from uptake in newly launched markets. Moving to cardiovascular on Slide 13. Eliquis delivered over $3 billion in fourth quarter sales. U.S. sales grew 19%, benefiting primarily from continued strong demand and the typical inventory build. Importantly, as you think about the impact to Eliquis from Medicare Part D redesign, Q1 U.S. sales growth will be tempered sequentially due to the implementation of the 10% manufacturer responsibility in the initial coverage phase. The remaining quarters of 2025 should steadily increase, particularly in the second half of the year due to the elimination of the coverage gap.\n\nTurning to KEmZyOs, sales in the fourth quarter more than doubled, benefiting from higher demand and a large inventory build. \u2014 as a standard of care and obstructive HCM, KIMZYOs continued to show strong momentum as evidenced by the approximate 1,300 new patients added to commercial drug in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently received a label update for KEMZIOS in Europe to ease the echo monitoring requirements in the maintenance setting for obstructive HCM. Importantly, we are pleased to announce today that we have a PDUFA date in April for a similar easing of the REMS echo monitoring requirements in the U.S. Let\u2019s turn to hematology on Slide 14. Rebase delivered more than 70% growth, reflecting solid uptake across first and second line MDS-associated anemia patients.\n\nSales in the U.S. benefited from demand and included onetime gross-to-net benefit outside the U.S. rebase sales more than doubled, driven by demand across newly launched markets in Europe and a strong launch in Japan. In cell therapy, BrionZ\u2019s fourth quarter sales more than doubled, driven by its best-in-class profile and strong demand growth across all its approved indications. Now moving to immunology on Slide 15. Global sales of STC grew more than 30% and U.S. sales benefited from higher demand, tempered by gross to net impacts from higher rebates associated with expanded access coverage. Starting in 2025, we further improved our access position with 80% of covered lives having 0 step edits, which will help us drive demand growth. As a result of this improved access position, however, we expect additional headwinds from higher rebates notably across the immunology franchise.\n\nRegarding CERTIKTU specifically, this will temper our reported sales in the first half of the year until demand volume can offset these impacts. I will wrap up reviewing our performance for the quarter on Slide 16 with neuroscience and cube fee. Covent sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $10 million and represent roughly 2 months of sales and initial stocking. And we\u2019ve seen strong prescription uptake during these early months of launch. Feedback from both patients and physicians has been favorable, highlighting the benefits of Cobenfi\u2019s differentiated efficacy and safety profile. Let\u2019s now move to the P&L on Slide 17. As expected, gross margin declined about 240 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by product mix.\n\nExcluding in-process R&D, operating expenses increased approximately 8%, largely driven by R&D investments, partially offset by our ongoing cost savings program. Regarding our operating expenses, we made significant progress during 2024 against our $1.5 billion strategic productivity initiative. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we realized approximately $1.1 billion in savings and expect the remaining $400 million to be realized in 2025. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9% compared to 14.9% in the prior year, primarily driven by earnings mix. For the full year, excluding in-process R&D charges, our effective tax rate was 18%, Overall, diluted earnings per share were $1.67 for the quarter and full year diluted earnings per share came in at $1.15.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation highlights on Slide 18. Our financial position remains strong with approximately $11.2 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31. We generated strong cash flow from operations of approximately $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to ensure we employ a strategic and balanced approach. Business development remains a priority, as does our plan to pay down debt. As of the end of 2024, we have repaid approximately $6 billion of the $10 billion of debt we committed to pay down relative to our March 31, 2024 balance. Our capital allocation priorities also include returning cash to shareholders through a commitment to the dividend.\n\n2025 marks our 93rd consecutive year of dividend payments. On Slide 19, I\u2019ll provide more detail on our expanded strategic productivity initiative that Chris mentioned earlier. Building on the work we did to capture cost savings last year, we identified additional opportunities to streamline operations further leverage technology and drive greater efficiency in our ways of working. As a result, we expanded the existing program to include approximately $2 billion of incremental run rate operating expense savings with approximately $1 billion to be achieved in 2025 and the remainder by the end of 2027. Under this expanded initiatives, savings will be driven by changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency with each accounting for roughly 50% of the targeted savings.\n\nWithin organizational design, we will continue to optimize and streamline our workforce to better align with the future needs of the business. To further optimize resources and enhance productivity, we will drive operational efficiencies across multiple areas of the business. In contrast to the initial $1.5 billion cost savings program, where savings were mainly reinvested. This expanded program will see the incremental $2 billion in savings drop to the bottom line. Overall, our focus is to become a leaner, more efficient company while investing behind our growth portfolio and promising areas of science. With that in mind, let me walk you through our non-GAAP 2025 guidance on Slide 20, starting with revenue. As Chris said earlier, we estimate revenue in 2025 to be approximately $45.5 billion, primarily reflecting the near-term impact of generics across multiple products and the continued strength of our growth portfolio.\n\nWe expect an 18% to 20% decline in the legacy portfolio due to the stacking of LOEs and anticipated headwinds from foreign exchange of approximately $500 million. This will be partially offset by higher revenue and continued strong performance of our key growth brands. Now continuing with our 2025 guidance for certain P&L line items, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 72%, which reflects the impact of product mix. Excluding in-process R&D, we expect total operating expenses to show a meaningful decline to approximately $16 billion, driven by the expanded cost savings program I just mentioned. We anticipate our overall expenses to be more evenly phased throughout the year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 37% for 2025.\n\nWe\u2019re expecting OI&E income of approximately $30 million and we expect to maintain our tax rate of approximately 18%. Considering these factors, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of approximately $6.55 to $6.85. Before closing, let me provide some insight regarding our expected quarterly progression of revenue for 2025. As it relates to quarterly phasing, we expect the first quarter to be impacted by the typical inventory destocking we see each year following the build in Q4. as well as the additional gross-to-net pressures from Medicare Part D redesign, which will be accentuated within Eliquis. As I said earlier, we expect Eliquis revenue for the remaining quarters of 2025 to steadily increase. particularly in the second half.\n\nAs a result of this, we expect the legacy portfolio to decline approximately 10% to 12% on a sequential basis, reflecting these dynamics and continued generic impacts as previously communicated. However, on a total company basis, we expect the inventory and gross-to-net dynamics to normalize beginning in Q2, with second half revenues to be higher than the first half of the year. In closing, our strong performance in 2024 has strengthened our confidence in our ability to deliver long-term value for our patients and shareholders. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and rightsizing our cost structure. We also look forward to multiple data catalysts, which will accelerate over the next 24 months and will derisk our pipeline and provide more certainty on the future shape of our company.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Chuck for Q&A.\n\nChuck Triano: Thanks, David and Chris for the prepared remarks. Alison, could we please poll for questions?\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Bristol Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) Follow Bristol Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\n\nChristopher Schott: Just 2 quick ones for me. First on Cobenfy. It seems like feedback and coverage dynamics are progressing well. Can you just elaborate on how you\u2019re thinking about the ramp of the drug from here as we balance as you highlight kind of entrenched physician prescribing habits against what seems like a relatively poor standard of care and pretty large unmet need in the space. I just trying to get so like the ramp, how you\u2019re thinking about it for \u201925? And the second 1 is just on the cost program. once you\u2019re done with this incremental $2 billion, should we think about additional cost opportunities as you go through that 2028 LOE cycle, or is this going to really put the company in the, I guess, the right place as we think about the longer-term model and longer-term business. So basically kind of thinking about is, is the 27% run rate kind of a good way to think about this? Or is there another step down as we head into Eliquis and OPDIVO?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the questions, Chris. I\u2019ll have Adam take the first question, and then I\u2019ll take the second. .\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Great. Thanks, Chris. So regards to the Coben fee, we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing with Coben with 3 months post launch, and the launch is really off to a strong start. We\u2019re now at approximately 1,000 TRxs per week. And we made very good progress achieving our access goals. So for Medicaid and Medicare, we\u2019re tracking ahead of our expectations. We\u2019ve achieved over 90% Medicaid access and over 80% Medicare access, recall those 2 payers represent over 80% of the covered lives in this category. And as expected, the majority have 1 step edit post generic. We\u2019re also making very good progress with commercial payers. The feedback over the last several months has been very positive. There\u2019s been a lot of enthusiasm around the efficacy and safety profile.\n\nI\u2019m also pleased with the number of trialists that we\u2019re seeing since launch, and we have an opportunity to further expand and increase adoption with roughly 30,000 psychiatrists. So as you said, this is the first new mechanism of action in decades in the treatment of schizophrenia. And so we\u2019re out with our teams educating customers on Cobenpi\u2019s differentiated profile and we\u2019re breaking reflexive prescribing habits, and that\u2019s going to take some time. So we would expect to see continued strong uptake through 2025. And as we said, with the ramp back half of this year. But taken together, we are really pleased with what we\u2019re seeing so far, and we plan to make this a very big product for the company over time.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Adam. And Chris, with respect to the second part of your question on the cost program, let me say a few things. First, as you think about this cost program keep in mind that our focus as a company continues to be on investing for growth. That\u2019s investing in the products that we have today, investing in the pipeline, both the late-stage pipeline as well as promising early areas of science. And maybe just give you quick vignettes on that. We plan to initiate 7 Phase III programs starting this year on Coben, clearly illustrating that we\u2019ll continue to invest in our pipeline. And then Adam can speak to this, but we made significant up investments in commercial last year which explains, we believe part of the progress that we\u2019ve made on products like CEMZYOS, OPDIVO and BRIAN.\n\nSo investing in growth is a priority for us, and that\u2019s the top priority. With respect to the cost programs, just a bit of context. As we were executing on last year\u2019s program, we cataloged a number of opportunities for us to become a more agile company, to become more nimble and speedy in terms of how we operate. And given where we are on that program as well as where we are with respect to LOEs, we think that it makes sense for us to capitalize on those opportunities now. So that\u2019s really driven the timing of this announcement, and we think it puts us in a good position going forward. With respect to this \u2014 the follow-up to that, which is, will there be additional cost-cutting efforts there, I think we\u2019re always going to align the organization to the needs of the business.\n\nThis is an extension of last year\u2019s program. It gives us more financial flexibility. That financial flexibility gives us strategic flexibility but we\u2019re always going to be focused on ensuring that we\u2019ve rightsized the organization, and we\u2019ve got the right level of spend, given where the business is.\n\nChuck Triano: Thanks, Chris. Alison, can we go to our next question.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Luisa Hector of Berenberg.\n\nLuisa Hector: I just wanted to take your assumption for Part D redesign, if you can quantify it in 2025. And then just an update on cendakimab, I don\u2019t see it on the slides, but any updates on the filing plans there.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the question, Luisa. I\u2019ll have Adam take both of those questions.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Thanks, Luisa. As relates to Part D redesign, there are pushes and pulls. Overall, we\u2019re going to see favorability with Eliquis due to the elimination of the coverage gap and with that, we\u2019re not going to see the historical dynamics with Eliquis, where first half sales have been higher than the second half sales. In fact, what we\u2019re going to see in Q1 is going to be the lowest quarter of sales for Eliquis mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 globally. And we\u2019ll see second half sales be higher than first half sales. But for the full year, we expect strong year-on-year growth for Eliquis. Now when you look at products like REVLIMID, POMALYST, ORENCIA and CAMZYOS, for example, that\u2019s going to offset the Eliquis favorability as we see increasing gross to net pressure starting in as patients enter the catastrophic phase.\n\nAnd as you know, we\u2019re responsible for 20% in the catastrophic phase and 10% in the initial coverage phase. But as we\u2019ve said previously, we project it to be roughly net neutral across our portfolio this year. As it relates to cendakimab, given the data that we have seen, we\u2019ve made the decision not to commercialize cendakimab. We\u2019re going to continue to prioritize investments and opportunities where we have a competitive advantage. We can deliver the highest return for the company in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to deliver potentially transformational outcomes for patients. We made a similar decision late last year with Zeposia in UC. As we saw the unsuccessful trial in Crohn\u2019s disease. And based on our competitive position with opposing in IBD, we made that decision as well.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Geoff Meacham of Citi.\n\nGeoffrey Meacham: Thanks so much for the question. I had another 1 on CoVENFI. I know, Chris, you highlighted the expansion opportunities on Slide 6. I guess, are there others that you could add or accelerate beyond what you have? I guess the main question is, since the emracladine failure are there changes to the investment plan that you\u2019re contemplating? And then on the policy front, I want to get your perspective as RFKJ\u2019s nomination or a confirmation looks I think fairly imminent, what are the potential puts and takes on IRA revisions? Obviously, been a lot of chatter on what discounting could look like in the outer years.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question and then turn it over to Samit and Adam, and then I\u2019ll come back and talk about the policy bit. Just let me give you a top line on Cobenfy. Obviously, the competitive dynamics and changes on the competitive front haven\u2019t impacted the short term on that product. We have always been focused on delivering that product as quickly as possible. patients. However, we do believe that those competitive dynamics provide a more significant long-term opportunity for us and so we have put a full court press on ensuring that we do everything we can to capitalize on that opportunity in the long term, and that includes accelerating programs where possible. So maybe Samit and Adam want to comment.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Yes, it\u2019s absolutely true what Chris just said because if you think about the dual muscular agonism mechanism of action that draft carries, it opens up the door for investigating and exploring many of the dementia associated psychosis and agitation disorders. So we will continue to explore where the drug could be applied, where additional indications could be added and how we can accelerate the development of this molecule and as well as continue to look into our pipeline, what other molecules we can bring forward in the neuropsychiatric space to be able to manage the unmet clinical need that exists for these patients at this time.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: I\u2019ll just add, Sumit. Our focus has been on ensuring a successful launch where generic atypical have about 80% market share, and co-benehas significant safety and ethically advantages there. As Sumit just mentioned, we see the unique efficacy advantages around the 3 domains of schizophrenia. \u2014 hitting on positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognition due to its unique maxes action. So we didn\u2019t expect competition from other muscarinic in schizophrenia until late 26, early \u201927. And the failure of erracladine, we have a clear path forward in schizophrenia and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity with Cobenfy. And we believe that we\u2019re going to drive meaningful growth for Covent really into the middle of the next decade.\n\nChristopher Boerner: On the policy front, maybe a few things. First, as a company, as you well know, we have a long history of working across both sides of the aisle. We actually look forward to working with the new Congress as well as President Trump\u2019s administration, including nominees like RFK once those nominees obviously are confirmed. Our focus as a company is going to continue to be on policies that strengthen the ecosystem for innovation to make sure that we\u2019re ensuring to address the needs of patients and our employees. Also, I would add ensuring that the FDA has what it needs to fulfill its mission. And so that\u2019s going to be our focus as a company. With respect to IRA specifically, I do think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to address in the coming administration some of the challenges as 1 of the first companies to go through the IRA price setting process.\n\nWe\u2019ve been very clear on concerns that we have with that law. And we see the need to have a number of fixes that will avoid some of the more damaging aspects of the law and some of the more perverse incentives and I would highlight addressing the billet and addressing the spillover impact as 2 of the most important areas that we\u2019ll be focused on. And of course, there are other policy priorities \u2014 but in general, we look forward to working with this administration, and we think we\u2019ve got some opportunities to do so.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs.\n\nUnknown Analyst: I\u2019m struck by the ability to do several things at the same time while trying to realign your costs and integrate these businesses. There have been several advancements of time lines in terms of data readouts. And there\u2019s also been an absence of slippage across integrating aspects of the pipeline that are very important what are the keys in your opinion, to being able to deliver on this progress and in particular, the advancement of time lines?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Maybe I\u2019ll start and then turn it over to Samit. I think, Chris, you\u2019ve correctly pointed out there a lot of moving parts. But I would say One of the reasons that we\u2019ve been fixated on operational excellence, becoming a more nimble and focused organization is making sure that we\u2019re staying absolutely focused on those things that are going to drive value to the company and value to shareholders. And so one of those things has been a very laser-like focus on R&D productivity. The work that we\u2019ve done in that regard has enabled us to accelerate a number of programs that are going to add value for the company. In fact, one of the reasons we have this wave of catalysts that are coming forward over the next 24 months, is that we have been focused on ensuring we hit the time lines that we set internally and where possible, accelerate and Samit and the team has done a nice job of helping us do that. So Samit, do you want to comment on specifics.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the question, Chris. As Chris said, the laser focus is the start. But then again, following the principles we laid out a few years back, in fact, between Robert and myself from the research and discovery perspective, the cause of biology to discover the drugs matching the modality to the mechanisms and then picking the right diseases. And then after that, accelerating that proof of concept generation. But then if you look at the late development, we broke down the process into multiple pieces and dig deeper into where we were doing well, whereas wherever the space is where we had the opportunity to shorten the time lines. And there, we identified several opportunities, and then we started to dig deeper into it.\n\nThe other thing we did last year is also prioritize our portfolio and made certain decisions what we will pursue versus what we will not pursue. Some assets, some trials were stopped and then we started focusing on where the most amount of scientific rigor was there to be able to achieve the proof of concept. And once that was achieved, how do we then accelerate that into generation of the data to bring the drug to the patients and to commercialization all of that has helped. And the examples that are right in front of you, last year, we were able to accelerate and deliver the psoriatic arthritis data early \u2013,, this year, we\u2019ll be able to give KENZYOSdata early. This year, we\u2019ll be able to bring in ADAPT. And now we are working on the next trial as well as we think about multiple myeloma, LPA1 and IPF as well as SLE trials, for SOTC.\n\nAnd of course, that mindset will go in all of these 7 trials that we\u2019ve talked about for Coventry as well. So overall, very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made, but we have a little bit more distance to go, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on our portfolio to deliver.\n\nChristopher Boerner: And just to put a finer point on what Samit said, Chris, we have the potential for 15 or more registrational trials that will read out by the end of next year. And so the work that Samit\u2019s team is doing to ensure that those are delivered, delivered on time is, we think, critical, and we\u2019ve made good progress in 2024. And as Samit said, we\u2019re heads down continuing to execute on that.\n\nOperator: And the next question will come from Tim Anderson of Bank of America.\n\nTimothy Anderson: I have a couple of questions. So the revenue guidance for \u201925 is about $1 billion less than consensus in as much as you\u2019ve looked at consensus, where are you seeing the biggest differences could Codensa be 1 of those contributors of the delta? And then a longer-term question on earnings. In the past, Chris, you\u2019ve suggested trough earnings would really be in the very late 2020s. And to me, it felt like maybe 2028, 2029. Is that still the right way to think about it? And could a product like Covent fee or some of these other programs possibly pull that forward?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the questions, Tim. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then turn it over to David for the first part of your question, and then I\u2019ll come back for the second part. Look, with respect to how we thought about guidance and the outlook for this year, I think you as well as I think everybody knows the LOE exposure that we have as a company as expected. This year, we\u2019re seeing the increased step down on Revlimid as well as the stacking of full year impacts products like POMALYST, which lost exclusivity in Europe as well as in the U.S. price and our guidance reflects that. But keep in mind, those are short-term impacts. And the long term, which is what we\u2019re focused on, we feel good about the progression that we\u2019re making on the new product portfolio.\n\nAnd then as we discussed just in the last question, we have an exciting set of assets that are going to be reading out that will frame out what the company looks like in the back part of the decade. And maybe I\u2019ll ask David to fill in some of the specifics on the LOEs and the guidance.\n\nDavid Elkins: Yes. Tim, thank you for the question. And just as a reminder, Bloomberg\u2019s for the total company is sitting around 46.2% we\u2019re guiding approximately 45.5%. If you remember in my prepared remarks, \u2014 so there\u2019s a headwind of currency, which we don\u2019t believe has been built in, which is around $500 million. So as we look at where we are versus consensus from a revenue perspective, we\u2019re broadly in line with where it is. Any minor differences is really as we keep highlighting is around the legacy portfolio, in particular, REVLIMID coming down to 2, 2.5 as well as the other generic impacts that we mentioned on the call. But overall, we feel pretty good where we are versus consensus.\n\nChristopher Boerner: With respect to the trough question, first, I think the way you\u2019re thinking about the drop in general is the right way to think about it. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re not going to be giving long-term guidance as a standard course. This reflects the philosophy that we have that we\u2019re going to guide to what we and you can hold us accountable for. But what we\u2019ve also been very clear on is that our focus continues to be on driving top-tier growth exiting this decade. And specifically, that means increasing the velocity of growth that we have in the last couple of years exiting this decade and into the next. So as it relates to trough, we\u2019re working to do everything we can to change the timing, the depth and duration of that.\n\nAnd how we do that is to continue to do more of what we frankly did last year, dry brand growth brand performance. accelerate the pipeline so that we derisk some of these future catalysts as quickly as possible, use our capital to accelerate growth. Frankly, that\u2019s what we did when we acquired Karuna to bring a product like Cobinfi into the portfolio. And in fact, as a result of that and what we see as the long-term potential, we believe we\u2019ve accelerated the velocity of growth as we exit this decade. So we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on finding ways to use capital to continue to accelerate their growth profile. And we\u2019re going to become more nimble as a company so we can move quickly to capitalize on those. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be transparent about our performance against on these calls.\n\nChuck Triano: Great. Thank you, Chris. Alison, let\u2019s move to the next question.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Mahi Banzel of Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal: My question is regarding Aliquis. So I mean \u2014 so there was some thoughts about Eliquis getting some tailwind because of design given that there\u2019s no donut hole now. And maybe the like given the price point the impact of party design may not be a lot. So in the context of that, how are you thinking about the growth for this brand for this year? .\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the question, Mohit. Adam, do you want to take that?\n\nDavid Elkins: Yes, Thanks Mohit, for the question. As I mentioned, we\u2019re going to see favorability with Eliquis this year in the U.S. due to Part D redesign with the elimination of the coverage gap. And so I talked about the dynamics historically, where the first half sales were higher than the second half sales. So we\u2019re going to see something very different this year, where Q1 sales will be the lowest quarter for Eliquis, and we\u2019ll see higher sales in the second half of the year. For the year, we expect strong double-digit growth for Eliquis overall. And when we look at where we are positioned in the market in the U.S., we have a market share that continues to grow linearly. Our share in the U.S. NBRx is roughly 75% and \u2014 and we know that with Xarelto out of the market, we\u2019ve got a great opportunity to continue to drive this important brand for the company.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Trang Han of UBS.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Just 2, please. So firstly, can you just give us some color on the gross margin cadence for 2025? You touched upon 1Q dynamics, but should we just follow the REVLIMID step downs for the year? \u2014 is there any other considerations that we should think about here? And then just wondering if you can give us any early insights into the access and coverage of Opdivo Quantic \u2014 and any thoughts on the uptake for \u201925.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the questions, Fran. David, do you want to take the first 1 and then Adam, you can comment on the second.\n\nDavid Elkins: As we said, the step down will be mainly driven by REVLIMID and POMALYST. \u2014 volumes coming through with those gross margins being slightly higher than the average. And the only other consideration obviously is Eliquis. And I think as Adam had covered typically Eliquis is larger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. This year, that\u2019s going to be inverted in that our lowest quarter for Eliquis the first quarter but our sales will be higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So that would be the other consideration as you think through the gross margin of the company in total.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes. So as it relates to Opdivo Quvantic, these are very early days. The team is out in the field educating health care practitioners on the benefits of subcu versus IV. As we said previously, we believe physicians will convert at least 30% to 40% of the IV business ahead of our LOE in late 2028, which will extend the franchise into the 2030s. We have seen so far very positive feedback early on is around usage in adjuvant patients, patients who are treated in combination with YERVOY, like in first-line metastatic melanoma, first-line RCC. The feedback specifically has been positive regarding the 3- to 5-minute infusion time taking all that treatment burden for both physicians and for patients. We\u2019ve also seen a number of NCCN guidelines updated for your reimbursement question to include optavialcuvantig within just a few weeks after approval.\n\nAnd I think the most common question that we\u2019re getting is around the reimbursement dynamics here. We\u2019ve had conversion from IV subcu in the first half of the year is going to take some time, mainly due to a temporary J code, which is routine for any new product in this category. And conversion will accelerate in the second half of the year once we transition to a permanent J code on July 1. And so we\u2019re excited about the launch and what this means for patients, physicians and importantly, the durability of our IO franchise.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman: One on BD, more specifically, now that we\u2019re on this side of the muscarinic debate with Coventry approved and peer acuity not showing an efficacy, can you walk us through kind of your process in determining why you went for Karuna when you wanted to get into schizophrenia. And on kind of a more mechanistic perspective, what\u2019s happening with Kemira? We saw a nice step up. What are you seeing in the field that\u2019s driving the uptake there? .\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the questions, Evan. \u2018ll start and then turn it over to Adam. There\u2019s no magic bullet with respect to how you approach business development from our standpoint. But I think there were a few things that we did well with the Karuna acquisition that will frame how we continue to do business development. First, I would note that the senior leadership team of the company owns the decision to move forward with that acquisition. Capital allocation is critically important as we\u2019ve discussed. Business development is a top priority for us as a company. It\u2019s important as we navigate the back part of this decade, and when you\u2019re allocating investor capital at that scale, it\u2019s critical that senior leaders take ownership and accountability for it.\n\nSo we did that. Second, we were very disciplined in the approach. It started with making sure that we really like the science, we considered multiple options and we zeroed in on the science that was coming out of Karuna as compelling in our view. And beyond that, we felt strongly that this had an opportunity to strengthen our therapeutic areas as well as to give us opportunities to accelerate growth in the back part of the decade. And of course, we were very disciplined on the financials. We needed to make sure that we could put a compelling case together that it would add value to the company and ultimately to shareholders. You actually saw how we executed against that post the decision to acquire in that we spent a lot of time with the Heritage Karuna team to fully develop this asset in ways that they were unable to do so.\n\nAnd we think that\u2019s important in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunity. And maybe the last lesson learned that I\u2019d highlight is we moved very quickly \u2014 and so those lessons, I think, will frame out how we continue to do business development at the company. And then Adam, do you want to take the second question?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes. Evan, regarding CMIOs, we\u2019ve seen strong and consistent growth from Kim Zios \u2014 as you heard from David\u2019s opening remarks, year-end, 2024, there were approximately 12,000 patients in the hub and roughly 9,500 patients on commercial drug. So we\u2019ve established a strong revenue base, and we expect continued growth from the expansion of our prescriber base. We\u2019re seeing high persistency and duration of therapy. And we\u2019re continuing to add new patients each and every week. So our focus is now on increasing depth of prescribing in the larger COEs while at the same time, increasing breadth in some of the smaller institutions and larger community practices, and we\u2019re making some good progress there. We also have a couple of things.\n\nDavid mentioned, one, we look forward to the PDUFA date that\u2019s coming in April. So similar to what we\u2019ve seen in Europe, our goal is to ease the burden of echo requirements for patients and physicians, and we expect that to open up additional capacity at the COEs. And as a result, physicians will be able to treat more patients. And as you\u2019re also aware, we have a data readout in nonobstructive HCM, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the ONS data in Q2, and that will and the eligible patient population by about 30% or so. And so that\u2019s going to allow Kamo to have a nice first mover advantage in both indications and across the full spectrum of patients with symptomatic HCM.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Akash Tewari of Jefferies.\n\nAkash Tewari: So what\u2019s the risk around the adjunct schizophrenia trial for KabEnfI? Because we haven\u2019t seen a lot of companies run that specific trial. And if they have, they\u2019ve often failed. So why wouldn\u2019t the probability of success for this trial be more like a 50-50 coin flip? And on the Camis label update, are you aiming for 6 months echo monitoring requirements? And if so, how do you think that will help expand access into the community setting?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks for the question, Samit and Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Sure. Thank you for the question. On the adjective schizophrenia, I remember where we started off and how patients are treated in the in the real world. So we obviously have developed the drug as a monotherapy, but these patients were primarily before they got onto the trial, we\u2019re receiving the D2 agonist and thereafter, there was a washout period, patients came on the drug and then, of course, the trial evaluated the primary endpoint in emerging 1, 2 and 3 at a shorter window. But remember, merging 4 and 5 have now read out with a 52-week follow-up. Many of those patients obviously, are also taking concomitant medications in the background. So \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen that efficacy continued to be maintained within \u2014 as we look towards the 52-week data point as well.\n\nSo overall, from that perspective, we are confident on the overall safety profile that is emerging on that. And then, of course, from a blinded data perspective, the study has continued at this point. So now we are only a few months away from the readout for that trial. And of course, on top of that, we\u2019ll look at ADAPT trials also reading out beginning at the back end of this year. Coming to Camzyos, a point that I would like to make is \u2014 it is very important that we continue to decrease the burden on the site on the patients and the treating physicians. And from that perspective, it was important the data that we\u2019ve collected from the real world as well as in the clinical trials suggest that the overall safety profile of Camzyos is maintained.\n\nMany of the patients are treated actually at the lowest holes of 2.5 and 5 milligrams and considering all of that data is where we approach the health authorities, and you\u2019ve already seen the action taken in Europe and now looking forward to the April action as we think about the maintenance for these patients with a longer duration in between echos as we look to the U.S. reviews as well. Adam, if you want to add anything?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Just adding just 1 bit, and point you to the the European label. The label was updated late last year to reduce the frequency of echo monitoring for patients taking CAMZIOS from every 12 weeks to once every 6 months when patients are in the maintenance phase. So that\u2019s after week 12. And what we would expect is not so much in the community, but this will open up additional capacity at the centers of excellence. And as a result, physicians will be able to treat more patients.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn: Great. Maybe 2 for me. David, I just wanted to clarify on the new productivity initiative, should we think about the run rate year-end \u201927 as being $15 billion. So an incremental $1 billion off of the $16 million now. I just wanted to make sure I understand it correctly. And then on iberdomide, the addition to the MRD endpoint, did FDA sign off on that? And if so, are you able to get approval on just an MRD endpoint? Or do you need follow-up data from the PFS? And anything you can say about what kind of efficacy delta you\u2019d need on MRD?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Terence, David in Samit.\n\nDavid Elkins: Yes. thanks for the question. Yes, you have that right. So we said an incremental. It\u2019s a $2 billion program, all that dropping to the bottom line. We said $1 billion of that which dropped this year with operating expenses of $16 billion the further $1 billion achieved by 2027 would get you to operating expenses of $15.\n\nSamit Hirawat: In terms of thinking about iberdomide, of course, quite excited that based on the discussions that you probably followed from the ODAC setting perspective at MRD as an endpoint is more and more becoming important because in multiple myeloma, there are multiple lines of therapies that are available, but still no cure available for patients with multiple myeloma. So it is important that we continue to figure out how to accelerate the process of drug development and that\u2019s why newer end points are needed. So of course, we\u2019ve discussed with the FDA the ability to include MRD as 1 of the primary endpoints in the clinical trial, and we\u2019ll certainly be reading that out most likely in this year. Now everything in the regulatory world will be dependent on the risk benefit ratio and the overall magnitude that we\u2019ll observe at the end of the day.\n\nSo when the data is available, that\u2019s when we will engage with the regulators in terms of how they will see that data and what else they would need Remember, we have not taken out PFS as the second primary endpoint within the trial as well. So of course, the patients will be followed for PFS and as well as the secondary endpoint, which is overall survival as well. So we are going to collect maximum data from the clinical trial and engage the authorities based on the magnitude and the timing of the readout.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Samit. The only thing, Terence, I would add, and David got it right with respect to how the cost savings will flow is to \u2014 as I said earlier on this call, keep in mind that as we think about the overall cost structure, as we see compelling opportunities for growth that exist, we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to invest in those \u2014 so just keep that in mind as framing all of this discussion around cost.\n\nOperator: Our next question will come from Courtney Breen of Bernstein.\n\nCourtney Breen: I think you spoke a little bit about business development in an answer before and referenced it as a top priority from a capital allocation perspective. Can you just talk a little bit about TA alignment, kind of what good looks like, particularly in the context of the organization you have right now, I think, last year was a little bit of digesting the deals that you\u2019ve done quickly. And so wanting to understand kind of how you\u2019re thinking about that appetite now and over the course of the year? And then the second was just around kind of codentfeand specifically kind of gross-to-net evolution as we\u2019re thinking about this access evolving from kind of initial private pay to more of the government setting to then adding on a little bit of the commercial environment, that would be really helpful to understand how you\u2019re expecting that to flow.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Both good questions. I\u2019ll start and then turn it over to Adam. As we said earlier, and as you reiterated, business development is a top priority for us. Think about that both in terms of partnerships and where it makes sense, acquisitions. And the way we think about therapeutic areas is that we\u2019re really focused on strengthening our position in the core therapeutic areas that we have today, and that we can do by bringing promising areas of science into the company as well as looking for assets that can improve the growth profile of the company. And I think you saw shortly after I became CEO in 2023, we did both of those things. What\u2019s important and the way we think about it is that we need to like the science and feel that we\u2019re the rightful owners of it, the financials have to make sense.\n\nAnd again, we\u2019ve included in that thinking strengthening the growth profile as a key factor we\u2019re considering. And we have to believe that we can drive value for the company and ultimately for shareholders. And as we look across the core therapeutic areas that we have today, we see opportunities as we see opportunities to strengthen our position in those therapeutic areas. The nice thing is that we\u2019re in a very strong financial position. And as I said earlier, that financial strength and flexibility gives us strategic flexibility and that flexibility includes doing business development where it makes sense.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Believe I\u2019ll just answer the question around SP261127157 Courtney. Thanks for the question. Relates to gross to net, the brand is going to continue to lean heavily towards the public sector Medicare and Medicaid. And you think about the evolution of schizophrenia and seton indications or our Alzheimer\u2019s indications, whether it be Alzheimer\u2019s the psychosis or Alzheimer\u2019s cognition. These are patients who are going to be in Medicare and Medicaid. Commercial patients are less than 10%, you will see that more commonly in some of the indications such as autism and in bipolar disorder, but the majority of the brand will largely be in the public where there are Medicaid best price.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim Securities.\n\nSeamus Fernandez: So just quickly on Cobenfy, I was hoping you could talk about the patient experience that you\u2019re seeing so far in the field. We know that patients certainly feel better cognitively, but there are questions around the tolerability and the BID dosing. So just interested to know if there\u2019s any early signs of sort of and how you\u2019re managing the GI profile that\u2019s been talked about a bit by some thought leaders in that regard. And then the second question is just as we think about the overall kind of multiple myeloma opportunity, just hoping to get a sense of where you think novel oral drugs like iberdomide or resignomide could appropriately fit within the context of the overall multiple myeloma market. given the availability of generic Revlimid and POMALYST?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Seamus. Adam, and then maybe, Samit, you can chime in as well.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes, Seamus, thanks for the questions. We\u2019ve been really pleased with what we\u2019re hearing from both physicians and patients. The feedback has been very positive with a lot of enthusiasm on the efficacy and the safety profile. So what we\u2019re hearing is patients are seeing improvement in positive symptoms as early as the first week of treatment and on really the lowest dose of 50 milligrams. And we\u2019re also hearing good successes on negative symptoms and what we were really excited about this asset for improvement in clarity of thought, improvement of cognition, patients being able to reengage with their families and even start thinking about going back to work. The AEs, what we\u2019ve heard from physicians, they\u2019re manageable, including the nausea and vomiting because what we\u2019re seeing is the majority of physicians in the real world are treating patients at the lowest dose.\n\nJust starting with 50 milligrams, they\u2019re taking a week or 2 before they titrate up to the next dose at 100 unlike what you saw in the clinical trials, which moved to 125 milligrams within the first 8 days of the trial. So that has been incredibly positively received, and so we\u2019re not hearing a lot of the top tolerability issues from physicians. But our teams are out there making sure that we\u2019re educating on what to expect. As it relates to BID \u2014 we know that on average, patients are on 7 pills per day. And so we\u2019re not hearing this as a major objection to prescribing. And last thing I\u2019ll mention is we\u2019ve got an ongoing study looking at taking Covent with food that will read out this year. So that will also improve the ease of prescribing for physicians and make it easier for patients as well.\n\nSamit Hirawat: So I\u2019ll just take it off from there. And 1 thing that I would just add on opened. So prior to Cobenfy, what drugs were doing was treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, meaning the positive symptoms primarily. With Cobenfy, now we are treating schizophrenia, meaning also impacting the negative symptoms, and we are seeing the impact on cognition as we have recently published the data on multiple myeloma switching gears it\u2019s important to understand where the patients are treated and what the drugs are available. If you think about the cell therapies and the T cell engagers or bispecifics, they are to be primarily used in the academic settings whereas most of the patients with multiple myeloma, especially with the relapsed/refractory disease are being treated in the community setting, where it is very difficult to get these therapies with the side effect management and the rents programs that go along with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where it is very important to continue to develop small molecules, which are easy to deliver and can be combined with the standard of care therapies. And that\u2019s exactly where Iberdomide Music might sit. And you know mesictamide is being compared head-to-head versus pomalidomide and that\u2019s how you replace somalitomide. And then, of course, there\u2019s another trial looking head-to-head iberdomide versus Revlimid, which certainly will read out later, but it is a very important component of the overall development plan.\n\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Risinger of Leerink Partners.\n\nDavid Risinger: Congrats on all the updates. Sorry, I have another call coming in here. So my apologies. They want me on the box to speak. So I have 2 questions. First, with respect to the performance in \u201925. So obviously, the worse that the LOEs perform in \u201925, the better the setup for the trajectory of growth for the company in \u201926. But if the loss of exclusivity products performed better than expected, then it makes it a little bit tougher to grow in. Could you just discuss that a little bit and provide some initial context for \u201926? I know that you\u2019re not providing guidance at this time. And then second, just with respect to RV, it\u2019s been performing very strongly, growing 20% roughly in the fourth quarter and roughly 20% for full year 2025 sorry, 2024, can you comment on growth prospects for YERVOY going forward as well?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, David. David Elkins and then Adam.\n\nDavid Elkins: Yes. So just on your question around 25 and what to think about heading into 26. First, REVLIMID, as we said, we have additional generic entry coming. So about 70% of the market will be supplied by generics. Remember, for REVLIMID, full generic entry in January of 26. So we\u2019ll be through that by the end of the year. And we have a generic entry APOMALIS next year as well. And the only other headwind that I would mention is we provided that guidance on IRA, which really took out the worst-case scenario for Eliquis as we head into the IRA. But really, our focus remains on investing in the growth drivers. You saw the strong execution in that growth portfolio that\u2019s now greater than 50% of our business. We exited double-digit growth last year.\n\nWe feel really good about the position that we\u2019re in this year. And then as you think about going into \u201926 with that growth portfolio, you heard Adam talk about the additional indications in Censis and STK as well as Real \u2014 and we got some really important data readouts that we\u2019re going to be able to add up to 6 new NMEs here over the next 2 years. So that growth portfolio is really coming together. We\u2019re adding to that. And then you\u2019ve heard all the commentary around Cobenfy further adding to that growth portfolio. So there\u2019s pushes and pulls there. But what\u2019s becoming clear is the strength of the growth profile as we go into the second half of the decade here.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: As it relates to YERVOY, we\u2019re seeing solid demand growth across our core indications, first-line lung, first-line RCC as well as first-line melanoma, where YERVOY is using combination. And that growth is coming both from the U.S. and from our international markets. In the U.S., we continue to see good adoption in the community. And as you know, last year, we presented I think is a remarkable 10-year long-term data in first-line melanoma. I think the last thing I\u2019d means we\u2019re also preparing for launches this year in first-line HCC and first-line MSPCRC, both in combination with Yervoy, which will help drive your voice performance. And we also have Opdivo YERVOY lung approval that\u2019s pending in China. So taken together, we would expect continued growth from YERVOY in \u201925.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Matt Phipps of William Blair.\n\nMatthew Phipps: Following up on the MRD primary endpoint for the Abertimide trial, is there a time course that the FDA wants as far as how much durability on that MRD? And why not add MRD endpoints to the teziimide trials? It does look like you already have MRD on the ArlosQuintEssential II and then similarly, in multi myeloma, is there a point at which Abema what is kind of the profitability breakpoint for Abema \u2014 and the success of Arlo cell really kind of gate the need for a beckoning.\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Matt. Samit then Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Sure. Thank you, Matt, for the question. So for multiple myeloma, look, MRD endpoint is something that is new from the perspective of using as a registration trial endpoint. And that\u2019s why we have to continue to follow the patients and provide the durability in terms of not only an MRD, but also overall response rates, CR rate that we will see and these will be the points of discussion with the FDA as we get into those time points once the magnitude is known for this endpoint as well as the events occur in the Iberdomide trial. In terms of how we are thinking about use of this particular endpoint for other trials. We are continuing to evaluate the potential to leverage an earlier MRD endpoint readout to accelerate the development of our multiple myeloma assets across the board, but it will all depend on the timing, the population as well as how the event accrual is occurring.\n\nSuccessor studies target a little bit more of a difficult-to-treat patient population. So we\u2019ll see how the event occurrence happens and that may become as 1 of the studies that we may consider an endpoint as well in the future, but not at this time.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: As it relates to Abema, we know multiple myeloma is going to remain a very crowded and competitive space, and there are multiple treatment options available. We remain committed to Abema, but we\u2019re going to see continued depending intensity and competitive pressures. So our focus is making sure that we\u2019re optimizing the value of bema and we\u2019re going to remain competitive in the space. As you heard earlier from Chris and David, we\u2019re very excited also about GPRC5D which we believe is going to play a critically important role in the treatment of post-BCMA CAR T with a single infusion and an improved safety profile.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Steven Scale of TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala: I have 2 questions. First, Bristol\u2019s second-generation TYK2 completed Phase I in psoriasis in August of 2024, but hasn\u2019t progressed. So curious what the profile of this agent is, what are plans and is IBD within those plans? And secondly, Milvexian Phase III readouts in stroke and ACS are expected in 2026, but later in the year. Curious if events are tracking for that 2026 readout and is there any possibility at all for a 2025 readout for either trial?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Thanks, Steve. Samit.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Thanks, Steve, for both the questions. So first of all, for the backup Tik2, we completed those studies. We have the data \u2014 but as you know, we are continuing to progress our overall plans for Sotika this time. And as we spoke earlier, we have to decide within our pipeline where we are going to really focus and prioritize \u2014 and at the current time, our focus is truly squarely on Sotto and maximizing that opportunity from a development and commercial perspective. So at this time, that ticket is not in the development as you already have stated. From the SSP and ACS readout, events are tracking as well as the enrollment is going really well. We do not expect that readout in 2025. We expect that readout as we have stated at the back end of 2026.\n\nOperator: The question will come from Kripa Devarakonda of Truist Securities.\n\nUnknown Analyst: I have a canvas question. Congrats on getting the label update in EU. I was wondering with the label change in EU and potentially a change in the U.S. as well. How do you see the peak opportunity now? And with ODYSSEY data upcoming this year, can you help set expectations for the readout? And then if I can week 1 in Senan for Kobani. One of the tails we recently spoke to said that there was an issue with drug availability at average pharmacies is what he said. I was wondering if this is just a one-off or just does it just take time to ramp up availability?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes. So I can certainly take those thank you. So as it relates to the label for CAMZyOS. As I said, we expect to have a PDUFA date in April of this year. And our goal is to continue to ease the burden of the echo requirements for both patients and physicians, and it\u2019s going to open up additional capacity at the COEs. What we are seeing for Caxias, which is and steady growth. We have a very large revenue base that\u2019s building, and we continue to expect growth from the expansion of prescribers and high persistency. Patients are staying on treatment for a very long time because they\u2019re feeling better. And so that\u2019s going to help with the duration of therapy, and we\u2019re focused on continuing to add new patients each and every week.\n\nAs it relates to the ODYSSEY readout, maybe Samit, if you want to talk a little bit about it, but just as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing top line data in Q2. This is going to add a positive around 1/3 of patients in HCM and have an opportunity to build upon the success of CMIOs with a strong first-mover advantage across both indications, and we\u2019re certainly looking forward to that data readout. And so I\u2019ll turn it to Samit to talk a little bit more about MCM and then I\u2019ll quickly answer your Coben question in the form.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Yes, I\u2019ll address the Odyssey question very quickly. The paper from a methodology perspective as well as the baseline characteristics of the patients who are just published in JACC heart failure. So you can certainly pick it up from there. And the primary endpoints of KCCQ and PVO2 are well described as well as what the statistical methodology is. So, of course, we are looking forward to the readout and it\u2019s just \u2014 I think in the next quarter, we\u2019ll be able to see the results, and then we\u2019ll share that with you. .\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes. Just really quickly on that. We\u2019re not hearing that. Our teams are out both with positions, but they\u2019re also at the pharmacies as well. So I do think that is potentially a one-off. And we want to make sure that the Covent is available broadly across the U.S., so patients can get access to this really important product.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Olivia Brayer of Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nOlivia Brayer: What data did you submit to the FDA for the less restrictive camsiosrans? Did that include anything additional versus what was submitted to \u2014 and are you asking the agency for the same 2 updates that were proposed in the December agenda? I think those are around monitoring frequency and the use of LVOT gradient \u2014 and then, Adam, I just wanted to clarify 1 point you made earlier. You said the European label was updated to reduce frequency. I think you said from every 12 weeks to once every 6 months. I just wanted to clarify that I heard that correctly.\n\nSamit Hirawat: Maybe I can start off. Thanks for the question, Olivia. We will not be able to give you the specifics at this time in terms of the asks of the FDA. Certainly, there are several of them, and then we\u2019ll see which ones we are able to have a conversation and get from a relief for the patient perspective. And in terms of the data that were submitted, they come from both clinical trials as well as from the real-world evidence. So overall data package was very strong, and we continue to have the dialogue with the regulatory agencies.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky: Yes. And Olivia, just to clarify, again, the label in Europe was updated to reduce the frequency of echo monitoring for patients taking Censis post week 12. So after week 12, as pace move into the maintenance phase instead of once a quarter, they\u2019re able to now have echos once every 6 months.\n\nOperator: Next question will come from James Shin of Deutsche Bank.\n\nJames Shin: I just wanted to follow up on the Rise question. What are BMY\u2019s expectations for the PANscore benefit? And then \u2014 any color on how ADP 2 will be disclosed? Will the MPIC be top line in the PR? And will this be followed by a full data set at a Medical Congress Tom?\n\nSamit Hirawat: Thank you for the questions. Let me start with the second 1 for Adapt. As has been recently done and previously done, at the top line, if we it reads out, we will be putting out a press release. But generally, we do not disclose the data. Those will be presented at medical conference appropriately and for RISE again, the magnitude that we are going to be looking for is going to be the difference between the 2 arms rather there and as well as we look \u2014 the difference that we observed from baseline to the time of readout. So both of those endpoints are going to be important, apart from the, of course, the secondary end points. Right now, we are not commenting on the overall magnitude. But here, even small differences in terms of the points would be very, very important and clinically meaningful, as you know, in the neuropsychiatric space. .\n\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sean McCutcheon of Raymond James.\n\nSean McCutcheon: Can you speak to the expectations for the cadence of data for the targeted radiotherapeutic portfolio and prioritization of further investment in BD and internal development. following that investment in the infrastructure in that segment..\n\nSamit Hirawat: Yes. From the raise portfolio perspective, of course, the Phase III is already ongoing in Gap NET. And this is in the patient population. \u2014 that is already you see prior Lutathera. So it\u2019s \u2014 and certainly, the Phase I data was very strong, and we\u2019ll continue to look for not only the response rate, but of course, progression-free survival is going to be important to continue to observe in this one as we look to the readout in 2026. As you know that we are also exploring the activity of this drug in patients with small cell lung cancer in a Phase I study, and we recently started the breast cancer program as well. And from the portfolio perspective, we have \u2014 we\u2019re looking forward to initiation of our Phase I program for GPC3 as a new target. And then, of course, there\u2019s a pipeline behind it in the research space as well.\n\nChristopher Boerner: And the only thing I would add is that we continue to be looking for opportunities to enhance the acquisition of raise, we believe in this platform. And if it\u2019s appropriate and it makes sense for us, both financially and scientifically, we would consider business development as well.\n\nChuck Triano: Great. Thanks, Chris. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question, and then we\u2019ll turn it to Chris for some closing remarks. .\n\nOperator: Next question will come from Alexandra Hammond of Wolfe Research.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Bristol\u2019s long-term growth potential. So the team has mentioned an under appreciation to the pipeline. Can you imply the key assets you expect to drive revenue looking at the back end of the decade, maybe your favorite child or 2?\n\nChristopher Boerner: Well, listen, I\u2019ll take that one. We feel great about the pipeline. We have a number of really exciting assets that are coming \u2014 we\u2019ve spoken at length, obviously, about Cobin. Clearly, we also are very excited about our CELMoD programs. We have multiple CELMoDs that we\u2019ve spoken about today, Ibara messy, but we haven\u2019t spoken about gocotomide. \u2014 that\u2019s a potentially very meaningful product in in lymphoma. Melexionis important. So it\u2019s very difficult to pick a favorite child here whenever there\u2019s such a wealth of opportunity in the late-stage pipeline. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the next wave of assets, which include some really exciting opportunities, including products like CD19, XT, ARLDD in prostate cancer as well as others.\n\nAnd by the way, I forgot to mention in the first wave of assets, LPA1, which is also a very fighting opportunity. So a plethora of potential catalysts that will be playing out over the next 24 months, and we look forward to seeing them then play out and going from there. So I think with that, we\u2019ll close today\u2019s call. I appreciate everyone staying on. I know we went a bit long, but hopefully, we\u2019re able to get to virtually all of the questions. Let\u2019s take a step back and maybe summarize where we are. Our priorities as a company, hopefully, you\u2019ve seen on this call are clear, we\u2019re focused on continuing to deliver very strong commercial execution and to deliver on the upcoming pipeline catalysts, some of which we just discussed. We\u2019re going to continue to have the ability to enhance value creation through business development and all the while maintaining strong financial flexibility.\n\nAs I look at 2024, we made very good progress. and I want to recognize our colleagues for all the hard work that they had last year. We continue to take decisive action to further rightsize our cost structure and invest in future growth. We believe these are important next steps in continuing to execute on the multiyear journey that we\u2019re on. And of course, we remain committed to our overarching goal, which is to reshape BMS to deliver top-tier growth by the end of the decade and most importantly, generate attractive returns for shareholders. So thanks again for tuning in today. And as always, the team is available for follow-ups. And have a good rest of the week.\n\nOperator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Bristol-Myers stock fell after earnings, but analysts remain bullish which suggests that any dip in the stock may create a buying opportunity\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nShares of The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY)are attempting to claw their way back into positive territory after the sharp post-earnings sell-off. The company beat on the top and bottom lines. However, the biopharmaceutical giant\u2019s cautious 2025 guidance had some investors heading for the exits. In midday trading, BMY stock isdown approximately 2%. However, the stock was down about 3.8% at the market open.\n\nEarly stock price movement is generally dictated by high-speed trading programs that are designed to move first and analyze second. The fact that BMY stock is off its lows and that it was a favorite of analysts before the earnings report suggests taking a minute to figure out what the earnings report showed and what it may mean for the stock.\n\nCurrent Results Point to Weaker Guidance\n\nBristol-Myers reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.67. That beat estimates of $1.47 by 13.6%. Revenue of #12.3 billion was also higher than the forecast of $11.57 billion. Full-year revenue of $48.26 billion was 7% higher than the $45.02 billion in 2023.\n\nMedical stocks, particularly in the healthcare sector, are the top performers in early 2025. However, the company\u2019s commentary on the results points to the fundamental issue that is troubling investors and analysts. That is, can the company\u2019s new products generate enough revenue to offset the declining sales in its legacy drugs?\n\nFor its part, Bristol-Myers is forecasting a decline in year-over-year (YOY) revenue of around 5$ to $45.5 billion. That\u2019s only slightly higher than $45.02 billion it generated in 2023. And the company\u2019s own forecasts show that the growth in revenue for drugs like Opdiva and Orencia are being more than offset as its legacy drugs face competition.\n\nUnderstanding the Two Parts of the Drug Company\u2019s Business\n\nLike many biopharmaceutical companies, Bristol-Myers' commercially available drugs are divided into a legacy portfolio and a growth portfolio. As the name suggests, its legacy portfolio is made up of drugs that have been around for years. However, that means they are now facing biosimilar (i.e. generic) competition.\n\nIn the case of Bristol-Myers, two of those drugs are Eliquis and Revlimid, which are #1 and #3, respectively, in contributing to the company\u2019s total revenue. Eliquis continues to show strength in the United States and contributes over 25% of the company\u2019s overall revenue, but revenue was down 1% internationally. However, the company is expecting its other legacy drugs, Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel and Abraxane, to face declining sales due to competition.\n\nThat said, the company\u2019s growth portfolio has at least a few years before some of its top names face biosimilar competition. But the company is counting on big things from Cobenfy, its new schizophrenia drug, is the first new treatment for the disease in 30 years. This has blockbuster potential, but it\u2019s still too early to tell.\n\nAnalysts Remain Bullish on BMY Stock\n\nBristol-Myers warned that it would post lighter year-over-year revenue for one of its legacy drugs, Revlimid, prior to earnings. Sure enough, the company reported a YOY decline, particularly in international sales. And the company\u2019s guidance suggests that trend will continue.\n\nThat points to the company\u2019s solid financials, which included $4.4 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter, bringing its total amount of cash on hand to $11.2 billion. Bristol-Myers also posted a full-year gross margin of approximately 71%.\n\nIt also suggests that this post-earnings move lower could be setting up a sharper move higher. And when you take that potential growth with the company\u2019s high-yield (4.2%) dividend, BMY may be a better opportunity than it seems.\n\nOverall short interest is low, but it was up more than 10% in the month before earnings. That was likely a response to BMY stock rising to its 52-week high. That could keep some pressure on the stock as it's precariously close to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). If it doesn\u2019t hold that, investors may want to see if the stock finds support around its 100-day SMA of around $55.60.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here",

Despite reporting earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, the company\u2019s disappointing forecast has left many scratching their heads. The stock is currently on shaky ground as concerns linger over its future performance.\n\nHowever, hope is glimmering on the horizon! Bristol Myers Squibb is touting a groundbreaking new class of schizophrenia medications that could drive substantial growth as early as 2025. This promising development paints a picture of potential recovery and expansion, igniting interest among those willing to delve deeper into the company\u2019s strategies.\n\nInvestors are now faced with a pivotal moment: Will they seize the opportunity or play it safe? The pharmaceutical landscape is notoriously unpredictable, yet innovations like these could redefine the game\u2019s rules and offer new avenues for profit.\n\nStay informed and vigilant as the market evolves. The takeaway? While the near-term outlook might be clouded, the potential for breakthrough advancements in mental health treatment may be the spark that revitalizes Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn the world of finance, timing is everything. Are you ready to act on the insights unfolding in this gripping story?\n\nUnlocking Potential: Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Strategic Innovations and Market Dynamics\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has become a focal point for investors, particularly in light of their strong earnings report, which surpassed analyst projections. Nevertheless, a disappointing forecast coupled with market uncertainties has sparked questions about the company\u2019s future. However, exciting developments in the company\u2019s pipeline, particularly their advancements in schizophrenia medications, signal a potential turnaround in the coming years.\n\nMarket Analysis and Trends\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is positioning itself within a competitive pharmaceutical landscape that is rapidly evolving. The focus on a new class of schizophrenia medications is not just a shot in the dark; it\u2019s part of a broader strategic shift aimed at tapping into the lucrative mental health market. The psychiatric medications market is projected to reach approximately $29.4 billion by 2022, and BMY aims to carve out a significant share of this growing sector.\n\nRecent Innovations and Use Cases\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is developing medications that represent a novel therapeutic class for schizophrenia\u2014a disorder that currently lacks sufficient treatment options for many patients. The anticipated launch in 2025 could place BMY at the forefront of addressing critical mental health needs. These medications may offer improved efficacy and fewer side effects, catering to patients who are often left behind by conventional treatments.\n\nKey Questions and Answers\n\n1. What factors contributed to Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s disappointing forecast despite strong earnings?\n\n\u2013 The forecast reflects concerns about upcoming patent expirations, particularly for key drugs, and competition from generic medications. While earnings rose, future revenue projections indicate potential declines that have led to investor skepticism.\n\n2. How significant is the new class of schizophrenia medications to BMY\u2019s growth prospects?\n\n\u2013 Very significant. Analysts believe that successful development and market launch could lead to a substantial increase in market share in the mental health segment, potentially offsetting losses from other products.\n\n3. What is the competitive landscape for mental health pharmaceuticals that BMY is entering?\n\n\u2013 The mental health pharmaceuticals market is filled with established players and emerging biotech firms. However, BMY\u2019s unique approach and innovative formulations in schizophrenia treatment could set them apart, offering a chance to gain a competitive edge.\n\nPricing and Specifications\n\nCurrently, specific pricing models for the new schizophrenia medications have not been disclosed. However, they are expected to be competitively priced to ensure accessibility while still providing a return on investment. The medications focus on novel mechanisms of action, which may also draw higher pricing tiers under Tier 1 prescriptions in insurance plans.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Bristol Myers Squibb navigates its current challenges, its commitment to research and development in the mental health space may serve as a lifeline. With the pharmaceutical market poised for growth, especially surrounding mental health issues, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s upcoming innovations could very well shape its future trajectory.\n\nStay tuned as developments unfold in this enthralling saga within the pharmaceutical industry. Will investors find confidence in BMY\u2019s innovative strategies, or will uncertainty continue to cloud the horizon?\n\nFor more insights on Bristol Myers Squibb, visit Bristol Myers Squibb.",

It first announced those cuts in April, and expanded on them with Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe company is preparing to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb issued full-year 2025 guidance that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, as some of the company's older drugs face competition from cheaper generics. That includes four drugs for different cancers: Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel and Abraxane.\n\nBristol Myers expects revenue to come in around $45.5 billion, which is below the $47.36 billion that analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting.\n\nThe company's revenue guidance also reflects an approximately $500 million expected negative impact from foreign exchange.\n\nThe drugmaker expects adjusted earnings per share of between $6.55 and $6.85. Analysts surveyed by LSEG expected adjusted earnings of $6.92 per share.\n\nDespite that outlook, Bristol Myers reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that blew past expectations, boosted by Eliquis and the company's so-called growth portfolio of drugs.\n\nHere is what Bristol Myers reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.67 adjusted vs. $1.46 expected\n\n$1.67 adjusted vs. $1.46 expected Revenue: $12.34 billion vs. $11.57 billion expected\n\nBristol Myers posted net income of $72 million, or 4 cents per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.\n\nExcluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 for the quarter.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant's revenue rose 8% from the same period a year ago to $12.34 billion.\n\nEliquis booked $3.2 billion in sales for the quarter, up 11% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.03 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount.\n\nThe blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.\n\nSales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a new negotiated price for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe second round of negotiations targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes Pomalyst, which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a cancer that develops in people with HIV.",

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic re-organization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cut costs by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe latest update comes as BMS approaches a loss of exclusivity for key assets Eliquis and Opdivo around 2028. Analysts wondered on a fourth quarter earnings call whether there might be additional cuts as this cliff approaches. Boerner could not guarantee this will be the last round of cost cuts but stated that this new round is an extension of what was done last year, after more cost savings were identified during the previous round of cuts.\n\n\u201cWe cataloged a number of opportunities for us to become a more agile company, to become more nimble and speedy in terms of how we operate and given where we are on that program, as well as where we are with respect to [loss of exclusivity],\u201d the CEO said on Thursday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe think it makes sense for us to capitalize on those opportunities now.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the loss of exclusivity period, Boerner pointed to growth products like Cobenfy, which was approved in September 2024 for schizophrenia. BMS is planning three Phase III trials of the asset, which was picked up in the $14 billion acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics at the end of 2023.\n\nThe company is also on the lookout for deals or partnerships to further build out the pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really focused on strengthening our position in the core therapeutic areas that we have today,\u201d Boerner said. \u201cWe need to like the science and feel that we\u2019re the rightful owners of it. The financials have to make sense.\u201d\n\nLiking the science was a one of the reasons the Karuna acquisition worked so well, Boerner said. The business development team considered multiple options but ultimately \u201czeroed in on the science that was coming out of Karuna as compelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic bullet with respect to how you approach business development from from our standpoint, but I think there were a few things that we did well with the Karuna acquisition that will frame how we continue to do business development,\u201d Boerner said.\n\nThe decision to buy Karuna wasn\u2019t taken lightly, and the team was careful with the shareholder dollars it was managing, he added. \u201cThe senior leadership team of the company owned the decision to move forward with that acquisition.\u201d The executives also took the time to get to know the Karuna leadership team to ensure they could take Cobenfy and develop it in ways the smaller company had not been capable of. But most of all, BMS conducted all this due diligence quickly.\n\nBMS CFO David Elkins said that the original cost savings program has realized $1.1 billion in savings to date, with $400 million to go. \u201cWe have entered 2025 with a stronger foundation to deliver on our long-term growth strategy,\u201d Elkins said.\n\nBMS recorded $12.3 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, an 8% increase and a beat on Leerink Partners\u2019 estimate of $11.6 billion. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) were 4 cents, while non-GAAP was $1.67. Full-year revenue rose 7% to $48.3 billion, with a GAAP EPS loss of $4.41, but non-GAAP was a gain of $1.15.\n\nThe revenue increases came from across BMS\u2019s portfolio, including legacy products like Eliquis and Revlimid and growth products like Opdivo, Yervoy and Reblozyl.\n\nThe company expects 2025 revenue to be around $45.5 billion, with non-GAAP EPS falling between $6.55 and $6.85.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to include additional details on the December 2023 Karuna acquisition.",

The company reported non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $3.4 billion, or $1.67 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $3.5 billion, or $1.70 per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER PRODUCT REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS ($ amounts in millions) Quarter Ended December\n\n31, 2024 % Change from Quarter\n\nEnded December 31,\n\n2023 % Change from\n\nQuarter Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023 Ex-F/X** U.S. Int'l(c) WW(d) U.S. Int'l(c) WW(d) Int'l(c) WW(d) Growth Portfolio Opdivo $ 1,423 $ 1,056 $ 2,479 2% 7% 4% 15% 7% Orencia 750 250 1,000 (1)% 9% 2% 15% 3% Yervoy 428 247 675 26% 9% 19% 15% 22% Reblozyl 445 102 547 65% 104% 71% 110% 72% Opdualag 233 21 254 25% >200% 34% >200% 34% Breyanzi 209 54 263 146% >200% 160% >200% 162% Camzyos 201 22 223 142% >200% 153% >200% 153% Zeposia 115 43 158 15% 30% 19% 33% 20% Abecma 59 46 105 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% Sotyktu 64 19 83 14% 171% 32% 171% 32% Krazati 36 3 39 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Augtyro 13 2 15 >200% N/A >200% N/A >200% Cobenfy 10 \u2014 10 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Other Growth Products(a) 186 326 512 13% 104% 58% 106% 59% Total Growth Portfolio 4,172 2,191 6,363 19% 24% 21% 31% 23% Legacy Portfolio Eliquis 2,221 974 3,195 19% (3)% 11% (2)% 11% Revlimid 1,169 170 1,339 (6)% (17)% (8)% (15)% (7)% Pomalyst/Imnovid 685 138 823 9% (48)% (8)% (47)% (7)% Sprycel 135 63 198 (67)% (45)% (62)% (41)% (61)% Abraxane 91 83 174 (48)% 17% (30)% 28% (26)% Other Legacy Products(b) 123 127 250 46% (14)% 8% (15)% 7% Total Legacy Portfolio 4,424 1,555 5,979 \u2014% (14)% (4)% (12)% (3)% Total Revenues $ 8,596 $ 3,746 $ 12,342 9% 5% 8% 9% 9%\n\n** See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\".

Growth Portfolio revenues were primarily due to higher demand for Reblozyl, Breyanzi, Camzyos, Yervoy and Opdualag.\n\nLegacy Portfolio\n\nRevenues for the Legacy Portfolio in the fourth quarter were $6.0 billion compared to $6.2 billion in the prior year period, representing a decline of 4% on a reported basis and 3% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts. Legacy Portfolio revenues were lower primarily due to the impact of generics on Sprycel, Revlimid, Abraxane and Pomalyst, partially offset by higher demand for Eliquis.\n\nPRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE\n\nNeuroscience\n\nCategory Asset Milestone Clinical &\n\nResearch CobenfyTM (xanomeline and trospium chloride) Long-term data from the Phase 3 EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5 trials evaluating Cobenfy in adults with schizophrenia showed that Cobenfy was generally well tolerated over 52 weeks, with continued improvements in symptoms and a side effect profile consistent with prior trials of the treatment in this indication.\n\nOncology\n\nCategory Asset Milestone Regulatory Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) + Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended approval of Opdivo + Yervoy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The recommendation is based on results of the Phase 3 CheckMate -9DW trial. The CHMP opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union. AugtyroTM (repotrectinib)* The EC approved Augtyro, a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as a treatment for adult patients with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced solid tumors expressing a NTRK gene fusion, and who have received a prior NTRK inhibitor, or have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor and treatment options not targeting NTRK provide limited clinical benefit, or have been exhausted. The approval is based on results from the TRIDENT-1 and CARE trials. *Approval received on January 13, 2025, and announced today by the company. Opdivo QvantigTM (nivolumab and hydaluronidase-nyhy) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Opdivo Qvantig injection for subcutaneous use in most previously approved adult, solid tumor Opdivo indications as monotherapy, monotherapy maintenance after completion of Opdivo plus Yervoy combination therapy, or in combination with chemotherapy or cabozantinib. The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 randomized, open-label CheckMate -67T trial. Opdivo + Yervoy The EC approved Opdivo plus Yervoy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The approval is based on results from the CheckMate -8HW trial. Clinical &\n\nResearch Opdivo + Yervoy Results from an analysis of the Phase 3 CheckMate -8HW trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy versus Opdivo monotherapy across all lines of therapy for microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient mCRC demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement at a median follow up of 47 months in the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review.\n\nHematology\n\nCategory Asset Milestone Clinical &\n\nResearch Breyanzi\u00ae (lisocabtagene maraleucel) Five-year overall survival data from the Phase 1 TRANSCEND NHL 001 study supported deep and durable responses of Breyanzi in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) with median overall survival (OS) of 27.5 months and an estimated OS rate at five years of 38 percent. Breyanzi continued to demonstrate an established safety profile with no new safety signals. In addition, new circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from the Phase 3 TRANSFORM study supported the superiority of Breyanzi to achieve deeper responses over the former standard of care in second-line LBCL. Regulatory Breyanzi The CHMP of the EMA recommended approval of Breyanzi for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received two or more prior lines of systemic therapy. The recommendation is based on data from the Phase 2 TRANSCEND FL study. The CHMP opinion will now be reviewed by the EC.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nCategory Asset Milestone Clinical & Research Camzyos\u00ae (mavacamten) In Europe, following an opinion from the CHMP of the EMA, Camzyos received a label update to reduce the frequency of required echocardiography monitoring once a patient treated for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is on a stable dose. In addition, the company is today announcing the receipt of an April Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date from the FDA in the same setting.\n\nImmunology\n\nCategory Asset Milestone Clinical & Research Sotyktu\u00ae (deucravacitinib) Results from the Phase 3 POETYK PsA-1 and POETYK PsA-2 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sotyktu in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met their primary endpoint, with a significantly greater proportion of Sotyktu-treated patients achieving at least a 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of disease after 16 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. In addition, both trials met secondary endpoints across PsA disease activity at Week 16. In both studies, Sotyktu was well-tolerated and demonstrated safety consistent with the established safety profile of Sotyktu observed in a Phase 2 PsA clinical trial and Phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis clinical trials.\n\nFULL-YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nAll comparisons are made versus the same period in 2023 unless otherwise stated.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb posted revenues of $48.3 billion, an increase of 7%, or 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts, primarily driven by the Growth Portfolio and higher demand for Eliquis , partially offset by the impact of generics on Sprycel, Revlimid and Abraxane . U.S. revenues increased 9% to $34.1 billion, primarily due to higher demand for the Growth Portfolio and Eliquis , partially offset by the impact of generics on Sprycel, Revlimid and Abraxane . International revenues increased 3% to $14.2 billion, or 8.0% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts, primarily due to demand for Growth Portfolio products, partially offset by the impact of generics within the Legacy Portfolio.\n\n, partially offset by the impact of generics on and . On a GAAP basis, gross margin decreased from 76.2% to 71.1%, primarily driven by intangible asset impairment charges and product mix. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin decreased from 76.6% to 75.3%, primarily due to product mix.\n\nOn a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 8% to $8.4 billion and 4% to $8.0 billion, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the timing of spend and the impact of recent acquisitions.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, research and development expenses increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions and IPRD impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, research and development expenses increased 7% to $9.8 billion, primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions.\n\nOn a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, Acquired IPRD increased from $913 million to $13.4 billion driven by a one-time Acquired IPRD charge from the Karuna asset acquisition and SystImmune collaboration. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, licensing income was $122 million during the year compared to $142 million in 2023.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased 2% to $8.9 billion, primarily due to lower amortization expense related to Revlimid , partially offset by the RayzeBio acquisition in 2024.\n\n, partially offset by the RayzeBio acquisition in 2024. On a GAAP basis, income tax expense was $554 million despite a pre-tax loss of $8.4 billion, primarily due to a $12.1 billion non-tax deductible charge for the Karuna acquisition. The 2023 GAAP effective tax rate was impacted by a non-U.S. tax ruling on statutory impairment deductibility, changes in tax reserves, valuation allowances, and IRS guidance on non-U.S. R&D expense deductibility. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate increased from 14.7% to 56.8%, primarily due to the non-tax deductible charge.\n\nThe company reported on a GAAP basis net loss attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $8.9 billion, or $(4.41) per share, compared to earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $8.0 billion, or $3.86 per share for the same period a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis the company reported net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $2.3 billion, or $1.15 per share, compared to earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $15.6 billion, or $7.51 per share for the same period a year ago. In addition to the non-GAAP drivers noted above, non-GAAP EPS was impacted by higher interest expense.\n\nFULL-YEAR PRODUCT REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS ($ amounts in millions) Year Ended December\n\n31, 2024 % Change from Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2023 % Change from\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023 Ex-F/X** U.S. Int'l(c) WW(d) U.S. Int'l(c) WW(d) Int'l(c) WW(d) Growth Portfolio Opdivo $ 5,350 $ 3,954 $ 9,304 2% 5% 3% 14% 7% Orencia 2,770 912 3,682 2% 2% 2% 10% 4% Yervoy 1,599 931 2,530 16% 8% 13% 15% 16% Reblozyl 1,444 329 1,773 80% 61% 76% 65% 77% Opdualag 870 58 928 41% >200% 48% >200% 48% Breyanzi 591 156 747 95% 156% 105% 162% 106% Camzyos 543 59 602 141% >200% 161% >200% 161% Zeposia 403 163 566 26% 42% 30% 42% 30% Abecma 242 164 406 (32)% 44% (14)% 47% (13)% Sotyktu 190 56 246 21% >200% 45% >200% 46% Krazati 118 8 126 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Augtyro 36 2 38 >200% N/A >200% N/A >200% Cobenfy 10 \u2014 10 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Other Growth Products(a) 674 931 1,605 9% 58% 33% 61% 34% Total Growth Portfolio 14,840 7,723 22,563 17% 16% 17% 24% 19% Legacy Portfolio Eliquis 9,631 3,702 13,333 14% (1)% 9% \u2014% 9% Revlimid 4,999 774 5,773 (4)% (14)% (5)% (11)% (5)% Pomalyst/Imnovid 2,695 850 3,545 15% (23)% 3% (22)% 3% Sprycel 983 303 1,286 (31)% (40)% (33)% (36)% (32)% Abraxane 541 334 875 (23)% 11% (13)% 25% (8)% Other Legacy Products(b) 416 509 925 25% (19)% (4)% (18)% (3)% Total Legacy Portfolio 19,265 6,472 25,737 4% (10)% \u2014% (8)% 1% Total Revenues $ 34,105 $ 14,195 $ 48,300 9% 3% 7% 8% 9%\n\n** See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\".

Growth Portfolio revenues were primarily driven by higher demand for Reblozyl, Breyanzi, Camzyos and Opdualag.\n\nLegacy Portfolio\n\nRevenues for the Legacy Portfolio remained relatively flat at $25.7 billion compared to $25.6 billion in the prior year period, and increased 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts. Legacy Portfolio revenues were primarily driven by higher demand for Eliquis, offset by the impact of generics on Sprycel, Revlimid, Abraxane and Pomalyst.\n\nUpdate on Strategic Productivity Initiative\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is expanding its existing strategic productivity initiative to include approximately $2 billion in additional annualized cost savings by the end of 2027.\n\nUnder this expanded initiative, savings will be driven by changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. These savings will be removed from our cost structure to contribute to a leaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science.\n\nFinancial Guidance\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is providing key 2025 non-GAAP line-item guidance assumptions as outlined below.\n\n\n\nWe estimate total revenues to be approximately $45.5 billion, reflecting, as previously expected, the near-term impact of generics across Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel and Abraxane, which we expect to result in a revenue decline of approximately 18-20% of the Legacy Portfolio. This is expected to be partially offset by the continued strength of our Growth Portfolio. This guidance also reflects an approximate $500 million expected negative impact to revenue due to foreign exchange.\n\n2025 Non-GAAP1 Line-Item Guidance Total Revenues\n\n(Reported & Ex-F/X) ~$45.5 billion Gross Margin % ~72% Operating Expenses2 ~$16 billion Other Income/(Expense) ~$30 million Tax Rate ~18% Diluted EPS $6.55-$6.85 1See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" 2Operating Expenses = MS&A and R&D, excluding Acquired IPRD and Amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n\nThe 2025 financial guidance excludes the impact of any potential future strategic acquisitions, divestitures, specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified, and the impact of future Acquired IPRD charges. To the extent we have quantified the impact of significant R&D charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, we may update this information from time to time on our website www.bms.com, in the \"Investors\" section. Non-GAAP guidance assumes current exchange rates. The financial guidance is subject to risks and uncertainties applicable to all forward-looking statements as described elsewhere in this press release.\n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP EPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of accelerated depreciation and impairment charges, legal and other settlements, gains and losses from equity investments and other adjustments. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.

The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management has evaluated the company\u2019s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented portray the results of the company's baseline performance, supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company\u2019s underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin, which is gross profit excluding certain specified items, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating margin, which is gross profit less marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses excluding certain specified items as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses, which is marketing, selling and administrative and research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, non-GAAP marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which is marketing, selling and administrative expenses excluding certain specified items, and non-GAAP research and development expenses, which is research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.\n\nThis earnings release and the accompanying tables also provide certain revenues and expenses, as well as non-GAAP measures, excluding the impact of foreign exchange (\"Ex-Fx\"). We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Ex-Fx financial measures are not accounted for according to GAAP because they remove the effects of currency movements from GAAP results.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business nor reflect the company\u2019s underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments, acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, divestiture gains or losses, stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments), income resulting from the change in control of the Nimbus Therapeutics TYK2 Program and amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from a non-U.S. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments and release of income tax reserves relating to the Celgene acquisition.\n\nBecause the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures presented in the press release that are prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and will also be available on the company\u2019s website at www.bms.com. Within the accompanying financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and EPS amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.\n\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP EPS, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of accelerated depreciation and impairment charges, legal and other settlements, gains and losses from equity investments and other adjustments. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.\n\nWebsite Information\n\nWe routinely post important information for investors on our website, BMS.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section. We may use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Such risks, uncertainties and other matters include, but are not limited to: increasing pricing pressures from market access, pharmaceutical pricing controls and discounting; market actions taken by private and government payers to manage drug utilization and contain costs; the company\u2019s ability to retain patent and market exclusivity for certain products; regulatory changes that result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse; changes under the 340B Drug Pricing Program; the company\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its product candidates; the possibility of difficulties and delays in product introduction and commercialization; increasing industry competition; potential difficulties, delays and disruptions in manufacturing, distribution or sale of products; the company\u2019s ability to identify potential strategic acquisitions, licensing opportunities or other beneficial transactions; failure to complete, or delays in completing, collaborations, acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions and the failure to achieve anticipated benefits from such transactions and actions; exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions or investigations; the impact of any healthcare reform and legislation or regulatory action in the United States and international markets; increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products; the failure of the company\u2019s suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations; the impact of counterfeit or unregistered versions of the company\u2019s products and from stolen products; product label changes or other measures that could result in declining sales; safety or efficacy concerns regarding the company\u2019s products or any product in the same class as the company\u2019s products; the risk of cyber-attacks and unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential data; the company\u2019s ability to execute its financial, strategic and operational plans; the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel; the impact of the company\u2019s significant indebtedness; political and financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, credit and foreign exchange risk management; risks relating to the use of social media platforms; issuance of new or revised accounting standards; and risks relating to public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.\n\nForward-looking statements in this earnings release should be evaluated together with the many risks and uncertainties that affect the company\u2019s business and market, particularly those identified in the cautionary statement and risk factors discussion in the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by the company\u2019s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document and except as otherwise required by applicable law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\nBRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (Unaudited, dollars and shares in millions except per share data) Three Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net product sales $ 11,811 $ 11,168 $ 46,778 $ 43,778 Alliance and other revenues 531 309 1,522 1,228 Total Revenues 12,342 11,477 48,300 45,006 Cost of products sold(a) 4,812 2,745 13,968 10,693 Marketing, selling and administrative 2,136 2,073 8,414 7,772 Research and development 3,191 2,478 11,159 9,299 Acquired IPRD 30 600 13,373 913 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1,693 2,278 8,872 9,047 Other (income)/expense, net 305 (371 ) 893 (1,158 ) Total Expenses 12,167 9,803 56,679 36,566 (Loss)/Earnings Before Income Taxes 175 1,674 (8,379 ) 8,440 Provision for Income Taxes 99 (88 ) 554 400 Net (Loss)/Earnings 76 1,762 (8,933 ) 8,040 Noncontrolling Interest 4 \u2014 15 15 Net (Loss)/Earnings Attributable to BMS $ 72 $ 1,762 $ (8,948 ) $ 8,025 Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding: Basic 2,029 2,027 2,027 2,069 Diluted 2,037 2,033 2,027 2,078 (Loss)/Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.04 $ 0.87 $ (4.41 ) $ 3.88 Diluted 0.04 0.87 (4.41 ) 3.86 Other (income)/expense, net Interest expense(b) $ 496 $ 316 $ 1,947 $ 1,166 Royalty income - divestitures (284 ) (239 ) (1,104 ) (862 ) Royalty and licensing income (204 ) (420 ) (736 ) (1,488 ) Provision for restructuring 77 44 635 365 Investment income (114 ) (145 ) (478 ) (449 ) Integration expenses 70 62 284 242 Litigation and other settlements 13 3 84 (390 ) Acquisition expense \u2014 32 50 32 Intangible asset impairments \u2014 \u2014 47 29 Equity investment (gains)/losses 205 (53 ) (16 ) 160 Divestiture losses 10 \u2014 15 \u2014 Other 36 29 165 37 Other (income)/expense, net $ 305 $ (371 ) $ 893 $ (1,158 ) (a) Excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is expanding its plan to cut costs, announcing alongside quarterly earnings on Thursday that it will slash an additional $2 billion in annual expenses by the end of 2027.\n\nThe announcement builds on cutbacks Bristol Myers announced last April and that affected about 2,200 employees. Bristol Myers didn\u2019t say how many workers will be impacted by the new initiative, but Chief Financial Officer David Elkins told analysts on a conference call that cuts will drive \u201coperational efficiencies across multiple areas of the business.\u201d\n\nBristol Myers is already facing limited generic competition for one of its highest-grossing products, the multiple myeloma drug Revlimid. But it\u2019s also bracing for the loss of billions in yearly revenue when patents expire for its cancer immunotherapy Opdivo and blood thinner Eliquis. The planned cuts announced Thursday will help Bristol Myers become a \u201cleaner, more focused company\u201d along the way, CEO Chris Boerner said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBristol Myers delivered both good and bad news on Thursday.\n\nOn one hand, the company\u2019s fourth quarter results and earnings per share topped analysts\u2019 estimates, as several products \u2014 from Eliquis to heart drug Camzyos and anti-inflammatory treatment Sotyktu \u2014 topped consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts.\n\nOn the other, though, its forecast of $45.5 billion in 2025 revenue missed analyst projections by almost $1 billion and would represent a roughly 6% decline from its 2024 total. That projection reflects the impact Bristol Myers expects generic competition to have across \u201cmultiple products\u201d this year, Boerner said. And that impact will grow once Eliquis and Opdivo \u2014 which generated nearly $26 billion in worldwide revenue combined last year \u2014 lose market exclusivity, too.\n\nThe lower-than-expected guidance numbers \u201ctarnished\u201d what was otherwise a \u201cstrong quarter,\u201d wrote Edward Jones analyst John Boylan.\n\nBristol Myers has been turning to deals to prepare for those losses, among them buyouts of RayzeBio, Mirati Therapeutics and Karuna Therapeutics. Those acquisitions have yielded prospects for cancer and neurological conditions, and Karuna\u2019s medicine, Cobenfy, has already gotten off to a strong start. Revenue from its \u201cgrowth portfolio,\u201d which includes newer medicines like Camzyos, the cell therapy Breyanzi and immunotherapy Opdualag, grew by about 21% in 2024 as well, according to its earnings presentation.\n\nYet the company is also cutting expenses. The company lowered annual costs by about $1.1 billion of its $1.5 billion target last year. But it did so while mainly reinvesting those savings into the company, CFO Elkins said. The new cuts, by contrast, will \u201cdrop to the bottom line,\u201d he added.\n\nHalf of the $2 billion in cuts are expected to occur this year, with the remainder coming by the end of 2027, he said.",

            "content": "Bristol Myers walloped fourth-quarter sales views Thursday, but Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) stock took a hit on a light outlook hamstrung by generic competition.\n\nFor the year, the drugmaker expects to earn an adjusted $6.55 to $6.85 per share. That high end of the guidance missed analysts' call for $6.91. Similarly, Bristol Myers forecast $45.5 billion in sales, which lagged the Street's $46.29 billion projection.\n\n\"This was a strong quarter, tarnished by lower-than-expected guidance due to generic competition as well as the negative effect of foreign currency,\" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in a report. \"We believe that Bristol being cautious this early in the year also played a role in guidance.\"\n\nBristol Myers Squibb stock toppled 3.8%, closing at 57.42. Shares broke out of a flat base after topping a buy point at 61.08 on Jan. 27, according to MarketSurge. But the stock has since fallen back below that entry.\n\nBristol Myers Stock: Sales, Profit Handily Beat\n\nIn total, Bristol Myers earned $1.67 per share, minus some items, on $12.34 billion in fourth-quarter sales. Earnings dipped 2% but easily beat forecasts for $1.46 per share, according to FactSet. Sales rose 8% \u2014 or 9% when excluding exchange rates \u2014 and topped calls for $11.57 billion.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Matt Phipps noted the beat was primarily driven by legacy drugs Revlimid and Eliquis. Revlimid is a cancer treatment, while Eliquis is a blood thinner.\n\nBut, among the newer drugs, Bristol Myers notched sales beats for Reblozyl, Breyanzi, Sotyktu and Camzyos. Reblozyl treats anemia in specific patients. Breyanzi is a cancer drug, Sotyktu treats psoriasis and Camzyos treats a heart condition.\n\nLeerink Partners analyst David Risinger noted Abecma and Abraxane sales came in light. Abecma, a multiple myeloma treatment, brought in $105 million in sales and was roughly 14% below projections. Abraxane, a chemotherapy drug, generated $174 million in sales, but missed forecasts by 4%.\n\nHe kept his outperform rating on Bristol Myers Squibb stock.\n\nAll Eyes On Cobenfy\n\nAnalysts are also closely watching Cobenfy, Bristol's new schizophrenia drug courtesy of the company's $14 billion takeover of Karuna Therapeutics.\n\nCobenfy, which is approved in the U.S., brought in $10 million in sales during its first full quarter on the market.\n\nThe company is also testing Cobenfy in patients with Alzheimer's psychosis and as an added treatment for patients already taking a schizophrenia drug.\n\n\"How important are these for the long-term potential of the franchise?\" William Blair's Phipps asked.\n\nHe has a market perform rating on Bristol Myers Squibb stock.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nNovo Surges As Ozempic Drives Fourth-Quarter Beat.

            "content": "The branded pharmaceutical industry relies on a high-cost, high-reward business model, driven by substantial investments in research and development to create innovative, patent-protected drugs. Successful products can generate significant revenue streams over their patent life, and the larger a roster of drugs, the stronger a moat a company enjoys. However, the business model is inherently risky, with high failure rates during clinical trials, lengthy regulatory approval processes, and intense competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers once patents expire. These challenges, combined with scrutiny over drug pricing, create a complex operating environment. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned for tailwinds from advancements in precision medicine, increasing adoption of AI to enhance drug development efficiency, and growing global demand for treatments addressing chronic and rare diseases. However, headwinds include heightened regulatory scrutiny, pricing pressures from governments and insurers, and the looming patent cliffs for key blockbuster drugs. Patent cliffs bring about competition from generics, forcing branded pharmaceutical companies back to the drawing board to find the next big thing.\n\n\u201cWe made good progress in 2024, which was capped by a fourth quarter of strong topline growth driven by key products and important pipeline advancements. We also achieved the landmark U.S. approval of Cobenfy last year for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, and we expect this medicine to have a meaningful impact on patients and the company as a new growth driver,\u201d said Christopher Boerner, Ph.D., board chair and chief executive officer, Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nOperating Margin: 1.4%, down from 11.4% in the same quarter last year\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $6.70 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 3.1%\n\nManagement\u2019s revenue guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $45.5 billion at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 1.7% and implying -5.8% growth (vs 7.3% in FY2024)\n\nIs now the time to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb? Find out in our full research report .\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q4 CY2024, with sales up 7.5% year on year to $12.34 billion. On the other hand, the company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $45.5 billion at the midpoint came in 1.7% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.67 per share was 13.8% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s sales grew at a solid 13.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Quarterly Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 2.3% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segment, Growth Portfolio. Over the last two years, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Growth Portfolio revenue averaged 18.1% year-on-year growth. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company\u2019s performance.\n\nThis quarter, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported year-on-year revenue growth of 7.5%, and its $12.34 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.6%.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 4.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a healthcare business, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 33.6%.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 40.5 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 39.1 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows operating expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP)\n\nin line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\n\nSadly for Bristol-Myers Squibb, its EPS declined by 24.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 13.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s adjusted operating margin declined by 40.5 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 6.2%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nIn Q4, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported EPS at $1.67, down from $1.70 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.13 to grow 514%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nWe liked that Bristol-Myers Squibb beat analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and EPS this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed significantly and its full-year revenue guidance also fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates, and this weighed on shares. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 4.2% to $57.19 immediately after reporting.\n\nShould you buy the stock or not?

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.67 outperformed the anticipated $1.46 while Q4 revenue surged to $12.3 billion, surpassing the estimate of $11.57 billion.\n\nThe quarter's results, reaffirmed Bristol Myers Squibb's financial health and strategic focus despite ongoing competition from generics manufacturers impacting its legacy portfolio of drugs.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) Adjusted EPS $1.67 $1.46 $1.70 (1.8%) Revenue $12.34 billion $11.57 billion $11.48 billion 6.9% Adj. gross margin 74% N/A 76.4% (2.4 pps) Adj. R&D expenses $2.8 billion N/A $2.5 billion 12.6%\n\nOverview of Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is a prominent entity in the biopharmaceutical sector, concentrating on innovative medicines that meet unmet medical needs across oncology, cardiovascular, and immunology domains. Recently, it has intensely focused on expanding its product portfolio and securing market exclusivity through strategic R&D efforts. Key success factors encompass advances in its product pipeline, managing patent expirations, and strategic collaborations.\n\nCore to its strategy, Bristol Myers Squibb actively invests in the development of new molecular entities, alongside strategically acquiring companies to amplify its R&D capabilities. This approach nurtures its position in highly competitive sectors, ensuring ongoing innovation to stay at the forefront of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nQuarterly Highlights and Developments\n\nThroughout the quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb reported notable financial and operational achievements. Its Growth Portfolio revenue increased significantly by 21%, reaching $6.4 billion. This surge was driven by strong demand for key drugs such as Reblozyl, Breyanzi, and Camzyos, which saw respective growth of 71%, 125%, and 101% year over year. Meanwhile, the Legacy Portfolio faced challenges, with a 4% decline as generic competition impacted products like Sprycel and Revlimid, though Eliquis cushioned these effects with its 11% growth.\n\nThe company celebrated significant milestones in its product pipeline, notably the FDA approval of Cobenfy and the promising regulatory path of Opdivo-related treatments. These achievements underscore Bristol Myers Squibb's commitment to advancing its pipeline in therapeutic areas with significant unmet needs. Furthermore, GAAP gross margin fell due to intangible asset impairments but maintained a strong non-GAAP margin of 74%.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb continues to make strides in strategic initiatives to secure long-term growth. It aims for $2 billion in savings by 2027, optimizing its operational efficiency. Additionally, it remains committed to its robust R&D investment strategy, with a 29% increase in its GAAP R&D expenses in Q4, highlighting its growth-focused trajectory.\n\nOutlook for the Future\n\nFor 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb projects revenue of roughly $45.5 billion, with a non-GAAP EPS between $6.55 and $6.85. Those estimates came in below analysts' consensus projections of a profit of $6.91 per share and $46.29 billion in sales. Management's strategic emphasis remains on mitigating legacy portfolio declines and leveraging the growth potential of newer assets. The company anticipates notable impacts from generic competitors, but strong performances from its growth portfolio are expected to offset these pressures.\n\nGiven the recent developments, investors are encouraged to focus on Bristol Myers Squibb's progress in expanding its product line and pipeline advancements. The management's priority on strategic investments and operational efficiency remains crucial for ongoing competitive success. Key areas to watch include regulatory updates and further pipeline advancements, crucial for sustaining growth in the coming quarters.",

            "content": "BMS-986354 contains the same CAR construct present in orva-cel, with an anti-BCMA domain, a CD8 transmembrane domain, 4-1BB costimulatory domain and CD3-z signaling domain [10], but BMS-986354 is manufactured using the proprietary NEX-T\u00ae process. The manufacturing process involves selection of CD8+ and CD4 + T cells from the processed apheresis material followed by activation in cytokine enriched culture media. The activated T cells are transduced with BCMA lentivirus and are minimally expanded until harvest, followed by formulation and cryopreservation. The harvest duration leveraging shortened ex-vivo expansion for the NEX-T\u00ae process was determined by balancing robustness of the CAR expression and increased proportion of less differentiated T cells that demonstrated increased in vitro proliferative potential and cytolytic activity.\n\nStudy design\n\nThis was a phase I, multi-center, open label study, performed in two parts consisting of dose escalation and dose expansion. The primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability of increasing doses of BMS-986354 and obtain the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The secondary and exploratory objectives were to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary efficacy at the RP2D dose based on overall response rate (ORR) and rates of CR/sCR according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria [11]. In addition, planned exploratory analysis also included and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile including immunophenotypic characterization of BMS-986354 clinical drug product performance.\n\nIn Part A, 3 dose levels (DL) of BMS-986354 were investigated: 20 (DL1), 40 (DL2) and 80 (DL3) x 106 CAR + T cells. At each DL, the study intended to treat a minimum of 3 participants monitored for at least 28 days prior to adjudication of the safety profile of the respective DL. Dose escalation and de-escalation was determined by a Bayesian modified Toxicity Probability Interval 2 (mTPI-2) [12] algorithm with a target dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 30% and an equivalence interval of 25% to 35%.\n\nParticipants were 18 years of age or older, had diagnosis of RRMM with confirmed progression during or within 12 months of last therapy or with no response and confirmed progression within the previous 6 months to most recent anti-myeloma treatment. Participants were required to have prior treatment with at least 3 distinct regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) unless ineligible. They were also required to have measurable disease with serum M-protein \u22650.5 g/dL and/or urine M-protein \u2265200 mg/24-hour, or involved serum free light chain \u2265 10 mg/dL with abnormal kappa/lambda ratio. Additionally, participants had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, absolute neutrophil count \u2265 \u00d7 109/L, platelet count \u2265 50 \u00d7109/L, creatinine clearance \u2265 60 ml/min and adequate cardiac and hepatic function among other inclusion criteria. The study excluded participants with known active or history of central nervous system involvement by MM, prior CAR T cell or another genetically modified T cell therapy, and prior therapy directed at BCMA.\n\nEligible participants underwent leukapheresis for collection of autologous T cells for product manufacturing. Participants received optional bridging therapy during the manufacturing period utilizing standard anti-myeloma drugs or combinations. Participants subsequently received lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2/day intravenously for 3 consecutive days, ending at least 2 (and a maximum of 9) days prior to infusion of BMS-986354. All participants were hospitalized for the first 14 days after BMS-986354 infusion and subsequently followed for 2 years for monitoring of toxicity and efficacy. After 2 years, participants were asked to participate in a long term follow up study (Study GC-LTFU-001).\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) was graded according to criteria defined by Lee [13]. Other toxicities were graded utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0.\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate\n\nThe study was conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs). The protocol was approved by the respective Institutional Review Board or ethics committee at each of the 10 participating institutions (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL; Mount Sinai Health System, New York, NY; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, AZ; Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC; UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY; all in the USA). All subjects provided documented informed consent. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) periodically reviews data to ensure safety, scientific validity and integrity of the study. The decision regarding dose escalation or de-escalation was made by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) composed by investigators in collaboration with the Sponsor. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as study NCT04394650.\n\nStatistics\n\nThe study population consists of eligible participants infused with a conforming BMS-986354 product. Data are presented descriptively for each cohort in part A and for the expansion cohort in part B. Rates are described with 95% C.I. based on the exact binomial distribution. Secondary endpoints of duration of response (DOR), and PFS were analyzed utilizing the Kaplan-Meier method. The data cutoff for this analysis was June 16, 2023.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nThe vector copy number (VCN) was determined by a validated Digital Droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) method to detect lentivirus gag sequence in a matrix of human genomic DNA, isolated from whole blood. The preliminary summary results at data cutoff of June 16, 2023, by dose level are presented as transgene copies per microgram of genomic DNA. Exposure at data cutoff of August 7, 2022, was also assessed by an exploratory method known as flow cytometry. PK parameters derived from results by flow cytometry such as Area Under the Curve from 0 to 28 days AUC 0-28d , Maximum Concentration (C max ), and Time to Maximum Concentration (T max ) were calculated using non-compartmental analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin 8.3).\n\nDrug product characterization\n\nThe memory phenotyping method is a flow based analytical method used to characterize the T cell memory composition and overall differentiation profile of the drug product by quantifying frequencies of bivariate populations including the following: CCR7 + CD45RA + , CCR7 + CD45RA-, CCR7-CD45RA-, and CCR7- CD45RA + .\n\nThe functionality of the drug product is assessed using the bulk cytokine release method, a multiplex assay that allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes in a single sample. The drug product is co-cultured overnight with the MM.1S cell line, which express BCMA endogenously. Upon incubation with the antigen-specific stimulated drug product, analytes/cytokines present will bind to their capture antibody and can be detected upon addition of a fluorescently labelled detection antibody. The reported concentration of each analyte in the test sample is determined relative to a standard curve generated with assay standards.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other best wide moat stocks to invest in.\n\nRussell Investments continues to monitor and analyze the potential for policy changes in President Trump\u2019s second term in office. In December 2024, the North American Chief Investment Strategist noted 4 areas of focus- i.e., tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy, and deregulation. Let us see what impact tariffs can have on the broader US economy and what should investors do in these uncertain circumstances.\n\nImpact of Tariffs on US\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the macroeconomic uncertainty is expected to continue to remain elevated in the near term, while the investors keenly wait to see whether the tariffs get scrapped after the 30-day period. To give a brief context, the US President announced that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have decided to delay the imposition of these tariffs for 30 days. Notably, Trump also announced that he has delayed the imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods for 30 days.\n\nIf tariffs get implemented, there can be a modest one-time increase in price levels for US consumers, says the investment firm. This might push out marginally when inflation will return to the target range of 2%. However, in the base-case scenario, the firm expects that the US Fed will succeed in returning inflation to 2%. From a growth perspective, while the tariffs might create a modest drag on the US economic activity, the broader economy is expected to avoid a recession.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nWhat Should Be the Strategy for Investors?\n\nSaxo Bank A/S believes that investors are required to ignore the noise and remain focused on fundamentals. While short-term volatility remains inevitable, investors need to prioritize long-term growth trends over reactionary trades. Therefore, investing in quality companies having strong domestic revenue, pricing power, and resilient business models is expected to withstand such headwinds. The bank believes that investing in high dividend-paying stocks in defensive sectors such as consumer staples might help mitigate the short-term negative impacts. Furthermore, the focus can be on secular growth themes that have the potential to transcend political cycles.\n\nElsewhere, Russell Investments opines that investors can benefit from staying disciplined during uncertain times. While the tariffs can adversely impact the broader economic growth, mainly in Mexico and Canada, there is a possibility of central banks and governments stepping in with support to mitigate the impacts of tariffs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Invest In, we scanned through VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF and some online rankings. Next, we chose the stocks that were popular among hedge funds.

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

It delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 37.57%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 4.67%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for these companies ahead of their earnings announcements.\n\nPer the Earnings Trends report, as of Jan 29, 12.3% of the companies in the Medical sector \u2014 representing 30.8% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 reported quarterly earnings. Of these, 85.7% beat on earnings, while 57.1% beat on revenues. Earnings increased 1.4% year over year, while revenues grew 6.6%. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to increase 12.5% year over year, while revenues are likely to grow 8.6%.\n\nPer the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry falls under the broader Medical sector, comprising pharma/biotech and generic companies, and medical device companies.\n\nThe fourth-quarter earnings season for the drug and biotech sector will be in full swing this week with many large drugmakers like \u2014 Merck , Pfizer , Eli Lilly and Co. , Amgen and Bristol Myers Squibb \u2014 due to announce results. Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie have already reported with both beating estimates for both earnings and sales. French drugmaker Sanofi came out with disappointing fourth-quarter results as it missed estimates for both earnings and sales.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 4, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Merck MRK, Pfizer PFE, Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, Amgen AMGN and Bristol Myers Squibb BMY.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMerck\u2019s top-line growth in the fourth quarter is likely to have been driven by blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, like in several previous quarters, aided by additional indications and patient demand. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 4, before market open.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. price-eps-surprise | Merck & Co., Inc. Quote\n\nPfizer\n\nPFE\u2019s performance has been solid, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters. It delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 74.50%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 65.62%.\n\nPFE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for the fourth quarter is pegged at $17.50 billion and 48 cents per share, respectively.\n\nThough sales of Pfizer\u2019s COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, declined in the past few quarters, it seems that sales have stabilized somewhat. The company\u2019s non-COVID operational revenues have been driving its top-line growth, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches like Abrysvo and newly acquired products like Nurtec, as well as those acquired from Seagen (December 2023). PFE is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 4, before the opening bell.\n\nPfizer Inc. price-eps-surprise | Pfizer Inc. Quote\n\nEli Lilly and Company\n\nLLY\u2019s performance has been mixed, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in three of the trailing four quarters and missing the same on the remaining occasion. It delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.23%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 22.37%.\n\nLilly has an Earnings ESP of -2.08% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for the fourth quarter is pegged at $13.48 billion and $5.15 per share, respectively.\n\nIn mid-January, Lilly lowered its sales guidance for full-year 2024 and announced disappointing preliminary sales numbers for the fourth quarter. Lilly expects revenues to be approximately $45.0 billion in full-year 2024, which falls short of its previous guidance range of $45.4 billion to $46.0 billion.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenues are expected to be approximately $13.5 billion, shy of the consensus estimate due to lower-than-expected sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nHigher demand and volume growth for LLY\u2019s key growth drugs like Emgality, Olumiant, Retevmo, Taltz and Verzenio are likely to have provided top-line support in the fourth quarter, driven by increased demand trends. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 6, before market open.\n\nEli Lilly and Company price-eps-surprise | Eli Lilly and Company Quote\n\nAmgen\n\nAMGN\u2019s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.20%.\n\nAMGN has an Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a Zacks Rank #3, indicating a likely earnings beat this time around. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for the fourth quarter is pegged at $8.86 billion and $5.03 per share, respectively.\n\nAmgen\u2019s product sales in the fourth quarter are expected to have been driven by strong volume growth of Evenity, Repatha, Prolia, Kyprolis and Blincyto, among others. However, prices of most products declined due to higher rebates to support expanded access. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 4, after market close.\n\nAmgen Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amgen Inc. Quote\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nBMY\u2019s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.54%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 20.81%.\n\nBMY has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #3, indicating a likely earnings beat this time around. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for the fourth quarter is pegged at $11.56 billion and $1.46 per share, respectively.\n\nConsistent label expansions in newer metastatic and adjuvant indications are likely to have maintained momentum for the blockbuster immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in the fourth quarter.\n\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter are likely to have increased on the back of growth in product franchise sales. Its growth portfolio primarily comprises sales from immuno-oncology drugs like Opdivo, Orencia, Yervoy, Reblozyl, Opdualag, Abecma, Zeposia, Breyanzi, Camzyos, Sotyku, Krazati and others.

            "content": "Tim Anderson, an analyst from Bank of America Securities, reiterated the Hold rating on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY \u2013 Research Report). The associated price target is $63.00.\n\nTim Anderson has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors influencing Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s (BMY) financial outlook. Firstly, there have been slight reductions in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for the coming years, driven by updated foreign exchange assumptions, changes at the product level, and considerations for pricing erosion related to the Inflation Reduction Act. These adjustments reflect a cautious stance on the company\u2019s near-term growth prospects.\n\nAdditionally, while BMY remains relatively inexpensive compared to its peers in large-cap biopharma, its valuation has approached that of similar companies following a significant stock price increase. The anticipated ongoing earnings decline due to generic competition also tempers expectations for substantial upside in the near future. Thus, Anderson maintains a Neutral rating with a price objective of $63, implying limited upside potential from the current price level.\n\nIn another report released on January 28, Citi also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $65.00 price target.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 30 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is neutral on the stock.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 15 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the upcoming market and corporate activity to look forward to this week, which will be dominated by earnings reports from various companies and an important inflation report from the Labor Department.\n\nCramer noted that Friday marked the heavy market focus on the prospect of the White House imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. As expected, the tariffs were announced, 25% from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, and the market, which had already been struggling, dropped further.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks\n\nCramer noted that the Dow plunged by 337 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Nasdaq declined by 0.28%. Adding fuel to the fire, President Trump later commented that he was \"not concerned about the market's reaction.\" Cramer, reflecting on this, wished he could share that same sense of ease. He added:\n\n\u201cFinally, on Friday, we get the Labor Department's non-farm payroll and right now the Fed is concerned that the economy might be running too hot. If we get robust job growth with higher wages, then I doubt we'll see any rate hikes in the first half of the year.\u201d\n\nHe then posed the question: if investors are hoping for a rising stock market, what would they want to see? Cramer explained that a job report that\u2019s just \"so-so\" would be ideal, strong enough to keep rate cuts on the table, but not so strong as to hinder quarterly earnings.\n\n\u201cBottom line: When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands because there's just too much data for any individual to process even for an AI-powered individual. By the way, oh, let's just throw in this DeepSeek stuff, which has made tech too maddening to buy or sell and too, let's say boring. So if in doubt, do nothing.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 31. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "If there were an official hierarchy of qualities that dividend seekers should consider before investing in a stock, a company's underlying business would almost certainly come ahead of its yield. However, the two aren't mutually exclusive. Some excellent, highly profitable corporations offer both a higher-than-average yield and a business that can sustain a dividend program for a long time.\n\nSuch companies can be wonderful options for income-seeking investments. If you're in the market for that combo, let's consider two healthcare companies that fit the bill: Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.85%) and Novartis (NVS 0.58%).\n\n1. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is a leading drugmaker with a large portfolio of medicines, with more than half a dozen each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. Though the company is especially prominent in the oncology market, its lineup features drugs in several other therapeutic areas, including immunology and rare diseases.\n\nThe company recently went through a period of slow revenue growth following a significant patent cliff, but the company has since bounced back. In the third quarter, the drugmaker's top line increased by a healthy 8% year over year to $11.9 billion.\n\nSome of its older products are still performing well. That list includes anticoagulant Eliquis, whose sales for the period increased by 11% year over year to $3 billion. However, the drugmaker has a portfolio of newer medicines that are slowly but surely making a larger impact on the company's financial results.\n\nPerhaps the most promising is Reblozyl, a medicine used to treat anemia in patients with beta-thalassemia. In the third quarter, Reblozyl's revenue was $447 million, 80% higher than the year-ago period. Reblozyl was first approved in the U.S. in 2019, and should help drive top-line growth for many more years.\n\nThis and other newer products should help Bristol Myers Squibb overcome more upcoming patent cliffs, including the one for Eliquis, which should be out of exclusivity by the end of the decade. It will be a massive loss, but the company is showing that it can handle these challenges. Many of its newer products will earn label expansions. The company will also launch more brand-new medicines, allowing it to continue delivering strong financial results and maintain its dividend program.\n\nThe stock's forward yield is about 4.2% -- compare that to the S&P 500's 1.3% -- while the company has increased its payouts by just under 38% in the past five years. Bristol Myers Squibb might not be the flashiest stock on the market, but it is a good pick for dividend investors.\n\n2. Novartis\n\nNovartis is another pharmaceutical leader with a deep product portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, 11 of its medicines had already generated more than $1 billion in sales for 2024, with most of these moving in the right direction.\n\nNovartis' top-selling drug is Entresto, a legacy medicine for heart failure whose sales in the third quarter increased by 26% year over year to $1.9 billion. Cosentyx, a drug for plaque psoriasis, came in second place with revenue of $1.7 billion, 27% higher than the prior-year quarter. The company's total sales increased to $12.8 billion, 9% higher than the year-ago period.\n\nCosentyx will soon see its U.S. patent expire, but Novartis does have newer medicines that should help drive top-line growth. These include Fabhalta, a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (a rare blood disease) that first earned the green light in December 2023. Last year, it won a label expansion for IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease). While Fabhalta only generated $44 million in the third quarter, it's still in the early innings of its commercial life and will earn more approvals, including in other countries.\n\nFabhalta alone won't replace Cosentyx, but Novartis' pipeline features 105 programs, including some brand-new medicines. So Novartis has a strong underlying business, which has allowed it to increase its dividend for the past 27 years straight. The company's forward yield is now about 3.7%, while it boasts a reasonable cash payout ratio just under 62%. This healthcare leader can provide both stability and regular income to risk-averse investors.",

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

It\u2019s worth noting that the annual earnings estimate has taken a massive hit due to acquisition-related expenses in 2024.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBMY\u2019s Earnings Surprise History\n\nBMY has an excellent track record. Its earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 15.54%. In the previously reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings beat estimates by 20.81%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Our Model Predicts for BMY\n\nPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\n\nEarnings ESP for BMY is +0.43%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nFactors Influencing BMY\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nTotal quarterly revenues are likely to have increased on the back of growth in product franchise sales. Growth portfolio primarily comprises sales from immuno-oncology drugs like Opdivo, Orencia, Yervoy, Reblozyl, Opdualag, Abecma, Zeposia, Breyanzi, Camzyos, Sotyku, Krazati and others.\n\nConsistent label expansions in newer metastatic and adjuvant indications have likely maintained momentum for immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in the fourth quarter. Management expects full-year 2024 sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Opdivo sales in the fourth quarter are pegged at $2.5 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Orencia sales are pegged at $966 million and $945 million, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Yervoy sales are pegged at $632 million and $590 million, respectively.\n\nReblozyl posted solid growth in both the United States and international markets in the last reported quarter. Sales in the United States are being driven by strong demand due to a broad label in the country's first-line setting.\n\nWe note that the FDA had earlier approved Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) as a first-line treatment for anemia in adults with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who may require transfusions. International sales growth, driven by reimbursement in Europe and Japan, has also likely boosted sales of this drug in the fourth quarter.",

            "content": "In the world of life sciences, deal flow often serves as a barometer for emerging trends.\n\nThe recent acquisitions by pharmaceutical giants Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb, worth a combined $28billion, highlight the growing interest in mental health treatment.\n\nThis sector, valued at $448billion globally by research firm IMARC, is rapidly evolving as new alternatives emerge to address the limitations of traditional blockbuster drugs.\n\nAmong the most promising developments within the sector are treatments targeting addiction, alcohol abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nThese conditions, which have long resisted conventional therapies, are now the focus of a new generation of biotech companies seeking to create more effective solutions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Solvonis Therapeutics has emerged as a player in the 'neuro-psych' space.\n\nTakeovers: The recent acquisitions by pharmaceutical giants Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb highlight the growing interest in mental health treatment\n\nPreviously known as Graft Polymer, the company has undergone a complete corporate transformation, driven by experienced health sector executive Anthony Tennyson.\n\nIt has exited its plastics business, retained the Graft Bio operation, and will focus entirely on mental health therapeutics.\n\nKey to the story is its planned acquisition of Awakn Life Sciences, a Canada-listed firm, which will bring two clinical-stage assets and a pre-clinical programme into Solvonis' portfolio.\n\nThe most advanced asset is AWKN-001, a treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) that combines ketamine with therapy.\n\nEarly clinical trials have shown remarkable results, with abstinence rates improving from 2 per cent to an impressive 86 per cent over six months.\n\nA phase III evaluation, the largest of its kind to date for racemic ketamine-assisted therapy in AUD, is underway.\n\nThe study, conducted at eight National Health Service (NHS) sites across the UK, aims to assess the efficacy of a single treatment cycle combining ketamine infusions with psychosocial support.\n\nEnrolment began last summer, and the trial is expected to continue until at least 2026, with final data analysis anticipated by 2027.\n\nThe study's total cost is estimated at \u00a32.4million, with Awakn contributing \u00a3800,000.\n\nIf successful, AWKN-001 could represent a transformational advance in the treatment of AUD, a condition that affects millions globally and imposes significant costs on healthcare systems.\n\nIn addition to AWKN-001, the acquisition will bring AWKN-002, an oral thin-film formulation of esketamine designed for sublingual administration.\n\nAWKN-002 pairs esketamine delivery with structured alcohol education, providing a new approach to tackling this addiction.\n\nIn December, Awakn received positive feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during what is known as a pre-IND (investigational new drug) meeting.\n\nThe American regulator was supportive of the company proceeding straight to phase IIb.\n\nFurthermore, it supported Awakn's expedited regulatory pathway through the 505(b)(2) process, allowing reference to Johnson & Johnson's data on its blockbuster Spravato drug, an esketamine-based treatment for depression.\n\nThis decision underscores the drug's potential to address a significant unmet need in combating AUD.\n\nBeyond these clinical assets, Solvonis and Awakn have been collaborating on a pre-clinical programme targeting trauma-related mental health disorders, including PTSD, which affects 13 million people in the United States alone.\n\nThe AWKN-SND-14 programme, developed and led by world-renowned neuropsychopharmacologist Professor David Nutt, consists of a series of modulators targeting serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline receptors.\n\nThese medical compounds are designed to enhance pro-social behaviour while providing a safer alternative to existing treatments for PTSD.\n\nPro-social behaviour, which involves individuals engaging in positive actions and supportive interactions with others, is increasingly recognised as a critical factor in addressing PTSD.\n\nBy fostering these behaviours, those with PTSD may overcome feelings of isolation, rebuild interpersonal relationships, and engage more effectively in therapy, ultimately supporting their recovery.\n\nAssessing the commercial potential of Solvonis' pipeline, you quickly realise it is substantial.\n\nIn the UK alone, around 100,000 people receive treatment for alcoholism annually, costing the healthcare system an estimated $4billion.\n\nIn the European Union, the figure rises to $22billion, while in the United States, the economic burden of AUD is estimated at between $27billion and $38billion.\n\nAs well as presenting a huge opportunity, these figures underscore the significant need for new and effective therapeutic interventions.\n\nAWKN-001 and AWKN-002 (if they successfully negotiate all regulatory hurdles) are poised to fill this gap, offering solutions that go beyond traditional therapies with limited efficacy.\n\nFollowers of the company will already have spotted that Solvonis' potential extends beyond its pipeline.\n\nIts company's senior team, led by chief executive Tennyson, combines deep expertise in life sciences and capital markets.\n\nProfessor Nutt's involvement adds significant scientific credibility, while Dennis Purcell, the company's chairman, brings decades of experience in biotech investment and capital markets.\n\nDespite this strong foundation, the combined market capitalisation of Solvonis and Awakn is less than \u00a38million, an anomaly in a sector where valuations for clinical-stage companies often far exceed this figure.\n\nThis discrepancy highlights the potential for significant upside, particularly if the company secures a licensing deal or partnership with a larger pharmaceutical firm.\n\nSuch an agreement would validate Solvonis' science and provide a catalyst for its stock.\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to the mental health therapeutics market, it represents a high-reward opportunity (though risks associated with the approval process must also be carefully considered).\n\nIts clinical assets are targeting substantial unmet needs, and its innovative pipeline positions the company at the forefront of the emerging neuro-psych industry.\n\nWhile the company's modest valuation reflects the challenges facing small-cap biotechs, it also presents an attractive entry point for those willing to navigate the risks inherent in drug development.\n\nAs the mental health market continues to expand and the limitations of existing therapies become increasingly apparent, Solvonis could emerge as a key player in reshaping the treatment landscape.\n\nFor now, this is undoubtedly one to watch.\n\nFor all your small-cap breaking news go to

            "content": "Last month, January 2025, the CGTLive\u00ae team was diligently tracking the FDA's activities related to the development of cell and gene therapies for the treatment of rare, complex, and otherwise challenging diseases and disorders.\n\nThe agency has continued to ramp up its activities around these therapies as more of them progress through the pipeline in tandem. Last month proved no different, with the FDA issuing a complete response letter (CRL) to Atara Biotherapeutics regarding its biologics license application (BLA) for tabelecleucel (tab-cel, also known as Ebvallo) and placing clinical holds on several of the company's trials, clearing an investigational new drug (IND) application for ViGeneron\u2019s retinitis pigmentosa (RP) gene therapy, and fast tracking Solid Biosciences\u2019 Friedreich ataxia (FA) gene therapy SGT-21. Our team has highlighted these, and several other important actions, below.\n\nClick the read more buttons for more details and information about each update.\n\nFDA Issues CRL for Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 BLA for T-Cell Immunotherapy Tabelecleucel for EBV+ PTLD\n\nJanuary 16, 2025 \u2014 The FDA has issued a CRL to Atara Biotherapeutics regarding its BLA for tab-ce, also known as Ebvallo, an allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T-cell immunotherapy, which is under evaluation for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory EBV-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD).\n\nNotably, the CRL was related to issues with a standard prelicense inspection of a third-party manufacturer for tab-cel rather than to any concerns regarding the efficacy and safety data contained within the BLA. The manufacturing process itself was not implicated, and the FDA has not requested additional clinical trials for tab-cel.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with our partner Pierre Fabre Laboratories, the FDA, and the third-party manufacturer to address the feedback to support marketing approval for Ebvallo,\u201d Cokey Nguyen, PhD, the president and chief executive officer of Atara, said in a statement. \u201cOnce the third-party manufacturer GMP compliance issues have been adequately addressed, we will file for a resubmission, which we would expect to be potentially approved within 6 months of resubmission. Atara and its partner Pierre Fabre remain confident in the potential of Ebvallo and are committed to bringing this potential first-in-class medicine to United States patients with EBV+ PTLD who have limited treatment options and significant unmet need.\u201d\n\nAll of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T-Cell Immunotherapy Trials Placed on Clinical Hold by the FDA\n\nJanuary 21, 2025 \u2014 The FDA has placed clinical holds on Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 active investigational new drug applications, which include clinical trials for tab-cel, an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy under evaluation for patients with relapsed/refractory EBV+ PTLD, and ATA3219, an investigational allogeneic CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy consisting of EBV-sensitized T-cells that have not been genetically modified being evaluated for nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nClinical trials impacted include the phase 3 ALLELE clinical trial (NCT03394365) in EBV+ PTLD for tab-cel, a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06429800) in SLE for ATA3219, and a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06256484) in r/r B-cell NHL for ATA3219. The hold is related to a good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance issue identified at a third-party manufacturer for tab-cel while the FDA was conducting a prelicense inspection forth product in relation to its BLA. Although ATA3219 is produced at a separate facility that is in full compliance with GMP, starting materials used in its production come from the aforementioned third-party manufacturer and are thus implicated.\n\n\u201cWe intend to work closely with the FDA to address these issues as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Cokey Nguyen, PhD, the president and chief executive officer of Atara, said in a statement. \u201cWe are encouraged with ongoing correspondence with the Agency and a potential path to submitting the necessary data to release the clinical hold. Patient safety remains our priority and maintaining the highest standards for our programs.\u201d\n\nAllogene Therapeutics\u2019 ALLO-329 Cleared by FDA for Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Rheumatology Indications\n\nJanuary 28, 2025 \u2014 Allogene Therapeutics\u2019 ALLO-329, an investigational allogeneic CAR-T therapy, has received clearance of an IND application from the FDA for a phase 1 rheumatology basket study.\n\nIn light of the IND clearance, Allogene intends to go forward with plans for RESOLUTION, a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT identifier pending) for ALLO-329 in systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and systemic sclerosis. The study, which Allogene anticipates will be launch in the middle of this year, will include 2 different lymphodepletion arms. In one arm patients will receive cyclophosphamide alone for lymphodepletion and in the other no lymphodepletion regimen will be used.\n\nNotably, ALLO-329 targets both CD19+ B-cells and CD70+ activated T-cells, with the intention of eliminating dysfunctional cells of both types. Furthermore, the CAR-T product utilizes the company\u2019s Dagger technology, which is intended to reduce or eliminate the need for lymphodepletion by making the CAR-T more resistant to rejection by the patient\u2019s immune system. Allogene stated that ALLO-329 may be able to be manufactured at a scale of 60,000 doses annually. In addition, the potential to reduce or circumvent the need for lymphodepletion prior to treatment may allow more patients to be eligible for the product.\n\nViGeneron Snags FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for CNGA1-Associated Retinitis Pigmentosa Gene Therapy VG901\n\nJanuary 14, 2025 \u2014 ViGeneron\u2019s VG901, an investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based gene therapy being evaluated for the treatment of RP caused by mutations in the CNGA1 gene in a phase 1b clinical trial (NCT06291935), has been granted rare pediatric disease designation (RPDD) by the FDA.\n\nIn addition to the new designation, ViGeneron also announced that the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) for the trial has given the green light for dose escalation. VG90 is intended to deliver a copy of CNGA1 to retinal photoreceptor cells via a proprietary AAV capsid referred to as vgAAV. It is administered by intravitreal injection.\n\n\u201cThis RPDD recognition from the FDA highlights the significant unmet medical need in retinitis pigmentosa and underscores VG901\u2019s therapeutic potential as the first-in-class and only clinical-stage therapy targeting retinitis pigmentosa associated with mutations in the CNGA1 gene,\u201d Caroline Man Xu, PhD, ViGeneron\u2019s cofounder and chief executive officer, said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to the previously granted FDA orphan drug designation for VG901, the RPDD designation further supports our efforts to accelerate the development of VG901.\u201d\n\nSolid Biosciences\u2019 Friedreich Ataxia Gene Therapy SGT-212 Garners Fast Track Designation\n\nJanuary 21, 2025 \u2014 Solid Biosciences\u2019 SGT-212, an AAV vector-based gene therapy intended to treat Friedreich ataxia (FA), has been granted fast track designation by the FDA.\n\nSGT-212, a dual route gene transfer therapy, is intended to be delivered both by intradentate nucleus (IDN) infusion and intravenous (IV) infusion at the same time. The therapy provides a functional copy of the disease-targeted human frataxin (FXN) gene. The IDN infusion utilizes an FDA-approved stereotactic, MRI-guided device to target the cerebellar dentate nuclei, whereas the IV infusion is intended to target cardiomyocytes. The therapy is expected to treat neurologic, cardiac, and systemic clinical manifestations of the disease. Notably, the University of Pennsylvania, Solid Biosciences, and FA212 LLC, which was founded by parents of children with FA, each contributed to the development of the investigational therapeutic.\n\n\u201cSGT-212 is the only FA therapy in development that is designed to address frataxin deficiency, the underlying cause of FA, and all manifestations of this devastating disease, and in doing so, hopefully halt the full spectrum of symptom progression regardless of where the patient is in their journey with this terrible disease,\u201d Bo Cumbo, BS, the president and chief executive officer of Solid Biosciences, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe fast track designation may enable us to more rapidly develop SGT-212 and bring hope to those living with FA who need and deserve better treatment options.\u201d\n\nArbor Biotechnologies\u2019 CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Therapy ABO-101 Cleared for US Trial in Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1\n\nJanuary 6, 2025 \u2014 Arbor Biotechnologies\u2019 ABO-101, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-delivered CRISPR-based gene editing therapy, has received clearance from the FDA for an IND application, enabling a phase 1/2 study in primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1).\n\nIn light of the IND clearance, Arbor noted it has designed redePHine, a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT identifier pending) that will evaluate ABO-101 in adults and children with PH1. ABO-101 consists of mRNA expressing a novel Type V CRISPR Cas12i2 nuclease and a guide RNA directed at the human HAO1 gene, both of which are delivered via an LNP licensed from Acuitas Therapeutics. It is intended to inactivate HAO1 in order to decrease build up of oxalate, buildup of which is caused by enzyme deficiencies in patients with PH1.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to advance ABO-101 to the clinic as we believe it has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for PH1, a rare disease with a high unmet need, and reinforces the promise of our precisely tailored gene editing approach,\u201d Dan Ory, MD, the chief medical officer of Arbor Biotechnologies, said in a statement. \u201cABO-101 is supported by a strong suite of preclinical data demonstrating specific and durable in vivo editing of HAO1 and corresponding, therapeutically relevant reductions in urinary oxalate in PH1 disease models.\u201d",

This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the \"Lagnificent 7\" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThere are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration.

MRK, Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY.\n\nHowever, the specifics of these reforms are still uncertain, which could cause \u201cvolatility\u201d in the healthcare sector until more details are released.\n\nAt the same time, Medicaid funding and eligibility changes are under consideration as potential cost-saving measures by the new administration.\n\nAlso Read: AbbVie Jumps After Q4 Earnings Beat, Skyrizi And Rinvoq Boom Offsets Humira Decline\n\nThese changes could have negative effects on biopharma companies with significant Medicaid drug exposure, including AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Gilead Sciences, and Eli Lilly and Company LLY, whose top Medicaid drugs make up a large percentage of their US sales.\n\nOverall, for the 340B program, the analyst sees potential policy/legal outcomes that would move dynamics towards a transfer of profits from providers to biopharma companies as a positive for much of the biopharma sector.\n\nMeanwhile, potential Medicaid changes could create \u201cpotential headwinds\u201d for healthcare providers and biopharma companies, though the exact effects remain uncertain.\n\nThe healthcare industry is awaiting further clarity on these proposed policy changes and their implications.\n\nOverall, the analyst notes that exposure to Medicaid and 340B can vary widely by product and indication.\n\nThe top three highest-spend drugs for Medicaid (as of 2022) are AbbVie\u2019s Humira, Gilead\u2019s Biktarvy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Trulicity for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nFor these drugs, Medicaid and 340B spending represented ~15-30% of the drugs' FY22 and FY23 revenue.\n\nFurther, 340B impact may vary for different methods of administration within the same indication \u2013 for example, Gilead\u2019s expects lower 340B exposure for injectables for PrEP than for daily orals \u2013 and expansion of eligibility for 340B discounts may have an outsized impact on certain therapeutics over others.\n\nOverall, 340B reform would serve as a tailwind to biopharma, as the aforementioned initiatives are generally intended to limit access to the statutory discount.\n\nOn the other hand, spending cuts to Medicaid could have a negative impact to volume if they have the effect of reducing coverage, the analyst writes.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical Innovation At The Core Of Healthcare\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been built on the back of scientific innovation. The first innovators a century ago have turned into large pharmaceutical companies regularly re-inventing themselves.\n\nThis is because life sciences and medicine have evolved equally fast in the last few generations. In addition, patent protection often expires less than 10-15 years after the commercialization of a new therapy, forcing pharmaceutical companies to invent new products constantly.\n\nThanks to this pressure to constantly innovate, even large companies kept the incentives to stay able to invent regularly life-changing medicine.\n\nIn this article, we will see some of the best healthcare innovators in all arrays of medicine, from cancer treatments to vaccines, rare diseases, neurosciences, or metabolic therapies.\n\nTop 10 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Healthcare Innovation\n\n(These stocks are organized by market capitalization at the time of writing of this article)\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.52% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology.\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences\n\nOncology\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nJ&J was the second largest pharmaceutical company by R&D investment in 2022 and boasts an impressive lineup:\n\n6 new products were approved in 2022.\n\n20 large MedTech pipeline programs.\n\n81 innovation deals.\n\n20 new equity investments in 2022.\n\n8 licensing agreements in 2022.\n\nWith its highly diversified activities in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, J&J is a good pick for investors looking to bet on pharmaceutical innovation with as little volatility as possible.\n\n(You can read more about J&J's innovation strategy from this transcript of a speech given at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference )\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY +1.51% )\n\nBMS is a pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in cancer, hematology, immunology, and cardiology.\n\nThe company is targeting its risk-adjusted sales to grow from $10B-$13B in 2025 to $25+B in 2030, with the growth coming from both currently commercialized blockbuster drugs increasing their market and new therapies. The new therapies are growing very quickly, having more than doubled revenues between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBMS also has more than 50 therapies in the early stage of clinical trials, of which half are in oncology.\n\nWith half of the 2020-2025 revenues expected to come from the new product portfolio, BMS has already achieved remarkable innovations and should strongly increase its operating margins.\n\nThe success is the commercialized new product portfolio is very encouraging, and BMS might be on the verge of a decade of explosive growth driven by its new product portfolio and its strong performance in all of its 4 core segments.\n\nInvestors will want to pay close attention to phase 3 of clinical trials and the continuing new product sales growth.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO -0.99% )\n\nNovo Nordisk's innovation has traditionally been razor-focused on diabetes, the core segment for the company. This is still true, with 10 clinical trials ongoing in the field .\n\nHowever, the major innovation of Novo Nordisk is in the obesity market, with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable medicine for weight loss initially used for diabetes.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times. The drug is proving so popular that a TikTok-induced mania even increased the shortage .\n\nThe company is also working on growth hormones and acquiring the connected medical device BIOCORP .\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes.\n\nSo, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed This market in more detail in our article \u201c Top Companies In Obesity Treatments .\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +0.69% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon . The company is currently most active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nAt its core, Merck is a technology company that goes beyond just pharmaceuticals. For example, it has a semiconductor offer (equally useful for many biotech equipment like DNA readers). It also controls Sigma Aldrich, a leading supplier of laboratory and testing materials and consumable s , which is part of the broader life science offering , which relies on 59 manufacturing sites and proposes 300,000 products.\n\nThe company has an ambitious R&D roadmap , with 1 new pharmaceutical launch every 1.5 years. This includes the potential of a new therapeutic method for cancer, relying on targeted DNA disruption.\n\nMerck combines steady cash flow from its industrial capacities (semiconductors and life sciences) with the potential of new blockbuster drugs in cancer and neurology.\n\nWith Merck's flagship drug, Keytruda, losing its patent protection in 2028, these innovations will be needed to keep the company's income growing.\n\nSo, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company has been able to reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE +1.87% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nPfizer sees the pandemic windfall profits as leverage to expand with new products and to \u201c allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation . \u201d\n\nAmong these opportunities for the next 2 years are 4 vaccines, of which 3 are mRNA, one treatment for growth hormone deficiency, and two for inflammatory diseases. It also covers 7 new indications for existing drugs and 4 business development deals.\n\nIn the longer term, a lot more potential launches could also work in a large variety of applications. This includes a potential competitor on obesity to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, new vaccines, hemophilia therapies, and cancer treatments.\n\nPfizer is a company that has demonstrated with the pandemic its ability to cash in on innovation and taken a strong lead in the vaccine sector. Combined with its previously well-established lines of business in oncology and inflammatory disease, this should reassure investors of Pfizer's ability to keep bringing new therapies to the market.\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybeans, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nFar from a distraction, the agricultural segment of the company shares many R&D capacities and human resources with the pharmaceutical segment.\n\nHowever, Bayer's stock valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of the pesticide RoundUp to cause cancer.\n\nSo investors will want to assess if the pharmaceutical segment is at a deep discount due to these legal issues or if the risk is too high despite Bayer's other IPs and R&D pipeline quality.\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN +2.22% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoetin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010, among other protein and biological-based therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3 , with a strong predominance of inflammation and oncology for these most advanced clinical trials.\n\nAnother innovation is AMG 133, an obesity treatment that is hoped to be more powerful than the existing therapies. AMG 133\u2019s unique advantage would also be a long half-life, with a dosage every 4 weeks instead of the required weekly treatment of Wegovy .\n\nBecause it is only entering phase 2 of clinical trials and because the company focuses on a wide array of therapies, AMG 133 is less central to the investment thesis for Amgen. Still, a potential 5-20 billion dollar blockbuster drug could seriously boost the company's bottom line. So, with Wegovy showing the market is larger than expected, this is something investors in Amgen will want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe company also has a biosimilar department (the equivalent of generic drugs for biotech treatments), with 5 approved drugs and 3 drugs in the R&D pipeline .\n\nAmgen has historically been one of the most innovative pharmaceutical companies ever made, almost single-handedly creating the biotech sector. Its impressive R&D pipeline shows Amgen is determined to keep that reputation intact, including by venturing into new segments like the obesity market.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD +1.18% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology .\n\nAn emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases. Still, HIV represents by far the bulk of Gilead's current income.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer. Its R&D pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe R&D programs are overwhelmingly dominated by infectious diseases and oncology clinical trials, deepening Gilead's specialization, especially with 13 HIV-related clinical trials.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nThe company behind the Covid mRNA vaccine sold by Pfizer is now using the money made during the pandemic to expand its offer widely.\n\nIt is now developing mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. This makes it a leading company in the field of mRNA vaccines, with only its competitor Moderna ( MRNA ) developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech. You can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies .\u201d\n\nBioNTech is also working on various other therapeutic methods, including cell and gene therapies, antibodies, and chemical drugs.\n\nAs the great winner of true transformation innovation with the arrival of mRNA during the pandemic, BioNTech has a spotless image with investors, even if the current stock price cooled down from the pandemic highs.\n\nThe company's future will depend on expanding mRNA to replace many older vaccines and on mRNA capacity to be used for other applications, of which cancer is the most promising financially.\n\nThe other big winner of the pandemic and the mRNA vaccine technology, Moderna, is doubling down on the vaccine application of mRNA. It has no less than 32 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines, covering 14 pathogens like the RSV, Zika, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus .\n\nDespite the focus on vaccine application, Moderna also has some research programs regarding cancer application, cardiac regeneration, and rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis in partnership with the leader in this sector, Vertex.\n\nThis R&D frenzy is fueled by the revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a tripling of R&D spending in 2023 compared to 2020.\n\nModerna is also looking to use its available cash, $16.4B in Q1 2023, to acquire licenses from smaller biotech or directly acquire these companies. The focus seems to be on technology platforms, which include synthetic genome company OriCiro , metagenomics and AI gene discovery Metagenomi , and macrophage therapies Carisma Therapeutics .\n\nModerna is, for now, a mRNA company with strong prospects in infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases. In the long run, its collaboration with startups working on new biotech technologies could yield out-sized results, similar to how mRNA used to be just a theoretical concept for decades.",

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval of Breyanzi\u00ae (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel), a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received two or more prior lines of systemic therapy. The European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU), will now review the CHMP recommendation.\n\n\u201cAs a company at the forefront of advancing therapies that transform outcomes for some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, CAR T cell therapies are a significant focus of our research, and Breyanzi remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy portfolio and pipeline,\u201d said Anne Kerber, Senior Vice President, Head of Late Clinical Development, Hematology, Oncology and Cell Therapy (HOCT), Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThis is another important step in our commitment to delivering Breyanzi to more patients across indications, as well as expanding into new regions, especially for diseases with continued unmet need such as relapsed or refractory FL, which is considered incurable.\u201d\n\nThe CHMP adopted a positive opinion based on data from the global, Phase 2 TRANSCEND FL study, the largest clinical trial to date to evaluate a CAR T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including FL, which enrolled adults with relapsed or refractory FL treated with Breyanzi after two or more prior lines of systemic therapy. In the study, Breyanzi demonstrated a high overall response rate of 97.1% (95% CI: 91.7\u201399.4) and complete response rate of 94.2% (95% CI: 87.8\u201397.8), the study\u2019s primary and key secondary endpoints, respectively. Responses were rapid and durable, and demonstrated sustained efficacy with 75.7% (95% CI: 66.0\u201383.0) of patients in response at 18 months. The safety of Breyanzi in FL is consistent with the well-established safety profile of Breyanzi observed across clinical trials, with no new safety signals observed.\n\nFL is an incurable, slow-growing form of NHL, characterized by cycles of remission and relapse. While significant advancements have been made in FL treatment in the last two decades, relapsed or refractory FL continues to represent an area of high unmet need, particularly among the nearly 20% of patients that experience disease relapse or progression within two years of first-line treatment. Newer treatments, such as CAR T cell therapies, have shown high rates of complete, durable responses and a manageable safety profile in clinical trials, potentially paving the way for lasting results in the routine care setting.\n\nIn the EU, the EC delivers its final decision within approximately two months following receipt of the CHMP opinion. Once issued, the decision will be applicable to all EU member states as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.*\n\nBreyanzi is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and FL grade 3B (FL3B), who relapsed within 12 months from completion of, or are refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy, and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL3B after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the TRANSCEND FL study.\n\n*Centralized Marketing Authorization does not include approval in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nAbout TRANSCEND FL\n\nTRANSCEND FL (NCT04245839) is an open-label, global, multicenter, Phase 2, single-arm study to determine the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in adult patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell NHL, including FL. The primary outcome measure is overall response rate, including best overall response of complete response or partial response as determined by an Independent Review Committee. Secondary outcome measures include complete response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival and safety.\n\nAbout Follicular Lymphoma\n\nFollicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common form of NHL, accounting for 20-30% of all NHL cases. FL develops when white blood cells cluster together to form lumps in a person\u2019s lymph nodes or organs. FL is considered to be an incurable disease, with patients frequently relapsing following front-line therapy and prognosis worsening after each subsequent relapse. Despite advances in treatment, there remains an unmet need for additional options for relapsed or refractory FL that offer treatment-free intervals with durable, complete responses.\n\nAbout Breyanzi\n\nBreyanzi is a CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which enhances the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. Breyanzi is made from a patient\u2019s own T cells, which are collected and genetically reengineered to become CAR T cells that are then delivered via infusion as a one-time treatment.\n\nBreyanzi is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after at least one prior line of therapy, has received accelerated approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma after at least two prior lines of therapy and relapsed or refractory FL in the third-line plus setting, and is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma in the third-line plus setting. Breyanzi is also approved in Japan, the EU, Switzerland, the UK and Canada for the treatment of relapsed or refractory LBCL after at least one prior line of therapy; and in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory patients with high-risk FL after one prior line of systemic therapy and in patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s clinical development program for Breyanzi includes clinical studies in other types of lymphoma. For more information, visit clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nFull European Summary of Product Characteristics for Breyanzi is available from the EMA website at www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nU.S. FDA-Approved Indications\n\nBREYANZI is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of:\n\nadult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B, who have: refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy; or refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy and are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to comorbidities or age; or relapsed or refractory disease after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\n\n\nLimitations of Use: BREYANZI is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\nadult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.\n\nU.S. Important Safety Information\n\nBOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, AND SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving BREYANZI. Do not administer BREYANZI to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab with or without corticosteroids.\n\nNeurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving BREYANZI, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with BREYANZI. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.\n\nT cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including BREYANZI.\n\nBREYANZI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BREYANZI REMS.\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, which enrolled a total of 702 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), CRS occurred in 54% of patients, including \u2265 Grade 3 CRS in 3.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 5 days (range: 1 to 63 days). CRS resolved in 98% of patients with a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 37 days). One patient had fatal CRS and 5 patients had ongoing CRS at the time of death. The most common manifestations of CRS (\u226510%) were fever, hypotension, tachycardia, chills, hypoxia, and headache.\n\nSerious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, diffuse alveolar damage, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS).\n\nEnsure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of BREYANZI.\n\nNeurologic Toxicities\n\nNeurologic toxicities that were fatal or life-threatening, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. Serious events including cerebral edema and seizures occurred with BREYANZI. Fatal and serious cases of leukoencephalopathy, some attributable to fludarabine, also occurred.\n\nIn clinical trials of BREYANZI, CAR T cell-associated neurologic toxicities occurred in 31% of patients, including \u2265 Grade 3 cases in 10% of patients. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1 to 63 days). Neurologic toxicities resolved in 88% of patients with a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 to 119 days). Of patients developing neurotoxicity, 82% also developed CRS.\n\nThe most common neurologic toxicities (\u22655%) included encephalopathy, tremor, aphasia, headache, dizziness, and delirium.\n\nCRS and Neurologic Toxicities Monitoring\n\nMonitor patients daily for at least 7 days following BREYANZI infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities and assess for other causes of neurological symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated. Manage neurologic toxicity with supportive care and/or corticosteroid as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS or neurologic toxicity occur at any time.\n\nBREYANZI REMS\n\nBecause of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, BREYANZI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BREYANZI REMS. The required components of the BREYANZI REMS are:\n\nHealthcare facilities that dispense and administer BREYANZI must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements.\n\nCertified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab.\n\nEnsure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after BREYANZI infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS.\n\nFurther information is available at www.BreyanziREMS.com, or contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions\n\nAllergic reactions may occur with the infusion of BREYANZI. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n\nSerious Infections\n\nSevere infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have occurred in patients after BREYANZI infusion. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, infections of any grade occurred in 34% of patients, with Grade 3 or higher infections occurring in 12% of all patients. Grade 3 or higher infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 7%, bacterial infections in 3.7%, viral infections in 2%, and fungal infections in 0.7% of patients. One patient who received 4 prior lines of therapy developed a fatal case of John Cunningham (JC) virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 4 months after treatment with BREYANZI. One patient who received 3 prior lines of therapy developed a fatal case of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis 35 days after treatment with BREYANZI.\n\nFebrile neutropenia developed after BREYANZI infusion in 8% of patients. Febrile neutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after BREYANZI administration and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Avoid administration of BREYANZI in patients with clinically significant, active systemic infections.\n\nViral reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, 35 of 38 patients with a prior history of HBV were treated with concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy.\n\nPerform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. In patients with prior history of HBV, consider concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy to prevent HBV reactivation per standard guidelines.\n\nProlonged Cytopenias\n\nPatients may exhibit cytopenias not resolved for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and BREYANZI infusion. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias persisted at Day 29 following BREYANZI infusion in 35% of patients, and included thrombocytopenia in 25%, neutropenia in 22%, and anemia in 6% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts prior to and after BREYANZI administration.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia\n\nB-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving BREYANZI. In clinical trials of BREYANZI, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse reaction in 10% of patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia, either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion, was reported in 30% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with BREYANZI and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement as clinically indicated.\n\nLive vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following BREYANZI treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during BREYANZI treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with BREYANZI.\n\nSecondary Malignancies\n\nPatients treated with BREYANZI may develop secondary malignancies. T cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including BREYANZI. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes. Monitor lifelong for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing.\n\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines\n\nDue to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving BREYANZI are at risk for developing altered or decreased consciousness or impaired coordination in the 8 weeks following BREYANZI administration. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, for at least 8 weeks.\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS)\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. Three of 89 (3%) safety evaluable patients with R/R CLL/SLL developed IEC-HS. Time to onset of IEC-HS ranged from 7 to 18 days. Two of the 3 patients developed IEC-HS in the setting of ongoing CRS and 1 in the setting of ongoing neurotoxicity. IEC-HS was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. One patient had fatal IEC-HS and one had ongoing IEC-HS at time of death. IEC-HS is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of IEC-HS should be administered per current practice guidelines.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe most common adverse reaction(s) (incidence \u226530%) in:\n\nLBCL are fever, cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, platelet count decrease, and hemoglobin decrease.\n\nCLL/SLL are cytokine release syndrome, encephalopathy, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include neutrophil count decrease, white blood cell decrease, hemoglobin decrease, platelet count decrease, and lymphocyte count decrease.\n\nFL is cytokine release syndrome. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, and white blood cell decrease.\n\nMCL are cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and encephalopathy. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include neutrophil count decrease, white blood cell decrease, and platelet count decrease.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS and Medication Guide.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Unlocking the Full Potential of Cell Therapy\n\nA pioneer in harnessing the immune system to fight cancer and an established leader in cell therapy, Bristol Myers Squibb is uniquely positioned to unlock the full potential of this technology across blood cancers and within new frontiers, including autoimmune disease.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is currently the only company with two approved CAR T cell therapies with two distinct targets, available in major markets around the world.

            "content": "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) is one of the leading biopharmaceutical companies focused on developing treatments for cancer, inflammatory, immunologic, cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases. With a market cap of $119.8 billion, Bristol-Myers\u2019 operations span various countries in the Americas, Europe, and the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe Princeton, New Jersey-based pharma giant has slightly lagged behind the S&P 500 over the past year. BMY has gained 19.7% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 23.3% surge during the same time frame. However, BMY has soared 4.6% on a YTD basis outpacing SPX\u2019s 2.6% gains in 2025.\n\nNarrowing the focus, Bristol-Myers has significantly outperformed the industry-focused First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF\u2019s (FTXH) 2.3% gains over the past 52 weeks and 3.4% returns on a YTD basis.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s stock prices soared 5.9% after the release of its impressive Q3 results on Oct. 31. Driven by the increase in sales of its Growth Portfolio and Eliquis, BMY\u2019s total revenues surged 8.4% year-over-year to $11.9 billion which surpassed the Street\u2019s expectations by over 5%. Although its adjusted net earnings declined 11.8% year-over-year to approximately $3.7 billion, its adjusted EPS of $1.80 surpassed the consensus estimates by a staggering 20.8%.\n\nBMY is set to announce its fiscal 2024 results in the upcoming week and analysts are anticipating a major 87.8% year-over-year decline in earnings to $0.92 per share. However, the company has a robust earnings surprise history and has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.\n\nAmong the 25 analysts covering the BMY stock, the consensus rating is \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on seven \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, 17 \u201cHold,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is notably more bullish than two months ago when the stock had a consensus \u201cHold\u201d rating, and only six analysts gave \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Truist Securities analyst Robyn Karnauskas maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating while raising the price target to $65, which indicates a 9.9% premium to current price levels.\n\nBMY\u2019s mean price target of $60.09 represents a modest 1.6% premium to current price levels, while its street-high target of $73 indicates a staggering 23.4% upside potential.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval of Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) plus Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -9DW trial. The CHMP opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines in the European Union (EU).\n\n\u201cHepatocellular carcinoma is the predominant type of liver cancer globally, including in the European Union, and when diagnosed at the advanced or unresectable stage, prognosis and overall survival remain sub-optimal with conventional therapy,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, Opdivo global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThe positive opinion received by the CHMP is a significant step forward in providing patients with additional treatment options, and we look forward to the upcoming European Commission review and the potential to expand the treatment landscape for adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\u201d\n\nIn June 2024, results were presented at the 2024 American Society of Oncology (ASCO\u00ae) Annual Meeting which showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the clinical trial\u2019s primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). In the trial, median OS was 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.8\u201329.4) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to 20.6 months (95% CI: 17.5\u201322.5) with the investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib (HR: 0.79 (0.65\u20130.96); p=0.018). The OS benefit was observed across clinically relevant patient subgroups. The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nIn August 2024, the U.S. FDA also accepted the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Opdivo plus Yervoy as a potential first-line treatment option for adult patients with unresectable HCC and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of April 21, 2025. The combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. FDA in 2020 based on results from the Phase 2 CheckMate -040 trial and has been an established second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators for their important contributions to the Phase 3 CheckMate -9DW clinical trial.\n\nAbout CheckMate -9DW\n\nCheckMate -9DW is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label clinical trial evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of lenvatinib or sorafenib monotherapy in adult patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.\n\nApproximately 668 patients were randomized to receive Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 1mg/kg plus Yervoy 3mg/kg Q3W for up to four doses, followed by Opdivo monotherapy 480mg Q4W infusion, or single agent lenvatinib or sorafenib as oral capsules in the control arm. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival (OS) and key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and time to symptom deterioration.\n\nAbout Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nLiver cancer is the third most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 90% of global cases. HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, where effective treatment options are limited and are usually associated with poor outcomes.\n\nUp to 70% of patients experience recurrence within five years, particularly those still considered to be at high risk after surgery or ablation. While most cases of HCC are caused by hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections, metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are rising in prevalence and expected to contribute to increased rates of HCC.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo\u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nAbout Yervoy\n\nYervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types.\n\nINDICATIONS\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated as neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, followed by single-agent OPDIVO\u00ae as adjuvant treatment after surgery.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (\u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab) and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%).

Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%).

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nIn addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.\n\nSome ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\n\nInfusion-Related Reactions\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30- minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.\n\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\n\nIn randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.\n\nLactation\n\nThere are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.\n\nSerious Adverse Reactions\n\nIn Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268).

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

            "content": "Medicaid funding, totaling approximately $900 billion per year and serving around 72 million participants, and the 340B program are key focus areas for potential healthcare reforms.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter, however, warns that federal Medicaid cuts could lead to stricter policies and lower drug coverage.\n\nPer Richter, the 340B program is currently facing increased scrutiny, with proposed reforms that could potentially benefit biopharma companies by limiting eligibility for drug discounts, which would enable \u201ctransfer of profits\u201d from providers back to biopharma.\n\nThis shift could positively impact major biopharma companies with high exposure to 340B drugs, such as Merck & Company, Inc. MRK, Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY.\n\nHowever, the specifics of these reforms are still uncertain, which could cause \u201cvolatility\u201d in the healthcare sector until more details are released.\n\nAt the same time, Medicaid funding and eligibility changes are under consideration as potential cost-saving measures by the new administration.\n\nAlso Read: AbbVie Jumps After Q4 Earnings Beat, Skyrizi And Rinvoq Boom Offsets Humira Decline\n\nThese changes could have negative effects on biopharma companies with significant Medicaid drug exposure, including AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Gilead Sciences, and Eli Lilly and Company LLY, whose top Medicaid drugs make up a large percentage of their US sales.\n\nOverall, for the 340B program, the analyst sees potential policy/legal outcomes that would move dynamics towards a transfer of profits from providers to biopharma companies as a positive for much of the biopharma sector.\n\nMeanwhile, potential Medicaid changes could create \u201cpotential headwinds\u201d for healthcare providers and biopharma companies, though the exact effects remain uncertain.\n\nThe healthcare industry is awaiting further clarity on these proposed policy changes and their implications.\n\nOverall, the analyst notes that exposure to Medicaid and 340B can vary widely by product and indication.\n\nThe top three highest-spend drugs for Medicaid (as of 2022) are AbbVie\u2019s Humira, Gilead\u2019s Biktarvy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Trulicity for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nFor these drugs, Medicaid and 340B spending represented ~15-30% of the drugs' FY22 and FY23 revenue.\n\nFurther, 340B impact may vary for different methods of administration within the same indication \u2013 for example, Gilead\u2019s expects lower 340B exposure for injectables for PrEP than for daily orals \u2013 and expansion of eligibility for 340B discounts may have an outsized impact on certain therapeutics over others.\n\nOverall, 340B reform would serve as a tailwind to biopharma, as the aforementioned initiatives are generally intended to limit access to the statutory discount.\n\nOn the other hand, spending cuts to Medicaid could have a negative impact to volume if they have the effect of reducing coverage, the analyst writes.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $11.57 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.\n\nThis biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.51%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Bristol Myers came out with earnings of $1.80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 per share, representing a surprise of 20.81%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.07 per share, delivering a surprise of 26.22%.\n\nFor Bristol Myers, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nBristol Myers currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.43%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 6, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

            "content": "Johns Hopkins Medicine\n\nResearchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy have developed a computer model to help scientists identify tumor-fighting immune cells in patients with lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nIn their study published Feb. 3 in Nature Communications, the team, including first author Zhen Zeng, Ph.D., a bioinformatics research associate at the Kimmel Cancer Center, demonstrated that their three-gene \"MANAscore\" computer model can identify the immune-cells targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. It also helped the team identify differences associated with patient response to immunotherapy.\n\n\"We have developed a way to identify the cells directly targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors, and if we can identify them, we can study them,\" says the study's senior author, Kellie Smith, Ph.D., an associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins. \"If we can study them, that means we can identify better biomarkers and better targets for combination immunotherapy.\"\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 inhibitors are available to treat dozens of cancer types. These revolutionary therapies work by unleashing tumor-killing immune cells, called T cells, that are switched off by the protein PD-1. PD-1 inhibitors turn the patient's T cells back on, allowing patients' immune systems to fight cancer more effectively. But not all patients respond to these therapies, and scientists need to know why in order to develop improved therapies that help nonresponders.\n\n\"Tumor-active T cells are very important to a patient's response to therapy, but they are difficult to find,\" Zeng says.\n\nSmith helped develop the MANAFEST technology (Mutation-Associated NeoAntigen Functional Expansion of Specific T Cells), which she and colleagues first described in the journal Cancer Immunology Research in 2018. Their approach combined MANAFEST with single-cell sequencing to identify these rare immune cells in six patients with lung cancer, a laborious process that took several years and cost millions of dollars. The original study showed that the immunotherapy-activated immune cells share a common gene expression profile. In the new study, Zeng, Smith and their colleagues built on those discoveries to develop MANAscore.\n\n\"Our model allows us to skip a time-consuming and expensive process to identify the cells targeted by immunotherapy, and will help us identify what distinguishes who will respond to these therapies,\" Smith says. \"We're not the first to come up with one of these models, but what sets ours apart is that it uses only three genes, while the most commonly used model requires more than 200 genes. Ours is simpler and easier to use.\"\n\nThe team also found key differences in the T cells activated in the tumors of patients who respond to immune checkpoint therapy compared with those who don't. Responding patients exhibit a higher proportion of stem-like memory T cells, which act as a reservoir for new cells and can develop into many effective anti-tumor cells, Zeng says. This observation may help explain why patients are more able to respond; the stem-like characteristics may make it easier for the T cells to multiply into an army of tumor-fighting cells. More studies are needed to confirm these observations.\n\n\"The stem-like characteristics of T cells are critical because they enable self-renewal and long-term persistence,\" Zeng says. \"This allows for sustained immune responses and the ability to expand into a robust population of effector T cells when needed.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the team is working to develop a clinical test that uses multispectral immunofluorescence panels to identify the three-gene signature of immune therapy responding T cells.\n\n\"We hope to translate our three-gene signature into a biomarker that clinicians can use to guide cancer care,\" Smith says.\n\nZeng is also using their new model to determine whether the proximity of T cells with the three-gene signature to other types of immune cells, like regulatory T cells, helps control the immune response.\n\n\"We want to apply our model to spatial data to learn whether cell-to-cell interactions among tumor-targeting T cells and other cell types affect clinical outcomes,\" Zeng says.\n\nShe is also collaborating with other laboratories across the country to determine if MANAscore can be used in patients with different types of cancer. They've created a database of single-cell sequencing data across cancer types and will use the score to help identify cancer-type-specific responder T cell characteristics.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the study include Tianbei Zhang, Shuai Li, Sydney Connor, Boyang Zhang, Jordan Wilson, Dipika Singh, Suzanne L.

            "content": "Dear reader, China\u2019s biotechnology sector has rapidly emerged as one of the fastest-growing industries, with Chinese players becoming key contributors to the global market through local innovation and international partnerships. A clear testament to this is the series of major international deals signed by Chinese biotech companies with leading global pharmaceutical firms, each involving upfront payments exceeding $100 million. These agreements mark a significant turning point for China\u2019s biotech sector and highlight its growing stature as a strong competitor on the global stage.\n\nThe list of deals includes 23 international agreements signed by Chinese biotech startups with major global pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, Merck, and Roche. These deals underscore the increasing confidence in the ability of Chinese companies to deliver innovative technologies on par with their Western counterparts.\n\nFor example, Chinese company Gracell Biotechnologies signed a deal with AstraZeneca worth $1 billion upfront, one of the largest deals in the list. The agreement included the acquisition of the Chinese CAR-T platform, with the total deal amounting to $1.2 billion. This transaction is not just a financial investment,but a reflection of the tremendous progress made by Chinese startups in developing advanced technologies for treating complex diseases like cancer.\n\nThese deals also highlight the diverse range of technical assets and targeted innovations offered by Chinese companies, showcasing their ability to provide innovative solutions addressing a wide spectrum of medical challenges. For instance, Regor Therapeutics secured an $850 million deal with Roche for the acquisition of the advanced CDKx platform. In the field of advanced immunotherapy, Curon Biopharmaceutical signed a $700 million agreement with Merck to develop T-cell engager technology. Similarly, BeiGene played a key role in agreements with Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), licensing PD1 and TIGIT therapies with upfront payments of $300 million and $263 million, respectively. These deals vividly demonstrate the positioning of Chinese companies as major players in developing cutting-edge technologies that address critical medical challenges.\n\nThese major international agreements signify a radical transformation in China\u2019s position on the global biotechnology map, reflecting a profound impact on the industry. One of the most significant effects is the support for local innovation; Chinese companies are no longer solely reliant on imported technology but are now capable of delivering their own innovations that attract global companies. Additionally, the substantial financial investments, with upfront payments exceeding $100 million, indicate a high level of international recognition and trust in Chinese capabilities, trust built through years of investment in research and development. Furthermore, these partnerships have facilitated Chinese companies\u2019 expansion into global markets. No longer confined to the domestic market, they are now actively involved in developing and marketing drugs internationally, strengthening their integration into the global healthcare system.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the success of China\u2019s biotech sector and its rise to prominence. Key among them is government support and regulatory reforms, which, despite the challenges, have streamlined research operations and empowered local companies to enter international markets. Accelerated local innovation has also played a crucial role, driven by a new generation of researchers and entrepreneurs in China focused on advanced technologies like immunotherapies and genetic engineering. Moreover, China\u2019s competitive advantage in operational costs makes it an attractive destination for research and development investments, significantly bolstering its position as a global force in biotechnology.\n\nWith these trends continuing, the future of China\u2019s biotech sector looks brighter than ever. The collaboration with global giants such as AstraZeneca, Merck, and Roche provide Chinese companies with enhanced expertise and access to advanced markets. Additionally, China\u2019s focus on fostering innovation and integrating with the global healthcare system further strengthens its prospects of becoming a global hub for biotech innovation.\n\nThe international mega-deals signed by Chinese biotech companies serve as a clear indicator of China\u2019s transformation into a major force in this field. These deals are not merely financial transactions but a testament to the growing global acknowledgment of China\u2019s potential and its ability to innovate. As this momentum continues, the future of China\u2019s biotech sector appears more promising than ever, combining local innovation and international partnerships to achieve sustainable success on the global stage.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other safe stocks to buy for the long term in 2025.\n\nThe US stock market is often regarded as one of the most reliable and resilient financial markets in the world. With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market\u2019s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDuring major crises such as the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced sharp declines but eventually rebounded to new highs. For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience. One of the key factors contributing to the reliability of the US stock market is its breadth and diversity. The market includes a wide array of industries, from technology and health care to consumer goods and energy, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios to reduce risk. Additionally, US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are among the most liquid in the world, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares efficiently. This liquidity and diversification provide a level of stability that is unmatched in many other markets, offering investors confidence in the market\u2019s ability to withstand shocks and recover from volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off.\n\nOn the day that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock bled 17% in the wake of investors panicking about Chinese AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s low development costs for AI, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the topic. Cramer has been one of the biggest fans of the GPU company, and right off the bat, he started out by sharing that the key thing to consider now is whether the GPU orders for the firm will materialize.\n\nHe also commented on \u2018traveler stocks\u2019 or those that have benefited from the broad AI sentiment. Cramer shared \u201cWhat I find most interesting is that, the fellow travelers to these are the nuclear stocks that have been up a lot. . . .Are the memes. Are the crypto.\u201d He commented that the fact that these stocks were all simultaneously losing value was not great for the market. According to Cramer, \u201cSo looks [like] they are all you know one stock and that is not good. That\u2019s not good because that says you have hype and froth in here that has to come out no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his experience using DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model. In his previous remarks, Cramer revealed that he was a fan of ChatGPT and had used OpenAI\u2019s product to research stocks ahead of his appearances on CNBC. However, he wasn\u2019t impressed by R-1. Cramer outlined that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of R-1 that left him unimpressed was censorship. \u201cThis is a Chinese product,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo when I put into my very helpful DeepSeek, what famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank? And it initially says, the famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he added. While this is all good, soon after the initial response, R-1 \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope,\u201d according to him.\n\nWhen co-host Carl Quintanilla asked him whether it was worth buying any of the AI stocks, Cramer was rather direct. He shared \u201cI don\u2019t have the knowledge to be able to make that decision. It\u2019s better to own that.\u201d Cramer also noted that before Monday\u2019s appearance, there was a debate about whether \u201ccan we just make a determination, or is the determination that we don\u2019t want to let anybody down so we can\u2019t make that?\u201d Given the absolute bloodbath in the premarket that day, he felt \u201clike, whatever you do, maybe twisted between now and the opening.\u201d As a result, Cramer shared \u201cBut sometimes you have to admit, like if you were at the hedge fund you\u2019d just say, you know I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s not a cop-out. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\n\nHowever, with respect to the doubt surrounding AI, he added \u201cWhen in doubt do you go against Zuckerberg? Do you go against Ellison? And I come back and say, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s better to say I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLike social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s AI, DeepSeek is also open source. When asked about whether being open source threatens the ecosystem, Cramer replied \u201cYeah I know that, again, I don\u2019t want to front row Mark Zuckerberg on what he\u2019s saying, but I would say that we do have tremendous chip allocation problems here. And I know that David, we, if you have open source, would you think, that you do not need as many chips. Right. Not necessarily.\u201d\n\nThe sell-off in tech stocks did make him feel that \u201cit\u2019s not such a bad idea to look away from one moment and go back and say the healthcare rotation was so powerful last week.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 70\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a healthcare stock that has seen a lot of attention from Cramer lately. He is impressed about the firm\u2019s schizophrenia medicine which he believes is the first of its kind in decades. This time around, amidst the DeepSeek sell-off, Cramer commented on how other sectors, such as healthcare, could offer investors refuge. He tied Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) to a note that he had sent club members over the weekend:\n\n\u201cLook there is no doubt, I sent a note to people this morning, we can, from the club. Look, this is the seminal thing, you know this is going to sound like the old days, but what do you when you have these situations? You buy Bristol-Myerrrrsss! And that\u2019s what people are going to do.\u201d\n\nOverall, BMY ranks 8th on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off. While we acknowledge the potential of BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "In contrast, large-cap stocks, particularly those in the S&P 500 have a strong operating leverage. Wagner noted that the S&P 500 is projected to see earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% in the following year, driven by revenue growth of only 5%. This operating leverage, he argued, was a unique characteristic of large-cap stocks and provided a compelling reason to favor them over small-caps. He explained that operating leverage amplifies the impact of revenue growth on earnings, which can lead to more significant returns for investors.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance on December 21, David Wagner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, provided a detailed analysis of the current market dynamics and his investment strategy. One of the key points Wagner made was his preference for large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks. This stance was particularly noteworthy given his extensive experience in small-cap investing and running a small-cap strategy for over a decade. Wagner explained that while small caps were not all equal, many passive small-cap investments include a significant portion of unprofitable companies. He cited data showing that passive small-cap investors often had 40% of their assets invested in companies that lacked profitability, which could be a significant risk in a volatile market.\n\nThe term \u201cblue chip\u201d originated from poker, where blue chips were the highest denomination of chips used in the game. In the early 20th century, the term was adopted by financial analysts to describe the stocks of large, well-established companies with a proven track record of success. These companies were considered to be the best of the best. Today, blue chip stocks are typically defined as the stocks of large, well-established companies that have a large market capitalization. These companies are usually industry leaders, with a strong brand, a diverse product or service offering, and a history of consistent profitability. Blue chip stocks offer a relatively low level of risk, particularly when compared to smaller, more volatile stocks. This makes them an attractive option for conservative investors, who are looking to preserve their capital and generate steady returns.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY ) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy under $100.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWagner also highlighted the evolving nature of the S&P 500. He noted that large-cap stocks were increasingly benefiting from operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which were not as prevalent in small-cap or international markets. Small-cap stocks, he observed, were more service-oriented and often lacked the robust profit margins and revenue diversification seen in large-cap companies.\n\nWagner further emphasized that while operating leverage could work both ways, potentially leading to more pronounced negative returns in a downturn, it was currently working in favor of large-cap stocks. He forecasted that the market would see more \u201ctailed\u201d returns, meaning that the best-performing large-cap stocks would outperform more significantly, while the worst-performing ones would underperform more severely. This dynamic, he argued, made large-cap stocks an attractive investment option.\n\nBlue chip stocks continue to be a cornerstone of a well-diversified investment portfolio, offering stability, steady growth, and resilience in uncertain economic conditions. Therefore, the case for investing in these stocks remains compelling.\n\nWhy Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) Is the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy Under $100?\n\nA pharmacy shelves stocked with pharmaceutical drugs awaiting distribution.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best blue chip stocks to buy under $100, we used blue chip ETFs plus online rankings to compile a list of 25 companies. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

Any upside above $67.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but BMY shares would have to advance 13.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 17.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.\n\nIn general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.

            "content": "Many stocks don't offer particularly high yields. The stocks in the S&P 500, for instance, average a yield of just 1.3%. That's not a terribly exciting rate of return on dividends for income investors. It would mean you have to invest around $77,000 in S&P 500 stocks to expect to collect just $1,000 in dividends over the course of a full year.\n\nThe good news, however, is that there are quality stocks that pay yields of well over double that rate, and they aren't risky or expensive investments, either. If you want a much-better-than-average dividend income, three stocks you'll want to consider for your portfolio today include Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.82%), Target (TGT -1.98%), and Suncor Energy (SU -0.10%).\n\nHere's why these three dividend payers can be excellent options for income-seeking investors.\n\n1. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nA top healthcare company you can invest in today is Bristol Myers Squibb. It has a diverse business which is beginning to be a whole lot safer of late. Investors have been concerned about the company's future as it loses patent protection for key drugs, but the company has been investing in its drug development pipeline, and that appears to be paying off.\n\nIn September 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cobenfy, a drug to treat schizophrenia that analysts believe could generate a whopping $7.5 billion in revenue at its peak. Earlier in the year, the FDA also expanded the use case for the cancer drug Breyanzi (to treat another form of blood cancer), which is a blockbuster treatment that can generate around $2 billion at its peak.\n\nInvestors have been hesitant to buy shares of Bristol Myers due to its patent cliffs and high debt load, but the company's focus on growth suggests it is moving in the right direction, and it may be a safer option than it appears to be at first glance. Trading at less than 9 times its projected earnings next year (based on analyst expectations), the stock could be a great buy. Its high dividend yield of 4.2% only sweetens the deal, as this can also be a great source of recurring income for your portfolio.\n\n2. Target\n\nConsumers have been scaling back on discretionary purchases due to rising costs over the past year, which has made investors bearish on Target. But discretionary spending won't stay down forever, and neither will this top retail stock. Share prices of Target have declined by 34% in the past three years, but at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just under 15, it can make for an underrated investment to add to your portfolio right now.\n\nDuring the company's past three quarters, Target's revenue has been flat, but it has been able to grow its earnings by more than 8% over that stretch. It may be facing some near-term headwinds, but that's largely due to broader economic conditions, which is why I wouldn't be too worried about the stock in the long run.\n\nTarget is a Dividend King, having raised its payouts for more than 50 consecutive years. Its 2.9% dividend yield is well above average, and with a stable business and an excellent track record, it's likely that the dividend income you'll collect from this stock will rise over time. This is another good stock you can buy and hold right now.\n\n3. Suncor Energy\n\nAnother solid dividend stock to consider for your portfolio is energy company Suncor. The Canadian-based company is a big player in the oil and gas industry, and investing in it can help to diversify your holdings. While there can be some volatility in the business due to commodity prices, Suncor has been a reliable investment, rising by nearly 40% in value over just the past three years.\n\nOver the trailing 12 months, it has generated 9.6 billion Canadian dollars ($6.67 billion) in operating profit on revenue totaling CA$54.8 billion ($38.08 billion). And its numbers can get even better as the business has been investing in its operations through a \"disciplined capital program\" with the aim of increasing production and lowering costs. Despite its robust numbers and promising outlook, the stock is only trading at a forward P/E of 14, making it yet another good value buy. Suncor also provides investors with a solid payout as the stock yields 4.1%.\n\nTogether, the dividend stocks listed here can help you build up a strong mix of diverse, income-generating investments to build your portfolio around.",

Walden is applying novel, multi-disciplinary approaches that directly target the kidney to prevent damage, slow disease progression, and restore kidney function. Walden's programs address novel targets for therapeutic intervention, directly targeting two cell types critical for kidney function: podocytes and proximal tubular cells. Dysfunction of these cells are critical hallmarks of the majority of kidney diseases. Walden's clinical-stage program is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits suPAR, a cause of podocyte dysfunction and kidney disease, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 Basket study.

Remember our little discussion about Schizophrenia approval opens the door for bipolar and depression treatment approval down the road? Well Cobenfy has a different game plan.\n\nBut first, it should be noted that myself and a few colleagues call this drug Cobenfail. Because it makes people SO SICK. Like poop your pants suddenly diarrhea, vomiting, nausea. Most patients cannot tolerate much more than a week on it and wave the white flag wanting to go off it. It is not selling like it should.

Looking forward, IMARC Group expects the 7MM to reach USD 8.9 Billion by 2035, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 4.10% during 2025-2035. A fundamental change in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) management favors precise individual therapeutic approaches instead of conventional general treatments. This evolution stems from a significantly enhanced understanding of the disease\u2019s molecular and genetic roots, most notably the crucial role of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in CML development. While established therapies like first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) continue to maintain their treatment position yet next-generation TKIs enhance therapy effects through increasing usage or replacing first-generation drugs. These newer agents demonstrate improved efficacy and can overcome resistance mutations, such as the challenging T315I variant. The rise of targeted therapies, encompassing allosteric inhibitors and innovative combination regimens, provide targeted treatments that minimize adverse effects and boost patient long-term success. These novel approaches are especially beneficial for those who have developed resistance or intolerance to conventional TKIs. Furthermore, combination therapies that target multiple disease pathways are showing promise in tackling refractory or advanced-phase CML cases, thus expanding the therapeutic options available for complex and challenging scenarios.\n\nRevolutionizing Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treatment: The Impact of Targeted Therapy\n\nMedical advances in targeted therapy treatment produced revolutionary changes to Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) which delivered improved results for patients. The core transformation of this evolution relies on developing three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) called imatinib dasatinib and nilotinib. The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein leads to CML, and these new drug treatments direct their action exclusively against this critical cause. This precise action allows for effective disease control with significantly reduced side effects, transforming CML from a life-threatening illness into a manageable chronic condition for many. In addition, the availability of newer generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors bosutinib and ponatinib delivers essential treatment choices for patients who no longer respond or tolerate their original therapies. Such drugs display improved resistance mechanisms while effectively targeting challenging T315I mutations and demonstrate minimized side effects for better long-term treatment endurance. The move towards personalized medicine, facilitated by genetic testing, is also playing a key role, allowing for individualized TKI selection and further optimizing treatment plans. These advancements collectively contribute not only to improved survival rates but also to enhancing the quality of life for individuals living with CML, fuelling ongoing progress and innovation within the market\n\nRequest a PDF Sample Report:\n\nhttps://www.imarcgroup.com/chronic-myeloid-leukemia-market/requestsample\n\nTransforming Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Management: Advances in Targeted Therapies and Innovative Approaches\n\nThe therapeutic landscape for chronic myeloid leukemia treatment continues its remarkable evolution through innovative therapies together with treatment methods refinement. The foundation of new treatment advancements centers on the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein which serves as the major molecular agent responsible for driving CML. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), like imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, marked a paradigm shift, allowing for effective disease control, minimized side effects, and enhanced patient well-being. Furthermore, the development of newer-generation TKIs, such as bosutinib and ponatinib, has broadened the therapeutic arsenal, offering crucial alternatives for patients who develop resistance or intolerance to initial treatments. Notably, these advanced TKIs directly target difficult-to-manage mutations, including T315I, which had previously posed a significant obstacle. The current trajectory emphasizes combination therapies and the pursuit of treatment-free remission (TFR) strategies, pushing the boundaries of optimized care for both newly diagnosed and challenging refractory cases. The horizon of CML treatment also includes the promise of gene-based therapies and novel inhibitors, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms and facilitating deeper molecular responses. These collective strides are revolutionizing CML care, providing more tailored and impactful solutions, and fostering renewed hope for improved survival and quality of life for patients.\n\nBuy Full Report:\n\nhttps://www.imarcgroup.com/checkout?id=7958&method=809\n\nMarketed Therapies in the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Market\n\nSprycel (Dasatinib) - Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSprycel (dasatinib), developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).\n\nTasigna (Nilotinib) - Novartis\n\nTasigna (nilotinib), developed by Novartis, is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) disease.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Bristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share, indicating a change of -14.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -87.8%. This estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.07 indicates a change of +668.2% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Bristol Myers.",

The combination treatment resulted in a 71% ORR as opposed to 58% in those given Opdivo alone.\n\nAs for safety, 22% of those in the combo arm developed grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, whereas such toxicities were reported in 14% of those on Opdivo monotherapy. Still, BMS maintained that the safety profile for the Opdivo-Yervoy regimen was consistent with what had been previously established, with no new signals of concern detected.\n\nOf note, the PFS benefits of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained significant \u201cacross all lines of therapy, including first-line,\u201d according to the pharma\u2019s news release.\n\nFor Thierry Andre, head of the Medical Oncology department at Sorbonne University, these latest findings \u201cconfirm nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a new standard treatment for people living with metastatic colorectal cancer.\u201d Thierry has disclosed receiving honoraria from BMS, as well as having acted as a consultant or advisor to the company.\n\nAlso at ASCO GI 2025, Pfizer announced Monday that its oral kinase inhibitor Braftovi (encorafenib), when used with cetuximab and the mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy regimen, results in significant ORR improvements in mCRC patients with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene.\n\nThe Braftovi combo yielded a 60.9% ORR, versus 40% in counterparts who were given chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. The treatment difference was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0008, according to Pfizer. At the time of the readout, median duration of response was 13.9 months in the Braftovi arm, as compared with 11.1 months in control comparators.\n\nOverall survival data were still immature, though Pfizer detected a trend in favor of the Braftovi combo. As for safety, the study found that the adverse event profile of the combination therapy was consistent with the known side effects of each respective agent. Serious adverse events were approximately balanced between the treatment groups.\n\nScott Kopetz, deputy chair of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in a statement said that these latest findings potentially position the Braftovi regimen as \u201cthe new standard of care for people with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, for whom long-term disease control is critical.\u201d Kopetz is a co-principal investigator of the Pfizer study and has consulted for the pharma.",

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

At a median follow-up of 47 months, Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the dual-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) versus Opdivo monotherapy (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results will be featured in a late-breaking oral presentation (LBA143) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium on January 25 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, in San Francisco, California and published the same day in The Lancet.\n\nPrevious results from CheckMate -8HW, evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy versus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, demonstrated that Opdivo plus Yervoy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 79%. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were the basis for a European Commission approval for first-line patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC in December 2024.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of dual inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 has been well established in Phase 3 trials of Opdivo plus Yervoy across a broad range of tumor types, including in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared to chemotherapy,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, global program lead, late development, oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThe results from this analysis of the CheckMate -8HW trial answer affirmatively an important question about whether dual I/O therapy with Opdivo plus Yervoy can also improve outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared with Opdivo alone.\u201d\n\nResults from the CheckMate -8HW trial at a median follow-up of 47 months in patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC across all lines of therapy include:\n\nPFS (progression-free survival; dual primary endpoint): Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus Opdivo monotherapy [HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003]. PFS rates at 12-, 24-, and 36-months were also higher compared to Opdivo monotherapy (76%, 71% and 68% versus 63%, 56% and 51%, respectively).\n\nplus demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus monotherapy [HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003]. PFS rates at 12-, 24-, and 36-months were also higher compared to monotherapy (76%, 71% and 68% versus 63%, 56% and 51%, respectively). ORR (overall response rate; secondary endpoint): ORR by BICR was significantly higher with Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo monotherapy [71% vs 58%; P = 0.0011].\n\nORR by BICR was significantly higher with plus compared to monotherapy [71% vs 58%; P = 0.0011]. Safety: The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols. Grade 3/4 TRAEs were reported in 22% of patients with Opdivo plus Yervoy and 14% of patients with Opdivo. No new safety signals were identified.\n\n\u201cThe data presented today confirm nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a new standard treatment for people living with metastatic colorectal cancer given the evidence observed in both disease-free survival and response rate,\u201d said Thierry Andre, M.D., Head of the Medical Oncology Department, Sorbonne University and Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France. \u201cImportantly, no new safety signals were identified, with a moderate increase of treatment-related adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2, observed with the combination. Together, these data reaffirm the benefit of dual immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab for this population of patients who urgently need improved treatment options.\u201d\n\nThe study is ongoing to assess secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS). Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -8HW clinical trial.\n\nAbout CheckMate -8HW\n\nCheckMate -8HW (NCT04008030) is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone or the investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\n839 patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo monotherapy (Opdivo 240 mg Q2W for six doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 240 mg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg Q3W for four doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), or investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (BICR) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first-line setting and PFS per BICR for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone across all lines of therapy.\n\nAbout dMMR or MSI-H Colorectal Cancer\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body\u2019s digestive or gastrointestinal system. CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In 2020, it is estimated that there were approximately 1,931,000 new cases of the disease; it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined.\n\nMismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5-7% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. These patients are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Creating a Better Future for People with Cancer\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u2014 transforming patients\u2019 lives through science. The goal of the company\u2019s cancer research is to deliver medicines that offer each patient a better, healthier life and to make cure a possibility. Building on a legacy across a broad range of cancers that have changed survival expectations for many, Bristol Myers Squibb researchers are exploring new frontiers in personalized medicine and, through innovative digital platforms, are turning data into insights that sharpen their focus. Deep understanding of causal human biology, cutting-edge capabilities and differentiated research programs uniquely position the company to approach cancer from every angle.\n\nCancer can have a relentless grasp on many parts of a patient\u2019s life, and Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to taking actions to address all aspects of care, from diagnosis to survivorship. As a leader in cancer care, Bristol Myers Squibb is working to empower all people with cancer to have a better future.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo\u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nAbout Yervoy\n\nYervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.\n\nIn Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%).\n\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).\n\nOPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.\n\nContacts\n\n\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\n\n\nMedia Inquiries:\n\nmedia@bms.com\n\nInvestors:\n\ninvestor.relations@bms.com\n\nRead full story here",

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

            "content": "PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\n\nBristol Myers Squibb Presents Results from CheckMate -8HW Analysis Evaluating Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) plus Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) Compared to Opdivo Monotherapy in Patients with Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced results of an analysis from the three-arm Phase 3 CheckMate -8HW trial evaluating Opdivo\u00ae (nivolumab) plus Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) versus Opdivo monotherapy across all lines of therapy, including first-line, for the treatment of microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). At a median follow-up of 47 months, Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the dual-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) versus Opdivo monotherapy (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003).\n\nThese results will be featured in a late-breaking oral presentation (LBA143) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium on January 25 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, in San Francisco, California and published the same day in The Lancet.\n\nPrevious results from CheckMate -8HW, evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy versus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, demonstrated that Opdivo plus Yervoy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 79%. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were the basis for a European Commission approval for first-line patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC in December 2024.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of dual inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 has been well established in Phase 3 trials of Opdivo plus Yervoy across a broad range of tumor types, including in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared to chemotherapy,\u201d said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, global program lead, late development, oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \u201cThe results from this analysis of the CheckMate -8HW trial answer affirmatively an important question about whether dual I/O therapy with Opdivo plus Yervoy can also improve outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared with Opdivo alone.\u201d\n\nResults from the CheckMate -8HW trial at a median follow-up of 47 months in patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC across all lines of therapy include:\n\nPFS (progression-free survival; dual primary endpoint): Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus Opdivo monotherapy [HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003]. PFS rates at 12-, 24-, and 36-months were also higher compared to Opdivo monotherapy (76%, 71% and 68% versus 63%, 56% and 51%, respectively).\n\nplus demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus monotherapy [HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003]. PFS rates at 12-, 24-, and 36-months were also higher compared to monotherapy (76%, 71% and 68% versus 63%, 56% and 51%, respectively). ORR (overall response rate; secondary endpoint): ORR by BICR was significantly higher with Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo monotherapy [71% vs 58%; P = 0.0011].\n\nORR by BICR was significantly higher with plus compared to monotherapy [71% vs 58%; P = 0.0011]. Safety: The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols. Grade 3/4 TRAEs were reported in 22% of patients with Opdivo plus Yervoy and 14% of patients with Opdivo. No new safety signals were identified.\n\n\u201cThe data presented today confirm nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a new standard treatment for people living with metastatic colorectal cancer given the evidence observed in both disease-free survival and response rate,\u201d said Thierry Andre, M.D., Head of the Medical Oncology Department, Sorbonne University and Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France. \u201cImportantly, no new safety signals were identified, with a moderate increase of treatment-related adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2, observed with the combination. Together, these data reaffirm the benefit of dual immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab for this population of patients who urgently need improved treatment options.\u201d\n\nThe study is ongoing to assess secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS). Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -8HW clinical trial.\n\nAbout CheckMate -8HW\n\nCheckMate -8HW (NCT04008030) is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone or the investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\n839 patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo monotherapy (Opdivo 240 mg Q2W for six doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 240 mg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg Q3W for four doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), or investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (BICR) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first-line setting and PFS per BICR for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone across all lines of therapy.\n\nAbout dMMR or MSI-H Colorectal Cancer\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body\u2019s digestive or gastrointestinal system. CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In 2020, it is estimated that there were approximately 1,931,000 new cases of the disease; it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined.\n\nMismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5-7% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. These patients are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Creating a Better Future for People with Cancer\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u2014 transforming patients\u2019 lives through science. The goal of the company\u2019s cancer research is to deliver medicines that offer each patient a better, healthier life and to make cure a possibility. Building on a legacy across a broad range of cancers that have changed survival expectations for many, Bristol Myers Squibb researchers are exploring new frontiers in personalized medicine and, through innovative digital platforms, are turning data into insights that sharpen their focus. Deep understanding of causal human biology, cutting-edge capabilities and differentiated research programs uniquely position the company to approach cancer from every angle.\n\nCancer can have a relentless grasp on many parts of a patient\u2019s life, and Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to taking actions to address all aspects of care, from diagnosis to survivorship. As a leader in cancer care, Bristol Myers Squibb is working to empower all people with cancer to have a better future.\n\nAbout Opdivo\n\nOpdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.\n\nOpdivo\u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.\n\nAbout Yervoy\n\nYervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types.\n\nINDICATIONS\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated as neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable (tumors \u22654 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, followed by single-agent OPDIVO\u00ae as adjuvant treatment after surgery.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (\u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab), in combination with YERVOY\u00ae (ipilimumab) and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nOPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.\n\nIn Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%).\n\nImmune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).\n\nOPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.\n\nIn patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%).

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nIn addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.\n\nSome ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.\n\nInfusion-Related Reactions\n\nOPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30- minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively.

In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.\n\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.\n\nFollow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone\n\nIn randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.\n\nLactation\n\nThere are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.\n\nSerious Adverse Reactions\n\nIn Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268).

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Bristol-Myers Squibb's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company\n\n\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nLast week\u2019s 6.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 26% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bristol-Myers Squibb?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bristol-Myers Squibb, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Bristol-Myers Squibb. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$88m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Bristol-Myers Squibb better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the .\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

            "content": "Takeaways\n\nThe Seventh Circuit will not rehear the case that led to its 2024 decision that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Bristol-Myers decision and its jurisdictional principles apply to FLSA collective actions.\n\nA solid majority of circuits to address the issue have held that Bristol-Myers applies in the FLSA context.\n\nAs a result, employers will be less vulnerable to nationwide collective actions in a jurisdiction where they are not headquartered or do not have their principal place of business.\n\nRelated links\n\n\n\nArticle\n\nIn its 2024 opinion in Vanegas v. Signet Builders, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit joined a growing number of federal circuits to hold that would-be plaintiffs from out of state cannot join a collective action brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) unless the court has general jurisdiction over the employer. Vanegas v. Signet Builders, Inc., 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 20780 (7th Cir. Aug. 16, 2024). With the decision, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin were added to the list of jurisdictions where employers may not be subjected to nationwide collective actions of federal wage and hour, equal pay, or age discrimination claims unless the suit is brought in the state in which they are headquartered or incorporated.\n\nThe good news for employers was tentative, though. A month after the Vanegas decision was issued, the plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing by the three-member Seventh Circuit panel or, alternatively, en banc rehearing by the full circuit court. On Jan. 13, 2025, however, the Seventh Circuit denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The Seventh Circuit held firm, leaving the original August 2024 decision to stand. Vanegas v. Signet Builders, Inc., 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 700.\n\nBristol-Myers\n\nAt issue in Vanegas at the Seventh Circuit was whether the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, 582 U.S. 255 (2017), applies to collective actions. In Bristol-Myers, a mass tort case, the Supreme Court held that a California federal court did not have personal jurisdiction over claims against a non-resident company brought by out-of-state plaintiffs. Personal jurisdiction requires that the claims \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state, and that jurisdictional requirement applies to each individual claim brought by each plaintiff, the Supreme Court explained. The out-of-state plaintiffs could not meet this requirement, so the California federal court could not hear their claims (but could hear the claims brought by California residents).\n\nBristol-Myers sharply limited nationwide multi-plaintiff suits. But the Court left unanswered whether the decision applies to class actions brought under Rule 23 or to collective actions under the FLSA.\n\nVanegas Case\n\nVanegas was a putative wage-hour collective action against a construction company that was incorporated and headquartered in Texas but maintained operations nationwide. The case was filed in Wisconsin, where the named plaintiff worked, so the federal court had jurisdiction over the named plaintiff\u2019s claims. When employees who worked for the company outside Wisconsin sought to join the collective, the employer sought to limit notice of the lawsuit to individuals who had worked in Wisconsin and bar the claims from out-of-state plaintiffs pursuant to Bristol-Myers. The district court ordered broad notice, however, and explained it would resolve the jurisdictional issues later.\n\nOn an interlocutory appeal, a three-member Seventh Circuit panel held that Bristol-Myers applies. Because the Wisconsin district court did not have jurisdiction over the out-of-state employees\u2019 individual claims against the company, those employees could not opt in to the action. With the appellate court\u2019s decision to deny rehearing, the collective action must be limited to employees within Wisconsin.\n\nA Clear Majority\n\nThe Seventh Circuit joins three other federal circuits on this issue, resulting in a 4-1 circuit split that favors employers. The Third, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held that Bristol-Myers applies to collective actions. Only the First Circuit has held that Bristol-Myers does not apply.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit will consider the issue next. It is poised to hear oral argument on Feb. 7 in Harrington v. Cracker Barrel, a proposed collective action brought by employees alleging that the restaurant chain violated the FLSA\u2019s tip credit provisions. In 2023, the federal court in Arizona issued notice of the putative collective action to Cracker Barrel employees outside the state, observing that the majority of district courts within the circuit have declined to apply Bristol-Myers to FLSA collection actions. That holding is before the Ninth Circuit on interlocutory appeal.\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe clear trend among the federal circuit courts is to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s Bristol-Myers decision and its jurisdictional principles to FLSA collective actions. This trend is likely to continue. That means it is much harder for employees to engage in forum shopping so that they can bring massive nationwide collective actions in hand-picked favorable jurisdictions. An employer still faces the prospect of defending a nationwide FLSA collective action in the state in which it has its principal place of business, is incorporated, or is subject to general jurisdiction. Moreover, plaintiffs can always bring a collective action in their home state limited to employees who live in that state, so employers may be subjected to duplicative collective actions in different jurisdictions.\n\nFinally, courts of appeals have been more reluctant to apply Bristol-Myers to Rule 23 class actions, however. Several federal appeals courts (including the Seventh Circuit) have ruled that Bristol-Myers does not apply to Rule 23 class action suits. If a consensus emerges that Bristol-Myers applies to collective but not class actions, it may alter plaintiffs\u2019 calculation of where, and under what statute, to sue. This is one more element of complexity in the constantly evolving world of class-collective litigation.\n\nContact a Jackson Lewis attorney if you have questions about the Vanegas decision or the application of Bristol-Myers to class and collective actions.",

And when I went to go and talk to other primary care providers, I just didn't get much of a response,\u201d explained Lewis.\n\nHer determination to expand awareness of the potentially life-saving practice of implementing the new national screening guidelines led her to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) in 2018, where she co-led the VA Partnership to Increase Access to Lung Screening (VA-PALS) program evaluation. Supported by the VA\u2019s Office of Rural Health and a grant from the BMS Foundation, VA-PALS was ahead of its time, offering lung cancer screening programs even before the full benefits were widely recognized. The program was such a success that lung cancer screening is now a mandated service provided to all veterans.\n\nNow, Lewis is looking to address gaps in lung cancer screening research and inform future guidelines through the MAS-EXPAND research study.\n\nBurn pits and lung cancer: A closer look at the emerging evidence\n\n\n\nBurn pits, open-air areas used on military bases to dispose of waste by burning, have become a focus of research due to their potential health risks. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), environmental sampling of the air and soil near burn pits has documented the presence of several chemical compounds shown in studies to be linked with inflammation and body tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory tract. Incomplete combustion of material in burn pits results in high volumes of toxic particulate matter (PM); and, according to the ACS, there is \u201cextensive evidence that PM in air pollution is linked to heart disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and an overall increased risk of death.\u201d\n\nFor Lewis, this potential risk factor is personal. Her husband is a veteran of the Iraq war, where he was consistently exposed to burn pits.\n\nHowever, despite the initial evidence, current research is not clear enough for governing bodies like the USPSTF to classify individuals exposed to burn pits as a high-risk population for lung cancer. Thus, whether to be screened outside of current guidelines is an active area of research within VA.\n\nThe next chapter: MAS-EXPAND's role in advancing screening research\n\n\n\nOver the next several years, MAS-EXPAND will recruit 1,400 veterans across seven VA medical centers to undergo annual low-dose chest CT scans. The hope is that detecting lung cancer and other diseases at earlier, treatable stages will produce enough evidence to inform future screening guidelines and potentially save lives.\n\n\"We hope to detect more lung cancers at earlier stages, when they are curable,\u201d said Lewis, who has committed much of her career to informing lung cancer screening guidelines.\n\nApart from her personal connection with the veteran community, she is inspired to honor the work of Dr. Pierre Massion, who submitted the initial grant for this project before unexpectedly passing away in 2021. \u201cWe are continuing this work in his legacy and have taken the acronym for the study to be MAS-EXPAND in memory of him,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nGoing forward, Lewis envisions MAS-EXPAND as a pilot that will pave the way for more inclusive and effective lung cancer screening guidelines, ultimately saving more lives.",

Since then, the PD-1 inhibitor broke open the immuno-oncology space, racking up some four dozen approvals for a suite of cancer types, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and many more, often as part of combo therapies and often paired with cancer drugs from other companies.\n\nBut recently Merck\u2019s Keytruda luck has turned. The company halted a Phase III trial of Keytruda plus anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in August 2024 after data showed it would not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. In the fall, an FDA committee recommended limiting the use of Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb rival med Opdivo in stomach and esophageal cancers based on PD-L1 expression levels.\n\nIn the latest study to readout, Keytruda was paired with Eisai\u2019s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Lenvima in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The late-stage trial, called LEAP-015, showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS at the interim analysis as compared to placebo, the companies said in a Friday release . This was one of the study\u2019s two primary endpoints. It also showed improvement in objective response rate (ORR), which was a secondary endpoint.\n\nBut the combo did not meet the other primary endpoint of overall survival, which is a measure of how long a patient survives after starting treatment. Specific survival data were not disclosed.\n\nMerck\u2019s Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president of global clinical development at the pharma\u2019s research branch, chalked up the results to the challenges of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and said in the release that the results add to the companies\u2019 understandings of this combination. Eisai\u2019s Corina Dutcus, senior VP and oncology global clinical development lead, similarly noted that these cancers present challenges \u201cdue to their heterogeneity and generally poor prognoses.\u201d\n\nThe companies will conduct a full analysis of the data and report results at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nKeytruda and Lenvima are approved together for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and certain types of endometrial carcinoma. The companies are also studying the combo in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal cancer in the broader LEAP clinical program.",

            "content": "Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management's confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\n\"From a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that's partially because of the relative underperformance that they've had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they're becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won't rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a long and impressive history of innovating and developing medicines that improve the lives of patients around the world. Founded in 1887 when William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the company was initially named Bristol, Myers and Company. Its first nationally recognized product, Sal Hepatica, was released in the 1890s.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb offers chemically synthesized drugs and biologics administered through injections or infusions to patients. The company's pharmaceutical portfolio includes a large number of well-known products. BMS's primary research and development sites are in New Jersey, California, Spain, Massachusetts, New York, Belgium, Japan, India and Massachusetts. The company's products sell to wholesalers and distributors around the world.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has a robust pipeline of investigational medicines in its pipeline. In addition, the company has established strategic collaborations and partnerships with various companies, successfully launching new products. These partnerships and investments generate portions of the company's revenue.\n\nBristol Myers-Squibb has acquired several companies over the years, including Medarex in 2009, ZymoGenetics in 2010, Inhibitex Inc. in 2012, Amylin Pharmaceuticals in 2012, iPierian in 2014, Flexus Biosciences in 2015, Cardioxyl in 2015, Padlock Therapeutics in 2016, Cormorant Pharmaceuticals in 2017, IFM Therapeutics in 2017, Celgene in 2019, Otezla in 2019, Forbius in 2020, MyoKardia in 2020 and Turning Point Therapeutics in 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the company divested individual consumer products and its subsequent consumer products businesses. In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for its cancer drug, Opdivo, used to treat skin cancers that do not respond to drug therapies. In 2019, the company divested its consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho.\n\nThe company has also faced several scandals, lawsuits and investigations over the years, the biggest of which is the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for the company's role in a 1940s experiment that infected hundreds with syphilis. In 2001 BMS faced an accounting scandal that resulted in a restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, BMS faced a lawsuit based on illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, a chemotherapy medication. The former head of the pharma group and the ex-CFO were indicted for federal securities violations in 2005. In July of 2006, an FBI raid on the company's corporate offices revealed that the company took steps to delay the release of a generic version of one of its drugs.\n\nBMS began a significant restructuring in 2009, focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, productivity initiatives and cost-cutting. The U.S. attorney forced the company into oversight and appointed a monitor as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2010 as global product development and design president.\n\nIn 2013, Forbes magazine ranked the company as the drug company of the year. Dr. Giovanni Caforio took the reigns as CEO in 2015. In 2017, reports began to surface that activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in the company, widely seen as a signal for a potential future takeover.\n\nAs Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to experience success and growth, the company is committed to delivering innovative treatments to patients and staying ahead of the curve in the biopharmaceutical industry. With its focus on research and development and a long and rich history of delivering innovative medicines, BMS offers an excellent long-term investment opportunity.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson has agreed to acquire neuroscience specialist Intra-Cellular Therapies for almost $15 billion (\u00a312 billion). This could be a harbinger for more billion-dollar deals this year, say analysts, as big companies look to replace revenues from impending patent expiries on blockbuster drugs. The trend will be helped by expectations that the new US administration could adopt a lighter touch to regulating mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n\nThe J&J deal would be the biggest biotech deal in over a year and will add treatments for disorders of the central nervous system. The most valuable is Caplyta (lumateperone) for depression, which J&J estimates will have peak annual sales above $5 billion.\n\n\u2018This is right in [J&J\u2019s] wheelhouse and investors have been urging it to do more in face of the patent cliff that it has in the next five years or so,\u2019 says Jared Holz, healthcare equity strategist at Mizuho. J&J will face biosimilar competition for its blockbuster autoimmune antibody Stelara (ustekinumab) in 2025, after patents expired late in 2023.\n\nMerck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Amgen are all facing significant patent losses over the next five years, according to analysis by healthcare investment bank Leerink. Blockbusters whose patents are expiring include Merck & Co\u2019s cancer antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in Europe in 2028; Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s blood thinner Eliquis (apixaban) in 2027 to 2029; and Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine in 2026.\n\n\u2018M&A is all about helping to drive future growth,\u2019 says Jeff Haxer, management consultant at Bain & Company. Most of the cost is in clinical development, but once products are on the market, profit margins are high. Hence acquisitions can insulate larger companies from early-stage risks and provide new revenue sources.\n\n\u2018Neurology and neuropsychiatry continue to garner interest,\u2019 says Holz. There is a high unmet medical need and many treatments for mental health conditions are old, with significant side effects. J&J has had success with Spravato, an esketamine nasal spray for depression, which looks likely to surpass $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nBiogen-Eisai\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s antibody Leqembi (lecanemab) was approved in the US for Alzheimer\u2019s in 2023 and then Europe in late 2024. While Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab) injections were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Alzheimer\u2019s last July. That success has led competitors to revive and acquire promising projects in the area. \u2018Oncology and neurology are two areas where we have lots of patients and several debilitating diseases that have high unmet needs. It is just that the science is quite difficult,\u2019 says Haxer.\n\nBut there is always risk in drug development. AbbVie bought Cerevel last year for $8.7 billion, but recently downgraded the value of the deal by $3.5 billion after the failure of a drug candidate for schizophrenia.\n\nBroad appetite\n\nLeerink\u2019s analysis confirms that large pharma has a broad appetite for mergers and acquisitions, mostly in the small- to medium-size range, with oncology, immunology and neurology making up much of the deal activity from 2022 to 2024.\n\n\u2018The small-to-mid-size biotechs, so mid-stage companies, have been the sweet spot,\u2019 says Jeffrey Jonas, an analyst with investor firm Gabelli, with lots of deals in the $1\u20135 billion range. \u2018Although it can be hard to value them when they are a few years from market,\u2019 he adds. \u2018A lot of the later-stage stuff tends to go for $10\u201315 billion and that\u2019s been a little harder to swallow and to make the maths work.\u2019\n\nThere was some trigger-shyness in the last 12 months, mostly just waiting to see what would happen with the election\n\nLeerink\u2019s analysis suggests the companies with the least exposure to sales loss from patent expiries are Takeda, Gilead, Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. But that won\u2019t necessarily stop those firms looking for deals.\n\nLilly, along with Novo Nordisk, is flush from sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. The consensus view is that they have established a strong lead in this segment, with over $20 billion invested in manufacturing and supply chains, says Holz. \u2018It is almost a nonstarter for anyone else to participate in the market on the injectable side. The production costs are high and if you have missed the initial wave, it\u2019s going to be hard to make money,\u2019 he adds.\n\nLilly has also agreed to buy Scorpion Therapeutics, a private biotech developing cancer treatments, for up to $2.5 billion. \u2018Lilly has been very active in oncology in particular,\u2019 says Jonas. \u2018It\u2019s also been pretty aggressive on radiopharmaceuticals.\u2019\n\nGSK has also agreed to buy IDRx, a biotech developing treatments for rare cancers, for $1 billion up front, with promises of a further $150 million in performance milestone payments. While Biogen took an opportunistic punt, offering to buy out its R&D partner Sage Therapeutics. Biogen and Sage signed a collaboration agreement in 2020 that saw Sage receive $875 million in cash and Biogen buy a $650 million stake in the biotech\u2019s equity. One of the drugs named in that agreement, Zurzuvae (zuranolone), has been approved in the US for postpartum depression, but \u2018the drug\u2019s potential market is much smaller than hoped,\u2019 says Jonas. The second candidate, intended to treat tremors and other neurological conditions, has struggled with disappointing clinical results, depressing Sage\u2019s share price, which Biogen seems to be looking to take advantage of.\n\nSage has reportedly filed a lawsuit to block Biogen\u2019s unsolicited takeover offer, and Jonas believes it will likely hold out for a better price, but has limited options.\n\nLess scrutiny\n\nNot everyone thinks J&J\u2019s plan to acquire Intra-Cellular will sail through regulatory scrutiny. \u2018I am a little worried about the [competition] review, because J&J is already strong in mental health conditions,\u2019 says Jonas. He believes it may take time to assuage regulators, but that the incoming Trump administration could take a lighter touch.\n\n\u2018The outgoing chairwoman of the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], Lina Khan, was very strict, especially with healthcare deals,\u2019 says Jonas. \u2018Everyone is pretty excited that the new administration is going to be more permissive.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared by Haxer. \u2018There was some trigger-shyness in the last 12 months, especially in 2024, mostly just waiting to see what would happen with the election,\u2019 he says, adding that deals over $10 billion were most impacted by FTC scrutiny in the US. The FTC was seen to take a tough approach to deals between Amgen and Horizon and Novo Holdings and Catalent, for example, although both eventually went through. \u2018The regulatory environment depressed some of the mega-deals and fundamentally I think we are going to see more large deals happen,\u2019 says Haxer.",

This results in anemia, fatigue, and other complications due to insufficient oxygen delivery throughout the body. Beta thalassemia can range from mild to severe, with the severe form, known as thalassemia major, requiring regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy to manage iron overload. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and while there is no universal cure, treatments focus on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Stem cell or bone marrow transplants offer potential cures for certain cases.Get a Free sample for the Beta Thalassemia Market Forecast, Size & Share Analysis Report:Beta Thalassemia EpidemiologyThe epidemiology section provides insights into the historical, current, and forecasted epidemiology trends in the seven major countries (7MM) from 2020 to 2034.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Bristol-Myers Squibb, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nNYSE:BMY Ownership Breakdown January 21st 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bristol-Myers Squibb?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:BMY Earnings and Revenue Growth January 21st 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.9% and 4.6% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been investors\u2019 favorites for a long time now. Over the years, these equities have performed better than the broader market. That said, when it comes to dividend investing, opinions often split down the middle between those seeking high yields and those favoring dividend growth. Though analysts recommend buying stocks with proven tracks of dividend growth, the appeal of high yields is hard to ignore. According to analysts, investors should steer clear of yield traps and focus on companies that consistently increase the value returned to shareholders. However, those advocating yields have plenty to say about the significance of dividend yields.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nOne such example is a report published by Newton Investment Management. According to the report, high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods between 1940 and 2021. The report also revealed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividends in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios surpassed low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While this result provides useful information, it doesn\u2019t offer details about the market conditions at the time, giving only a broad picture of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have paid close attention to how dividend stocks perform during market volatility, as the need for consistent income becomes more pronounced in such times. As a result, they suggest considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also have a strong history of dividend growth.\n\nDan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, made the following comment about extremely high yields in the firm\u2019s recent report:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps\u2014companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.\u201d\n\nThat said, high yields aren\u2019t automatically a bad sign. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks, as it shows how much income an investor can expect relative to the stock's price. However, to fully benefit from high yields, other factors like the company\u2019s cash flow, payout ratio, and dividend growth must also be considered. If these metrics are strong, high-yield stocks can still be appealing. Some reports have pointed out the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields increase, returns generally rise, and risk decreases. Hartford Funds conducted research factoring in annualized standard deviation, which measures a portfolio\u2019s return volatility, with a higher standard deviation indicating greater historical risk. The report found that from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios delivered an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively.",

            "content": "Open any medical textbook and you\u2019ll read that multiple myeloma is incurable. However, recent advancements by Johnson and Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb and more are shifting the paradigm to something a lot more manageable, providing new hope for the 25,000 U.S. patients diagnosed with the blood cancer each year.\n\n\u201c[Multiple myeloma] has not been considered curable, but I think times are changing,\u201d Saad Usmani, a myeloma specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, told BioSpace. \u201cWe are starting to call myeloma a chronically managed condition.\u201d\n\nWhen Usmani started in the space 15 years ago, survival for multiple myeloma was an average of two to three years following diagnosis. Now, he said, some patients are living 15\u201320 years or more as treatment options have advanced and expanded.\n\nWith CAR T cell therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and monoclonal, bispecific and trispecific antibodies plus other drug classes both on the market and in development pipelines, there is a growing variety of treatments to fit the unique biology of each patient\u2019s needs\u2014ultimately reaching for the ever-elusive cure.\n\nJ&J leads the way in this space. Half of all new medicines approved for multiple myeloma have come from the company and its partners, according to Mark Wildgust, vice president of global medical affairs at J&J. But with the multiple myeloma market projected to reach $38 billion by 2034, there is plenty of room for other companies\u2014including BMS and Pfizer\u2014to gain strong footholds in the market.\n\nThe Multiple Myeloma Market\n\nJ&J\u2019s top seller, Darzalex, is a CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody injected subcutaneously as a monotherapy or as a component of a patient\u2019s multifaceted regimen. As of December, the drug was on track to rake in $12 billion in 2024. Sanofi is looking for a similar blockbuster in its anti-CD38 therapy Sarclisa, which was just approved in September.\n\nIn addition to Darzalex, J&J markets CAR T therapy Carvykti and bispecific antibodies Tecvayli and Talvey. The company also has a novel trispecific antibody in the pipeline, for which Wildgust said it expects data this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, BMS sells CAR T therapy Abecma alongside three immunomodulators, Revlimid, Thalomid and Pomalyst, a portfolio it scooped up in its $74 billion buyout of Celgene in 2019. It also markets Empliciti, a monoclonal antibody developed with AbbVie.\n\nIn competition with Tecvayli and Talvey, Pfizer sells Elrexfio, which targets BCMA CD3. Regeneron also has a BCMA CD3-targeted bispecific, linvoseltamab, in development. In a Phase III trial, treatment with the candidate elicited a 46% complete response rate with 92% of those patients s negative for minimal residual disease after 12 months. Linvoseltamab was denied FDA approval in August 2024 due to third-party issues with its manufacturing site and Regeneron is currently awaiting another inspection.\n\nWhile the market may seem crowded, not all of these products are in direct competition, as many are approved for different lines of treatment and diverse patient populations.\n\nIn July 2024, Darzalex was approved for frontline treatment, joining proteasome inhibitors from Takeda and Amgen. Sanofi\u2019s Sarclisa is also approved for patients newly diagnosed with the disease. CAR T therapies, on the other hand, can be used only after at least one treatment has failed, since the FDA greenlit Carvykti in the second line in April 2024. At the same time, the regulator approved Abecma in the third line, while bispecifics are still approved only for patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy.\n\nSuch a range of options is valuable because when it comes to multiple myeloma, experts agree that a multifaceted treatment regimen is key.\n\n\u201cThere is no golden bullet that will address any cancer,\u201d Usmani said. \u201cYou will have a strategy that attacks the cancer with different components.\u201d CAR Ts, bi- and trispecifics, antibody-drug conjugates, proteosome inhibitors, cereblon modifying agents and steroids each manipulate the immune system and target cancer in different ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being a cook. We\u2019re working on how to best put them together in sequence to get the desired outcome that we need\u2014the recipe,\u201d Usmani said.\n\nAnd the recipe may be different depending on the type of myeloma, which is a heterogeneous disease with multiple molecular subgroups. The recipe could also depend on the age of the patient, he added, as multiple myeloma predominantly affects older people.\n\nEven if CAR T therapy ultimately becomes a first-line treatment, the regimen would begin with a combination of chemo-immunotherapies to bring the disease level down by 80-90%, Usmani said. Then, the CAR T would \u201ccome and clean the rest of it up.\u201d\n\nCAR T Cell Therapies: Carvykti vs. Abecma\n\nWhile Darzalex may be the current money-maker for J&J, Wildgust emphasized the value of CAR T cell therapy Carvykti. \u201cIf you were to look at the singular most efficacious myeloma product developed at Johnson & Johnson, I think it\u2019s Carvykti,\u201d he told BioSpace.\n\nCAR T cell therapy involves extracting a patient\u2019s own T cells and genetically modifying them in a lab to recognize and destroy cancer cells\u2014in Carvykti and Abecma\u2019s case, BCMA-expressing cells. Carvykti, co-developed by Legend Biotech, is in competition with BMS and 2seventy Bio\u2019s Abecma. However, the therapies are not necessarily considered equals by practitioners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always hesitant to comment on efficacy in the absence of head-to-head data, but this is a clear case where I think even BMS would admit their product\u2019s performance is inferior to Carvykti,\u201d Ran Reshef, a professor of medicine and clinical lead for the CAR T Cell program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said during a recent William Blair investor call, adding that real-world data clearly shows Carvykti\u2019s superiority.\n\nHowever, in an email to BioSpace, a BMS spokesperson said, \u201cData comparisons from separate trials investigating Abecma or Carvytki in certain patients with multiple myeloma are not appropriate, as each trial has different patient populations, study designs, and treatment comparators.\u201d\n\nCarvykti and Abecma could soon have new competition from Gilead Sciences and partner Arcellx, which in November 2024 touted strong response rates and promising survival outcomes from a registrational Phase II trial of anitocabtagene autoleucel in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nWhile there have been concerns and reports of delayed neurotoxicity among patients taking the therapies, particularly Carvykti, Reshef said this has not precluded him from using them in treatment. However, this has reframed the conversation, helping patients to understand the risk of potential long-term side effects that may not be reversible. So far, none of his patients have declined the therapy due to the risk.\n\n\u201cCarvykti is the only [CAR T] that\u2019s proven a survival benefit,\u201d Wildgust said, adding that J&J is \u201cfiguring out\u201d how to manage the safety concerns associated with the drug.\n\nBeyond survival benefit, CAR T therapies are at the forefront of the \u201ctreat to cure\u201d mission, Wildgust said. He referenced a study conducted in China showing that five years after one dose of Carvykti, about 21% of patients were still alive without disease progression. J&J\u2019s CARTITUDE-1 study is expected to read out this summer, providing a five-year progression-free survival rate.\n\n\u201cMy anticipation is, we\u2019re going to see a proportion of those patients are indeed cured,\u201d Wildgust said.\n\nA Shift in Expectations\n\nWith these treatment advances comes a shift in expectations for patients and providers alike. In April 2024, for example, an FDA advisory committee agreed that minimal residual disease (MRD) could be a viable surrogate endpoint in place of survival for accelerated drug approval in multiple myeloma. With patients surviving for longer periods of time, it has become impractical for companies to follow trials through to a survival readout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fancier way of measuring how deep the response is to treatment,\u201d Usmani said. \u201cIf patients achieve MRD negativity, they get better progression-free survival, which is a surrogate for overall survival.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of prevention on the horizon, as J&J is now targeting high-risk smoldering myeloma with Darzalex. Smoldering myeloma is an early stage of the disease in which abnormal plasma cells have begun to build up in the bone marrow, but without noticeable symptoms. It\u2019s often found incidentally in a patient\u2019s bloodwork. About half of smoldering myeloma cases with high-risk features will develop into active myeloma within two years, Wildgust said.\n\n\u201cHistorically, patients with smoldering myeloma are watch and wait,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, the patients will tell you it\u2019s watch and worry. Watch and be scared.\u201d\n\nThat could soon change. In a Phase III trial presented last month at the American Society of Hematology\u2019s annual meeting, treating high-risk smoldering myeloma patients with Darzalex reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 51% versus active monitoring. The need for first-line treatment was also reduced by 42% in the Darzalex group compared to the monitored group. J&J has filed applications with both the FDA and European Medicines Agency to make Darzalex the first-ever treatment option for smoldering myeloma.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether Darzalex becomes a preventive option for high-risk patients, both Usmani and Wildgust are optimistic that a cure for some multiple myeloma patients may be near.\n\n\u201cI think that this is an amazing time to be a myeloma investigator, trying to figure out how to develop strategies that get us to that functional curability in this older patient population,\u201d Usmani said.\n\nMeanwhile, J&J has undertaken the \u201caudacious\u201d mission to cure 50% of patients with myeloma, and \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re as far away from that as we might think,\u201d Wildgust said. \u201cI want a red pen, and I want to go find every medical textbook and cross out incurable because that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d",

            "content": "One industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. . .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

He notes that previous work has established that the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in resistance to CAR T-cell therapy. However, in this study, Davila explains that he and colleagues wanted to delve into how tumors itself could be associated with resistance.\n\nThe cohort included 54 patients with LBCL treated with CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy; 61 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and 54 RNA sequencing samples were analyzed by investigators. Of note, 39 samples were collected at baseline, 15 at relapse, and 7 both before and after treatment. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the 7 paired samples and somatic driver discovery on baseline samples, which integrated single nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, copy number variants, and structural variants.\n\nDavila says looking into potential genetic mutations and genetic abnormalities within tumor cells was one major opportunity. Since the CAR T cells are targeted toward CD19, genetic pathways that could alter or destroy CD19 expression could potentially mediate resistance, according to Davila. He emphasizes that this observation is crucial, as this is a mechanism of antigen escape in acute leukemia, although this notion has been a common area for debate.",

Retail pharmacies dominate the market, holding a 38.4% share. They are the primary channel for rivaroxaban distribution, especially for patients managing conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Retail pharmacies also cater to individuals undergoing post-surgical venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Their accessibility and availability make them a preferred option for patients seeking convenience and consistent supply of rivaroxaban.\n\nHospital pharmacies play a critical role in the rivaroxaban market by initiating treatment and monitoring patient responses. Hospitals ensure the proper prescription and dosage of rivaroxaban, particularly during acute care. They are vital for managing complex cases like DVT or PE, requiring immediate attention. Online pharmacies are an emerging segment, offering convenience and home delivery services. This channel is gaining popularity among patients seeking affordable and easily accessible rivaroxaban options. Combined, these distribution channels address diverse patient needs.\n\nKey Market Segments\n\nBy Indication\n\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF)\n\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)\n\nPulmonary Embolism (PE)\n\nProphylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)\n\nOthers (Acute Coronary Syndrome, etc.)\n\nBy Formulation\n\nTablets\n\nSuspension\n\nBy Patient Type\n\nAdults\n\nPediatrics\n\nBy Distribution channel\n\nHospital Pharmacies\n\nRetail Pharmacies\n\nOnline Pharmacies\n\nDrivers\n\nRising Prevalence of Cardiovascular and Thromboembolic Diseases\n\nThe rising prevalence of cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases is driving the growth of the rivaroxaban market. Globally, aging populations are at greater risk of conditions like atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and venous thromboembolism (VTE). These conditions require effective anticoagulation therapy to prevent complications. As the demand for better treatment options increases, rivaroxaban emerges as a leading choice. Its widespread adoption highlights its importance in managing these life-threatening conditions, especially in aging societies.\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of death worldwide. According to WHO 2021, an estimated 17.9 million deaths were attributed to CVDs, representing 32% of global fatalities. Heart attacks and strokes accounted for 85% of these deaths. Over 75% of CVD-related deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, emphasizing the global burden. The increasing incidence of these diseases underscores the urgent need for effective treatments like rivaroxaban.\n\nThe need for anticoagulation therapy is amplified by premature deaths caused by CVDs. In 2019, 38% of the 17 million premature deaths (under 70 years) from noncommunicable diseases were linked to CVDs. These statistics demonstrate the urgency of addressing these conditions. Rivaroxaban is widely preferred due to its efficacy, safety, and convenience. Unlike traditional anticoagulants, it eliminates the need for routine monitoring, making it a patient-friendly option.\n\nGrowing awareness of cardiovascular diseases has also led to better diagnosis and treatment rates. Patients are increasingly prescribed rivaroxaban for conditions like AF, DVT, and PE. Its convenience and proven benefits have made it a leading anticoagulant. As healthcare systems advance and more patients access effective therapies, the rivaroxaban market continues to expand. This trend reflects the increasing focus on managing thromboembolic and cardiovascular diseases globally.\n\nRestraints\n\nSafety Concerns and Risk of Bleeding Complications\n\nThe rivaroxaban market faces a significant restraint due to the risk of bleeding complications. This concern is common with all anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban. Serious bleeding events, such as gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding, can occur. This limits its use in specific patient groups, like those with a history of bleeding disorders or active bleeding. These safety concerns often deter healthcare providers from prescribing rivaroxaban. Patients at higher risk, including those with medical conditions or certain medications, are particularly affected, impacting market growth and acceptance.\n\nAdditionally, several factors can heighten the risk of bleeding while on rivaroxaban. These include using other anticoagulants or medications that affect clotting. Patients with bleeding disorders or those scheduled for surgeries require cautious medication management. Healthcare providers must carefully assess risks before prescribing rivaroxaban. These safety issues underline the need for clear communication between patients and providers. Addressing these challenges is vital for enhancing the adoption of rivaroxaban in the market.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGrowth in Generic Rivaroxaban Market\n\nThe expiration of rivaroxaban\u2019s patent has opened opportunities for the growth of generic versions in the market. Pharmaceutical companies are now offering more affordable alternatives, driving competition and reducing prices. This development makes rivaroxaban accessible to a broader patient base, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The introduction of generics also encourages adoption across various therapeutic areas like atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). These factors collectively expand the market potential for rivaroxaban globally.\n\nIn January 2024, Lupin Limited received tentative U.S. FDA approval for its generic Rivaroxaban Tablets USP. These tablets will be available in strengths of 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg. The approval enables Lupin to market a generic version of Xarelto\u00ae, manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The tablets will be produced at Lupin\u2019s Pithampur facility in India. This development enhances affordability and accessibility, further boosting the market for rivaroxaban generics.\n\nImpact of Macroeconomic / Geopolitical Factors\n\nIn periods of economic slowdown or recession, governments and healthcare systems may face budget constraints, leading to tighter healthcare spending. This could result in reduced access to expensive treatments like Rivaroxaban, especially in public healthcare systems. Hospitals and clinics may prioritize generic alternatives or lower-cost treatments for patients, potentially limiting the adoption of branded rivaroxaban.\n\nChanges in health insurance and reimbursement policies, especially in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, can significantly affect market dynamics. If insurance companies reduce coverage for specific treatments or impose stricter reimbursement criteria, patients may have less access to Rivaroxaban. Additionally, insurance reimbursement cuts could lead to more emphasis on generics, reducing the share of branded rivaroxaban in the market.\n\nTrends\n\nShift Towards Outpatient and Home Care Settings\n\nA key trend influencing the Rivaroxaban market is the shift towards outpatient and home care settings. Traditionally, anticoagulant treatments like rivaroxaban were predominantly administered in hospital settings, especially for conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\nHowever, advancements in healthcare delivery and the growing preference for cost-effective care are driving a transition toward outpatient and home-based care models. This shift is supported by Rivaroxaban\u2019s advantages, including its oral administration, which eliminates the need for hospital-based intravenous treatments or constant monitoring (as seen with older anticoagulants like warfarin). Patients can take the medication at home, reducing the strain on healthcare facilities and improving convenience for patients, particularly elderly individuals or those with chronic conditions.\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nNorth America is leading the Rivaroxaban Market\n\nThe market is primarily dominated by the United States, which accounts for a substantial share due to its advanced healthcare infrastructure, widespread use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and a high prevalence of diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). As per the data by Medscape, Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a highly prevalent medical condition, with an annual incidence of approximately 80 per 1,000 people. In the United States, over 200,000 individuals develop venous thrombosis each year, and of these, 50,000 cases are further complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\nWith increasing awareness of these conditions and the aging population, the demand for Rivaroxaban has risen significantly. Several factors contribute to Rivaroxaban\u2019s market growth in North America. These include its ease of use (oral administration with no need for regular monitoring), efficacy in reducing stroke risk in AF patients, and its approval for multiple indications, including post-surgical prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Moreover, the shift toward outpatient care and home-based treatments has made Rivaroxaban even more appealing, as patients prefer convenience and reduced hospital visits.\n\nKey Regions and Countries\n\nNorth America US Canada\n\nEurope Germany France The UK Spain Italy Russia Netherland Rest of Europe\n\nAsia Pacific China Japan South Korea India Australia New Zealand Singapore Thailand Vietnam Rest of APAC\n\nLatin America Brazil Mexico Rest of Latin America\n\nMiddle East & Africa South Africa Saudi Arabia UAE Rest of MEA\n\n\n\nKey Players Analysis\n\nThe Rivaroxaban market is highly competitive, with companies focusing on innovation, regulatory approvals, and consumer trust.

            "content": "What Is an Economic Moat?\n\nSome companies seem to have an uncanny ability to fend off rivals and maintain their market dominance year after year. This phenomenon, known as an \"economic moat,\" doesn't just keep rivals at bay but also seems to separate successful firms from those that fail.\n\nPopularized by legendary investor Warren Buffett\u2014it's perhaps his favorite metaphor, used in dozens of investor talks going back decades\u2014the term \"economic moat\" draws an evocative parallel with the water-filled trenches that protected medieval castles. In the business world, these moats characterize sustainable competitive advantages that shield a company's profits from marauding competitors.\n\nBut what constitutes an economic moat and, more importantly, how do companies build them? From patents to unbeatable brand recognition, the makeup of these competitive fortifications is far more diverse than their watery antecedents. Understanding economic moats isn't just academic\u2014it's a crucial skill for investors seeking companies with the potential for long-term outperformance.\n\nKey Takeaways \"Economic moat\" is a term that refers to a business's ability to maintain a competitive edge over its competitors.\n\nThe analogy relates to the moats that would surround medieval castles and act as a barrier of protection.\n\nA company can create an economic moat by taking advantage of its size, intangibles, lower costs, and high switching costs.\n\nThe term economic moat was made popular by legendary investor Warren Buffett.\n\nMorningstar offers the best-known proprietary metric of companies that have economic moats.\n\nUnderstanding Economic Moats\n\nAn economic moat is more than just a fleeting competitive edge\u2014it's a sustainable advantage that allows a company to outperform its rivals over an extended period. These can take many forms, but they all serve the same purpose: protecting a company's market share and profitability from competitive forces. Warren Buffett has explained the idea many times. Here's one example from when he answers an investor's question about how he looks for winning companies:\n\nWe're trying to find a business with a wide and long-lasting moat around it, surrounding and protecting a terrific economic castle\u2014with an honest lord in charge of the castle \u2026 For one reason or another, it can be because it's the low-cost producer in some area. It can be because it has a natural franchise [or] because of its service capabilities, its position in the consumer's mind, [or] because of a technological advantage. For any kind of reason at all, it has this moat around it.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons, beyond popular mythology, for Buffett to choose and stick with this metaphor for business success for so long. Historically, moats were built to provide an extra layer of defense against attackers. They made it more difficult for invaders to reach castle walls by adding an obstacle that had to be crossed under fire from defenders.\n\nContrary to popular myths, moats were not typically filled with dangerous creatures like crocodiles or piranhas\u2014often, the supposed impregnability of a company's defenses is just as mythic. In many cases, water moats were stagnant water, though some might be filled with debris, refuse, or dead animals. In addition, as gunpowder and cannons became more prevalent in the late medieval period, moats provided less practical defense, and their design changed to reflect new warfare technologies until they disappeared altogether.\n\nWhile the defensive role was central, moats also symbolized power and prestige. A castle with a large, well-maintained moat reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, particularly during the late medieval period when status displays became increasingly important. This brings us back to Buffett since he argues that it's in the nature of capitalism that \"everybody is going to try\" to take on a big castle. But a moat is not enough, he makes clear. Homophonically mixing watery metaphors, he says, \"most moats aren't worth a damn\":\n\nWhy is that castle still standing, and what's going to keep it standing or cause it not to be standing five, 10, 20 years from now? What are the key factors and how permanent are they? How much do they depend on the genius of the lord in the in, in the castle? And then, if we feel good about the moat, then we try to figure out whether, is the lord going to try and take it off for himself\u2014whether he\u2019s likely to do something stupid with the proceeds, etc. But that's the way we look at businesses.\n\nOur task in the rest of this article is to flesh out the different aspects of what Buffett mentions above since it contains much of what's been discussed in recent decades in terms of this concept.\n\n\n\nCreating an Economic Moat\n\nLet's start with what Buffett highlights among the typical ways businesses form economic moats:\n\nCost Leadership\n\nBeing a low-cost producer gives a company pricing power and potentially higher margins since the company can either undercut competitors' prices or maintain higher profit margins. For example, Walmart Inc.'s (WMT) efficient supply chains and economies of scale allow it to offer lower prices than many competitors.\n\nA competitive advantage is essentially any factor that allows a company to provide a good or service that is like those offered by its competitors and outperform them in profits. However, economics holds that, all else being equal, these advantages should disappear over time since every competitor is working day and night at storming and overtaking the castle of the moat metaphor.\n\nBrand Strength\n\nA strong \"position in the consumer's mind\" can command premium pricing and customer loyalty. Consumers often choose branded products over generic alternatives, even at a premium price. Consider a company with a strong brand name, like Coca-Cola Co. (KO), whose brand is so powerful that many consumers will choose it over less expensive alternatives worldwide, allowing the company to charge premium prices. This brand loyalty acts as a moat, making it difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold in the market.\n\nOther companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and, at least until some missteps in recent years, Nike, Inc. (NKE) have been prime examples of companies with powerful brand moats.\n\nService That Breeds Loyalty\n\nSome companies build moats through superior customer service. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), for instance, has made customer service a cornerstone of its business, creating a reputation for fast shipping and easy returns that keep customers coming back.\n\nTechnological Edge\n\nProprietary technology or patents can create a significant moat. For example, Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) search algorithm, continually refined over the years, gives it a technological edge that's been hard for competitors to match. Switching medieval war metaphors, only the advent of AI in recent years has demonstrated some potential chinks in Google's armor.\n\nA good example of a competitive advantage would be a low-cost advantage, such as cheap access to raw materials.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nBuffet leaves wide open how different companies might fortify their businesses. Many do so with intangible assets like patents, trademarks, and regulatory licenses. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, rely heavily on patent protection to maintain their competitive advantage.\n\nThe patent acts as a legal moat, preventing competitors from producing the same drug for a set period. This exclusivity allows the company to recoup its research and development costs and generate substantial profits before generic alternatives can enter the market.\n\n\n\nBenefitting From the Size of the Castle\n\nBeing big can sometimes, in itself, create an economic moat for a company. At a certain size, a firm achieves economies of scale. This is when more units of a good or service can be produced on a larger scale with lower input costs. This reduces overhead costs in financing, advertising, production, etc.\n\n\n\nLarge companies that compete in a given industry tend to dominate the core market share of that industry, while smaller players are forced to either leave the industry or occupy smaller \"niche\" roles.\n\nSwitching Costs\n\nBeing the big fish in the pond has other advantages. When a company can establish itself in an industry, suppliers and customers can be subject to high switching costs should they choose to do business with a new competitor.\n\nAs such, a rival doesn't have to make a cheaper widget; they have to make a widget that's cheaper than their competitor's plus the cost of switching, all while making it worthwhile in time and effort.\n\nThe Durability of Economic Moats\n\nHowever, Buffett emphasizes that having a moat isn't enough. The moat's durability is crucial. He mentions the following:\n\nLongevity: Will the advantage last for five, 10, or 20 years? Key factors: What are the critical elements maintaining the moat? Permanence: How stable are these factors? Management dependence: Does the moat rely too heavily on current leadership? Management integrity: Will company leaders exploit the moat for personal gain or make poor decisions?\n\nIt's not just about identifying a company's current strengths but predicting how they will hold up against competitive pressures and changing market conditions.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most durable \"moat\" is the network effects of one's products. This occurs when a product becomes even more needed by others as it gains popularity. Social media platforms are classic examples of this. Once these network effects take hold, competitors can't just launch a better product or service to get ahead.\n\nThe Role of Management\n\nWhile a strong economic moat provides a company with competitive advantages, the effectiveness of that moat largely depends on the quality of the company's management, as Buffett makes clear. Even the widest moat can be squandered by poor leadership decisions. Conversely, exceptional management can reinforce and expand existing moats, or even create new ones.\n\n\n\nThese are the names for management styles that can have varying impacts on a company's economic moat:\n\n\n\nVisionary leadership: Some leaders are known for their ability to anticipate future trends and position their companies accordingly. This approach can help create and maintain technological or brand-based moats.\n\n\n\nOperational excellence: CEOs and management teams that build their companies' moats through relentless focus on operational efficiency and cost management.\n\nCustomer-centric management: Leaders who prioritize customer satisfaction can create strong service-based moats.\n\nInnovation-focused leadership: Often confused with visionary leadership, this is the term for management teams that emphasize continuous progress in their products that can be sustained over the long term.\n\n\n\nFinancial Stewardship: Managers who allocate capital wisely, reinvesting in the business rather than pursuing short-term gains, can strengthen a company's competitive position over time.\n\nUltimately, the quality of management can be the difference between a company that leverages its economic moat for sustained success and one that sees its competitive advantages slowly erode.\n\nHowever, suppose you develop and patent a juicing technology that allows you to get 30% more juice out of the average lemon. This would have the same effect of reducing your average cost per glass of lemonade.\n\nThis time, your competitors will have no way of duplicating your methods, as your competitive advantage is protected by your patent. In this example, your economic moat is the patent that you hold on your proprietary technology. In this case, if your lemonade company was a public firm, your stock would probably outperform that of your competition in the long run.\n\nMarkets evolve, technologies change, and consumer preferences shift\u2014after all, no one builds actual moats anymore. The challenge for companies is not just to build a moat, but to continually widen and deepen it to maintain their competitive position.\n\nHow To Identify Companies With Economic Moats\n\nDetermining which firms have the strongest economic moats is vital for investors seeking long-term value. While qualitative analysis is essential, several quantitative metrics can help you spot those with protective moats. Here are the different kinds of metrics analysts typically review:\n\nMeasures of Profitability\n\nHigh return on invested capital (ROIC): Companies with wide economic moats tend to consistently generate high ROIC. This metric helps assess how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate profits. A consistently high ROIC (typically above 15%) over five to 10 years suggests a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nGross and operating margins: A company with a moat can usually charge premium prices or achieve cost efficiencies, leading to higher gross and operating margins.\n\nCost advantages: Companies with moats often achieve cost advantages through scale, production efficiency, or access to unique resources. Cost advantages enable companies to underprice competitors or maintain healthy margins, even in competitive markets.\n\nMeasures of Stability and Growth\n\nRevenue growth and market share: Companies with economic moats often dominate their industries or niches. Examining market share and revenue growth over time helps indicate whether a company can fend off competitors and sustain its position.\n\nEarnings stability: Less volatile earnings compared with peers suggest a more defensible market position.\n\nFree cash flow: Strong and consistent free cash flow generation can indicate a company's ability to reinvest in its moat.\n\nLow debt-to-equity ratio: Companies with strong moats often don't need to rely heavily on debt financing.\n\n\n\nMeasures of the Ability To Hold Market Share\n\nMarket leadership: Most clearly, being No. 1 or 2 in an industry can be a sign of a powerful competitive position.\n\nPatents, trademarks, and proprietary technology: Intellectual property or proprietary technology is a clear sign of a moat, especially in industries that rely on innovation. A company's ability to continually develop and protect such assets gives it a significant edge over competitors.\n\nBrand strength: A powerful brand can create a durable moat by establishing loyalty and trust with consumers. Measuring brand equity, customer satisfaction, and the company\u2019s share of mind in the marketplace can provide insights into its moat.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Nvidia's Economic Moat\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) is a compelling example of a contemporary company that has built a significant economic moat, especially in recent years. As a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia has solidified its position through a combination of technological advances, brand strength, and strategic partnerships.\n\nTechnological Leadership\n\nNvidia\u2019s moat is primarily built on its ability to continuously innovate and dominate in key markets such as gaming, AI, and data centers. Its GPUs, particularly in the AI and machine learning space, are, for now, leading the industry. Nvidia\u2019s proprietary technologies, such as its CUDA platform for parallel computing, give it a significant edge over competitors. These not only provide Nvidia with its technical lead but also lock in customers who are heavily dependent on its specialized software and hardware.\n\nStrong Network Effects\n\nNvidia benefits from network effects in industries that rely on GPU technology, such as gaming and AI research. Developers optimize their software for Nvidia's hardware, making it difficult for users to switch to other platforms without facing performance trade-offs. This strong ecosystem of hardware and software compatibility deepens the moat by fostering loyalty and reducing the incentives for customers to switch to rival products.\n\nPartnerships and Market Penetration\n\nNvidia\u2019s strategic partnerships with major tech companies, including its growing role in cloud computing and its alliances with major automakers for self-driving cars, reinforce its moat. These partnerships ensure Nvidia's products are a key player in several fast-growing sectors.\n\nHigh Margins and ROIC\n\nNvidia consistently posts impressive gross margins, regularly exceeding 60%, a sign of its ability to charge premium prices for its products. Its high ROIC, supported by scale and strong market demand, indicates that Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantages could be sustainable over the long term.\n\nThe Contrarian Take on NVDA's Moat\n\nWhile NVDA's rapid ascent in market share this decade has made many analysts converts about its prospects, there are reasons to hold back from believing that NVDA has created a sustainable moat around its operations. While Nvidia dominates the GPU market, the tech industry evolves rapidly, and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) or Intel Corporation (INTC) could erode Nvidia\u2019s market share through aggressive pricing or technological breakthroughs.\n\nThe reliance on its GPU gains means Nvidia\u2019s moat could narrow if a rival develops superior AI or gaming chips, or if emerging technologies like quantum computing render GPU architectures less relevant. In addition, a contrarian might highlight Nvidia\u2019s dependence on strategic partnerships and question whether shifting industry alliances or supply chain disruptions could weaken its dominance over time. In their view, Nvidia\u2019s moat is more vulnerable to disruption than the market assumes.\n\nInvesting With Moats\n\nVanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF\n\nIn addition, a contrarian might note that those who have to put their money where their mouth is, namely those managing VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT), haven't made it among their top 10 holdings. Thus, beyond doing your own analysis, one way to see where one major firm is placing its bets on the \"moat\"-ness of certain companies is by following the progress of the MOAT exchange-traded fund (ETF). Here are its major sector and company holdings, along with key trading details.\n\n\n\nMorningstar's Economic Moat Ratings\n\nThe MOAT ETF is based on a proprietary system from Morningstar, the investment research firm. This system, its economic moat rating, is a well-known metric among investors interested in finding and investing in moats.\n\nMorningstar says it classifies companies into three categories:\n\nWide moat: Companies expected to maintain competitive advantages for over 20 years. Narrow moat: Companies likely to sustain advantages for 10 to 20 years. No moat: Companies without significant advantages or advantages expected to dissipate quickly.\n\n\n\nMorningstar says it uses these factors when collating its moat ratings:\n\nHistorical financial performance: Companies consistently generating returns on capital above their cost of capital often indicate the presence of a moat. Future sustainability: Analysts assess whether past performance is likely to continue, considering industry trends and company-specific factors. Sources of competitive advantage: Morningstar identifies five primary sources of economic moats, including network effects, intangible assets, cost advantages, switching costs, and its efficiency in serving its market over competitors.\n\nWhile worthwhile, investors should be aware that moat ratings are based on analysts' judgments and may not always accurately predict a company's future performance. Market conditions, technological disruptions, and management decisions can all impact a company's competitive position over time.\n\nComparing MOAT With a Benchmark, SPY\n\nWhile much further analysis would be needed, a starting point for determining the gains from investing in the MOAT ETF would be comparing its price shifts with a benchmark. In this case, we chose the SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY), a common choice for these types of ETFs (and indeed, MOAT's own in some of its quarterly updates). We took SPY's price action and calculated what would have happened if an investor had taken the same amount of MOAT's IPO price, $19.79, and invested it in SPY instead.\n\nThe two charts below give a visual means of seeing how they have compared since MOAT's IPO. MOAT, it turns out, tracks SPY's price action pretty well, coming out a bit ahead. However, those investing passively in SPY might think the sustained effort to identify moats hasn't led the actively managed MOAT to vanquish its benchmark in some medieval fashion, as one might expect with an expense ratio (0.46%) five times as much as that of SPY (0.09%).\n\nWho Is Warren Buffett? Warren Buffett is often considered one of the most successful investors in history and is widely regarded as the \"Oracle of Omaha.\" Born in 1930, Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A), a conglomerate that owns a diverse array of businesses and holds significant stakes in many well-known companies. Buffett is famous for his value investing strategy, his frugal lifestyle despite his immense wealth, and his pledge to give away the majority of his fortune to philanthropic causes.\n\nWhat Is Value Investing? Value investing is an investment strategy that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis. The concept was developed by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, who taught at Columbia Business School in the 1920s. Value investors look for companies with strong fundamentals that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. This could be due to short-term market pessimism, temporary business challenges, or simply because the company isn't \"exciting\" enough to attract investor attention.\n\nWhat Are Other Common Metaphors Used in Investing and Finance? Like a good teacher, finance professionals often use metaphors to explain complex concepts. That said, technical analysts (e.g., \"dead cat bounce\") seem to have the most viscerally memorable. Other common examples include the following: \"Bull\" and \"Bear\" markets: Representing optimistic (rising) and pessimistic (falling) market conditions. \"Rocket ship\": Describing a stock that's rising very quickly. \"Underwater\": Referring to an investment worth less than its purchase price. \"Headwinds\" and \"Tailwinds\": Factors that make growth harder or easier, respectively. \"Unicorn\": A start-up valued at over $1 billion.\n\n\n\nCan You Tell Me About Those Technical Analyst Metaphors? Yes, it's quite a list, suggesting a field rife with dark humor\u2014not a bad thing to have around when trades swing the wrong way. In no particular order, these are real names for events, strategies, and market moves you'll find in any technical analyst's lexicon, limiting ourselves to the first 10 that spring to mind. Dead cat bounce: Let's at least define this for you since we mentioned it above. It's a temporary recovery in stock prices after a huge fall\u2014from the fact that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough. Catching a falling knife: This warns against buying into a market that's dropping rapidly. Just as grabbing a falling knife is dangerous\u2014this doubles as good kitchen advice\u2014so is trying to time the bottom of a crashing market. Blood in the streets: Originating from Baron Rothschild, this phrase suggests the best time to buy is when there's extreme pessimism in the market; this is a contrarian's take on the mar traps: These terms describe situations where the market gives a false signal that a reversal is occurring. A bull trap tricks investors into thinking a downtrend has ended when it's actually just a temporary upward movement before further declines. A bear trap does the opposite. Capitulation: Technical traders don't just \"throw in the towel\"; they capitulate. The word evokes abject and humiliating surrender in war. Bagholders: This sounds innocuous\u2014it's used for investors left holding worthless stocks\u2014but it derives from those left holding an empty bag after a robbery. Sheep getting slaughtered: Refers to naive investors following the herd into bad investments. Dead cross: There's no shortage of \"dead\" things in trading. This is when the short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, often seen as a bearish signal. More positively, the golden cross is a bullish signal. Gravestone doji: A candlestick pattern shaped like a gravestone, indicating a bearish reversal. Hanging man: Yet another candlestick pattern, shaped like a hanged man, suggesting a potential price drop coming.\n\nWhat Is Apple's Economic Moat? Apple has a few economic moats, the primary one being creating products that didn't exist before, such as the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. After creating these products, Apple's economic moat has consisted of its marketing, its design, and its user-friendly interface.\n\nWhat Company Is Considered to Have the Widest Economic Moat of All Time? While it's challenging to definitively claim any single company has the broadest economic moat of all time, many experts would point to Coca-Cola as a pretty good example of a vast and enduring moat. Warren Buffett himself has frequently praised Coca-Cola's moat, and Berkshire Hathaway has been a long-term major shareholder.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWarren Buffett's castle-and-moat metaphor is often used to illustrate how companies protect their profits from competitors. While moats can take various forms\u2014from cost advantages to brand power to network effects\u2014their true value lies in their durability.\n\nFor investors, identifying companies with wide, enduring moats can be key to long-term investment success. However, no moat is impregnable forever. Market conditions change, new technologies emerge, and consumer preferences shift. Thus, successful investing isn't just about finding companies with moats today, but anticipating how those moats might evolve or erode over time.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.",

Here\u2019s what you may have missed this week:\n\nFDA Approves Sotorasib Plus Panitumumab for KRAS G12C\u2013Mutated Colorectal Cancer\n\nThe regulatory agency cleared the combination of sotorasib (Lumakras) and panitumumab (Vectibix) for use in adult patients with KRAS G12C\u2013mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy based on findings from the phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 trial (NCT05198934). Those who received 960 mg of sotorasib plus panitumumab (n = 53) experienced a 52% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs investigator\u2019s choice of trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf) or regorafenib (Stivarga; n = 54; HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.3-0.78; P = .005).\n\nFDA OKs Acalabrutinib Plus Bendamustine/Rituximab for Previously Untreated MCL\n\nAcalabrutinib (Calquence) combined with bendamustine and rituximab (Rituxan; BR) was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who were not candidates for transplant based on findings from the phase 3 ECHO trial (NCT02972840). The median progression-free survival was 66.4 months (95% CI, 55.1-not estimable) with the triplet (n = 299) vs 49.6 months (95% CI, 36.0-64.1) with placebo/BR (n = 299), translating to a 27% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; P = .016).\n\nDato-DXd Receives FDA Priority Review in Pretreated EGFR-Mutated NSCLC\n\nThe regulatory agency granted priority review to the biologics license application (BLA) seeking the approval of datopotamab deruxtecan for use in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non\u2013small cell lung cancer who previously received systemic therapies, including an EGFR-targeted therapy. The BLA is supported by data from the following studies: phase 2 TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142), phase 3 TROPION-Lung 01 (NCT04656652), and phase 1 TROPION-PanTumor01 (NCT03401385). Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the target action date was July 12, 2025.\n\nFDA Approval of Subcutaneous Nivolumab Represents Paradigm Shift in Solid Tumor Management\n\nIn an exclusive interview with OncLive, Roxana S. Dronca, MD, a hematologist/oncologist and chair of the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, discussed the FDA approval of nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy (Opdivo Qvantig) across approved solid tumor indications. She highlighted how the decision represents a significant shift in cancer management, spotlighted the data that supported the approval, and explained how the continued development of subcutaneous approaches could impact care.\n\nPDUFA Date Set for 3-Month Variation of Leuprolide Mesylate in Advanced Prostate Cancer\n\nThe regulatory agency issued a day-75 letter stating that the goal date under the PDUFA regarding the marketing approval for the 3-month, 21-mg variation of leuprolide mesylate (Camcevi) for use in adult patients with advanced prostate cancer will be August 29, 2025. The application is based on data from a phase 3 trial (NCT03261999).\n\nHonorable Mention: FDA Approves Datopotamab Deruxtecan for Unresectable or Metastatic HR+/HER2-Negative Breast Cancer\n\nDatopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk (Datroway) was cleared by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor\u2013positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have previously received endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.",

            "content": "New Initiative in Partnership with Africa Centers for Disease Control (Africa CDC) and Local Ministries of Health Builds on Decades of Capacity Building to combat HIV and Pediatric Cancer\n\nHOUSTON, Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Texas Children's Global HOPE and Baylor College of Medicine Global Health, with support from the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, an independent charitable organization, announced the next front in their joint efforts to dramatically improve children's health in Sub-Saharan Africa with the launch of a groundbreaking program to address one of the most urgent threats facing the region: sickle cell disease (SCD).\n\nPartnership staff celebrate the program's launch in sub-Saharan Africa\n\nSickle cell disease is a lifelong, inherited disorder affecting red blood cells and is one of the leading causes of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by lifelong anemia, bone-crushing pain episodes that last for days or weeks, disability from brain strokes in childhood, and early childhood death from infections. In 2023, an estimated 7.7 million people were living with SCD, with more than 80% residing in sub-Saharan Africa. The three organizations are initially launching their joint programs in Tanzania and Uganda.\n\nIn Tanzania, Texas Children's Global HOPE Program and Baylor College of Medicine Global Health, backed by funding from the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, will collaborate with Baylor College of Medicine Children's Foundation \u2013 Tanzania, Bugando Medical Centre, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, and the Ministry of Health on the Sickle Cell Access and Lifelong Care Program (SCALE). SCALE is designed to improve the survival and quality of life for children living with sickle cell disease through early screening, infection prevention and accessible treatment.\n\nIn Uganda, starting in Kayunga, a mostly rural region, a new program led by the Ministry of Health unites Texas Children's Global HOPE, Baylor College of Medicine Global Health and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation with Baylor College of Medicine Children's Foundation-Uganda, Uganda National Health Laboratory and Diagnostic Services (UNHLDS), Makerere University, Uganda Pediatric Association and Mulago National Referral Hospital to integrate SCD care in primary health services.\n\nThe initiative, in partnership with the Africa CDC, is part of a phased approach for a broader pan-African program. With a focus on building local healthcare capacity, the program will integrate three essential lifesaving SCD interventions into primary care services: (1) screening all infants for SCD at birth or vaccination visits, (2) administering timely childhood vaccinations and penicillin to prevent fatal infections, and (3) supplying hydroxyurea, a drug that reduces sickling of blood cells to prevent complications of SCD. The program will also train local health workers and supplement medical supplies to help provide sustainable, long-term care.\n\nThis program marks the next phase of a 25-year partnership between Baylor College of Medicine Global Health, Texas Children's Global Health and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation in the region that has been transformational for children's health. In 1999, these partners launched a response to HIV/AIDS at the height of the epidemic, providing care for more than 396,000 mothers and children across the region. Their efforts helped transform pediatric HIV and AIDS from an acute health crisis to a manageable chronic disease in some countries through improved healthcare system capacity, training tens of thousands of local healthcare workers, and establishing independent foundations that operate in partnership with governments to deliver care. Texas Children's leveraged these partnerships and launched the Global HOPE Program in 2016 to address the unconscionable suffering and mortality of children with cancer, sickle cell disease and other blood diseases in Africa and similar underserved regions around the world.\n\nSince 2016, Texas Children's Global HOPE Program has trained 35 pediatric cancer and blood disease specialist doctors and 180 pediatric cancer nurses across east and southern Africa. These teams provide specialist care for about 2,500 children diagnosed with cancer every year at 12 tertiary centers in eight countries. They have treated more than 26,000 children with cancer, SCD and blood disorders to date. The dramatic improvement these African pediatric hematologists are making for children with SCD by providing basic medical interventions at tertiary centers reveals the neglect for the many more children with SCD that never make it to large city hospitals in Africa. These African specialists, in collaboration with Global HOPE, have concluded that a public health strategy for controlling SCD in Africa is urgently needed.\n\n\"In response to the outcry by the public and Ministries of Health to address sickle cell disease in Africa, together with colleagues and partners in Africa we have resolved to depart from the status quo by integrating interventions into the existing primary health systems to rapidly scale-up, save resources, and lives,\" said Dr. Joseph Lubega, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine and director of Texas Children's Global HOPE Program. \"This is the beginning of bringing an end to thousands of years of intolerable pain, disability and tragic deaths because of sickle cell disease across Africa. These children and families cannot wait any longer.\"\n\n\"Families in Sub-Saharan Africa know the devastating impact of sickle cell disease all too well,\" said Catharine Grimes, president of the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation. \"For people living outside of major urban centers, finding care is a significant challenge and sometimes not even possible. Our new initiative will integrate lifesaving early-stage interventions into primary care facilities in non-urban areas. Leveraging the infrastructure and local healthcare capacity we have already built to address previous urgent crises like HIV/AIDS, we are focused on empowering local health workers to provide sustainable, long-term care. The Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation is proud to be working in partnership with these local health care professionals to turn the tide against this dire public health threat and deliver a brighter, healthier future for families around the region.\"\n\nAbout Texas Children's\n\nTexas Children's, a nonprofit health care organization, is committed to creating a healthier future for children and women throughout the global community by leading in patient care, education and research.

            "content": "Cobenfy, the new schizophrenia drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), could be a multibillion-dollar success story in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and set the company up well as it contends with a slate of generic competition this year.\n\nTalking about the drug\u2019s potential uses, CFO David Elkins told CNBC that Alzheimer\u2019s is the \u201creally large market here.\u201d\n\nHe went on to explain that the anti-psychosis effects of the drug were important for Alzheimer\u2019s patients. \u201cIf you can get rid of the psychosis, the agitation, people\u2019s cognition improves,\u201d he said.\n\nBMY said it would release initial late-stage trial data for Cobenfy in Alzheimer\u2019s-related psychosis treatment later this year.\n\nThe drug, the first novel treatment for schizophrenia in decades, comes from its $14 billion acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics in 2023.\n\nCobenfy Holds Key for BMY Rating\n\nMoreover, his comments come as analysts are sounding bullish over the potential market for the drug, which won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September.\n\nJefferies upgraded BMY to Buy from Hold and raised its price target by $7 to $70, citing improved confidence in the company\u2019s product pipeline, more disciplined spending, and greater clarity on regulatory risks.\n\nIn particular, it highlighted how Cobenfy was set to become a $10 billion-plus product.\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) analyst Chris Schott believes Cobenfy sales may reach $5 billion by 2030 and with peak sales of around $10 billion.\n\nNew Research Shows Promise for BMY\n\nMeanwhile, researchers have published evidence this week indicating that Cobenfy may help reduce cognitive impairments in some schizophrenia patients, in addition to its previously documented effect of reducing both positive and negative symptoms of the illness.\n\nElkins was speaking on the sidelines of the at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where industry executives addressed a range of topics, including the loss of exclusivity \u201cwave.\u201d\n\nBMY\u2019s Revlimid, the multiple myeloma drug acquired in the buyout of Celgene, faces a slew of generic competitors in March before it hits a full generic market in 2026.\n\nSales of the drug were $4.4 billion in the first nine months of Fiscal year 2024, but the company expects a significant drop in 2025. Pomalyst and Sprycel, drugs that sold a combined $3.7 billion over the same nine months, are also set to face generics this year, BMY said.\n\nIn December, BMY said it had won FDA approval for an injectable version of its cancer treatment Opdivo.\n\nIs BMY a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on BMY, based on five Buys, 10 Holds and one Sell. The average BMY price target of $61.80 implies almost 10% upside from the current level. Shares have risen over 18% in the last 12 months.\n\nSee more BMY analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Looking Ahead at the Class Action Litigation Landscape in 2025\n\nClient Alert | January 17, 2025\n\nClass actions remain an active and evolving area of litigation, and we expect that trend to continue in 2025.\n\nThis update previews several important issues for class-action practitioners in the year ahead, including significant circuit splits, a noteworthy petition before the Supreme Court regarding Rule 23\u2019s \u201cascertainability\u201d requirement, and developments in mass arbitration.\n\nI. Circuit Splits to Watch in 2025\n\nClass action-related issues continue to percolate through the federal courts of appeals, with several circuit splits that deepened in 2024 growing potentially ripe for Supreme Court review. This section highlights circuit splits on standing in class actions, personal jurisdiction, and standards for expert evidence at the class-certification phase.\n\nA. Standing in Class Actions\n\nCourts continue to grapple with how Article III standing principles affect class actions. As summarized in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Chavez v. Plan Benefit Services, Inc., 108 F.4th 297 (5th Cir. 2024), the courts of appeals have taken varying approaches to implementing Article III requirements in class actions, including: (1) the \u201cstanding\u201d approach, and (2) the \u201cclass certification\u201d approach. Id. at 308-11.\n\nUnder the \u201cstanding\u201d approach\u2014adopted by the Second, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits\u2014named plaintiffs must establish Article III standing for themselves and absent class members before courts can proceed to a Rule 23 certification analysis. Chavez, 108 F.4th at 309-11. Although the specific approach varies somewhat by circuit, it generally requires class representatives to show they have the \u201csame interest[s] and \u201csame injur[ies]\u201d as the putative class. Id. at 311.\n\nBy contrast, under the \u201cclass certification\u201d approach\u2014adopted by the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits\u2014courts include these standing questions as part of \u201cthe Rule 23 inquiry.\u201d Id. at 312. According to the Fifth Circuit, courts following this approach do so to separate Article III\u2019s standing requirements with Rule 23\u2019s requirements, and thus focus on \u201cthe relationship between the class representative and the passive class members.\u201d Id. at 309.\n\nThere remain important questions about how to square these approaches with the Supreme Court\u2019s insistence that Article III principles apply equally in class actions. As the Fifth Circuit observed, the Supreme Court has \u201ccaution[ed] against dispensing standing \u2018in gross\u2019 in a class-action context\u201d\u2014and emphasized that plaintiffs must always \u201cdemonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each form of relief that they seek.\u201d Id. at 307 (quoting TransUnion, LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)); see also TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cEvery class member must have Article III standing in order to recover individual damages.\u201d). But it seems we will have to wait before there is more clarity on this issue: although the defendants in Chavez filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court denied the petition in December. So at least for now, the split will persist\u2014though it may only be a matter of time before the Supreme Court provides guidance.\n\nB. Personal Jurisdiction in FLSA Collective Actions\n\nWe previously addressed a circuit split on the issue of personal jurisdiction in collective actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), specifically regarding whether out-of-state plaintiffs can join an FLSA action filed in a state where the defendant is not subject to general personal jurisdiction. This circuit split stems from competing interpretations of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court, 582 U.S. 255 (2017), which addressed personal jurisdiction in mass actions, but did not explicitly address FLSA collective actions.\n\nSince the Supreme Court decided Bristol-Myers Squibb, the Third, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held that the jurisdictional analysis in Bristol-Myers Squibb, which requires a \u201cclaim-by-claim personal jurisdiction analysis\u201d in mass actions, also applies to FLSA collective actions. Fischer v. Fed. Express Corp., 42 F.4th 366, 375 (3d Cir. 2022); Canaday v. Anthem Cos., Inc., 9 F.4th 392, 397 (6th Cir. 2021); Vallone v. CJS Sols. Grp., LLC, 9 F.4th 861, 865 (8th Cir. 2021). By contrast, only the First Circuit has declined to follow that line of decisions and instead has held that courts need not have personal jurisdiction over every opt-in plaintiff in FLSA cases. See Waters v. Day & Zimmerman NPS, Inc., 23 F.4th 84, 93 (1st Cir. 2022).\n\nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision is the clear outlier among the circuits, with the momentum in favor of the majority approach adopted by more and more circuits. For example, this past year, in Vanegas v. Signet Builders, Inc., 113 F.4th 718 (7th Cir. 2024), the Seventh Circuit joined the majority of circuits in holding that opt-in plaintiffs must each satisfy personal jurisdiction requirements to participate in FLSA collective actions. Id. at 724. The court explained that an FLSA collective action is like a mass action because it is a \u201cconsolidation of individual cases, brought by individual plaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 725.\n\nWhile it remains unsettled whether the same rule applies to absent class members in Rule 23 class actions, the growing agreement among the circuits suggests that companies should expect their home jurisdictions to be the preferred venue for plaintiffs filing nationwide collective actions\u2014meaning jurisdictional defenses will remain an important consideration when defending such actions in other forums.\n\nC. Standards for Expert Evidence at Class Certification\n\nParties often rely on expert evidence when litigating class-certification motions, and one important question that practitioners routinely confront is to what extent the admissibility of such expert evidence should affect the class-certification analysis. We earlier previewed a developing circuit split on the intersection between Daubert admissibility analysis and class certification. On one side of the split, the Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits require a full Daubert analysis and a finding that expert evidence is admissible before it can support class certification. In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., , 186-88 (3d Cir. 2015); Prantil v. Arkema Inc., 986 F.3d 570, 575-76 (5th Cir. 2021); Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Allen, 600 F.3d 813, 815-16 (7th Cir. 2010). On the other side of the split, the Eighth Circuit has applied a more flexible approach for examining expert evidence regarding class certification. In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prods. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 611-14 (8th Cir. 2011).\n\nThis circuit split is poised to persist into 2025, with no clear consensus emerging. The Sixth and Ninth Circuits entered the fray this past year, with the Sixth Circuit joining the majority and the Ninth Circuit apparently siding with the minority:\n\nIn In re Nissan North America, Inc. Litigation, 122 F.4th 239 (6th Cir. 2024), the Sixth Circuit reasoned that \u201c[i]f expert testimony is insufficiently reliable to satisfy Daubert, it cannot prove that the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been met in fact through acceptable evidentiary proof.\u201d at 253 (internal quotation marks omitted); see In re Nissan N. Am., Inc. Litig., 122 F.4th 239, 253 (6th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[t]he Supreme Court requires parties to \u2018satisfy through evidentiary proof\u2019 that they \u2018in fact\u2019 meet the elements\u201d of Rule 23). The Sixth Circuit therefore held that where expert evidence is \u201cmaterial to class certification,\u201d it must satisfy Daubert. Nissan, 122 F.4th at 253.\n\nBy contrast, the Ninth Circuit recently held that plaintiffs may rely on evidence that is not admissible to support class certification and that a district court need conduct only a \u201climited\u201d Daubert analysis at the class-certification stage, even if an expert\u2019s model is not \u201cfully developed.\u201d Lytle v. Nutramax Labs., Inc., 99 F.4th 557, 570-71, 576-77 (9th Cir. 2024). The Ninth Circuit based its holding on the \u201ctemporal focus of the class certification inquiry,\u201d reasoning that \u201cclass action plaintiffs are not required to actually prove their case\u201d at class certification, but rather \u201cmust show that they will be able to prove their case through common proof at trial.\u201d at 570. Notably, the holding in Lytle appears at odds with Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc), in which the Ninth Circuit held en banc that plaintiffs \u201cmay use any admissible evidence\u201d to satisfy their burden at class certification (id. at 665 (emphasis added)) and that defendants \u201cmay challenge the reliability of an expert\u2019s evidence under Daubert\u201d when opposing class certification (id. at 665 n.7).\n\nThe defendants in Lytle petitioned for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to rule on whether a district court may rely on inadmissible expert evidence to certify a class under Rule 23. As argued in the petition, the less stringent approach described in Lytle is particularly dangerous because it \u201callows putative class counsel to choose what evidentiary standard applies,\u201d and \u201cexpert testimony that is less developed receives less scrutiny.\u201d Nutramax Labs., Inc. v. Lytle, No. 24-576, 2024 WL 4904592, at *15 (U.S. Nov. 21, 2024). The petition remains pending.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously expressed doubt that Daubert was not applicable to expert testimony at the class-certification stage. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 354 (2011). Until the Supreme Court provides clarification, parties and practitioners should carefully consider their approach to relying on and opposing expert evidence at the class-certification stage, particularly in jurisdictions like the Eighth or Ninth Circuits (or those that have yet to address the role of Daubert at class certification). Given the possibility for Supreme Court review, litigants should ensure that their own expert evidence satisfies Daubert, consider mounting Daubert challenges to opposing expert evidence to preserve claims of error, and ask courts to make clear findings regarding admissibility of expert evidence to best position their cases for review in the event the Supreme Court decides this issue.\n\nII. Ascertainability at the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court continues to receive cert petitions that raise interesting and recurring issues in the class-action space. There is one such petition pending on an oft-litigated issue: whether Rule 23 embodies an \u201cascertainability requirement\u201d that obliges plaintiffs to offer \u201cobjective criteria\u201d by which class members are \u201creadily identifiable\u201d in reference to objective criteria. As discussed in last year\u2019s article, courts have taken different approaches to ascertainability, with no clear consensus among the circuits.\n\nThe pending cert petition seeks review of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in Career Counseling, Inc. v. AmeriFactors Financial Group, LLC, 91 F.4th 202 (4th Cir. 2024), which reaffirmed that Rule 23 contains an ascertainability requirement. The case involves a putative class action alleging that a company sent unsolicited fax advertisements to 59,000 recipients in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The district court denied class certification, holding that the putative class failed to satisfy Rule 23\u2019s implicit threshold requirement of ascertainability. Id. at 207. Specifically, the district court reasoned that the individuals eligible for class membership were not \u201creadily identifiable\u201d because only those who received the advertisements through \u201cstand-alone\u201d fax machines (rather than online fax services) could maintain a TCPA claim, and there was no way to readily identify those with stand-alone fax machines. Id. In affirming the denial of class certification, the Fourth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that there is no implicit ascertainability requirement under Rule 23. Id. at 209.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a cert petition that asks the Supreme Court to settle whether \u201cadministrative feasibility\u201d stands as a distinct prerequisite to class certification, or instead sits as one of several prudential factors for courts to consider in their Rule 23(b)(3) superiority analysis. See Career Counseling v. Amerifactors Fin. Grp., No. 24-86, 2024 WL 3569079, at *11 (U.S. July 19, 2024). This is the latest of several cert petitions to have raised this question in the past few years; although the Supreme Court has not taken the question up yet, this is certainly an issue that many are eagerly watching.\n\nIII. Continued Judicial Scrutiny of Dispute-Resolution Agreements and Evolving Strategies to Manage Mass Arbitration Risk\n\nMass arbitration is becoming one of the largest legal threats to companies, with a sophisticated plaintiff\u2019s bar implementing novel strategies to take advantage of arbitration agreements to exert settlement pressure on defendants. We see no signs of this trend slowing in 2025, and companies have responded to this threat with dispute-resolution provisions that encourage the efficient resolution of individual disputes\u2014all the while disincentivizing plaintiff\u2019s attorneys from initiating \u201cmass arbitration\u201d campaigns that benefit no one other than themselves.\n\nCourts have begun to review these efforts to curb the risk of exploitative mass arbitration. In Heckman v. Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., 120 F.4th 670 (9th Cir. 2024), the court has declined to enforce an arbitration agreement based on its conclusion that the arbitration provider\u2019s rules were \u201cinternally inconsistent, poorly drafted, and riddled with typos,\u201d and that \u201ccounsel struggled to explain the Rules at oral argument.\u201d Id. at 677-78.\n\nThe court determined that defendants\u2019 \u201cmarket dominance\u201d in the ticket services industries supported a finding that the contract was adhesive, further supporting a finding of unconscionability. Id. at 682. The court also ruled that a provision permitting unilateral modification of the terms without prior notice rendered the clause \u201cprocedurally unconscionable\u201d under California law. Id. at 682-83.\n\nAs to substantive unconscionability, the court expressed three concerns. First, the defendant\u2019s \u201cbellwether\u201d process\u2014which would bind future claimants to a single arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the validity of the delegation clause in both bellwether and non-bellwether cases\u2014effectively deprived the non-bellwether claimants of their right to be heard or otherwise participate in proceedings that could affect their rights. Id. at 684-85. Second, the arbitration rules also restricted discovery and the evidence that could be presented. Id. at 685-86. And third, the claimants were bound by what the court viewed as a functionally \u201casymmetrical\u201d appeal provision, leaving them without a right to appeal any denial of injunctive relief. Id. at 686.\n\nHeckman did not reach several types of clauses that have been used to address \u201cmass arbitration\u201d abuses such as pre-dispute informal dispute resolution clauses, individualized arbitration demand requirements, cost-splitting provisions, and fee-shifting for frivolous claims. And courts already have upheld \u201cbatching\u201d clauses post-Heckman. See, e.g., Kohler v. Whaleco, Inc., 2024 WL 4887538, at *9 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2024) (post-Heckman decision holding that batching provision in arbitration agreement did not make delegation clause unconscionable). Given the rapidly evolving case law and differing approaches to the review of arbitration provisions, companies should analyze their clauses on a regular basis.\n\nThe following Gibson Dunn lawyers contributed to this update: Jessica Pearigen, Vannalee Cayabyab, Psi Simon, Matt Aidan Getz, Wesley Sze, Lauren Blas, Bradley Hamburger, Kahn Scolnick, and Christopher Chorba.\n\nGibson Dunn attorneys are available to assist in addressing any questions you may have regarding these developments.

            "content": "Who remembers the days when New Jersey was really thought of as the Garden State? Not that we're far removed from that today, but a lot has changed over the years.\n\nI myself grew up in Brick and have witnessed this transformation firsthand. I remember when I was just a kid in the early 1990s how rural the town once was. The Brick Plaza was mostly run down, and the ShopRite stood mainly alone.\n\nI also remember a lot of woods everywhere, and no crowded highways. Even before I was born, my family owned an old farmhouse that sat on an actual farm in the town. Today, it's a full-fledged development that surrounds the old house that's held up by actual tree logs in the basement.\n\nBut that farm existed well before I was born. As for the change I've seen? Well, I've seen the town of Brick transform from a quiet nothing town to the overcrowded and overdeveloped shore town that it is today. And I watched that all happen in the span of a decade, with really no signs of slowing down even today.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, Brick is a great town. It's my childhood town, after all (Go Dragons!), but it's just not the same as it was when I was raised there. The sleepy shore town I once knew no longer exists.\n\nLittle could I imagine that I'd see growth happen at an even faster rate as time went on. However, with more and more people looking to move into New Jersey, that development has only accelerated.\n\nUnless you're in a protected area, it's really hard to know when overdevelopment will hit your part of the state. Just think about a large patch of woods somewhere in the state that perhaps existed not too long ago.\n\nNow think about how quickly those woods came down, only for dozens and dozens of oversized family homes to be built in place. If this were a one-off situation, I wouldn't think twice about it. But from my observations, these oversized developments are springing up all over the state at an alarming rate.\n\nNJ / Open Space / Housing Development Canva (Townsquare Illustration) loading...\n\nAnd what happens right after? We suddenly have more deer being hit by cars because they have nowhere to go. Or, rodents are suddenly becoming an issue because they have nowhere to go.\n\nOr - and this is a big one - the flooding risk becomes much more dire because water from rainstorms has nowhere else to go. Without the land for it to absorb into, it just becomes a flash flooding emergency.\n\nBut I don't need to tell you this. Just think about how much flooding now occurs thanks in part to overdevelopment. It's just my opinion, but I feel something needs to be done to at least slow the rates of these developments locals want nothing to do with.\n\nAnd it's not just the woods coming down that's a concern. Sometimes, certain large facilities closing down also spark fear of more unnecessary housing developments moving in.\n\nExterior of the Freehold Raceway track Exterior of the Freehold Raceway track (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) loading...\n\nTake the old Freehold Raceway, for example. What will happen there? Will it also be bulldozed and transformed into hundreds of oversized homes? If that happens, the biggest conclusion most will draw from it is money. More money for the town, and more unnecessary traffic for the rest of us.\n\nNow, I personally don't know what they're going to do with that land yet, but I propose they somehow make it an extension of the existing mall. Perhaps, an area the mall can add rides at? An area that can be connected by a walk path or roadway connected by an overpass to cross Route 9.\n\nI mean, the American Dream Mall has rides, so why not let the Freehold Raceway Mall view this as an opportunity for them to go that route? I feel something like that would be much more welcomed than just putting up hundreds of unwanted homes that'll cause more problems than they're worth.\n\nUnfortunately, that's what triggers the worry with most New Jerseyans when it comes to new development. And if homes are built, that fear turns into anger.\n\nCanva/Townsquare Media illustration Canva/Townsquare Media illustration loading...\n\nNot too far from the now former Freehold Raceway is another area of development. Not in Freehold, but the next town over.\n\nJust east traveling along County Route 537, you'll see another area of development underway. It's an area between Colts Neck High School and Route 18.\n\nWhat was previously a huge patch of trees is now completely stripped away. It honestly feels like this over-development is never-ending sometimes.\n\nColt's Neck, NJ - Development Google Maps via Canva Edit (Townsquare Illustration) loading...\n\nLook, it's not that we don't want anyone else to move here. We're just tired of watching our state become less and less green as a result, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe Garden State slogan won't be much longer if we don't slow it down soon with all this overdevelopment with oversized homes. If we keep building homes at the rate we do now, we should consider changing our slogan to the endless construction state.\n\nBiggest NJ company layoffs announced in 2024 New Jersey saw over 14,000 total layoffs in 2023, according to WARN data.

            "content": "David Lat linked to a November 2017 profile of Tom Goldstein in the University of North Carolina alumni magazine. He was interviewed in April 2017. In that period, he had two back-to-back oral arguments in California Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc. (4/17/2017) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California (4/25/2017). In my post yesterday, I listed some of the allegations made in the indictment from that time frame, which involved high stakes poker games, suffering losses of nearly $10 million, and moving funds around from the firm to pay those debts.\n\nHere is how the alumni magazine described his experiences during that time:\n\nOn a Sunday in April, Goldstein secluded himself in a 10th-floor suite at the Park Hyatt Washington hotel. For two days before every Supreme Court appearance, he leaves home to focus. . . .\n\nIn stories from his younger years, Goldstein came across as larger than life, dabbling in high-stakes poker and once shipping a Ferrari to Las Vegas for a drag race. In person, he's soft-spoken and selfeffacing. He gave up poker. He traded the Ferrari for a Tesla P100D (still fast, but with room for the kids). He quit posting YouTube spoofs about his work. These days, most of what he talks about are legal briefs and oral arguments. \"I think most people,\" he said, \"would find what I do boring.\"\n\nThat evening, Howe planned to bring their daughters down for dinner from their home in Chevy Chase \u2014 eating together is a family commitment they rarely forfeit, not even for the Supreme Court. But other than a rare break for an interview, at the Hyatt there were few distractions. \"When I left home last night, the dog started throwing up and my daughter was sick so it was just good fortune that I had separated myself, and then I'll be back home on Monday,\" Goldstein said. \"Now it's just a question of putting it all together, refining the answers, filling in all the little holes of what I don't know. That sort of thing. \u2026 I'll learn things until the last possible minute.\" . . .\n\n\"We're a good team,\" Howe said. Said Goldstein: \"I wouldn't have time to do what I do without all she does with the family and the blog. And my law practice makes her job possible. So each of us contributes equally to the success of the other. \u2026 The only time we've had a problem is when there's been a hierarchy. We figured that out so we're never in an environment where one reports to another.\" . . .\n\nHowe, who blogged about Neil Gorsuch's first day on the court that morning, took a seat in the spectator section to watch her husband's argument. She doesn't write about his cases; Columbia Law School professor Ronald Mann covered the hearing for SCOTUSblog. Goldstein was up against Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who is considered a leading contender for justice if there's another opening under President Donald Trump. \"One of the things I love about what I do is that the people on the other side that you're dealing with are super talented,\" Goldstein said. \"They push you. You cannot sleep on any case. The other side is going to make all the best arguments that can be made, in the best way they can be made. It really causes you to up your game. I find other places where you can just wing it very boring.\"",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With the close of J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, attention turns to next week\u2019s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, and what his administration might mean for the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBy and large, pharma executives and investors here are largely saying they remain confident in the stability of regulatory processes, despite headlines around the potential for disruption. Some aren\u2019t expecting much to change if Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou might politically look at some of his views in question, but scientifically, people believe that he's quite strong when he drives and makes decisions based on rational inputs,\u201d said Andy Plump, president of R&D at Takeda Pharmaceuticals.\n\nEven if Makary or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump\u2019s named to lead HHS, were to place new scrutiny on the approval of vaccines or other drugs, there are checks in the overall system, said Chris Bardon, co-managing partner of life science investment firm MPM BioImpact.\n\n\"In most situations, political appointees don't really change much,\u201d Bardon said. \u201cThe people who are just doing their job every day, processing applications, reviewing data, working with companies? None of that's going to change.\u201d\n\nYet the FDA will be without a number of veteran leaders, including Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus and Patrizia Cavazzoni, who have stepped down or announced plans to depart since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nExpect more details on Trump\u2019s healthcare agenda in the coming weeks as the Senate vets both Kennedy and Makary. In the meantime, here are few other highlights from BioPharma Dive\u2019s time covering the JPM meeting.\n\nWhere are the generalists?\n\nBiotech\u2019s winter could last well past the changing of the seasons this year, if you ask analysts at HSBC Innovation Banking. Though some in the industry are optimistic, others, HSBC among them, see headwinds from interest rates and the potential for regulatory instability from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Uncertainty always creates volatility, and volatility is not great for the public markets,\u201d said Rebecca Stevenson, head of healthcare investment banking in the Americas for HSBC. \u201cUltimately the dust needs to settle before we see generalist [investors] back in. Is that happening in the next six months? Probably not.\"\n\nAnalysts have pointed to the retreat of generalist investors, who park their funds across sectors, from biotech public offerings as one reason for depressed IPO performance.\n\n\"The only thing you could chase during the pandemic was healthcare so they're all overindexed on healthcare,\" Stevenson said. \"They\u2019ve got to get those positions down.\u201d\n\nFor many to come back in, dealmaking needs to pick up and remain high. While HSBC views the pace of private market M&A as \u201csolid,\u201d deals for public companies were noticeably less last year. (J&J offered some respite on the latter front Monday, bidding nearly $15 billion to buy Intra-Cellular Therapies.)\n\nTwo factors have been at play, Stevenson said: Large-cap consolidation has seemed off the table under the Biden administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission, but also, there are relatively few assets with the commercial impact and revenue pharma companies look for to justify major deals.\n\nInvestors are also keeping an eye on geopolitical tensions, such as competition between the U.S. and China, and guidance on upcoming interest rate cuts. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nExplaining Lilly\u2019s missed forecast\n\nEli Lilly disappointed investors hours before CEO David Ricks\u2019 appearance at JPM, when it announced 2024 revenue that fell short of the financial guidance it gave Wall Street only months ago. Speaking to many of those investors Tuesday afternoon, Ricks outlined some of the reasons why.\n\nPrescription growth for many chronic diseases is higher in December than in most other months, so Lilly assumed that would be the case with its GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, which didn\u2019t come true, Ricks said. That might have been because of how insurers handle new prescriptions, but the company doesn\u2019t exactly know why. \u201cNonetheless, it happened, and we didn't predict it,\u201d he said.\n\nUnpredictable decisions by distributors and wholesalers on how much supply to stock also played a role, he said. \u201cThe economics in our distribution channels aren't great right now, and they're really preserving their working capital,\u201d Ricks said.\n\nThose mistakes have helped Lilly better understand GLP-1 market dynamics, particularly in the relatively new obesity indication where Zepbound is prescribed.\n\n\u201cIt's our job to give good guidance to the street, and we aim to land within that guidance normally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I think we're dealing with a business here that is pretty unprecedented in our sector in terms of size and scale and growth rate, and we've learned a few things.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAbbVie reassessing psychiatry\n\nAbbVie\u2019s $8.7 billion purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics last year was a big bet om emraclidine, an experimental drug for schizophrenia designed in similar fashion to another Bristol Myers Squibb had acquired by buying Karuna Therapeutics.\n\nWhile Karuna\u2019s drug is now approved in the U.S. as Cobenfy, Cerevel\u2019s unexpectedly fell short in two Phase 2 trials last November. The failure cost AbbVie billions of dollars in market value and left analysts stunned. Last week, AbbVie took a roughly $3.5 billion impairment charge to reflect the setback\u2019s impact on its books.\n\nThe drug hasn\u2019t been completely cast aside, AbbVie executives told investors at the JPM Wednesday. \u201cWe're still studying it,\u201d said CEO Robert Michael. \u201cWe still think emraclidine can play a role.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company appears to be rethinking the investment it commits to neuropsychiatry more broadly.\n\n\u201cCommitting that much capital on early data, we'd certainly rethink that in psych,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThat said, we weren't the only party that was bidding for Cerevel. They saw the same thing we did.\u201d\n\nBut AbbVie remains willing to take \u201ccalculated risks,\u201d Michael added, citing the company\u2019s track record in adding important assets like Skyrizi and Imbruvica through dealmaking. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nNovartis\u2019 dealmaking plans\n\nNovartis spent billions of dollars snapping up companies in 2023 and 2024, from radiopharmaceutical developer Mariana Oncology to Kate Therapeutics and its experimental gene therapies. The company will remain an active dealmaker in 2025, according to Fiona Marshall, Novartis\u2019 president of biomedical research.\n\nIn an interview with BioPharma Dive Tuesday, Marshall said the pharmaceutical company is open to bringing in a variety of early-stage assets, even if its own R&D teams are developing their own versions or working on similar technology. It picked up Mariana, which had a radiopharma drug in development for small cell lung cancer, expanding a pipeline that already contained the radiopharma therapies Pluvicto and Lutathera.\n\n\u201cSo often, it's having our own program that makes us really like the project, and then if we see somebody else is doing it better than us externally, we'll still bring that in,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite cooling interest in gene therapy due to persistent challenges, Novartis is still bullish on the field and on assets it acquired via deals for Kate as well as for DTx Pharma in 2023. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nBen Fidler contributed reporting.",

            "content": "When Gury Doshi, MD, learned that a patient\u2019s insurance didn\u2019t cover her breast cancer medication, Doshi had a potential workaround. The patient could try to bypass the insurer and access the drug at little or no cost through a patient assistance program hosted by the drug manufacturer.\n\nAlmost all major pharmaceutical companies offer this type of financial assistance to patients who meet certain eligibility criteria, which has generally included those who are uninsured or underinsured and likely wouldn\u2019t be able to afford such expensive prescriptions.\n\nEstimates suggested that companies spend about $4 billion a year to keep these financial assistance programs running, and the programs include steep discounts for more than 300 drugs overall.\n\nAs Doshi soon discovered, the list included the breast cancer drug her patient needed.\n\nThe 59-year-old patient was approved for the drugmaker\u2019s patient assistance program and soon began receiving the oral breast cancer agent at no cost, said Doshi, a medical oncologist and hematologist at Texas Oncology in Houston.\n\nHowever, the drugmaker recently announced that patients with commercial health insurance would no longer be eligible for its patient assistance program starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen for her,\u201d Doshi explained. \u201cIt\u2019s very disconcerting to say, \u2018We were able to work things out to get you started on medication, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next year.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very traumatizing for patients,\u201d Doshi said.\n\nOncologists and patients across the country are increasingly encountering this problem, as more drug manufacturers are banning or restricting commercially insured patients from their patient assistance programs. Since 2023, several major drug manufacturers \u2014 AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and most recently Novartis \u2014 made this move, leaving thousands of previously eligible patients without this financial support. After facing pushback, however, AstraZeneca changed course in late 2024 and began allowing certain eligible commercially-insured patients to enter its AZ&Me program again. According to the company, these may include patients who have been denied coverage by their plan, who have exhausted their copay benefit, or who don\u2019t have a prescription plan as part of their benefit.\n\nOutside of patient assistance programs, which often provide the most comprehensive help, patients have several other pharmacy assistance options, such as copay assistance or foundation-based grants. And about one third of patients prescribed oral anticancer drugs rely on either pharmaceutical company\u2013 or foundation-sponsored financial assistance programs.\n\n\u201cMany of our patients are only able to access these life-saving or life-prolonging therapies through assistance programs as their copays would otherwise be prohibitive,\u201d Meera Ragavan, MD, MPH, a medical oncologist at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, told Medscape Medical News.\n\nBut with drug companies tightening access to this essential financial lifeline, patients and oncologists are left scrambling to find other ways to get these treatments.\n\nInside Insurer Cost-Shifting\n\nWhat\u2019s fueling patients\u2019 growing reliance on pharmacy assistance programs?\n\nThere are several key factors at play here.\n\nFirst, cancer drugs are getting more expensive. The average annual cost of new cancer drugs in the United States rose by 53% between 2017 and 2021, from $185,000 to more than $283,000 a year, according to The Lancet Oncology.\n\nSecond, insurance companies are increasingly restricting the cancer drugs they will cover and finding ways to defer the costs of these expensive agents to others. About 1 in 4 patients say their commercial health plan deems their specialty medication to be a \u201cnonessential health benefit,\u201d according to a 2023 poll from the PAN Foundation, a healthcare advocacy organization. The poll found that about 1 in 3 respondents said their plan directed them to find financial assistance for their specialty medication. The same percentage were told that any financial aid they received for their specialty medication would not count toward their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nIn fact, the existence of patient assistance programs may provide \u201clittle incentive for payors to provide robust coverage of specialty drugs or for manufacturers to lower drug prices,\u201d Ragavan and colleagues wrote in their review.\n\nIn recent years, insurers have been ramping up cost-shifting strategies to reduce their own spending on expensive drugs. These strategies include copay accumulator and maximizer programs as well as alternative funding programs, all run by third parties.\n\nWith copay accumulator programs, patients receive a copay card from the manufacturer with a fixed amount to help them pay for the drug. The caveat to a copay card is the funds do not count towards a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket maximums and, depending on the amount and the cost of the drug, the funds can be depleted quickly.\n\nCopay maximizer programs are features of an insurance plan that maximize the amount of manufacturer copay assistance a patient receives. When patients enroll in these programs, a third party determines the maximum amount of copay assistance available from the manufacturer and the insurance plan sets the patient\u2019s copay to that amount. However, these programs also bar the manufacturer\u2019s payments from counting toward a patient\u2019s deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy insurance, you figure you\u2019ve got a deductible and you\u2019ve got some copays, but eventually you\u2019ll get to the place where the insurance company picks up the whole burden,\u201d said Barbara L. McAneny, MD, a medical oncologist/hematologist who practices in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area. \u201cThat\u2019s how insurance works. But with copay accumulators and maximizers, [insurers] play games in such a way that the patients can never get to their complete out-of-pocket max.\u201d\n\nThe third-party vendors that run alternative funding programs claim to help employers reduce their healthcare costs by assuming a health plan\u2019s responsibility for covering specialty drugs. Under these programs, insurance plans define specialty medications as nonessential and notify patients they must enroll in an alternative funding program to get the medication they need. Alternative funding programs, however, generally exclude or deny specialty drugs and then help patients access the medications through drugmaker patient assistance programs. In most cases, patients are required to work with alternative funding programs or are left paying the full cost of their medications.\n\nCopay accumulator and maximizer programs as well as alternative funding programs are now common among commercial insurance plans, according to a 2024 analysis. In 2022, an estimated 39% of commercially insured patients were enrolled in plans with copay accumulators, 41% had plans with copay maximizers, and 12% were enrolled in plans with alternative funding programs, according to the study.\n\nWith oral anticancer agents getting more expensive, patients may be relying more heavily on financial assistance programs, and this growing reliance may be driving drug companies to limit patients\u2019 eligibility.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association for pharmaceutical manufacturers, the wave of pharmacy assistance program restrictions is a reaction to the increasing coverage restrictions from insurers.\n\nWhen asked directly by Medscape Medical News, however, drug companies did not address this specific claim.\n\nIn 2024, Pfizer announced that it would no longer accept new commercially insured oncology patients into its patient assistance program. A spokesperson for Pfizer said its patient assistance program is \u201cdesigned to serve patients with the greatest financial need,\u201d and as more options become available to help patients afford their medicines, Pfizer reviews and updates the eligibility criteria of its patient assistance program to ensure the company can continue to provide a wide range of medicine free of cost to eligible patients, the spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that these changes may affect some of our patients and are working to ensure a smooth transition,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nA spokesperson for AstraZeneca noted that its AZ&Me patient assistance program was never designed for patients with commercial insurance. Although that option was removed after July 2023 \u201cto protect the integrity of the program,\u201d the company backtracked late last year and began allowing commercially insured patients once again.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the drug companies are figuring out real quick, \u2018I\u2019m not playing this game anymore. You\u2019re making these patients pay all these premiums, but you\u2019re not actually wanting to help the patient and pay for their drugs.\u2019\u201d said Lindsey Scott, manager of pharmacy services for Texas Oncology. \u201cThe drugmakers are sick of it, so they\u2019re refusing to accept commercially-insured patients into their patient assistance programs.\u201d\n\nBut, Scott said, this tug of war between health insurers and drug companies ultimately \u201cleaves the patient right smack in the middle.\u201d\n\nRestrictions Put Patients in Jeopardy\n\nFor patients who have been taking cancer medications for years, the new restrictions to patient assistance programs are disrupting regimens and putting progress at risk, said Brooke Looney, PharmD, a clinical pharmacist with the outpatient oncology specialty pharmacy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nLooney recalled a grocery store employee in his 40s whose oral cancer treatments had kept his metastatic melanoma under control for 4 years. The total price for his two medications is $45,000 a month. The patient\u2019s commercial insurance includes a pharmacy benefit plan that covers up to 45% of specialty medications.\n\nIn past years, the patient used a copay card, which allotted $25,000 a year toward his out-of-pocket costs, said Looney, who provides access support to patients on oral anticancer medications at Vanderbilt. After the card was maxed out, the patient qualified for the drugmaker\u2019s patient assistance program, which paid the remaining cost.\n\nBut in 2024, the patient was excluded from the financial assistance program because commercial insurance was no longer allowed, Looney said. That means, after about 1 month of copay help, the patient would be left paying about $25,000 a month.\n\nFor months, Looney and her team exhausted all efforts trying to help the patient pay for his medication, appealing to his human resources department, the pharmacy plan, and the drugmaker.\n\nBut nothing worked.\n\n\u201cThe patient worried how he would continue the medication that had worked for 4 years to keep him stable and stop his disease from progressing,\u201d Looney said. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018We\u2019ve got to keep fighting because there\u2019s no way we can let this patient go off therapy.\u2019\u201d\n\nLooney\u2019s team supplemented the patient with samples of the medications while they continued to write letters, make calls, and search for financial assistance, she said.\n\nFinally, the team secured more funding for him through an internal assistance program run by the pharmacy that contracts with his insurer. The program agreed to cover the remaining medication costs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our Band-Aid\u201d for now, Looney said. But \u201cit makes me nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that pharmacy ever deems him ineligible, or they change their parameters, it\u2019s going to come back to us again to try to figure out how to get him the medication,\u201d Looney said.\n\nCancer care center staff often work tirelessly to help patients access their medication, but much of the burden can fall on patients, Doshi added. Some plans or human resources departments will only discuss financial matters with patients, and patients are frequently forced to endure endless back-and-forth, she said.\n\nPatients left with paying high out-of-pocket costs for cancer medications are at greater risk for forging their treatment.\n\nA study in the Journal for Clinical Oncology found that higher out-of-pocket costs were associated with increased rates of delayed initiation and abandonment of insurer-approved prescriptions for a new course of therapy with a novel oral anticancer agent.\n\nAlmost half the patients who faced out-of-pocket costs of more than $2000 for their first prescription, abandoned their approved oral anticancer prescription at the pharmacy.\n\n\u201cCertainly, any delay in initiating cancer treatment delays [successful] outcomes,\u201d Doshi said. \u201cBecause of the patient assistance program exclusions, we are seeing delays in patients starting on medication, and that delay in starting treatment or having access to treatment has a negative impact on their disease and on their life.\u201d\n\nIs There an Answer?\n\nAlthough the oncology community has issued sharp criticism against insurers and the third-party companies behind the copay and alternative funding programs, there has been no overarching solution so far.\n\nIn some cases, drug companies have taken legal action against third-party vendors for allegedly taking advantage of their assistance programs.\n\nIn 2023, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against SaveOnSP, a copay assistance program. SaveOnSP is run by Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager owned by health insurance giant Cigna, and works with specialty pharmacy Accredo Health Group, Inc.\n\nIn the suit, Johnson & Johnson claimed the copay assistance program had been inflating copays for certain medications and then billing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s copay assistance program, Janssen CarePath.\n\nInflating patient copays ultimately reduces what health insurers pay for these drugs and \u201cextracts patient assistance support away from Janssen CarePath for the financial benefit of SaveOnSP and its partners,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nAbbVie filed a similar lawsuit against the alternative funding plan, Payer Matrix, in 2023 in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In that case, AbbVie alleged Payer Matrix employs a fraudulent scheme that exploits AbbVie\u2019s charitable assistance program.\n\nPayer Matrix has denied the allegations and contends it\u2019s a \u201cpioneering advocacy organization\u201d that partners with employer groups nationwide to \u201cmitigate the financial risk associated with the ever-rising costs of these types of drugs,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nOncologists and patient advocates say alternative funding programs are more challenging to regulate but some states have passed copay accumulator legislation. At least 19 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have laws requiring insurers to count copay assistance toward patients\u2019 deductibles. And in 2024, Tennessee proposed legislation that would prohibit insurer, pharmacy benefits manager, or a third party from altering health insurance coverage benefits based on the availability of financial assistance for a prescription drug.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to bring awareness at the state legislature levels, and we actively continue to work through societies like Community Oncology Alliance and with our health policy leadership through US Oncology,\u201d Doshi said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones speaking out on behalf of patients. The burden is too much to put on the backs of cancer patients.\u201d\n\nAlicia Gallegos is a freelance healthcare reporter based in the Midwest.",

Morgan Healthcare Conference added up to the largest M&A turnout in years. How does that brief January flurry compare to previous years?\n\nJohnson & Johnson led the charge with the biggest deal announced during the conference since at least 2018, revealing the pharma giant is in line to buy neuropsychiatric biotech Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion. GSK also joined the fray this year with a $1 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker IDRx.\n\nThe M&A rebound has been years in the making as companies like J&J and GSK face a patent cliff that threatens billions in revenue, and they need to pump up their pipelines to adjust to the coming storm, experts have observed.\n\nThe deals this week, while pointing to a general upswing in dealseeking, also paint a picture of companies\u2019 shifting priorities. At J&J, for instance, incoming competition for the immunology standout Stelara has caused the massive company to explore opportunities in neuropsychiatry, where it found recent success with the depression drug Spravato. For GSK, a near-term patent expiration for the HIV drug dolutegravir has led to a deeper dive into the dependably active field of oncology.\n\nHere, we\u2019re stepping backward through J.P. Morgan history to explore the deals that have peppered the meeting since 2018, following the wider life sciences landscape along the way, from a megamerger boom to a pandemic disturbance and potential resurgence on the horizon.\n\n2025 (Jan. 13-16)\n\nFor deals announced during the J.P. Morgan conference, 2025 takes the cake as the largest in recent years. J&J\u2019s $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular is out of the ordinary for the conference as a more substantial deal rather than the standard bolt-ons, particularly since the pandemic threw uncertainty into the mix.\n\nThe deal gives J&J one more leg up in clinical depression and schizophrenia with the potential blockbuster Caplyta in Intra-Cellular\u2019s commercial portfolio and a pipeline of neuropsychiatric drugs that could build on the pharma giant\u2019s success with the ketamine-based depression drug Spravato.\n\nGSK\u2019s $1 billion IDRx deal is more in line with the usual slate of mergers announced during the conference, bringing in a rare cancer drug with precision medicine capabilities.\n\nAdding to the deal flurry, Eli Lilly acquired a clinical oncology drug candidate from Scorpion Therapeutics for as much as $2.5 billion in milestone payments down the road.\n\n2024 (Jan. 8-11)\n\nLast year, the J.P. Morgan conference boasted four deals between opening and closing, but the total consideration was much lower with less than $4 billion on the line. J&J again held the most prominent position at the table, announcing the $2 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker Ambrx Biopharma on the first day of the meeting. Ambrx provided J&J with multiple antibody-drug conjugate candidates, which is a field that continues to appeal to drugmakers.\n\nThree pharma giants rounded out the other deals, with GSK\u2019s $1 billion up-front purchase of immunology biotech Aiolos Bio, Merck & Co.\u2019s $680 million acquisition of cancer drugmaker Harpoon Therapeutics and Novartis\u2019 $250 million up-front bolt-on of immunology company Calypso.\n\n2023 (Jan. 9-12)\n\nDealmaking was a little more muted in 2023, but a few smaller acquisitions still slid into focus. AstraZeneca\u2019s $1.3 billion up-front purchase of cardiorenal specialist CinCor was the largest of the bunch as the industry slowly emerged from the pandemic-era doldrums. Two smaller deals \u2014 including Ipsen\u2019s rare disease purchase of Albireo and BioNTech\u2019s InstaDeep buy \u2014 brought total consideration to around $2.7 billion during the conference window.\n\n2022 (Jan. 10-13)\n\nZero. Zilch. Nada. There were no deals at all announced during the 2022 J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, marking a low point in the meeting\u2019s dealmaking reputation. In fact, the only acquisition revealed during that entire month of January was UCB\u2019s purchase of epilepsy drugmaker Zogenix for as much as $1.9 billion with milestones, more than a week after the meeting ended.\n\nOne important note about 2022: The conference was held remotely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2021 (Jan. 7-13)\n\nLike many of the years during the pandemic, 2021 was light on deals announced during the conference. Chimerix kicked it off with a small $78 million purchase of cancer drugmaker Oncoceutics, and then Sanofi upped the ante with an acquisition of immunology biotech Kymab worth $1.1 billion up front.\n\n2020 (Jan. 13-16)\n\nThe first year of the decade marked another low point for J.P. Morgan dealmaking with only one announced during the meeting\u2019s window. BioNTech, prior to skyrocketing as Pfizer\u2019s partner with the first approved COVID-19 vaccine, placed a modest $67 million bet on cancer biotech Neon Therapeutics. Today, BioNTech is still pursuing a foothold in oncology with a pipeline of cancer therapies.\n\nA week prior to the meeting, Eli Lilly jumped into the new year with a $1.1 billion acquisition of immunology company Dermira.\n\n2019 (Jan. 7-10)\n\nThe year before the pandemic was a major one for dealmakers. The only acquisition that debuted during the J.P. Morgan conference was Lilly\u2019s $8 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker Loxo Oncology \u2014 substantial on its own and worth some San Francisco chatter \u2014 but the real talk of the meeting was Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s whopping $74 billion megamerger with Celgene, announced before the doors opened. The deal reshaped the industry.\n\n2018 (Jan. 8-11)\n\nWhile there were no deals reported during the J.P. Morgan meeting in 2018, the industry was still busy \u2014 three major acquisitions came down the pike later that month. Two were wrought by growth-hungry Sanofi, which dropped more than $15 billion collectively to purchase rare disease drugmakers Bioverativ and Ablynx in late January. And similarly, prior to its own sale the following year, Celgene brought Juno Therapeutics into the fold for $9 billion. The cell therapies it gained in that acquisition are now important reminders within Bristol Myers\u2019 current portfolio that a successful pharma is built piece by piece.",

But Alzheimer's is the \"really large market here,\" Bristol Myers Squibb CFO David Elkins told CNBC on Tuesday at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.\n\nThere are nearly 6 million patients in the U.S. with Alzheimer's, and around half of them have psychosis, or symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, Elkins said. Cobenfy could be the first drug specifically approved for Alzheimer's-related psychosis, said Chief Commercialization Officer Adam Lenkowsky.\n\nAtypical antipsychotics \u2013 medication used to treat a range of psychiatric disorders \u2013 are often used to treat psychosis in Alzheimer's patients even though they are not approved for that purpose. But those treatments can increase the risk of death, and Cobenfy does not, according to Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nMeanwhile, Alzheimer's agitation, a symptom that can cause a patient to feel restless and worried, is estimated to affect around 60% to 70% of patients with the disease, according to some studies.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb on Monday said it plans to release initial late-stage trial data for Cobenfy in Alzheimer's-related psychosis treatment during the latter part of the year, which is earlier than expected. The company also expects to start phase three trials in Alzheimer's agitation, Alzheimer's cognition and bipolar disorder in 2025, while studies in autism will begin in 2026.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Chris Schott expects Cobenfy sales to reach about $5 billion by 2030, with a peak sales potential in the $10 billion range across multiple treatment uses, according to a research note on Tuesday. That is a huge boon to Bristol Myers Squibb as it faces pressure to offset the potential loss of revenue from top-selling treatments that will see their patents expire.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bristol Myers Squibb Co. said its new schizophrenia drug is off to a better start than similar recently launched treatments, in an early sign that its $14 billion purchase of Karuna Therapeutics is paying off.\n\nThe medication, to be sold under the name Cobenfy, was a key piece of Bristol\u2019s acquisition of Karuna. US regulators approved Cobenfy in September, becoming the first new type of schizophrenia drug in seven decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tracking ahead of all the newly launched atypical antipsychotic analogs,\u201d Chief Commercialization Officer Adam Lenkowsky said in an interview. Those would include drugs like Vraylar and Caplyta.\n\nCobenfy launched in late October, and Lenkowsky said he expected uptake to ramp up in the second half of this year. The feedback from doctors and patients has been \u201creally strong and quite remarkable,\u201d he said. Patients are switching from generic antipsychotic drugs to Cobenfy and reporting a reduction in hallucinations and delusions, improved clarity and the \u201cability to re-engage with family members.\u201d\n\nAbout 80% of schizophrenia patients are on Medicaid or Medicare. The drug is covered by more than 90% of Medicaid plans and by the early second quarter of this year should have \u201ccritical mass\u201d with Medicare coverage as well.\n\nStill, the company has more work to do. The biggest challenge, he said, is \u201cupending the habit that physicians have had for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of education that needs to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for physicians to change prescribing habits.\u201d\n\nBristol is also still looking for deals to find new sources of growth with top-sellers like Revlimid, Opdivo and Eliquis either facing or about to face generic competition.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sit there and say \u2018We\u2019re going to do a big deal, we\u2019re going to do a small deal,\u2019\u201d Chief Financial Officer David Elkins said.\n\n\u201cWe look for where is the high unmet medical need that\u2019s still out there in therapeutic areas where we have scientific expertise, commercial expertise,\u201d he said, referencing treatments for cardiovascular conditions as an example of that.\n\nAfter a flurry of deals in late 2023, including for Karuna and RayzeBio, Elkins said management spent last year incorporating those assets but that they haven\u2019t stopped looking for more.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole team here, meeting with a lot of our partnerships and meeting with other companies,\u201d he said, calling their deals strategy \u201cvery active.\u201d\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

(Nasdaq: AGIO), a leader in cellular metabolism and pyruvate kinase (PK) activation, which is pioneering therapies for rare diseases, today announced positive results from the Phase 3 ENERGIZE-T study of mitapivat, an oral small-molecule PK activator, in adults with transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia. These results were presented in an oral session (abstract #409) at the 66th Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in San Diego, California.\u2022 In July 2024, Researchers from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine have developed an innovative model that could serve as a platform for creating new therapies to treat Alpha Thalassemia (AT), a serious blood disorder. Their findings were published in the journal Blood. Each year, thousands of children are born with AT, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. While the genetic trait can offer protection against malaria and cause only mild anemia in its normal form, children whose parents both carry defective genes face a significantly higher risk of severe AT.\u2022 In January 2024, Agios Pharmaceuticals reported positive outcomes in a Phase III ENERGIZE trial of mitapivat for patients with non-transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia, meeting primary and two key secondary endpoints. The company intends to seek regulatory approval for mitapivat as a thalassemia treatment by year-end, incorporating data from the second Phase III ENERGISE-T study (NCT04770779) for adults with transfusion-dependent alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia.Alpha Thalassemia OverviewAlpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the production of alpha globin chains, which are essential components of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. This deficiency results in a reduced amount of hemoglobin and red blood cells, leading to anemia.Get a Free Sample PDF Report to know more about Alpha Thalassemia Pipeline Therapeutic Assessment-Emerging Alpha Thalassemia Drugs Under Different Phases of Clinical Development Include:\u2022 Etavopivat tablets: Forma Therapeutics, Inc.\u2022 GMCN-508A: Genmedicn Biopharma Ltd.\u2022 Luspatercept: Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2022 Mitapivat: Agios PharmaceuticalsAlpha Thalassemia Route of AdministrationAlpha Thalassemia pipeline report provides the therapeutic assessment of the pipeline drugs by the Route of Administration.

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this biopharmaceutical company have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Bristol Myers falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Bristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share, indicating a change of -14.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.93 points to a change of -87.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.14 indicates a change of +667.8% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Bristol Myers is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

OS will be fully evaluated at the final analysis after the pre-specified number of deaths occur during the study.\n\nSafety data showed nivolumab\u2019s profile was consistent with findings from prior studies, and compliance rates for the SOC therapies were similar between the 2 arms.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in decades where a therapy demonstrated superiority over SOC cisplatin-radiotherapy in high-risk patients with locally advanced HNSCC,\" Jean Bourhis, MD, PhD, principal investigator of NIVOPOSTOP and medical director of GORTEC, stated in a news release.\n\nNIVOPOSTOP was a randomized, controlled, open-label trial investigating the addition of nivolumab to SOC radiotherapy and cisplatin compared with SOC radiotherapy and cisplatin alone. Investigators enrolled 680 patients between 18 and 75 years of age with histologically confirmed, stage III or IV, resected, locally advanced HNSCC who had high-risk factors for relapse, including nodal extracapsular extension, multiple nodal involvement, multiple perineural invasions, or positive surgical margins.1,2 Completion of macroscopic resection and recovery from surgery to allow for the administration of chemoradiotherapy was required, and patients needed to be free from disease.2 Those with oropharyngeal tumors needed to have a known p16 status per immunohistochemistry. Patients with stage II, p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer were allowed to enroll if they had pT3N1 or pT4N1 disease, plus a tobacco consumption history of at least 20 packs per year.\n\nPatients were excluded if they had nasopharyngeal, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, or thyroid cancers; had squamous cell carcinoma involving cervical neck nodes with an unknown primary site; had metastatic disease; underwent incomplete macroscopic resection; or had central nervous system disease. Other than surgery, no prior treatment for the current malignancy was permitted, including prior TKIs, monoclonal antibodies, induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any investigational agent.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either SOC radiotherapy at 66 Gy over 6.5 weeks plus cisplatin at 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles; or the same SOC chemoradiotherapy regimen in combination with nivolumab.1,2 In the experimental arm, patients received a 240-mg dose of nivolumab alone 3 weeks prior to the start of SOC chemoradiotherapy, which was given concurrently with nivolumab at 360 mg once every 3 weeks.2 Following the completion of SOC radiotherapy in the experimental arm, nivolumab was continued as maintenance at 480 mg once every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles.1,2\n\nAlong with the primary end point of DFS, secondary end points included OS and the rates of acute and late toxicities.2\n\n\"These clinically meaningful findings have the potential to be practice-changing for high-risk LA-SCCHN patients receiving adjuvant therapy,\" Yoann Pointreau, MD, and Yun Gan Tao, MD, added in a news release.1 Pointreau is the current president of GORTEC, and Tao is the president-elect.\n\nReferences",

I have a little bit of a soft spot for the menin inhibitors and some of the work that's been done in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which has been such a difficult disease over many years to develop really effective therapies for. But, I think the initial profile of some of these novel inhibitors just looks really promising in those patients, so I'm excited to see those develop into a broader patient population and in combination therapies in AML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREDIT: Lexeo Therapeutics\n\nSandi See Tai, Chief Development Officer of Lexeo Therapeutics:\n\nI\u2019m incredibly excited about gene therapy especially in 2025. Gene therapy offers transformative potential to treat many conditions that have few or no effective treatment options today, and there is a huge unmet need for individuals living with rare diseases. We\u2019ve also seen some very exciting news recently from the Food and Drug Administration in Huntington\u2019s disease, Fabry disease, and others, showing a willingness from the agency to partner and use accelerated approval pathways to help get potential treatments to patients more quickly if the evidence package appears safe and effective. To me, this acceleration really demonstrates the power of our industry to advance innovation and at the end of the day improve lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREDIT: Lundbeck\n\nJohan Luthman, Executive Vice President of R&D at Lundbeck Therapeutics:\n\nI think some immunotherapies are still really looking very impressive. There is still some mileage to go with immunotherapies for autoimmune diseases of various kinds, but recently we've seen a breakthrough in neuromyelitis optical disorder, and some years back in myasthenia gravis. We still see new, interesting things progressing in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is still a big medical need. We will see maybe the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors coming through, finally; it\u2019s been a rocky road. We may see CD40 ligand monoclonal antibodies serving across the board for many indications, but also probably MS. Also, in my field, psychedelic medicine is very controversial. I think we will see in the coming years whether that delivers what we hope for or not. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s esketamine drug, Spravato, is out on the market, and it's starting to really look promising. That's the only psychedelic-type drug that is out there. But, we may see some more breakthroughs in this area of drug treatment assisted by psychotherapy, which I think is an interesting combination therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREDIT: Claudio Soto\n\nClaudio Soto, Cofounder and Chief Security Officer of Amprion and Professor at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston:\n\nIn my area of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the accumulation of protein aggregates, I am most excited about drugs aiming to reduce the expression of the endogenous proteins that become misfolded and accumulate in the brain. There are some antisense oligonucleotide-based drugs under development, such as those being tested at Ionis Pharmaceuticals, for most of the diseases in this group. I believe that reducing the normal proteins that will be the substrate for the prion-like spreading of the pathological abnormalities represents a great and novel opportunity to attack these diseases. I think it will be very difficult for small molecules or antibodies to reduce substantially the protein aggregates, but removing the raw materials for making them is a clever and logical strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREDIT: Zura Bio\n\nRobert Lisicki, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Zura Bio:\n\nI\u2019m excited about the potential of drugs in clinical trials that target multiple pathways within a single therapy. These treatments, such as bispecific antibodies, could help address the complexities of diseases, particularly in the rare disease space where treatment options are limited. By targeting multiple pathways simultaneously, these therapies may offer more tailored care, providing hope for better outcomes and improved patient support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREDIT: Aligos Therapeutics\n\nLawrence Blatt, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Aligos Therapeutics:\n\nI am most excited about the innovative chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) therapies currently in clinical trials, particularly those leveraging a novel mechanism of action. These drugs have the potential to overcome historical barriers in CHB treatment, offering a realistic path toward improved chronic suppression and functional cure rates for millions of patients worldwide.\n\nSome responses have been edited for length and clarity.",

Many existing drugs that treat the condition come with side effects that lead patients to stop taking them, including weight gain and fatigue. The Food and Drug administration approved Cobenfy in September of 2024, and it is the first new type of treatment for the disorder in decades.\n\nAccording to Boerner, doctors and schizophrenia patients are providing good feedback about Cobenfy, saying that it not only treats symptoms like hallucinations, but also provides relief for other cognitive impairments. He said Bristol Myers is researching other uses for the drug, including treatment for mania caused by bipolar disorder and psychosis seen in those with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBoerner also addressed concerns about upcoming patent expirations the company currently faces, which would likely lead to revenue losses. He said Bristol Myers has a \"young portfolio growing assets,\" as well as \"a string of new catalysts that are going to have data coming out over the next 18 to 24 months.\" He also said the company is in a strong financial position that allows it to continue to provide shareholders with \"an attractive dividend.\"",

            "content": "The FDA approved 55 novel medicines in 2024\u2014some first-in-class and others representing the first new mechanism of action for an indication in decades.\n\nNovel approvals last year ran the therapeutic gamut from cardiovascular and hematological to infectious diseases, with some of the most significant new mechanisms of action found in oncology and neuroscience.\n\nTop of mind is Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy, which the FDA greenlit in September as the first novel schizophrenia treatment in 35 years. Going back to February, we saw the approval of Iovance\u2019s Amtagvi, the first one-time cell therapy for a solid tumor and the first tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy. Amtagvi is indicated for advanced melanoma, which has been notoriously difficult to treat. Another notable milestone was the March approval of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Rezdiffra, the first therapy to get the FDA\u2019s nod for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\nHere\u2019s a look at five of the year\u2019s most notable novel approvals.\n\nIovance\u2019s Amtagvi Jumpstarts TIL Space\n\nIn February 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Iovance Biotherapeutics for Amtagvi to treat patients with advanced melanoma. Forty years in the making, TIL therapies take advantage of the patient\u2019s own immune cells\u2014lymphocytes\u2014which tend to be suppressed in the tumor environment. These cells are extracted from tumor biopsies, expanded in numbers or revamped for better efficacy, then transfused back into the patient, leading to antitumor activity.\n\nIovance supported its Biologics License Application for Amtagvi with clinical data showing a 31% objective response rate with a median duration of response not reached at 18.6 months of follow-up; 42% of responses lasted for two years or longer.\n\nWhile CAR T therapies have transformed treatment for blood cancers, their performance hasn\u2019t been as impressive against solid tumors. Part of the attraction of TIL therapies is their ability to recognize multiple antigens simultaneously, something CAR Ts are unable to do. Conventional CAR Ts can only recognize a small number of proteins on the surface of tumor cells, while TILs can identify tumor targets derived from intra- or extracellular tumor proteins, Sammy Farah, CEO of Turnstone Biologics, told BioSpace in February. Because solid tumors are known to be heterogeneous, TILs are likely to be successful as a treatment modality, Farah said.\n\nWith more than 75 TIL immunotherapies in preclinical or clinical studies for various indications, numerous players are coming up behind Iovance. Turnstone Biologics is developing TIL therapies for colorectal cancers, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and uveal melanoma, while Instil Bio is working on TILs for non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Bristol Myers Squibb and Incyte Corporation are also active in this space.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s Tecelra Succeeds Against Synovial Sarcoma\n\nAlso in the cell therapy space, Adaptimmune Therapeutics in August 2024 secured FDA approval for the first engineered T cell therapy for solid tumor cancers in the U.S. Tecelra is also the first new therapeutic option for synovial sarcoma\u2014a rare soft tissue cancer\u2014in more than 10 years. Like Amtagvi, Tecelra was approved under the FDA\u2019s accelerated pathway.\n\nAlso similar to Amtagvi, Tecelra leverages the patient\u2019s immune cells and modifies them to be able to target cancer cells. Tecelra is specifically designed to recognize and attack the melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4) protein, which is crucial to preventing cell cycle arrest and cell death. MAGE-A4 is commonly overexpressed in solid tumors, especially synovial sarcoma.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval was based on results of the SPEARHEAD-1 study, in which treatment with Tecelra led to an overall response rate of 43%. A complete response was reported in 4.5% of patients. Treatment response lasted for at least 12 months in 39% of study participants who were responsive to the therapy.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy Breaks Through Against Schizophrenia\n\nOn the neuro front was the FDA\u2019s approval of Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy in September. A first-in-class muscarinic agonist, Cobenfy comprises two separate drugs with distinct mechanisms of action: xanomeline activates M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors to reduce schizophrenia symptoms, while trospium reduces potential side effects of such activation, such as cardiovascular issues and increased production of saliva and tears. Dopamine-based drugs come with side effects such as weight gain and drowsiness. Targeting the muscarinic pathway may avoid such issues because these receptors are not expressed in key brain regions, Carlos Dortrait, SVP and general manager of U.S. immunology and neuroscience at BMS, told BioSpace in September.\n\nBMS supported Cobenfy\u2019s application with data from three registrational studies. EMERGENT-1 and EMERGENT-2 established the drug\u2019s efficacy in treating schizophrenia on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and EMERGENT-3 showed that the therapy, then called KarXT, could significantly reduce overall symptom severity.\n\nWhile Cobenfy proved the potential of targeting the muscarinic pathway in schizophrenia, the mechanism was called into question not two months later when AbbVie\u2019s emraclidine failed to show efficacy in two Phase II clinical trials for the neuropsychiatric disease. The difference might lay in the M1 receptor, Stifel analysts suggested in November. While Cobenfy acts on both the M1 and M4 receptors, emraclidine only targets M4. \u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding thesis that M1 may contribute to efficacy on cognition,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nIf true, this would be bad news for Neurocrine Biosciences, which is developing a muscarinic M4 selective agonist, NBI-1117568. The San Diego\u2013based company announced results from a mid-stage trial of the candidate in August 2024, showing that the lowest dose of NBI-1117568 improved symptoms of schizophrenia. All other doses failed to meet the study\u2019s primary endpoint.\n\nRoche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza Provides Flexible Treatment Option\n\nAlso in September, the FDA greenlit the first subcutaneous PD-(L)1 blocker in the U.S., Roche\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza. Approved for the same indications as intravenous Tecentriq\u2014including skin, liver, lung and soft-tissue cancers\u2014the subcutaneous formulation leverages Halozyme Therapeutics\u2019 Enhanze technology, which uses a recombinant enzyme to digest hyaluronan proteins beneath the skin to improve fluid flow in the subcutaneous space. This effect allows large volumes of the liquid Tecentriq to be injected under the skin, while also boosting the medicine\u2019s dispersion and absorption.\n\nTecentriq Hybreza \u201ccan treat patients faster and in more accessible settings\u201d and \u201coffers patients with multiple cancer types and their physicians greater flexibility and choice of treatment administration,\u201d Roche CMO Levi Garraway said in a statement following the approval.\n\nThe subcutaneous formulation is administered in approximately seven minutes, while an intravenous infusion of Tecentriq usually takes 30 minutes to 60 minutes, according to Roche.\n\nApproval of Tecentriq Hybreza was based partly on the Phase Ib/III IMscin001 study, in which the subcutaneous injection reached comparable levels of the drug in the blood as its intravenous formulation, with similar safety and efficacy profiles.\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Neffy First Nasal Spray for Severe Allergies\n\nPeople living with severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis got a new, more palatable treatment option in August when the FDA approved ARS Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Neffy as the first nasal spray for the condition. The first epinephrine product for the treatment of anaphylaxis that is not administered by injection, Neffy is a single-dose nasal spray administered into one nostril. A second dose may be administered if there is no improvement in symptoms or symptoms worsen, according to the FDA\u2019s approval announcement.\n\n\u201cAnaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\u201d Kelly Stone, associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \u201cThe availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis.\u201d\n\nNeffy\u2019s approval was supported by four studies in 175 healthy adults without anaphylaxis, which showed comparable epinephrine blood concentrations between the nasal spray and approved epinephrine injection products. Neffy also led to similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate as epinephrine injection products did. These physiological changes are critical effects of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis, according to the FDA.",

Here researchers test tablets for impurities and the ability to withstand exposure to light, extreme temperatures and humidity during storage, as well as their durability, with the goal of achieving a shelf life of three years.\n\nDr Clare Rawlinson-Malone, incoming Moreton site leader, says: \u201cConnecting with local universities is immensely beneficial for scientific collaboration and nurturing our talent pipeline. The life sciences and medicine development sectors are incredibly dynamic and there is growing enthusiasm for a regional approach.\u201d\n\nIn a drive for better sustainability, scientists in Moreton use enzymes to help synthesise drugs, avoiding the need to employ oil-based solvents and heavy metals during drug development.\n\nBack in the 1960s, staff at Moreton provided the first ever human clinical trial supplies of an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor \u2013 a class of drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure \u2013 and later created technologies for the delivery of diabetes treatments.\n\nView image in fullscreen Some fear that AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, will turn from the UK market to targeting the US. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nThe hope in the Leasowe area is that, as more biotech and pharma companies invest around Liverpool, they will create jobs for local people and provide a boost to the local economy.\n\nThere are 167 life science companies in the Liverpool city region, employing more than 6,000 people, out of 354 such firms in the north-west, employing 28,000 people.\n\nA designated life science investment zone, the Liverpool city region expects to attract up to \u00a3800m in investment over the next 10 years, including \u00a3160m from the government, and create 8,000 more jobs.\n\nThe AstraZeneca investment, if it goes ahead, would provide a further big boost. The company is in talks with the UK government about \u201cincentives\u201d to support the expansion of its childhood-vaccine factory in Speke in order to turn it into a bigger research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centre across about six hectares (15 acres) where several vaccines could be produced at once.\n\nIt has constructed a new 7,710 sq metre (83,000 sq ft) building that stands empty and would be kitted out with bioreactors, in a move from current egg-based technology to cell-culture-based vaccines.\n\nThe current facility, near the Mersey and Liverpool John Lennon airport, manufactures the drug substance for the children\u2019s nasal flu vaccine that is used in the annual vaccination programmes in the UK and the US.\n\nIt can make more than 20m doses a year, which are shipped to Philadelphia to be \u201cfilled and finished\u201d as Fluenz or FluMist nasal spray. The new Speke plant would be able to produce vaccines from start to finish \u2013 important to the UK\u2019s pandemic readiness planning.\n\nThe Office for Life Sciences \u2013 part of the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology \u2013 is leading negotiations, together with the Treasury, to work out the mechanisms of the funding, which could come from the government\u2019s \u00a3520m Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund.\n\nAs part of the package, the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority could fund training and apprenticeships to attract new staff to the site and upskill current employees.\n\nView image in fullscreen AstraZeneca has put plans for a \u00a3450m investment in Speke on hold as it tries to secure state funding. Photograph: AstraZeneca\n\nThe Conservative government trumpeted the planned AstraZeneca investment of \u00a3450m in March and pledged an undisclosed subsidy, which the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reportedly wanted to cut. Government grants tend to be 15%-25% of capital costs, according to industry insiders, which would equate to \u00a367.5m at the lower end. AstraZeneca has also been investing in other countries, most recently the US.\n\n\u201cThese companies are multinational, so they will go where the expertise is \u2013 they will go where they can get the best value, so we need to be able to compete and work with them closely where we can,\u201d says Prof Janet Hemingway, former president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nShe was also director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) for nearly two decades, and in 2020 set up the Infection Innovation Consortium (iiCon), which brings together industry, academia and NHS clinicians.\n\nSoriot and other executives flew to New York in mid-November to present AstraZeneca\u2019s latest financial results, which showed a 24% rise in third-quarter pre-tax profits to $1.8bn. There, they unveiled plans to spend $3.5bn on new labs that will bring together all its researchers in the Boston area, along with manufacturing sites for new cell therapy and biologics (drugs that are derived from biological sources such as cells, tissue or blood).\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t escape anyone\u2019s attention the US economy is expected to grow and there\u2019s lots of innovation there,\u201d Soriot has said. While the US is the business\u2019s largest market, accounting for 43% of its revenues, he added that \u201cwe are in the top three companies in most markets \u2013 not in the US\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, AstraZeneca has been rocked by a crisis in China, where the president of its China business and other senior executives were detained over allegations of illegally importing cancer medicines.\n\nThis has weighed on the drug maker and sent its share price sharply downwards when the news broke. AstraZeneca\u2019s market value has dropped from a peak of more than \u00a3200bn in mid-August to about \u00a3170bn.\n\nReferring to the Speke expansion, Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, says: \u201cAstraZeneca will be looking to get the best support possible [from the UK government] so it can compete effectively on the global stage and get the best returns for its shareholders.\n\nFrom a UK perspective, it\u2019s pretty important that we support this sort of investment and harness the opportunities for growth Geoff Davison, Bionow\n\n\u201cThe government will be looking to help to provide the right conditions for investment, job creation and growth, even as it minds its own fragile finances and contrasts those with AstraZeneca\u2019s $6bn in global after-tax profits in 2023 and how the company\u2019s management felt comfortable returning $4.5bn to shareholders in dividends last year.\u201d\n\nProf Tom Solomon, director of the UK\u2019s emerging infections research unit since 2014 and head of the Pandemic Institute in Liverpool, which was set up in 2021, says: \u201cIt also sends a signal to other potential investors. Here\u2019s a company that wants to invest. They obviously need government partnership and support, and if we want more of this kind of thing, we can\u2019t renege on the deals that have been made, even if the deal was made by the previous government.\u201d\n\nA Treasury spokesperson says: \u201cWe are committed to making the UK one of the best places in the world to develop and manufacture new and innovative medicines, and we are in active discussions with AstraZeneca to support the delivery of this planned investment in Speke.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca says: \u201cThe discussions with the UK government are ongoing. We are reviewing the incentives for investment in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s \u00a3108bn life sciences sector provides more than 300,000 jobs across the country, and the autumn budget promised up to \u00a3520m backing for the Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund, set up to support businesses investing in UK projects.\n\nLiverpool is the only place in the UK with officially designated \u201chigh potential opportunity\u201d status for vaccines, and LSTM, the world\u2019s first tropical disease research institute, was founded there in 1898. Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, says: \u201cWe are a genuine global leader in understanding and tackling infectious diseases, and we\u2019re continually striving to innovate and future-proof the world against the viruses and pandemics of the future.\u201d\n\nSpeke is where the Distillers Company, a Scotch whisky maker, became one of the first factories in Europe to manufacture penicillin, in 1945, and where US company Eli Lilly made biosynthetic insulin and human growth hormone in the 1980s.\n\nThe area is reliant on a handful of big companies that have their subsidiaries here, while GlaxoSmithKline shut its factory in 2004 with the loss of 500 jobs.\n\nAdjacent to AstraZeneca in Speke is the UK\u2019s largest vaccine factory, run by Australia\u2019s CSL Seqirus, which has been manufacturing flu vaccines since 1943 (previously under Novartis) and employs 750 people. It makes 56m doses a year from start to finish, but could ramp this up to 200m in the event of a flu pandemic.\n\nThe nearby TriRx factory, initially built by Eli Lilly, has just been saved from closure by the US company Elanco Animal Health, in a \u00a320m buyout saving 300 jobs. The site makes monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies that can treat cancer and other diseases.\n\nChina\u2019s Pharmaron runs a gene therapy and vaccine manufacturing site in Speke, originally the National Biomanufacturing Centre, built in 2003 with government funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have so many big companies in the small area of Speke but it\u2019s really important to Liverpool and the UK that we maintain this infrastructure and capability,\u201d says Geoff Davison of Bionow, which represents 330 life sciences organisations across northern England.\n\n\u201cAstraZeneca and other global players can easily go elsewhere in the world. From a UK perspective, it\u2019s pretty important that we support this sort of investment and harness the opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nTogether with neighbouring Cheshire and Warrington, the Liverpool city region delivers \u00a32bn of infectious disease research and development each year.\n\nAs a major port, Liverpool has a long history of infectious diseases and public health initiatives, and in November 2020 became the first place in the world to do voluntary mass testing for Covid-19, with nearly half the city\u2019s population coming forward.\n\nMore recently, researchers from Liverpool University developed the first vaccine for the Zika virus, which is spread by mosquitoes and can cause serious birth defects. The vaccine is being tested in about 20 volunteers in initial clinical studies.\n\nHemingway\u2019s iiCon organisation \u2013 backed by the Wellcome Trust and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 is building new robotic labs powered by AI and capable of handling dangerous pathogens in a \u00a310m project at LSTM.\n\nFounded with a \u00a318.6m government grant, the consortium has an infectious disease R&D programme worth \u00a3260m four years later. It has helped 36 new products enter the market, including diagnostic devices, vaccines and next-generation mosquito nets against malaria, treated with a more effective insecticide that is also safe for babies.\n\nHowever, there are challenges. The distinctive Spine building \u2013 home to the Pandemic Institute and the Royal College of Physicians \u2013 at Paddington Village has been half-empty since opening in May 2021.\n\nA Liverpool city council cabinet report said last year that it suffered from \u201ca lack of investment\u201d. Paddington Village is a key part of the \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d that includes Liverpool University and the Royal hospital, and the council is pushing ahead with its expansion undaunted.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s prowess in science must never be underestimated,\u201d says Mould. \u201cThe University of Cambridge has more Nobel laureates on its own than the whole of France. Britain therefore offers deep pools of knowledge and talent, combined with a cheap currency [which is helpful for exports], so it can be a terrific base from which to operate, as AstraZeneca can already attest.\u201d",

Full size image\n\nImmune landscape of urachal cancer\n\nThe immune landscape of urachal cancer (UrC) included low programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression across the samples: 11.76% (n = 4) had CPS score \u226510, 55.88% (n = 19) had CPS score of 1\u20139, while 32.35% (n = 11) had a combined positive score (CPS) score of 0 \u2013 Fig. 1c. Furthermore, predictive markers of response to immunotherapy \u2013 tumor mutation burden-high [TMB-H] (4.78% vs 4.87%, p = 1.0) and PD-L1 (11.76% vs 11.76%, p = 1.0) \u2013 were similar in both Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-Altered and MAPK-wild type (WT) UrC \u2013 Fig. 1d. Similarly, no difference in the distribution of interferon (IFN)-gamma scores (a transcriptomic signature predictive of response to immunotherapy) was observed between MAPK-Altered and MAPK-WT UrC (Median: \u22120.36 vs \u22120.38, p = 0.052) \u2013 Fig. 1e. Using quanTIseq to deconvolve transcriptomic profiles and estimate immune cell fractions, the tumor microenvironment was similar across the MAPK-Altered and MAPK-WT cohorts, with exception of NK cells, which were significantly higher in MAPK-Altered UrC patients (3.5% vs 2.7%, p = 0.022) \u2013 Fig. 1f. Meanwhile, overall survival was similar between MAPK-Altered and -WT urachal cancer (HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.48\u20132.31) and no prognostic impact of MAPK-alterations was observed in these patients (Supplementary Fig. 1a/b) \u2013 using surrogates of time from diagnosis and tissue collection to last contact. Outcome data shows that 7 urachal patients were treated with IO therapy (Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Ipilimumab, Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab) but no therapeutic advantage was observed in these patients as the median OS from therapy to last contact was 10 months (95% CI, 2\u201315 months).\n\nWe analyzed the genomic and transcriptomic differences among urachal histological subtypes\u2014mucinous, enteric, and others. While no significant differences were observed in mutation prevalence across the three groups, we noted a non-significant trend toward higher prevalence of PD-L1 (22c3) expression and TMB-High in the enteric subtype compared to Fig. 2 mucinous and other subtypes. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment revealed a significant reduction in M2 macrophages and an increase in dendritic cells in enteric urachal cancers. However, no significant differences in overall survival (OS) were observed among these groups.

Full size image\n\nGenomic profile of urachal cancer in comparison to bladder and colorectal\n\nAs the origin of urachal cancer remains an ongoing debate in the genitourinary cancer field, the genomic profile of urachal cancer (n = 42) was evaluated in comparison to colorectal (n = 21,136) and bladder cancer (n = 6455). The prevalence of TP53 (83.3% vs 73.7%, 58.8%, p = 0.0019), GNAS (11.9% vs 2.8% vs 0.1%, p < 0.0001) and STK11 (7.1% vs 0.4% vs 0.5%, p = 0.002) mutations was significantly higher in urachal cancer compared to bladder or CRC. Genomic loss-of-heterozygosity (gLOH) was significantly higher in UrC (29.0% vs 10.8%, p = 0.0044), while the prevalence of APC mutation (4.8% vs 75.0%, p < 0.0001) was significantly lower compared to CRC. Similarly, mutation of SMAD4 (9.5% vs 1.1%, p = 0.0014) and KRAS (35.7% vs 3.6%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher in UrC, while the prevalence of RB1 (5.5% vs 19.9%, p = 0.024), TERT promoter (pTERT) (3.1% vs 70.0%, p < 0.0001) mutation, as well as decreased prevalence of PD-L1 + IHC expression (11.8% vs 38.6%, p < 0.001) and TMB-H (4.9% vs 37.4, p < 0.0001) compared to bladder cancer \u2013 Fig. 3a\u2013e.\n\nFig. 3: Gene expression profiling of urachal cancer in comparison to bladder and colorectal cancer. a Differentially expressed genes between bladder and colorectal cancer. b Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of genes expression data in urachal, bladder and colorectal cancer. c Comparison of top 10 highly differentially expressed genes in colorectal cancer. d Comparison of top 10 highly differentially expressed genes in bladder cancer. Asterisks indicates overall statistical significance, ****p < 0.0001. Full size image\n\nTo explore the similarity of urachal cancer with other tumor types, gene expression profiles were compared to those of bladder and colorectal cancers. Firstly, differentially expressed genes were obtained between bladder cancer and colorectal cancer (Fig. 3a, d, e). Genes such as CEACAM5, MUC13, EPCAM, CDH17, and HNF4A were significantly observed in colorectal cancer while GATA3, UPK1A, KRT7, TUSC3 and PSCA were significantly observed in bladder cancer. Gene expression data for colorectal, bladder and urachal samples were projected using UMAP projection (Fig. 3b) and there was a distinct cluster and separation of most bladder cancers from colorectal, while urachal cancer samples was observed to be closely around the colorectal cancer samples. To further explore this similarity, clusters were obtained using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the top 10% differentially expressed genes between colorectal and bladder, most of the urachal cancer samples (39/41, ~95%) was observed to be clustered closely to the colorectal cancer samples \u2013 Fig. 3c. Next, differentially expressed genes were analyzed between bladder cancer and colorectal cancer. We observed that genes highly expressed in bladder cancer had lower expression in urachal cancer while those that were highly expressed in colorectal cancer were in similar order of magnitude in urachal cancer \u2013 Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Table 1.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated differences in the tumor microenvironment across the three genitourinary tumors\u2014UrC, bladder cancer, and CRC. Our findings reveal notable heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, with distinct immune cell fractions associated with each tumor type. Specifically, macrophage M1 cell fractions were significantly higher in CRC and UrC compared to bladder cancer, while CD8+ T cells were more abundant in CRC and bladder cancer compared to UrC. Conversely, neutrophil levels were significantly lower in UrC compared to both CRC and bladder cancer (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nAntibody drug conjugate gene expression in urachal cancer\n\nGiven that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to HER2, TROP2 and NECTIN4 are used in the treatment of bladder cancer, we compared the expression of these genes in urachal cancer to bladder and colorectal cohorts13. Our result (Supplementary Fig. 2) demonstrate that bladder cancer cohort had significantly higher expression levels of HER2, TROP2 and NECTIN4 compared to urachal and colorectal. The expression of these genes was comparable between urachal and colorectal cancer.",

            "content": "Building a portfolio capable of paying tens of thousands in dividends doesn't have to be complicated\n\nBuilding a portfolio full of high-quality dividend stocks that pay enough to cover your essential living expenses in retirement is a big goal for many investors.\n\nQuality dividend payers also tend to raise their dividend each year, more than offsetting inflation most of the time. That means if you can build an annual income big enough to retire on using dividends alone, you may be able to avoid selling any of your shares. Your heirs will certainly thank you for a very generous income-generating portfolio when you eventually pass it on to them.\n\nFortunately, you don't have to spend hours researching dividend stocks to pick out one or two quality companies to buy each month. Consistently investing in a simple exchange-traded fund (ETF) and reinvesting the dividends could result in a massive portfolio over time that pays you tens of thousands of dollars each year. This simple strategy could turn a $200 monthly investment into $25,000 in annual dividend income for patient investors.\n\nThe best dividend ETF you can buy\n\nGreat dividend stocks have a relatively long track record of payment, consistently raise their dividend, and have the financial wherewithal to keep raising it for years to come. That's why the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD -0.29%) is such an attractive fund for investors looking for dividend growth stocks.\n\nThe fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which selects 100 stocks issued by U.S. companies with a 10-year track record of paying dividends. On top of that, each company produces strong cash flow that more than covers debt and payments to shareholders, ensuring they can continue raising payments. Those criteria differentiate it from other dividend ETFs, which might select stocks based purely on yield or dividend growth without concern for potential payout cuts in the near future.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is full of great companies. Its top 10 holdings (and their forward dividend yields) are:\n\nPfizer (6.4%) Abbvie (3.6%) Coca-Cola (3.2%) Cisco Systems (2.7%) BlackRock (2%) Bristol Myers Squibb (4.4%) Texas Instruments (2.8%) Verizon Communications (6.8%) Amgen (3.7%) PepsiCo (3.7%)\n\nA few high-yield dividend stocks make it into the ETF's top holdings, but yield is far from the most important metric for weighting in the fund. Most of the top holdings have yields well below what you could get from Treasury bonds, but they hold a lot of potential to raise those payments over time. A great dividend growth stock could pay off much more in the long run than simply selecting investments with the highest yield today.\n\nThe Schwab fund has an expense ratio of just 0.06%, making it one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to invest in a variety of great dividend growth stocks.\n\nHow to turn $200 per month into $25,000 in annual dividends\n\nIf you consistently buy $200 worth of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF each month, you'll eventually have a sizable portfolio. And if you automatically reinvest the dividends until you're ready to start living off your portfolio, you should see excellent returns.\n\nThe ETF has a 13.6% annual return since its inception in 2011. That's unlikely to continue; the last 13 years have been some of the best in stock market history.\n\nThe S&P 500 historically returns around 10% per year. Big mature dividend-paying stocks might return slightly less, on average. Investors will also have to account for the above-average tax drag on dividend stocks, so the fund might grow about 9% per year (when reinvesting dividends).\n\nThe ETF also has a 3.3% distribution yield over the trailing 12 months. That, too, may come down over time. That's because the Federal Reserve is currently looking to lower interest rates over the next few years, which could carry over to dividend yields (as a result of more investors moving capital to stocks and sending share prices higher). A 3% dividend yield may be a conservative long-term estimate.\n\nInvesting $200 per month based on the assumptions noted above (including the reinvestment of dividends) will lead to the following theoretical returns over time:\n\nAt the End of Year... Portfolio Value Annual Dividends 1 $2,499 $75 5 $14,948 $448 10 $37,946 $1,138 15 $73,331 $2,200 20 $127,776 $3,833 25 $211,546 $6,346 30 $340,436 $10,213 35 $538,749 $16,162 40 $843,879 $25,316\n\nThe above table is merely hypothetical. Anyone with even a little bit of experience with stocks knows they don't go up in a straight line every month. As a result, actual returns will look much different from the above table. That said, the longer your investment horizon is, the more likely real-world results will look similar to theoretical results.\n\nAnother consideration is that $25,000 won't be worth nearly as much in 40 years as it's worth today. Inflation will eat into the value of the dollar over time.\n\nEven with a modest 2% average annual inflation, $25,000 in 40 years won't be worth half as much as it's worth today. If your goal is $25,000 in today's dollars, you'll need to double your investment.\n\nYou'll find those challenges in any long-term investment planning exercise. It's important to remain flexible and adjust your strategy over time to ensure you reach your goals.\n\nBut by starting today, you can build a strong foundation for massive dividend payments in the future by consistently investing in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF each month.",

            "content": "The UK's self-regulated system for disclosing payments from drug companies to healthcare professionals and organizations is failing to protect patients and public trust, according to a new analysis led by researchers at the University of Bath, UK and Lund University, Sweden published in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.\n\nThe study highlights the staggering shortcomings of the current system, known as Disclosure UK, which is managed by the pharmaceutical industry's membership body/trade body , the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). The report finds that Disclosure UK leaves critical gaps that obscure potential conflicts of interest and put patient care at risk.\n\nKey findings:\n\n1. Billions in untraceable research payments\n\nBetween 2015 and 2022, drug companies reported \u00a33.3 billion in research-related payments, representing 72% of all disclosed transactions. These payments are lumped together in aggregate without naming recipients, making it impossible to assess where the money goes or how it might influence patient care. Companies such as AstraZeneca (UK and Sweden owned with HQ in Cambridge, United Kingdom), Allergan (US owned), and Bristol Myers Squibb (US owned) classified over 90% of their total payments as research-related, raising concerns about how the definition of \"research\" may be used to limit transparency.\n\n2. Non-research payments lack clarity\n\nNon-research payments, including sponsorships and consultancy fees, amounted to \u00a31.1 billion over the same period. While under the Code of Practice these payments are supposed to name recipients, companies' practices vary widely. Some report nearly all recipients, while others, such as Allergan, disclose as little as 15%.\n\n3. Significant breaches by major companies\n\nSeveral companies have been found to violate transparency requirements. Novo Nordisk, the Danish company that manufactures the weight-loss jabs Wegovy and Ozempic, failed to report approximately \u00a37.8 million in payments to over 150 UK healthcare professionals and organizations, which constituted a major breach of the self-regulatory Code of Practice.\n\nThe Iceberg of Uncertainty: Unveiling the \"Unknowns\"\n\nThe study introduces a novel framework for understanding the \"unknowns\" of payment disclosure, inspired by the \"Rumsfeld Matrix,\" which categorizes gaps in knowledge about drug companies' financial ties to the healthcare sector. Researchers identified four key layers of uncertainty in how payments are disclosed under Disclosure UK: Known knowns : These are payments that are reported and can technically be identified, but it's tricky to trace them. For instance, the way NHS trusts or organizations are named by drug companies can cause records to be incomplete or misleading.\n\n: These are payments that are reported and can technically be identified, but it's tricky to trace them. For instance, the way NHS trusts or organizations are named by drug companies can cause records to be incomplete or misleading. Known unknowns : These payments are acknowledged in the system, but their details \u2013 which are key for tracing potential conflicts of interest \u2013 are hidden from the public. For example, research payments worth \u00a33.3 billion are lumped together without specific details like the names of recipients, the amounts, or the purposes-often hiding behind claims of \"commercial sensitivity.\"\n\n: These payments are acknowledged in the system, but their details \u2013 which are key for tracing potential conflicts of interest \u2013 are hidden from the public. For example, research payments worth \u00a33.3 billion are lumped together without specific details like the names of recipients, the amounts, or the purposes-often hiding behind claims of \"commercial sensitivity.\" Unknown knowns : These payments exist but are reported incorrectly or wrongly assigned. This happens when there are inconsistent naming systems or duplicate entries. For example, more than 10% of payments to patient organisations between 2015 and 2018 were reported wrongly, making it nearly impossible to establish the extent and nature of their ties to drug companies.\n\n: These payments exist but are reported incorrectly or wrongly assigned.

For example, more than 10% of payments to patient organisations between 2015 and 2018 were reported wrongly, making it nearly impossible to establish the extent and nature of their ties to drug companies. Unknown unknowns: These payments are never reported at all-either because companies aren't required to disclose them (like Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which isn't part of the ABPI Code) or because they ignore reporting rules. These cases involve companies like Novo Nordisk failing to disclose payments altogether, which the industry's self-regulatory body viewed as indicative of failings in the company's corporate culture, and not just technical processes for payment reporting..\n\nDr. Piotr Ozieranski, lead author from the University of Bath, warns:\n\n\n\n\"Our analysis reveals that the public sees only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to drug company payments to healthcare professionals and organizations. Without strong legislation, conflicts of interest will remain hidden, undermining healthcare integrity and potentially putting patients at risk.\n\nSunlight is the best disinfectant, which is why we're calling for a UK version of the USA's Sunshine Act to ensure transparency in pharmaceutical spending.\"\n\nDr. Emily Rickard, co author from the University of Bath added:\n\n\"Why is one of the world's largest industries-directly impacting public health-allowed such lax transparency? If pharmaceutical companies are funnelling billions across the UK's health ecosystem in the name of public interest, the public deserves to know where this money goes and how it affects patient care.\n\nThe UK government must prioritise patients' health over pharmaceutical profits, ensuring economic incentives don't compromise wellbeing. Robust legislation for pharmaceutical payment transparency is essential to protect patients from the harmful effects of unchecked commercial influence.\"\n\nThe report calls for the UK government to move beyond Disclosure UK and introduce mandatory legislation, which can be modelled on the US Sunshine Act. Such laws would:\n\nRequire all payments, including those for research, to disclose full recipient details and amounts.\n\nMandate consistent reporting standards, including unique identifiers for payment recipients.\n\nImpose significant financial penalties for companies failing to comply with transparency rules.\n\nThe research authors believe the government's recent consultation on payment transparency is a step in the right direction. However, the report cautions that simply expanding Disclosure UK won't be enough. Only legislation backed by enforcement mechanisms can bring the clarity and accountability needed to protect public trust in healthcare.\n\nSpecific recommendations for improvement are detailed in a recent Policy Brief published by the Institute of Policy Research at the University of Bath in collaboration with UK-based patient advocates.",

After pharma and biopharma biggies such as Amgen, Sanofi, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Zoetis, the city is now learnt to be on the radar of pharma giants such as Eli Lilly, GSK, and Merck.TOI has learnt that the US-headquartered Eli Lilly, which has a market capitalisation of over $734 billion, has already zeroed in on a facility in the heart of Hyderabad's IT hub, a stone's throw from IKEA. The global development centre (GDC) is expected to become operational by mid-2025, sources indicated. The American drug giant acquired about 2.5 lakh sq ft to 2.75 lakh sq ft of space spanning over one floor at Phoenix Equinox, where it will accommodate over 2,500 people, realty sources said. However, TOI could not get a confirmation on the development from the company at the time of going to press.Buzz about Eli Lilly's plans to set up shop in Hyderabad, which has emerged as a key global capability centres (GCC) hub for the life sciences sector, comes almost a year after Eli Lilly's global CEO David Ricks visited Hyderabad. He had delivered the keynote address at the BioAsia 2024 conclave, where he also held a meeting with Telangana industries & IT minister D Sridhar Babu. Realty sources said while players like GSK were scouting the Hyderabad market for viable options, Amgen has already acquired 6 lakh sq ft at RMZ Nexity and is scouting for more space in the city in locations such as Genome Valley.Apart from pharma and biopharma giants, Hyderabad has also seen healthcare and medtech players such as Cigna's Evernorth, HCA Healthcare, Providence, Medtronic, and Olympus Corporation set up some of their largest GCCs and global innovation centres. Telangana's lifesciences sector bagged investments worth more than Rs 36,000 crore in 2024 with 13 GCCs deciding to set up shop in the state.",

Opdivo has truly revolutionized treatment in melanoma and is a mainstay treatment in lung cancer. What is interesting about this approval is that \u201cit\u2019s delivered in a three- to five-minute subcutaneous injection versus a 30-minute delivery that comes with the infusion,\u201d said Bartie. This specific approval \u201cis the first and only PD-1 that has been approved as a subcutaneous option for patients.\u201d According to Bartie, what is potentially interesting about this treatment option is that \u201cit allows cancer treatment to happen in a shorter period of time\u201d, in turn \u201calleviating some of the issues for the working poor who are not from substantial economic means.\u201d\n\nFor Bartie, the job and the mission are personal as she\u2019s had to deal with cancer in her own family. \u201cI know my parents benefited from innovation and I want to make sure people who find themselves in the same situation I found myself in, have access to the education, the thought leaders, community doctors and resources that can help them make informed decisions that ultimately can save their lives.\u201d\n\nWith approximately 80% of cancer patients receiving treatment in community settings rather than major academic medical centers, Bartie emphasizes the crucial role of the pharmaceutical industry in supporting local healthcare providers and oncologists. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that the pharmaceutical industry continues to be a strong partner with community oncologists, given the fact that they are at the frontline of defense in treating the vast majority of these patients.\u201d For many patients, community medicine is the only choice, and excellent care is available in this setting. Still, there are many community oncologists who tell SurvivorNet they struggle to keep up with the latest treatments and the knowledge needed to deploy them. We do note that the idea of a widely used drug delivered in the form of a shot has had some success in multiple myeloma with the subcanteous formulation of daratumumab.\n\nCould Injectable Immunotherapy Mean Better Care?\n\nLooking ahead, Bartie envisions these improvements transforming the quality of patient care and community support. She emphasizes that faster administration times will allow healthcare providers to focus on what matters most: meaningful patient interactions and comprehensive care planning.\n\n\u201cWe hope these innovations will allow doctors and nurses to spend more time coaching and counseling patients,\u201d Bartie explained. But her vision extends beyond the clinic walls. She stressed the importance of strengthening the broader support ecosystem, particularly through the advocacy community, which she describes as \u201cthe linchpin and nexus of education and support for our patients.\u201d\n\nLearn more about SurvivorNet's rigorous medical review process.",

            "content": "Analysts point out that while income and growth are crucial for retirees to maintain financial stability during a potentially long retirement, this approach has its limitations and may not be suitable for everyone. They advise building a portfolio that is diversified across various sectors and includes companies with strong cash reserves to support stock buybacks. Dave King, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, stressed the importance of straightforward diversification in an interview with Barron\u2019s. He recommended holding at least eight stocks from different sectors, suggesting that while diversification doesn\u2019t need to be overly extensive, it should include more than just a few stocks\u2014ideally more than five, with representation from each major sector. King also advised that when selecting stocks, investors should not rely too heavily on Wall Street research. Instead, they should prioritize fundamental, time-tested factors like a company\u2019s credit rating or the reputation of its management, which can provide key insights into the stability of its dividend payments.\n\n\u201cTo have a retirement portfolio that has a significant component of stocks with attractive dividends makes a tremendous amount of sense. If the average company in the market can grow its earnings at 7% to 8% a year, your dividends should be growing at a similar rate.\u201d\n\nDue to their solid long-term performance in the past, dividend stocks are becoming a vital part of a well-rounded retirement portfolio for many investors. Strategically chosen dividend-paying stocks can offer stability during market declines and enhance gains during upswings by providing regular income that helps mitigate losses and amplify returns. In addition, they offer a hedge against inflation, which has become a growing concern due to rising costs of essentials like food and energy. Several top-performing companies have consistently increased their dividend payouts over decades. David Giroux, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price who oversees the firm's capital appreciation strategy, shared insights on dividend stocks in an interview with Barron\u2019s. Below are some of his remarks:\n\nDividend stocks are well-suited for retirees because they also offer protection during challenging times. A report by Morningstar highlighted that dividend-stock funds were well-prepared to endure the tech stock crash from 2000 to 2002, as they had minimal exposure to the sector. During that period, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index suffered a cumulative loss of nearly 44%, largely due to significant declines in its growth stocks, whereas dividend stock funds experienced only about a third of that loss.\n\nAs retirement approaches, ensuring financial stability becomes increasingly important for investors. Among the available investment options, consistent dividend payments are especially attractive due to their dependability and security. Dividends, which represent a portion of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, provide a reliable income stream.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have steadily risen, with an average annual increase of just over 7%. In strong market periods, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in tougher years like 2020 and 2022, when returns were flat or negative, dividends provided stability and helped strengthen portfolio resilience.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a screener to select dividend stocks that have shown at least 10 years of dividend growth and are spread across various industries, making them suitable for a retirement stock portfolio. From the initial selection, we chose ten stocks, each from a different industry, all with yields of at least 2%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields, as of January 6. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nHow Much Debt Does Bristol-Myers Squibb Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2024 Bristol-Myers Squibb had US$49.8b of debt, an increase on US$37.7b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$8.09b in cash leading to net debt of about US$41.7b.\n\nNYSE:BMY Debt to Equity History January 7th 2025\n\nHow Strong Is Bristol-Myers Squibb's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Bristol-Myers Squibb had liabilities of US$22.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$53.8b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.09b as well as receivables valued at US$14.9b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$53.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Bristol-Myers Squibb has a huge market capitalization of US$114.7b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nWith a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.2, Bristol-Myers Squibb uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 7.1 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. Bristol-Myers Squibb grew its EBIT by 6.1% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Bristol-Myers Squibb's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

The company had 120 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, while Pitchbook puts the headcount at 122, meaning the cuts could affect about 48 people and leave the biotech with fewer than 75 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. The company expects to provide initial Phase Ia dose escalation data in the first half of the year. In addition to focusing on this and other wholly owned clinical stage programs, CytomX is continuing work with its collaboration partners, including Amgen, Astellas, Bristol Myers Squibb, Moderna and Regeneron.\n\nThat said, the biotech noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. A Phase I study has enrolled over 70 patients to date, but plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nLast March, the biotech had a major development when BMS discontinued its partnered program for a more potent version of the BMS immunotherapy Yervoy. CytomX\u2019s stock dipped about 20% in premarket trading the morning after that news broke.\n\nThe biotech\u2019s workforce reduction is expected to primarily affect areas supporting nonpartnered early research as well as general and administrative functions. The cuts should be complete by the end of the first quarter. CytomX noted in its announcement that cost reductions from the restructuring combined with focused clinical development priorities should extend its cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.",

He also talked synthetic control arms and how they can replace expensive non-treatment arms, enhancing trial efficiency.\n\nACT: What trends do you think we\u2019ll see in 2025 with real-world evidence (RWE) and real-world data (RWD) in clinical research?\n\nJadhav: The second bucket is around external control arms, synthetic control arms. It's been around for quite a while, overarching use of this for the particular components of the clinical trial where they're actually not getting the treatment, so the non-treatment arms are leveraging real-world data to understand and compare and contrast to the treatment arms that you put forward there. Historically, recruiting patients where you're not providing them the treatment, as you can imagine, is very, very expensive and very time consuming overall. I think that's the area where you look at synthetic control arms, and leveraging real-world data can help be a good proxy, or can help augment and allow you to compare and contrast to the treatment arm. The good thing with real-world data and leveraging it for these type of control arms is that the volume is very, very large, and the quality and the longitudinality of the data is pretty good as well. If anything, the compare and contrast, the treatment arm versus a non-treatment arm can actually be a high-quality fashion as well. These are some of the key trends that we're seeing as we move into 2025 in terms of helping improve clinical research by leveraging real-world data.",

            "content": "TOURS, France, Jan. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GORTEC, known as Head and Neck Radiation Oncology Group, today announced that the randomized Phase 3 NIVOPOSTOP GORTEC 2018-01 trial evaluating nivolumab, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s anti-PD-1 therapy, as a post-operative treatment component for resected patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (LA-SCCHN), with high risk of relapse met its primary endpoint of Disease-Free survival (DFS) across all comers.\n\nThe study evaluated after surgery the addition of nivolumab to standard-of care (SOC) radiotherapy and cisplatin, compared to SOC radiotherapy and cisplatin alone. At a pre-determined number of DFS events, there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS for patients receiving nivolumab. The safety profile of nivolumab was consistent with that reported in previous studies, and the compliance to SOC treatments was similar between the 2 arms of the study.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in decades where a therapy demonstrated superiority over standard of care cisplatin-radiotherapy in high-risk patients with LA-SCCHN\u201d said Prof Jean Bourhis, Principal Investigator of the study and Medical Director of the GORTEC.\n\n\u201cThese clinically meaningful findings have the potential to be practice-changing for high-risk LA-SCCHN patients receiving adjuvant therapy,\u201d added both Dr Yoann Pointreau, President and Dr Yun Gan Tao, President-Elect of the GORTEC.\n\nA trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was observed for nivolumab. OS will be evaluated at the final analysis, once the pre-specified number of deaths has been reached.\n\nAbout GORTEC\n\nGORTEC is a cooperative group dedicated to Head and Neck Oncology. GORTEC has a long-standing experience of large scale international innovative phase III trials relying on a robust high-quality study management and a strong multidisciplinary network of investigators and experts in the field of head and neck cancers.\n\nAbout head and neck cancer\n\nHead and neck cancer includes malignancies of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, and is collectively the sixth most common cancer worldwide, having accounted for 891,453 new cases and 458,107 deaths globally in 2022*. Most of these cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCHN), and approximately 60% of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced (LA) disease. Current treatment guidelines for LA-SCCHN recommend surgical resection followed by radiotherapy or cisplatin-radiotherapy (if high-risk pathological findings after resection). Despite these definitive treatments, a large proportion of LA-SCCHN patients develop locoregional recurrence and/or distant metastases within 2 years of completing treatment.\n\nAbout nivolumab\n\nNivolumab is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. Nivolumab is approved for the treatment of 10 different cancer types including colorectal, non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric and gastro-esophageal junction cancers, melanoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma.\n\nAbout NIVOPOSTOP GORTEC 2018-01\n\nIt is a randomized controlled, open-label Phase 3 trial (NCT03576417) evaluating nivolumab as adjuvant treatment in patients with resected LA-SCCHN. The main inclusion criteria were high-risk of relapse as defined by nodal extra capsular extension, multiple nodal involvement, multiple peri-neural invasion and/or positive tumor margins after surgery. The primary endpoint was DFS, and secondary endpoints include OS, QOL and safety. The study enrolled 680 patients who were randomized after surgery to receive either SOC 66 Gy radiotherapy and cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W for three cycles) or nivolumab 240 mg, followed by SOC cisplatin-radiotherapy with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W every 3 weeks during cisplatin-radiotherapy and followed by 6 cycles of nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks.\n\n* Bray F, Global cancer statistics 2022: CA Cancer J Clin 2024; 74(3): 229-63.\n\nMedia Contact: Jean Bourhis: jean.bourhis@gortec.fr\n\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2591470/GORTEC_Logo.jpg\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gortec-announces-new-trial-success-for-head-and-neck-cancer-treatment-302344111.html\n\nSOURCE GORTEC",

            "content": "Q: What is subcutaneous treatment?\n\nA: Medicine administered through the subcutaneous method is delivered in the fatty tissue through a short and narrow needle. Some subcutaneous treatment is mixed with an enzyme called recombinant human hyaluronidase, which helps disperse and absorb the medicine, therefore allowing larger volumes of medicine to be administered in less time.\n\nQ: What are the differences between IV and subcutaneous treatment options that are important to consider?\n\nA: Before subcutaneous options became available, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments were only available through IV infusion, which takes longer for administering the treatment and more preparation steps, including limitation on location. IV infusion can be associated with pain and discomfort, and getting the medicine can take a longer time to administer.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the benefits of subcutaneous injections:\n\nTime savings : Subcutaneous immunotherapy offers less administration time spent (as compared with IV).\n\n: Subcutaneous immunotherapy offers less administration time spent (as compared with IV). Flexibility : This method can be administered in treatment centers, clinics and outside of the hospital setting.\n\nNo port access needed : With subcutaneous immunotherapy, the need for vein access is avoided.\n\nA drawback is that absorption is slower with subcutaneous formulation\u2014which can be sped up with recombinant human hyaluronidase. For some people, IV infusions may make more sense, especially if they are receiving multiple treatments through the same mode.\n\n\n\nSubcutaneous formulations can provide time savings due to less administration time while also making treatment potentially more accessible.\n\nQ: Is subcutaneous immunotherapy as effective as an IV option?\n\nA: Subcutaneous immunotherapy can deliver similar results and a comparable safety profile to IV infusions in less administration time, while also offering the flexibility to receive treatment in multiple locations.\n\nQ: How can patients know if subcutaneous therapy is a good option for them?\n\nA: Many factors go into choosing the most appropriate treatment option, so patients should talk to their doctors to create a treatment plan that is right for them. However, subcutaneous treatment options may be an approach to consider for patients who are looking to save time. They may offer similar results and comparable safety profile to IV infusions.",

            "content": "The FDA ended 2024 with a flurry of year-end decisions, capping off a productive year that saw 55 novel approvals. This list includes several potentially practice-changing drugs, including Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy, the first new mechanism of action for schizophrenia in over three decades, and Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster therapy Dupixent, which in September 2024 became the first biologic approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nLast year, the FDA also greenlit the industry\u2019s first-ever treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Rezdiffra, and introduced a much-needed alternative anti-amyloid treatment option for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla.\n\nThe gene therapy space also saw several key approvals in 2024, including Pfizer\u2019s Beqvez, indicated for hemophilia B, and PTC Therapeutics\u2019 Kebilidi, which is used for the treatment of L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiencyand is the first direct-to-brain gene therapy cleared by the FDA.\n\nLooking ahead, the FDA is expected to deliver several key verdicts that could shape the industry\u2014and clinical practice\u2014in profound ways. Here are BioSpace\u2019s five most anticipated regulatory decisions in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nBiogen and Eisai\u2019s Leqembi\n\nIndication: Intravenous maintenance for early Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nPDUFA: January 25\n\nAmid a disappointing launch\u2014and equally underwhelming sales\u2014Biogen and Eisai are awaiting an FDA approval for the monthly intravenous maintenance regimen of their Alzheimer\u2019s disease therapy Leqembi (lecanemab). The regulator\u2019s final word is due on January 25.\n\nLeqembi, the first anti-amyloid antibody Alzheimer\u2019s drug to win the FDA\u2019s traditional approval, is currently indicated as an intravenous medication administered once every two weeks in approximately hour-long infusion sessions. Under the proposed monthly regimen, the interval between Leqembi doses can be stretched to one month in patients who complete an initial bi-weekly initiation phase\u2014though the exact duration of Leqembi initiation has yet to be determined, according to Biogen and Eisai.\n\nAs per the partners, monthly maintenance is designed to help maintain therapeutic levels of Leqembi in the body in order to suppress toxic protofibrils, which otherwise could result in nerve damage and brain injury even after the clearance of amyloid-beta clumps.\n\nThe companies are backing their application with modeling results using data from the Phase IIb Study 201 and its related open-label extension study. The models also include data from the Phase III Clarity AD and its open-label extension phase.\n\nBiogen and Eisai are also advancing a subcutaneous injection formulation of Leqembi. In August 2024, Eisai noted that the partners had initiated a rolling Biologics License Application for injectable Leqembi and expect approval by March 2026.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report in November 2024, Eisai lowered its full fiscal year sales forecast for Leqembi to $280 million from its previous guidance of approximately $370 million. Analysts from various firms said at the time that Leqembi\u2019s U.S. launch so far has been disappointing and fraught with various infrastructure challenges.\n\nStill, demand for Leqembi appears to be strong and growing, with Biogen and Eisai touting around 6,000 patients waiting to be initiated on the anti-amyloid therapy, which could translate to future growth once the companies address infrastructure and administrative challenges.\n\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Dato-DXd\n\nIndication: Metastatic, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer\n\nPDUFA: January 29\n\nBy January 29, the FDA is expected to have released its decision regarding AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Biologics License Application (BLA) for their antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which the partners are proposing for the treatment of a type of breast cancer.\n\nResults are mixed for Dato-DXd. In the Phase III TROPION-Breast01 study\u2014which the companies are using to back the BLA\u2014the investigational ADC lowered the risk of death or disease progression by 37% versus the investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, according to an October 2023 readout. At the time, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo called this effect \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful.\u201d\n\nHowever, a follow-up data drop in September 2024 showed Dato-DXd was unable to significantly boost overall survival in the study. TROPION-Breast01 enrolled patients with inoperable or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors were HR-positive and either HER2-negative or HER2-low.\n\nAs for safety, TROPION-Breast01 found Dato-DXd to be well-tolerated overall, with a better adverse event profile than chemotherapy. The most common grade 3 or higher side effects included neutropenia, fatigue and anemia.\n\nDato-DXd is an ADC designed to target the TROP2 protein, which is highly expressed in several cancers. This binding affinity allows Dato-DXd to deliver its exatecan derivative payload directly to the target cells, triggering their death.\n\nAside from breast cancer, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are also testing Dato-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer, for which the ADC likewise failed to yield significant overall survival improvements in September 2024.\n\nVertex\u2019s Suzetrigine\n\nIndication: Moderate-to-severe acute pain\n\nPDUFA: January 30\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is advancing a non-opioid analgesic, dubbed suzetrigine, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. The FDA\u2019s verdict is due on January 30.\n\nSuzetrigine is an orally available pain signal inhibitor that selectively targets the NaV1.8 voltage-gated sodium channel, a genetically validated pain target that is typically found on peripheral neurons. NaV1.8 is believed to play a role in sensing pain and transmitting signals back to the central nervous system.\n\nVertex is backing suzetrigine with two Phase II and three Phase III studies, including the NAVIGATE 1 and NAVIGATE 2 trials, which looked at the analgesic efficacy of the drug candidate in patients who had undergone bunionectomy and abdominoplasty, respectively.\n\nFull data from these two late-stage studies, presented in October 2024 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, showed that suzetrigine monotherapy improved pain scores by 48.4 points after a tummy tuck. In patients undergoing the toe procedure, suzetrigine lowered pain scores by 29.3 points. Both treatment effects were statistically significant versus placebo.\n\nAt the time of the readout, analysts appeared to be torn over suzetrigine. BMO Capital Markets said that the presentation \u201creaffirms our confidence in the strength of suzetrigine\u2019s profile in acute pain,\u201d while William Blair noted that while suzetrigine \u201chas a strong argument for inclusion in the market,\u201d its \u201cpricing remains a point of investor contention.\u201d\n\nIf approved, suzetrigine will represent the first new drug class for acute pain in more than two decades, according to Vertex.\n\nAlnylam\u2019s Amvuttra\n\nIndication: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy\n\nPDUFA: March 23\n\nOn the heels of BridgeBio\u2019s recently approved Attruby is Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra, which the Massachusetts-basedbiotech is hoping to expand into transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\n\nAmvuttra, which is currently indicated for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, is an RNA interference treatment that works by knocking down mutant and wildtype TTR mRNA, leading to an overall decrease in protein levels in the serum. Through this mechanism, Amvuttra also lowers TTR deposits in various organs, including the heart, that would otherwise give rise to the various symptoms of cardiomyopathy, including the stiffening of cardiac walls.\n\nTo support its ATTR-CM bid, Alnylam is using data from the Phase III HELIOS-B study, which found that Amvuttra had \u201cfavorable effects\u201d on survival, cardiovascular events, functional capacity and quality of life in ATTR-CM patients, according to the biotech\u2019s press announcement of the FDA\u2019s acceptance of its supplemental New Drug Application. A presentation at the 2024 American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions showed that Amvuttra treatment led to a 28% drop in the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events.\n\nThe FDA is expected to release its verdict on March 23.\n\nIf approved, Amvuttra will be the first RNA interference therapeutic for ATTR-CM, in contrast to BridgeBio\u2019s Attruby and Pfizer\u2019s Vyndaqel and Vyndamax, which are TTR stabilizers.\n\nSanofi\u2019s Fitusiran\n\nIndication: Hemophilia A or B\n\nPDUFA: March 28\n\nTo challenge the increasingly popular gene therapy approach to hemophilia, Sanofi is advancing fitusiran, an investigational small interference RNA therapy. The pharma is seeking approval for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A and B patients, regardless of their inhibitor status. The FDA\u2019s decision is due on March 28.\n\nIn support of fitusiran\u2019s FDA bid are data from the ATLAS clinical development program. In April 2023, Sanofi announced publications in The Lancet and The Lancet Hematology touting encouraging late-stage results for the siRNA candidate.\n\nOne of these studies, dubbed ATLAS-INH, focused on patients with inhibitors and found that 66% of fitusiran-treated participants hit zero monthly bleeding episodes, as compared with 5% of control counterparts who were given an on-demand bypassing agent. The other trial, named ATLAS A/B, enrolled patients without inhibitors, of whom 51% had zero monthly bleeds after fitusiran treatment, versus 5% of comparators treated with on-demand clotting factors.\n\nTaken together, both studies showed that prophylactic fitusiran could reduce the annualized bleeding rate by 90% versus their respective control arms, according to Sanofi.\n\nIf approved, fitusiran will introduce a new modality of treatment to a therapeutic space that is increasingly being addressed with gene therapies. Leading the charge is BioMarin\u2019s Roctavian, which became the first FDA-approved gene therapy for hemophilia A in June 2023. It works by restoring the body\u2019s ability to produce the blood-clotting protein factor VIII.\n\nPfizer is taking a similar approach to hemophilia A with its investigational gene therapy giroctocogene fitelparvovec. In July, the candidate aced its Phase III trial, maintaining over 5% factor VIII activity in 84% of treated patients at 15 months. In February, the pharma won the FDA\u2019s approval for its hemophilia B gene therapy Beqvez.",

Data from the phase 3 CheckMate-67T study (NCT04810078) provided support for this approval. In the trial, subcutaneous nivolumab was compared with its intravenous formulation.\n\n\u201cIntravenous [nivolumab] has helped transform the treatment of several solid tumor types over the past decade, but there remains a need for additional administration options to address treatment burden on patients and improve efficiencies in healthcare systems,\u201d said Gina Fusaro, PhD, vice president, global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb, in a press release. \u201cWe believe this new option, given as a single injection administered in less than 5 minutes, could transform the treatment experience for both patients and physicians.\u201d For more details on approval indication, read full article here.\n\nTislelizumab Gains FDA Approval in Advanced Gastric and GEJ Cancers\n\nTiselizumab (Tevimbra) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy received FDA approval for newly diagnosed, locally advanced or metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Data from the global phase 3 RATIONALE-305 trial (NCT03777657) support the approval, demonstrating an improvement in overall survival and a manageable safety profile. In the trial, tiselizumab plus chemotherapy was compared with placebo plus chemotherapy. For detailed trial data, read the full article here.\n\nExploring Notable Achievements Throughout 2024 for Breast Cancer\n\nIn this article, Targeted OncologyTM explores the top 10 advancements that occurred in 2024 for breast cancer. Highlights begin with an FDA approval for inavolisib (Itovebi, previously GDC-0077) with palbociclib (Ibrance) and fulvestrant for hormone receptor\u2013positive (HR+), HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer. Adjuvant ribociclib (Kisqali) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor also took home an FDA approval for HR+/ HER2-negative early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, among other noteworthy approvals.\n\nOther highlights include the encouraging results from the phase 3 OlympiA trial (NCT02032823), evaluating olaparib (Lynparza), and the I-SPY 2.2 trial (NCT01042379), evaluating neoadjuvant therapy based on tumor subtype. For the full list of breast cancer breakthroughs that occurred in 2024, read the full article here.\n\nSpecialist Provides Insight on Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Case\n\nIn this article, David H. Ilson, MD, PhD, discussed a case of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, explaining optimal treatment choices supported by data from the following phase 3 trials: CheckMate 649 (NCT02872116), KEYNOTE-859 (NCT03675737), and CheckMate 648 (NCT03143153). Ilson provides an expert perspective on the impact of various treatment combinations, as well as evaluating the safety profiles of the current treatment options available for this patient population.\n\n\u201cThe better choice here is likely to be chemotherapy plus nivolumab because you do see this early drop-off in patients,\u201d Ilson explained. \u201cWe have to be judicious in which patients we select for this regimen. Personally, I would treat patients with ipilimumab/nivolumab if the primary [tumor] were controlled and if they had low-volume metastatic disease, but it is an option and certainly a nonchemotherapy option if clinically appropriate.\u201d Ilson is a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, New York. For the full discussion and case details, read the full article here.\n\nDiscussion on ctDNA as Ideal Biomarker in HER2+ Breast Cancer\n\nIn this article, Adrienne Waks, MD, discussed data from the DAPHNe trial (NCT03716180), which showed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to be a promising biomarker for monitoring treatment response and minimal residual disease in HER2-positive breast cancer. In the trial, patients received neoadjuvant paclitaxel, trastuzumab (Herceptin), and pertuzumab (Perjeta), which was effective in clearing ctDNA. Waks is senior physician and the associate director of breast oncology clinical research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cAt baseline, with the tumor in place, the detectability rate was good, and that was one important finding for us. Over the 12 weeks of therapy, when we retested their ctDNA before surgery, we found that almost all of them had cleared their ctDNA\u2014though not quite all, but almost all. Then, postoperatively, when we looked at their adjuvant therapy about a year later, the large majority\u2014over 90% to 95%\u2014had persistent clearance of circulating tumor DNA at those later time points,\u201d said Waks.

In the BMS-986253 arm, the complete response (CR), partial response, stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) rates were 8.1%, 6.5%, 19.4%, and 50.0%, respectively. These respective rates were 1.7%, 10.0%, 31.7%, and 36.7% in the control arm.\n\nNo patients in either arm had SD for more than 6 months. In the BMS-986253 group, 4.8% of patients had a best response of non-CR/non-PD, and response was unable to be determined in 11.3% of patients. In the control arm, 1.7% of patients had a best response of non-CR/non-PD, 13.3% were unable to be evaluated for response, and best response was not reported in 5.0% of patients.\n\n\u201cThese results further support the use of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with melanoma who progress on anti\u2013PD-[L]1 monotherapy,\u201d lead study author Matteo Simonelli, MD, of the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital Humanitas University in Milan, Italy, said in a presentation of the data.\n\nCA027-002 Overview\n\nPart 2 of CA027-002 included patients at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed, unresectable, stage III or IV melanoma whose disease progressed on or after anti\u2013PD-(L)1 therapy. Prior anti\u2013PD-(L)1 therapy needed to be the most recent line of treatment. Patients with BRAF V600E\u2013mutated and wild-type disease were allowed to enroll, and patients needed to have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. No prior anti\u2013CTLA-4 therapy was allowed.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 3600 mg of BMS-986253 once every 2 weeks plus 1 mg/kg of nivolumab once every 3 weeks and 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab once every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks, followed by 3600 mg of BMS-986253 once every 2 weeks plus 480 mg of nivolumab once every 4 weeks; or placebo plus the same regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab for the first 12 weeks, followed by placebo plus 480 mg of nivolumab once every 4 weeks.\n\nStratification factors included serum IL-8 levels (>10 pg/mL vs \u226410 pg/mL), BRAF V600E status (mutated vs wild-type), and peripheral lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (>upper limit of normal [ULN] vs \u2264ULN).\n\nBlinded independent central review\u2013assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria served as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points included PFS and safety.\n\nThe median age was 64.0 years in the experimental arm vs 63.5 years in the control arm. The majority of patients were male (BMS-986253 arm, 64.5%; placebo arm, 71.7%), White (90.3%; 88.3%), not Hispanic or Latino (67.7%; 68.3%), from Europe (75.8%; 56.7%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (80.6%; 83.3%), had LDH levels no higher than the ULN (62.9%; 61.7%), did not harbor BRAF V600E mutations (79.0%; 78.3%), and did not have brain metastases (96.8%; 93.3%).\n\nAdditional Efficacy and Safety Data\n\nThe median time to response was 1.9 months in the BMS-986253 arm vs 2.6 months in the placebo arm. The median duration of response was not applicable (NA; 95% CI, 4.07-NA; range, 4.1-18.5) in the BMS-986253 arm vs NA (95% CI, 5.29-NA; range, 4.6-15.5) in the placebo arm.\n\nThe median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.8) in the BMS-986253 group vs 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.7) in the placebo group (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61-1.45; P = .74). In the BMS-986253 arm, the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 24% and 15%, respectively. These respective rates in the placebo arm were 22% and 12%.\n\nRegarding safety, any-grade treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) occurred in 95.2% of patients in the BMS-986253 arm vs 87.7% of patients in the control arm. The rates of grade 3/4 TRAEs were 46.8% and 52.6%, respectively. TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 22.6% of patients in the BMS-986253 group vs 24.6% of patients in the placebo group. The rates of serious TRAEs were 38.7% and 40.4%, respectively.\n\nThe most common grade 3/4 TRAEs included diarrhea (BMS-986253 arm, 9.7%; placebo arm, 15.8%), colitis (6.5%; 12.3%), increased alanine aminotransferase levels (8.1%; 5.3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (4.8%; 5.3%), and increased lipase levels (6.5%; 3.5%).\n\nOne grade 5 TRAE was reported in each arm. One patient in the experimental arm had grade 5 renal failure, and 1 patient in the placebo arm had grade 5 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\n\nDisclosures: Dr Simonelli reported serving as an advisory board member for Incyte, Cytovia, and GSK; being an invited speaker for GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb; serving on a data monitoring committee for Sanofi; serving as a steering committee member for Celgene and Bristol Myers Squibb; and receiving travel grants from Roche, Sanofi, and Pfizer.\n\nReference\n\nSimonelli M, Butler MO, Ascierto PA, et al.

            "content": "If you're worried about having enough passive income to maintain your lifestyle during retirement, you're not alone. Having to spend more just to maintain their current standard of living is a constant concern for most families.\n\nThere isn't much that you can do to stop the march of inflation, but you can prepare. Filling your portfolio with dividend-paying stocks that raise their quarterly payouts faster than the underlying inflation rate could even lead to extra spending cash.\n\nMedtronic (MDT 1.14%), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.99%), and AbbVie (ABBV -0.03%) have many years of reliable dividend growth under their belts. If there's one corner of the economy investors can count on to grow in good and bad macroeconomic conditions, it's the healthcare sector.\n\nYou can put off buying a new car for years, but medical conditions rarely give customers of these companies an option. Here's how adding them to your portfolio and holding them over the coming decade gives you a great chance to realize a growing passive income stream.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic got started with pacemakers in the 1950s. Cardiovascular devices such as leadless pacemakers and replacement valves are still a large part of the business, but there's much more. For example, it markets implantable devices that can alleviate chronic back pain.\n\nSurgeons all over the world employing a growing suite of Medtronic's minimally invasive solutions have allowed the company to raise its dividend for 47 consecutive years. At recent prices, the stock offers an attractive 3.5% yield.\n\nIn the U.S. and other developed nations, populations are aging. Older folks use a lot of healthcare, which is driving up overall spending. The U.S. spent $4.9 trillion on healthcare in 2023, which was 7.5% more than it spent a year earlier.\n\nLast year, Medtronic generated a healthy $5.5 billion in free cash flow but needed just 66% of this sum to meet its dividend obligation. With the unstoppable trend toward increasing healthcare expenses at its back, investors can reasonably expect plenty more dividend payout raises in the years ahead.\n\n2. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nIn the U.S., spending on prescription drugs rose 11.4% year over year to $450 billion in 2023. With this tailwind at its back, Bristol Myers Squibb has been able to raise its dividend payout for 16 consecutive years. The stock offers a 4.3% yield at recent prices.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb stock has been under pressure because there are aging blockbusters in its product lineup that could lose market share soon. For example, Eliquis is an oral blood thinner that racked up $3 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2024. It's responsible for 25% of total revenue but will likely begin competing with generic versions in the U.S. beginning in 2028.\n\nWhile Bristol Myers Squibb could lose Eliquis revenue in a few years, its portfolio of more recently launched drugs with longer periods of market exclusivity could more than offset the losses. The company's growth portfolio, which contributes 49% of total sales, grew third-quarter sales by 18% year over year.\n\nRecently, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable version of Bristol Myers Squibb's blockbuster cancer therapy, Opdivo. Sales of the infused version of the immunotherapy rose to $2.3 billion in the third quarter. An easy-to-administer injectable version that's interchangeable with the infusion could allow Bristol Myers Squibb to retain Opdivo revenue when the infused version begins losing patent-protected market exclusivity a few years from now.\n\n3. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie is another big pharmaceutical company made of many pieces moving in opposite directions. Its former lead drug is an anti-inflammatory injection called Humira.\n\nAt recent prices, AbbVie stock offers a 3.7% yield. The company has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since spinning off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.\n\nCompetition with lower-cost biosimilar versions of Humira is hammering sales of the blockbuster injection. In the first nine months of 2024, AbbVie reported Humira sales that fell 34% year over year to $7.3 billion.\n\nDespite huge Humira losses, total revenue during the first nine months of 2024 rose by 3% year over year. A pair of drugs that launched in 2019, Skyrizi for psoriasis and Rinvoq for arthritis, are offsetting Humira losses on their own.\n\nIn the third quarter, sales of Skyrizi rose 51% year over year to reach an annualized $12.8 billion. Rinvoq sales bounded 45% higher year over year to an annualized $6.4 billion.\n\nWith the heaviest Humira losses already in its rearview, AbbVie could grow by a high single-digit percentage in 2025 and beyond. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio now looks like a great idea for most income-seeking investors.",

Choi, MD, of the department of dermatology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and colleagues wrote. \u201cWhile the atopic march has been presented as a sequential progression of allergic conditions, the temporal relationship between early-onset AD and subsequent development of the atopic march is not fully understood.\u201d\n\nSevere disease, male sex, family history and prenatal factors were significantly associated with an increased risk for atopic march progression in infants with atopic dermatitis. Image: Adobe Stock.\n\nThe large, retrospective cohort study used the MarketScan Research Database from 2010 to 2018 and included 27,228 patients with AD (60.3% boys) diagnosed before age 1 year and 55,174 controls (51% boys) with no AD diagnosis before age 1 year.\n\nResults showed that higher proportions of patients with AD compared with controls developed asthma (19.21% vs 8.65%), allergic rhinitis (28.27% vs 12.62%), food allergy (16% vs 2.27%) and all three conditions at once, which is known as the atopic triad (10.69% vs 0.71%; P < 0.001 for all).\n\nAmong infants diagnosed with AD, 20.1% developed allergic rhinitis as the second atopy diagnosis after a mean of 497.7 \u00b1 7.9 days following their AD diagnosis. Similarly, 12.4% developed asthma after a mean of 408.4 \u00b1 6.6 days and 11.9% developed a food allergy after a mean of 269.3 \u00b1 6.4 days.\n\nFactors that contributed to a higher likelihood of infants with AD developing the atopic triad included being male (HR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45-1.9), having severe disease (HR = 3.16; 95% CI, 2.77-3.6) and having a family history of atopy (HR > 3.4; P < .001).\n\nDelivery via cesarean section as well the mother\u2019s antibiotic usage during pregnancy were also significant factors in atopic march progression among infants with early-onset AD.\n\nThe authors called the study\u2019s use of health care claims data a limitation.\n\n\u201cEarly-onset AD is associated with higher rates of developing atopic march conditions compared to controls,\u201d Choi and colleagues wrote. \u201cParticular attention should be paid towards risk factors and atopic march screening in early-onset AD patients.\u201d",

The company raised $16 million to accelerate the development of treatments targeting undruggable proteins associated with cancer, cardiometabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and longevity.\n\nThis oversubscribed seed round was led by Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner at Felicis, a firm renowned for backing biotech giants like Recursion, Ginkgo Bioworks, and BioAge. Other notable investors include Y Combinator, age1, Modi Ventures, Wilson Sonsini, as well as several angel investors including Jeff Dean (Head of Google AI), Uri Lopatin (Khosla, YC, Pardes), Ben Mann (Co-Author GPT-3, Co-Founder Anthropic), Alec Nielsen (CEO Asimov), Trevor Martin (CEO Mammoth), Juan Benet (Founder Filecoin), Nish Bhat (Co-Founder Color Health), Jim Dahl (Rock Creek Capital), and De Thompson V (Legends Capital).\n\nGeneral Proximity founder and CEO Armand B. Cognetta III, PhD, is a veteran of renowned chemical biologist Benjamin Cravatt\u2019s research group. And the founding team behind General Proximity includes an array of top scientists from institutions such as Scripps Research Institute, the Broad Institute of Harvard/MIT, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, UPenn, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and UCSF, with deep experience from top pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, Merck, GSK, Genentech, Roche, and Alnylam), as well as multiple veterans from the labs of induced proximity innovators Craig Crews and Amit Choudhary.\n\nGeneral Proximity also assembled a world-class Scientific & Strategic Advisory Board featuring key opinion leaders from top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies such as Martin Babler (Genentech, Principia, Alumis), Lawrence Hamann (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis, Celgene, Takeda, Interdict), and Andy Crew (Astellas, Arvinas, Siduma) alongside several academic experts in cancer biology and neurodegeneration.\n\nThe team is responsible for hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and patents. They have also been a driving force behind over 200 clinical programs and 36 FDA-approved medicines.\n\nThis team has also attracted significant interest from the pharmaceutical industry, securing a record five \u2018Golden Ticket\u2019 awards from major pharma pitch competitions (AbbVie, Servier, Astellas, Ono, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and winning a coveted spot in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JLabs biotech incubator.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\u201cWe believe proximity medicines are the future of small-molecule drug discovery and have the potential to lower global disease burden more than any other current therapeutic modality. Biological proximity\u2014the nearness or interaction of two or more (macro)molecules\u2014is a master regulator of biology. By achieving precise control of proximity through our OmniTAC platform, we are able to modulate \u2018undruggable\u2019 targets more effectively than other approaches. Control of proximity equals control of biology.\u201d\n\nArmand B. Cognetta III, PhD, Founder and CEO of General Proximity\n\n\u201cIt was clear from our first meeting with Armand that General Proximity is going to be one of the technologies that propels us towards cures for cancer and many other diseases. We quickly became convinced that their cutting-edge proximity approach would enable them to solve some of the most ambitious and consequential challenges in drug discovery, paving the way for a bold new era of human healthspan and longevity extension.\u201d",

This development, reported by the Bio-Economy Research Center of the Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization on Jan. 4, highlights the ongoing advancements in the pharmaceutical industry, despite a slight decrease from the previous year's 55 approvals.\n\nThe FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) granted these approvals, which encompassed a diverse range of small molecule drugs, biological products, and oligonucleotides. Notably, the number of new drug approvals last year surpassed the average annual number of 46.5 over the past decade, indicating a robust year for pharmaceutical innovation.\n\nAmong the notable approvals, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' \"Resmetirom\" became the first approved treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a metabolic disorder previously lacking any approved therapies. Additionally, the first schizophrenia treatments, \"Xanomeline\" and \"Trospium,\" developed by Karuna and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), received the green light from the FDA.\n\nEli Lilly and Roche led the pack with two new drug approvals each, the highest among companies. Cancer drugs dominated the list with 15 approvals, accounting for 30% of the total. Skin and blood disorders each saw six new drug approvals (12%), while heart disease treatments received five approvals, ranking third. In contrast, neurological and infectious diseases had fewer new drug approvals compared to the average over the past five years.\n\nBy modality, small molecule drugs had the most approvals with 32, followed by biological drugs (16) and oligonucleotides (2). The small molecule drugs included 30 non-peptide small molecule drugs, one peptide small molecule drug, and one radiopharmaceutical. The biological drug approvals comprised 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), three bispecific antibodies, two fusion proteins, and one toxin product.\n\nAmong domestic pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Hugel received approval for the botulinum toxin \"Letybo,\" and Yuhan Corporation received approval for the non-small cell lung cancer treatment \"Lazertinib.\" Lazertinib's approval is particularly noteworthy as it marks the first Korean cancer drug to receive FDA approval.\n\nThe Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization expressed optimism about the future, stating, \"We hope that this year will also see new drugs developed by domestic companies receiving approval from the U.S. FDA, which could help turn around the currently stagnant domestic investment atmosphere and invigorate companies' research and development (R&D).\"\n\nThe inclusion of South Korean companies Hugel and Yuhan Corporation in the list of FDA-approved drugs underscores the increasing role of international players in the global pharmaceutical market. South Korea has been investing heavily in its pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, aiming to become a global leader in drug development. The approval of drugs from South Korean companies by the FDA is a significant milestone and reflects the country's progress in this field.",

At the same time, the Dow added 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.77%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the biopharmaceutical company had lost 3.48% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 6.56%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.82%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Bristol Myers Squibb in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on February 6, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.47, showcasing a 13.53% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $11.59 billion, indicating a 0.96% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Bristol Myers Squibb. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.57% upward. Bristol Myers Squibb is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Bristol Myers Squibb has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.9 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 22.04.\n\nInvestors should also note that BMY has a PEG ratio of 1.97 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.54.\n\nThe Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 66, which puts it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration ended 2024 with a quartet of notable drug approvals, including three of new medicines that Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk and Bristol Myers Squibb developed for cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and cancer, respectively.\n\nThe approvals concluded a year in which the agency\u2019s main review office cleared 50 novel medicines, less than the 55 in 2023 but toward the higher end of annual totals over the past several years. The record came in 2018, when 59 were cleared by the regulator\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA\u2019s biologics office also issued 10 new medicine approvals in 2024.\n\nThe Dec. 20 clearance of Alyftrek came a few weeks ahead of the agency\u2019s Jan. 2 decision deadline, and extends Vertex\u2019s dominance in the lung disease cystic fibrosis. Prior to Alyftrek\u2019s approval, Vertex had previously brought four cystic fibrosis medicines to market, building a business that generated nearly $10 billion in 2023. Sales are expected to surpass that total in 2024.\n\nLike Vertex\u2019s top-selling drug Trikafta, Alyftrek is a three-drug combination that uses a compound called tezacaftor as its chemical backbone. The two other components are different, allowing Alyftrek to be dosed less frequently \u2014 once daily instead of twice \u2014 and enabling Vertex to pay lower royalties on drug sales. Testing showed the drug was statistically \u201cnon-inferior\u201d to Trikafta on a measure of lung function, and better at lowering the amount of chloride in a person\u2019s sweat, a marker associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nAlyftrek\u2019s approval could also extend Vertex\u2019s market exclusivity in cystic fibrosis, as the drug\u2019s main U.S. patent expires in 2039, two years after Trikafta\u2019s. Vertex priced the therapy at about $370,000 per year, a 7% premium to Trikafta.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Alhemo, meanwhile, was approved on Dec. 20 to prevent bleeds in people at least 12 years of age who have either the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d forms of hemophilia. The decision came about a year and a half after an earlier rejection and makes Novo\u2019s drug available to those who develop an immune response, or \u201cinhibitors,\u201d to other therapies, unlike Pfizer\u2019s similar medicine Hympavzi.\n\nBristol Myers also joined Roche in bringing to market a type of cancer immunotherapy that can be administered via an under-the-skin injection, rather than an infusion. The drug, Opdivo Qvantiq, was approved on Dec. 27 for use in most of the solid tumors Bristol Myers\u2019 Opdivo is cleared to treat. Opdivo Qvantiq\u2019s OK follows the September clearance of a subcutaneous version of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq, and comes ahead of the potential availability of an under-the-skin form of Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda.\n\nThese newer versions are administered more quickly than their predecessors \u2014 in Opdivo Qvantiq\u2019s case, within three to five minutes, versus 30 to 60 minutes for Opdivo \u2014 and are protected by newer sets of patents. Opdivo\u2019s main patent is set to expire in 2028.\n\nFinally, Lilly on Dec. 20 added a new use for its fast-selling weight-loss drug Zepbound, securing the first clearance of a prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea. The drug has been specifically approved for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Its use is recommended alongside increased exercise and a lower-calorie diet.\n\nThe approval adds another new indication for so-called incretin medicines, which are also available for diabetes and have proven beneficial for heart failure, kidney disease and a common liver disorder.",

            "content": "Several Big Pharma companies unveiled price increases for some 250 drugs during the first month of the year, according to data from 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nMost notably, Pfizer is raising the price of its COVID-19 medication Paxlovid, while Bristol Myers Squibb is hiking the price of several cancer cell therapies.\n\nMost of the drug price increases are lower than 10%, with the median price increase reaching 4.5%. That\u2019s about the same as the median increase last year.\n\nAnnual price drug hikes have become less frequent in recent years due to increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the public, but drugmakers have turned to higher launch prices to get around that, 3 Axis president Antonio Ciaccia told Reuters.\n\nLaunch prices in 2023 were 35% higher than in 2022, according to an analysis by the outlet.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers don\u2019t have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\u201d Ciaccia said.\n\nPfizer came out on top in raising the prices of most drugs for the third year in a row, accounting for about 60 on the list.\n\nThe pharma giant, which has experienced a tumultuous few years following a sharp decline in its COVID business, raised the prices of its migraine drug Nurtec and some cancer drugs including Adcentris, Ibrance and Xeljanz.\n\nLeadiant Biosciences was responsible for the biggest price hikes this month, including a 15% increase on its Hodgkin\u2019s disease therapy Matalune \u2014 as well as a 20% increase on cystinosis treatment Cystaran.\n\nBMS increased the prices of its oncology drugs, Abecma and Breyanzi, by 6% and 9%, respectively.\n\nDan Ollendorf, chief scientific officer and director of health technology assessment methods and engagement at healthcare nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), told MM+M that the context around the list prices is important to understand their impact.\n\nList prices are different from net prices, or the money drugmakers take home after paying rebates, discounts or other concessions to middlemen and insurers.\n\n\u201cBefore we make too much out of the yearly list price increases, we have to think about what that actually will mean in terms of net pricing,\u201d he said.\n\nNotably, some list prices also went down this month.\n\nMerck decided it will reduce the list price of its diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, noting it wants to align the list price more closely to the net price. Januvia is one of the first 10 drugs chosen to be part of the Medicare negotiation process, though it\u2019s unclear if the January price drop is related to that.\n\nLast month, ICER published a report that examined the top 10 drugs with the most substantial net price increases in 2023.\n\nThe report found that five of those drugs \u2014 Biktarvy, Darzalex, Entresto, Cabometyx and Xeljanz \u2014 saw \u201cunsupported\u201d price increases that did not add value to patients and resulted in $815 million in added costs to payers.\n\n\u201cThe higher prices we pay for drugs, and if those prices are not aligned with value to the patient, the more pressure that puts on the system,\u201d Ollendorf explained.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a BMS spokesperson said \u201cit is important to note that most patients will not pay the list price for their medication,\u201d and that it does not reflect the discounts provided to insurers, PBMs and other purchasers.\n\n\u201cAt BMS, we are committed to achieving unfettered patient access to our potentially life-saving medicines and our approach to pricing prioritizes the value our medicines deliver for patients, healthcare systems and society,\u201d the spokesperson continued.\n\nDrug pricing advocacy organization the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP), however, wasn\u2019t as pleased with the news.\n\n\u201cBig Pharma makes a tradition of ringing in each new year with egregious price hikes on hundreds of brand name prescription drugs,\u201d CSRxP executive director Lauren Aronson said in a statement. \u201cBig Pharma\u2019s price hikes this January will continue to grow but already outpace the rate of inflation and include significant increases on drugs for serious conditions, like cancer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear how the January price hikes might impact net prices or ultimately impact patients, Ollendorf said. Higher list prices don\u2019t always translate to higher net prices and even reductions in price \u2014 as seen with Januvia \u2014 might not always provide savings to patients.\n\n\u201cIt depends both on whether the net price trend is following the same pattern [as the list price trend],\u201d Ollendorf explained. \u201cIf the net price trend is flatter, then it may not have as much of an impact on patients unless that patient has insurance that is still basing the co-insurance level on the list price rather than the net price.\u201d\n\nAnother area that might have an impact on increasing drug costs is the newly implemented provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that requires drugmakers to pay rebates to the federal government for raising the prices of drugs faster than the rate of inflation.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to track not just whether the net price trend is different from the list price trend, but also how the effects of inflation rebates in the Medicare program play out,\u201d Ollendorf said.",

            "content": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 14% over a half decade.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb became profitable within the last five years. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.\n\nThe steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:BMY Earnings and Revenue Growth January 2nd 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Bristol-Myers Squibb will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Bristol-Myers Squibb, it has a TSR of 2.4% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb provided a TSR of 13% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 0.5% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Bristol-Myers Squibb better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Bristol-Myers Squibb you should know about.",

            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration ended 2024 with a quartet of notable drug approvals, including three of new medicines that Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk and Bristol Myers Squibb developed for cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and cancer, respectively.\n\nThe approvals concluded a year in which the agency\u2019s main review office cleared 50 novel medicines, less than the 55 in 2023 but toward the higher end of annual totals over the past several years. The record came in 2018, when 59 were cleared by the regulator\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA\u2019s biologics office also issued 10 new medicine approvals in 2024.\n\nThe Dec. 20 clearance of Alyftrek came a few weeks ahead of the agency\u2019s Jan. 2 decision deadline, and extends Vertex\u2019s dominance in the lung disease cystic fibrosis. Prior to Alyftrek\u2019s approval, Vertex had previously brought four cystic fibrosis medicines to market, building a business that generated nearly $10 billion in 2023. Sales are expected to surpass that total in 2024.\n\nLike Vertex\u2019s top-selling drug Trikafta, Alyftrek is a three-drug combination that uses a compound called tezacaftor as its chemical backbone. The two other components are different, allowing Alyftrek to be dosed less frequently \u2014 once daily instead of twice \u2014 and enabling Vertex to pay lower royalties on drug sales. Testing showed the drug was statistically \u201cnon-inferior\u201d to Trikafta on a measure of lung function, and better at lowering the amount of chloride in a person\u2019s sweat, a marker associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nAlyftrek\u2019s approval could also extend Vertex\u2019s market exclusivity in cystic fibrosis, as the drug\u2019s main U.S. patent expires in 2039, two years after Trikafta\u2019s. Vertex priced the therapy at about $370,000 per year, a 7% premium to Trikafta.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Alhemo, meanwhile, was approved on Dec. 20 to prevent bleeds in people at least 12 years of age who have either the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d forms of hemophilia. The decision came about a year and a half after an earlier rejection and makes Novo\u2019s drug available to those who develop an immune response, or \u201cinhibitors,\u201d to other therapies, unlike Pfizer\u2019s similar medicine Hympavzi.\n\nBristol Myers also joined Roche in bringing to market a type of cancer immunotherapy that can be administered via an under-the-skin injection, rather than an infusion. The drug, Opdivo Qvantig, was approved on Dec. 27 for use in most of the solid tumors Bristol Myers\u2019 Opdivo is cleared to treat. Opdivo Qvantig\u2019s OK follows the September clearance of a subcutaneous version of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq, and comes ahead of the potential availability of an under-the-skin form of Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda.\n\nThese newer versions are administered more quickly than their predecessors \u2014 in Opdivo Qvantig\u2019s case, within three to five minutes, versus 30 to 60 minutes for Opdivo \u2014 and are protected by newer sets of patents. Opdivo\u2019s main patent is set to expire in 2028.\n\nFinally, Lilly on Dec. 20 added a new use for its fast-selling weight-loss drug Zepbound, securing the first clearance of a prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea. The drug has been specifically approved for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Its use is recommended alongside increased exercise and a lower-calorie diet.\n\nThe approval adds another new indication for so-called incretin medicines, which are also available for diabetes and have proven beneficial for heart failure, kidney disease and a common liver disorder.",

            "content": "Regulators stayed busy over the holidays, squeezing in a few more drug approvals just before the midnight ball drop. Merck\u2019s high-priced acquisition finally got the nod in the UK for a rare lung condition, and the FDA greenlit an injectable version of BMS\u2019 blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved Winrevair (sotatercept) for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disease that causes high blood pressure in the lungs and can eventually lead to organ failure. Merck scored FDA approval for Winrevair in March 2024 and in the E.U. in August.\n\nThe drug was believed to be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for a disease with a very high mortality rate, Jeremy Feldman, director of the pulmonary hypertension program and medical director for high-risk care at Summit Heath, told BioSpace at the time. The new therapeutic class targets an underlying cause of PAH, improving the balance between pro- and anti-proliferative signaling.\n\nIn 2021, Merck paid $11.5 billion to acquire Acceleron Pharma, with sotatercept, a first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH, as the lead asset. The drug is expected to be a potential blockbuster for Merck, with the PAH market projected to reach a value of $12.2 billion by 2032. As of Merck\u2019s third quarter earnings report, the drug had already posted sales of $219 million since its March launch and is expected to top $1.5 billion in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the pond, BMS scored a late December win when the FDA approved its bestselling cancer drug Opdivo in an injectable version on Monday. The anti-PD-1 therapy is approved in a number of oncological indications including melanomas, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancers and more. It was first approved as a 30-minute intravenous infusion given every two or four weeks.\n\nDubbed Opdivo Qvantig, BMS worked with Halozyme Therapeutics to bring the intravenous infusion to subcutaneous formulation. The new injectable version is expected to enhance patient convenience and may help protect BMS sales erosion as the IV formulation approaches the dreaded patent cliff in 2028. It\u2019s approved for most previously approved adult, solid tumor indications as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Opdivo brought in $6.8 billion in sales as BMS\u2019 top-selling cancer product. This year, BMS is undergoing a \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d that is expected to generate around $1.5 billion in cost savings for the pharma giant.\n\nCorrection (Jan. 7): This story has been updated to correctly state that Opdivo Qvantig is approved for most, not all, previously approved adult, solid tumor indications.",

            "content": "On December 27, the Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo Qvantig, an injectable formulation of the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, which will reduce administration time from about 30 minutes to about five minutes and may allow patients to receive treatment in more settings.\n\n\u201cReceiving a cancer diagnosis can be frightening and stressful,\u201d said Audrey Davis, LPC, of the Cancer Support Community. \u201cHaving a treatment option that may offer patients flexibility to receive treatment outside of traditional hospital settings and reduce the administration time is important. It\u2019s exciting to see these continued advancements with immunotherapy administration that may offer another choice for patients and caregivers navigating this difficult journey.\u201d\n\nOpdivo, from Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a monoclonal antibody that targets an immune checkpoint that regulates immune function. Some cancers can hijack the PD-1 protein on T cells to turn off response to malignant cells. Drugs that block the interaction between PD-1 and its binding partner on tumors, known as PD-L1, can release the brakes and restore T-cell activity.\n\nThe original IV infusion formulation of Opdivo is approved for the treatment of 11 different types of cancer. The new injectable formulation is indicated\u2014alone or in combination regimens\u2014for most of the same malignancies, including melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\nUntil recently, all of the nearly dozen approved checkpoint inhibitors had to be administered via intravenous infusion, a time-consuming procedure that usually takes place at an infusion center. Injectable formulations could potentially be administered at a doctor\u2019s office, making treatment more accessible and convenient. The first injectable checkpoint inhibitor, Roche/Genentech\u2019s Tecentriq Hybreza (injectable atezolizumab), was approved in September. Merck has also reported good results for an experimental injectable version of Keytruda (pembrolizumab).\n\nOpdivo Qvantig and Tecentriq Hybreza both use Halozyme Therapeutics\u2019 Enhanze drug delivery technology, which adds a hyaluronidase enzyme to increase the permeability of tissue under the skin and enables the checkpoint antibodies to be dispersed and absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n\n\nThe approval of Opdivo Qvantig was based on findings from the randomized Phase III CheckMate-67T trial (NCT04810078), which compared the two formulations in people with previously treated advanced kidney cancer. The study showed that the injectable formulation was noninferior to the intravenous infusion, meaning it worked at least as well. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that drug concentrations were comparable, and the overall response rate was statistically similar (24% versus 18%, respectively). The safety profiles of the two formulations were also similar.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis approval of subcutaneous nivolumab gives our patients a new option that can deliver consistent efficacy and comparable safety expected from IV nivolumab and offers a patient-centric treatment experience,\u201d sadi Saby George, MD, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, in a news release. \u201cOpdivo Qvantig offers faster administration, delivered in three to five minutes. It may allow patients, in consultation with their doctors, to choose another treatment method and the flexibility to receive treatment closer to home.\u201d\n\n\n\nClick here to learn more about cancer immunotherapy.",

But an early screening program, involving the University of Colorado Cancer Center, is showing intriguing results.\n\nCU's Center teamed up with a similar center at the University of Kentucky, the Markey Cancer Center.\n\nThe program is known as QUILS (Quality Implementation of Lung Cancer Screening) and it launched in 2015. Kentucky has one of the highest smoking rates and among the highest rates of lung cancer diagnoses and deaths in the U.S. It\u2019s also among the states with the highest poverty rates.\n\nThe program has dramatically shifted Kentucky\u2019s lung cancer screening rate from among the lowest to the second highest in the country, according to QUILS. That\u2019s resulted in a 10 percent decline in late-stage cancer diagnoses.\n\n\u201dWe can reduce costs and improve our public health by doing this more effectively,\u201d said Jamie Studts, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who helped develop the program while working there before moving to his current position. He also prepared a roadmap for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to improve lung cancer screening in Colorado.\n\nThe program helped improve lung cancer screening in Kentucky through a collaborative approach to building a coalition of partners, working with primary care physicians and clinics to promote screenings.\n\nThanks to its efforts, the state\u2019s screening rates are twice the national average, according to the University of Kentucky. The hope now is to replicate its success in other states.\n\nPete Comparoni, University of Kentucky John Herbst gets a CT for a lung cancer screening and awareness.

If a growth or lump is discovered early, it can be cut out. If it\u2019s removed before it spreads, a patient\u2019s chance of surviving five years jumps from 4 percent to 55 percent, according to the program.\n\n\u201cIt's a game changer if we can learn how to do it well, and if we can have this accepted and integrated into our system,\u201d said Studts, who added that the key is developing trusting community relationships.\n\nBuilding trust is critical, Studts said. \u201cWe often stigmatize those individuals who either currently smoke or have a history of smoking and they don't have the greatest relationship with our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBroadly putting programs like this in place in Colorado, and really every state, has enormous potential, he said.\n\nStudts said the goal is to create a social norm around lung cancer screening, \u201cso that lung cancer screening is viewed just like any other cancer screening, that it becomes normal for people to consider doing it if they're eligible.\"\n\n\u201cI refer to it as the greatest missed opportunity to reduce cancer mortality that we currently have available to us,\u201d he said.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb Foundation, a charitable organization, is funding the program.\n\n\"Early detection saves lives. But far too many Americans, especially people in vulnerable communities, face barriers to accessing lung cancer screening,\u201d said Catharine Grimes, President of the BMS Foundation.\n\nThe program is now expanding to a pair of other states that also have a high lung cancer burden: Nevada and Mississippi.

These not only lead to delays in product launches, but also failure in supplying penalties and the incurring of additional costs towards remedial measures, thus impacting revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nPharma companies have taken several measures to combat various US market-related risks. These include optimisation of product portfolio, cost saving measures and increased focus on complex molecules including injectables, inhalations, specialty products and biosimilars.",

            "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters): Drugmakers plan to raise U.S. prices on at least 250 branded medications including Pfizer Covid-19 treatment Paxlovid, Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer cell therapies and vaccines from France's Sanofi at the start of 2025, according to data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nNearly all of the drug price increases are below 10% - most well below. The median price increase of the drugs being hiked Jan. 1 is 4.5%, which is in line with the median for all price increases last year.\n\nThe increases are to list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.\n\nLarger drug price increases were once far more common in the U.S., but in recent years, Drugmakers have scaled them back after price hikes drew sharp criticism in the middle of the last decade.\n\n\"Drugmakers don't have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\" 3 Axis President Antonio Ciaccia said.\n\nA Reuters analysis of prices for new drugs found that pharmaceutical companies launched new U.S. drugs in 2023 at prices 35% higher than in 2022.\n\nThe over 250 drug hikes represent an increase from Dec. 29 last year, when Drugmakers unveiled plans to raise prices on more than 140 brands of drugs.\n\nDrug companies are also reducing some prices on Jan. 1. Merck & Co plans to cut the list price of its heavily discounted diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet \"to align the list price more closely to the net price.\"\n\nU.S. PAYS MOST\n\nThe U.S. pays more for prescription medicines than any other country, and incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to lower drug costs by focusing on middlemen in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nMore drug price increases are likely to be announced by other Drugmakers over the course of January - historically the biggest month for Drugmakers to raise prices.\n\nPfizer raised prices of the most drugs on the latest list - more than 60 drugs. As well as a 3% hike on Paxlovid, the company raised prices on medicines including migraine treatment Nurtec and cancer drugs Adcetris, Ibrance and Xeljanz between 3% and 5%.\n\n\"Pfizer has adjusted the average list prices of our medicines and vaccines for 2025 below the overall rate of inflation - approximately 2.4% - across many products in our diverse product portfolio,\" Pfizer spokesperson Amy Rose said in an email. She said the increases help support investments in drug development and offset costs.\n\nBristol Myers raised the price of its expensive cancer cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi by 6% and 9%, respectively. The personalised blood cancer treatments can already cost close to half a million dollars.\n\nA BMS spokesperson said in an email that the company is \"committed to achieving unfettered patient access\" to its medicines. She said the price of Breyanzi in particular \"is reflective of the potentially transformative, individualized treatment in a one-time infusion.\"\n\nSanofi raised prices on around a dozen of its vaccines between 2.9% and 9%.\n\nThe largest brand price increases according to the 3 Axis analysis were from Leadiant Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Italy's Essetifin. The company raised prices around 15% on its Hodgkin's disease treatment Matulane and about 20% on Cystaran, eye drops to help patients with symptoms from a rare condition called cystinosis.\n\nSpokespeople from Leadiant and Sanofi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \u2013 Reuters",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this biopharmaceutical company have returned -6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Bristol Myers falls in, has lost 7.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nBristol Myers is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -87.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.19 indicates a change of +672.4% from what Bristol Myers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Bristol Myers.",

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Oncology Pharmaceuticals Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for oncology pharmaceuticals was valued at $196.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% to reach $401.4 billion by the end of 2029.\n\nThis report seeks to deliver an in-depth analysis of the worldwide oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer medications) market. It includes a thorough overview of various types of oncology drugs, such as targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and an examination of current and historical market revenues.\n\nSeveral factors make the oncology pharmaceutical industry a prime candidate for growth. The oncology pharmaceuticals market is a dynamic and quickly changing sector within the global pharmaceuticals industry. The main priorities of this market are the development, manufacture, and marketing of medications used to treat cancer. It is anticipated to keep expanding due to continuous scientific and technological breakthroughs. Novel immunotherapies and CAR-T cell therapy are emerging treatments that can completely transform how cancer is treated. However, to ensure that new therapies help a wide range of patients, it will be imperative to address issues about drug affordability and accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry's pipeline and portfolio in oncology is among the most diverse due to its strong emphasis on research. Over time, improved methods of screening, diagnosis, surgery, and radiation therapy, along with rapidly growing options for systemic treatment, have improved the prognosis for many cancers.\n\n\n\nGlobal funding for cancer research has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, and the rate at which new drugs are being developed has not slowed. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapeutics between 2017 and 2022 for various solid tumor malignancies and indications. The arsenal of cancer treatments is growing at a very rapid pace, which has led to a significant increase in treatment and regulatory complexity. Cancer treatment is now far more expensive for patients and healthcare systems due to the high cost of many new medications. These difficulties and expenses go beyond solid adult cancers to the pediatric and hematology/oncology fields.\n\n\n\nTargeted therapy holds a significant market share regarding medication class, and new precision medicine techniques are emerging from an improved molecular understanding of cancer. As the incidence of breast cancer rises worldwide, pharmaceutical companies are focusing more and more on early diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\n\n\nThe oncology pharmaceuticals market is further categorized by indication, including lung cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer. Additionally, the report presents the market revenue for each geographic region, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World (RoW).\n\n\n\nIn order to provide an in-depth understanding of the market, this report also includes profiles of market participants, the competitive landscape, key competitors, and respective market share/ranking. This report includes an oncology pharmaceuticals pipeline analysis, patent analysis, and a detailed discussion of key marketed products. This report outlines the driving and restraining factors of the oncology pharmaceuticals market.\n\n\n\nBy geography, the market in this report is segmented into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nInnovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.",

Scores of pharmas and biotechs downsized and restructured their workforces to stay afloat, including large companies such as Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. Some of those businesses cut thousands of employees.\n\nBioSpace tracked the layoffs below. Keep reading for details on these cuts.\n\nDecember Layoffs: Javara, Ring, Outlook and More\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nNational Resilience\n\nDec. 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nAmplifyBio\n\nDec. 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nAgenus\n\nDec. 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nAlligator Bioscience\n\nDec. 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nIdorsia Pharmaceuticals\n\nDec. 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember Layoffs: Kronos, Novartis, Recursion and More\n\nKronos Bio\n\nNov. 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovartis\n\nNov. 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nRecursion Therapeutics\n\nNov. 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nMedigene\n\nNov. 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nAlector\n\nNov. 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nBMS\n\nNov. 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nSonata Therapeutics\n\nNov. 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nJ&J and Merck\n\nNov. 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nGilead Sciences\n\nNov. 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nAdaptimmune\n\nNov. 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nGilead Sciences and Kite Pharma\n\nNov. 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSensei Biotherapeutics\n\nNov. 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals\n\nNov. 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nOrna Therapeutics\n\nNov. 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not say how many jobs it cut.\n\nIn November 2023, Orna let go less than a quarter of its staff, Endpoints News reported at the time. Regarding this month\u2019s layoffs, spokesperson Peg Rusconi told STAT, \u201cWe believe that realigning our resources toward rapidly advancing our maturing panCAR programs will best position us to deliver our potentially breakthrough therapies to patients in need.\u201d\n\nSTAT noted the biotech, which designs circular RNA therapeutics, will also focus on the vaccine collaboration with Merck announced in 2022.\n\nAimed at treating autoimmune and oncology diseases, Orna\u2019s in vivo CAR platform panCAR combines its oRNA technology with proprietary lipid nanoparticles to make therapies that modify immune cells. The company hopes to bring its panCAR drug candidates to clinical trials by 2026, according to its website.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 12\n\nGenetic testing company 23andMe announced Nov. 11 that it will lay off more than 200 employees\u2014about 40% of its workforce\u2014as part of a sweeping business restructuring effort to streamline its operations and cut costs.

In return, 23andMe expects to generate over $35 million in annualized savings.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nNov. 11\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific will lay off 160 employees across three Massachusetts locations, according to a Nov. 7 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The Wilmington-based tools and services company is letting go staff in Lexington, Plainville and Cambridge between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. Thermo Fisher will close the Lexington facility, the Boston Business Journal reported.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Thermo Fisher employed about 122,000 people globally, including 61,000 in the Americas, according to a February SEC filing. The Boston Business Journal stated the company had about 4,100 employees in Massachusetts as of September.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s 50,000-square-foot, $90 million contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) site in Lexington opened in 2019. At that time, it was expected to add more than 200 jobs, employing scientists, quality control specialists and production teams to support development, testing and manufacture of viral vectors.\n\nAccording to the Boston Business Journal, in a letter to the state explaining the cuts, Thermo Fisher wrote that it continuously evaluates its global operations for opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness in meeting customers\u2019 needs. It added that to further use its state-of the-art Plainville facility and better optimize resources across its manufacturing network, as well as due to \u201cexternal constraints regarding our Cambridge site,\u201d it would adjust staffing in Cambridge and Plainville, cease operations in Lexington and transfer programs from Lexington to Plainville.\n\nThe 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services ranging from process development to commercial manufacturing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nNov. 11\n\nCharles River Laboratories has laid off more than 6% of its employees\u2014over 1,300 people\u2014since 2023, Endpoints News reported following the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company\u2019s Nov. 6 earnings call. The company also shared during the call that it\u2019s begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites to consolidate capacity that\u2019s no longer needed given lower demand for its products and services, according to Endpoints.

The Edmonton, Alberta\u2013based biopharma company, which has a U.S. commercial hub in Rockville, Maryland, did not say which locations the layoffs affect or when they\u2019ll be complete.\n\nThis is the second known workforce reduction this year for Aurinia. In February, the company announced it would cut at least 25% of its employees during the first quarter. That news came after Aurinia failed to find a buyer, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nIn its Nov. 7 announcement, Aurinia stated the restructuring will improve operational efficiency and should save the company more than $40 million in annualized cash-based operating expenses.

The cuts will include some management positions.\n\nCompass had 32 employees at the end of December 2023, 19 of whom were primarily involved in research and development and clinical activities, according to an SEC filing.\n\nThe company, which revealed the delays in its third quarter business update, had expected data from a first Phase III trial, COMP005, this quarter, according to Fierce Biotech. Compass has now shifted that timeline to the second quarter of 2025. The company had also anticipated data from a second Phase III trial, COMP006, around the middle of 2025, Fierce reported. This readout has now been pushed back to the second half of 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpero Therapeutics\n\nOct. 30\n\nAs part of a restructuring following the suspension of its development program for an antibiotic candidate, Spero Therapeutics will lay off about 39% of its workforce, the company announced Oct. 29.

If the Cambridge, Massachusetts, business has the same number of employees now, the cuts could affect about 18 people.\n\nRegarding its antibiotic candidate, Spero shared that an interim analysis of the Phase IIa study of SPR720, a treatment being investigated for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, did not meet the primary endpoint.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nICON\n\nOct. 28\n\nAfter announcing a revenue shortfall, Dublin-based contract research organization (CRO) ICON signaled during an investor call that layoffs are coming, Fierce Biotech reported. In the Oct. 24 call, the company\u2019s CEO, Steve Cutler, shared the business is \u201clooking at where we have an excess of people in certain areas\u201d and \u201ctaking fairly decisive actions.\u201d ICON has locations in 45 countries, including the U.S., where it has offices in 11 states.\n\nICON\u2019s third-quarter revenue of $2.03 million, a 1.2% year-over-year decrease, failed to meet expectations for three reasons, according to the company\u2019s earnings announcement. The CRO cited material headwinds from two large customers undergoing budget cuts and development model changes; lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity; and \u201congoing cautiousness\u201d from biotech customers, resulting in award and study delays.\n\nThe company also noted in its announcement that it expects an \u201coutlook for growth over the medium term\u201d and that its year-to-date revenue is $6.24 million, a year-over-year increase of 3.1%, or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals\n\nOct. 25\n\nFollowing a disappointing Phase III trial of ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Marinus Pharmaceuticals is laying off employees as part of cost-cutting measures, the company announced Oct. 24. The commercial-stage pharma is also discontinuing further clinical development of the drug and exploring strategic alternatives with the goal of \u201cmaximizing value for stockholders,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nRadnor, Pennsylvania\u2013based Marinus did not specify how many people it\u2019s letting go or when the layoffs are effective. The company had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. However, that number is likely lower now, as Marinus announced in May that it would reduce its workforce by about 20% as part of cost-cutting measures at that time.\n\nIn its Oct. 24 announcement, Marinus noted that the Phase III TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. It added that while reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 23\n\nAt Pfizer, another group of employees is paying the price for the company\u2019s recent Phase III Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failure.\n\nThe layoffs, which will affect 75 workers at Pfizer\u2019s Sanford, North Carolina, site, come four months after the company\u2019s investigational DMD therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase III trial. Pfizer said the cuts are related to that trial failure, according to Fierce Pharma.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs follows the elimination of 150 positions in Sanford immediately after the Phase III DMD readout. This is also the second round of layoffs in as many weeks at Pfizer after the company handed out 80 layoff notices at its McPherson, Kansas, facility on Oct. 16 and Oct. 17.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 22\n\nPfizer handed out 80 layoff notices last Wednesday and Thursday at its McPherson, Kansas, facility, where around 1,800 people are employed, multiple local outlets reported. According to ABC affiliate KAKE News, the cuts affect positions in management and engineering but not in production.\n\n\u201cFollowing the announcement of our margin assessment program in May 2024, we\u2019ve conducted a series of these evaluations focused on operational efficiencies and network optimization,\u201d Pfizer said in a statement sent to the publication. \u201cBased on these evaluations, we have aligned headcount with our site capacity designs to meet the needs of the business.\u201d\n\nThere will be a meeting this week for those affected, Tucky Allen, Kansas WorkforceONE, told KSN News, noting that Pfizer reached out to his organization before announcing the layoffs, so his team could meet with laid-off employees and help them find new jobs, which could include placements within Pfizer. Allen told KSN that more and more manufacturing companies are making such cuts. \u201cThis time of year seasonally is obviously a time when employers will do their internal audits and see what their staffing looks like,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThis is Pfizer\u2019s second round of layoffs this month. At the beginning of October, The Irish Times reported that the company will eliminate up to 210 manufacturing jobs across sites in Grange Castle, Newbridge and Ringaskiddy, Ireland. Pfizer has not formally announced either round of cuts.\n\nTakeda\n\nOct. 21\n\nTakeda will lay off 45 employees at its Cambridge location and another 34 at its Lexington site between late September 2024 and March 2025, according to an Oct. 15 WARN notice.

The cuts will include roughly 55% of the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech\u2019s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team. The company expects to mostly complete the layoffs by the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to Sage, the reorganization is meant to support the ongoing launch of Zurzuvae in postpartum depression and focus pipeline development efforts for drug candidate dalzanemdor in Huntington\u2019s disease ahead of a clinical study expected later this year.

While the WARN notice lists the layoffs as closures, the two sites will in fact remain open, a company spokesperson told Fierce Pharma. The Sanford site is involved in gene therapy programs, while the Rocky Mount facility makes sterile injectables, Fierce reports.\n\nAfter a downturn in sales of its COVID products, Pfizer announced a $3.5 billion cost-cutting initiative last October, and has since implemented several rounds of layoffs. In May of this year, the company disclosed plans to cut a further $1.5 billion in costs over the next several years.\n\nCue Biopharma\n\nJuly 29\n\nBoston-based Cue Biopharma announced on Thursday a shift in priorities that will entail laying off a quarter of its staff. The company will focus resources on its autoimmune program while seeking partners to continue development of its oncology candidates, Cue CEO Daniel Passeri said in the announcement. The realignment will extend Cue\u2019s cash runway into mid-2025, the company said.\n\nAs of the day before the announcement, Cue had about 50 employees, Passeri told Endpoints News.\n\nAnokion\n\nJuly 26\n\nAnokion, a Switzerland- and Massachusetts-based company focused on autoimmune disease, will lay off an undisclosed number of staff, a spokesperson told Fierce Biotech.

            "content": "The healthcare sector has long been a sanctuary for income investors seeking stability and growth. Within this realm, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 1.04%) and Merck & Co. (MRK 1.38%) stand out for their combination of above-average dividend yields and proven business models. These industry titans have consistently rewarded shareholders through market cycles while maintaining robust drug-development pipelines.\n\nRecent market volatility has created an attractive entry point for both stocks heading into 2025. Their dividend yields now sit well above the S&P 500 average, while their valuations scan as compelling relative to historical norms. As a result, these pharmaceutical leaders warrant serious consideration for investors seeking defensive positioning and reliable income streams.\n\nLet's examine the key factors that make these two high-yield dividend stocks screen as top buys early in the new year.\n\nA healthy prescription for income\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb has built its success on groundbreaking cancer treatments and strategic acquisitions. The company's oncology portfolio includes breakthrough immunotherapy drugs that have transformed patient care. This strong market position generates substantial cash flows that support shareholder returns.\n\nTurning to the specifics, the pharmaceutical giant offers investors a 4.3% dividend yield backed by a reasonable 59.8% payout ratio. Management has demonstrated its commitment to shareholders through consistent dividend growth, averaging 7.91% annually over the past five years. The recent acquisitions of Mirati, RayzeBio, and Karuna have strengthened its pipeline significantly this year, creating a bridge to the company's future.\n\nThat said, a significant challenge looms on the horizon. The company faces major patent expirations by 2028, including its blockbuster drugs Opdivo and Eliquis. Moreover, the substantial debt from its $74 billion Celgene acquisition in 2019 adds some unwelcome financial pressure during this transition period. The drugmaker's stock performance reflects these concerns, having lost 11.4% of its value over the past five years.\n\nBMY Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nTrading at 8.12 times forward earnings, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock offers considerable value given its strong oncology franchise, acquisition strategy, and generous shareholder rewards. While the 2028 patent cliff poses a significant challenge, the company's stellar dividend growth and focus on rebuilding its pipeline through strategic deals make it attractive for income investors seeking a combination of yield and value.\n\nMarket pressures weigh on returns\n\nMerck has established itself as a leader in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology. The company's flagship cancer drug Keytruda has revolutionized treatment protocols and drives significant revenue growth. This dominant market position generates substantial cash flows to fund shareholder returns.\n\nOn the dividend front, the pharmaceutical giant delivers a 3.25% yield supported by a healthy 64.4% payout ratio. The company's track record shows consistent dividend increases, with 7.68% annual growth over the past five years. A strategic focus on high-margin specialty drugs and unmet medical needs has strengthened its competitive position.\n\nYet investors must weigh several risks. The looming patent expiration for Keytruda in 2028 threatens a key revenue stream. The company's pipeline beyond immuno-oncology requires bolstering to counter this future patent cliff. Competition in cancer treatment continues to intensify, potentially challenging Merck's market leadership.\n\nAt 10.2 times forward earnings, Merck stock trades at a valuation that reflects both its current oncology leadership and future patent risks. However, with specialty drugs driving strong cash flows and an elite dividend program in place, Merck stands out as an appealing option for income investors.\n\nTwo high-yield stocks worth buying\n\nFor income investors, these pharmaceutical giants offer two distinct paths forward. Bristol-Myers Squibb provides a higher 4.3% yield and an acquisition-driven strategy to counter its 2028 patent cliff. Merck offers a lower but still attractive 3.25% yield, with its specialty drug focus supporting consistent payout growth. Both stocks trade at compelling valuations under 11 times forward earnings, making early 2025 an attractive entry point for investors seeking healthcare exposure and growing dividend income.",

The median price increase of the drugs being hiked Jan. 1 is 4.5%, which is in line with the median for all price increases last year.\n\nThe increases are to list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.\n\nLarger drug price increases were once far more common in the U.S. but in recent years drugmakers have scaled them back after price hikes drew sharp criticism in the middle of the last decade.\n\n\"Drugmakers don't have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\" 3 Axis President Antonio Ciaccia said.\n\nA Reuters analysis of prices for new drugs found that pharmaceutical companies launched new U.S. drugs in 2023 at prices 35% higher than in 2022.\n\nThe over 250 drug hikes represent an increase from Dec. 29 last year when drugmakers unveiled plans to raise prices on more than 140 brands of drugs.\n\nDrug companies are also reducing some prices on Jan. 1. Merck & Co plans to cut the list price of its heavily discounted diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet \"to align the list price more closely to the net price.\"\n\nU.S. PAYS MOST\n\nThe U.S. pays more for prescription medicines than any other country, and incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to lower drug costs by focusing on middlemen in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nMore drug price increases are likely to be announced by other drugmakers over the course of January - historically the biggest month for drugmakers to raise prices.\n\nPfizer raised prices of the most drugs on the latest list - more than 60 drugs. As well as a 3% hike on Paxlovid, the company raised prices on medicines including migraine treatment Nurtec and cancer drugs Adcetris, Ibrance and Xeljanz between 3% and 5%.\n\n\"Pfizer has adjusted the average list prices of our medicines and vaccines for 2025 below the overall rate of inflation \u2013 approximately 2.4% \u2013 across many products in our diverse product portfolio,\" Pfizer spokesperson Amy Rose said in an email. She said the increases help support investments in drug development and offset costs.",

(NASDAQ: HALO) (Halozyme) today announced that Bristol Myers Squibb received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Opdivo Qvantig\u2122 (nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy) co-formulated with Halozyme's ENHANZE\u00ae drug delivery technology for subcutaneous use in most previously approved adult, solid tumor intravenous (IV) Opdivo\u00ae indications as monotherapy, monotherapy maintenance following completion of Opdivo plus Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) combination therapy, or in combination with chemotherapy or cabozantinib. Opdivo Qvantig is the first and only subcutaneously administered PD-1 inhibitor.\n\nThe subcutaneous administration of Opdivo Qvantig is faster, with a three- to five-minute administration time compared to 30 minutes for IV Opdivo.* Subcutaneous administration may offer flexibility to receive treatment where it is best for patients and their providers, may reduce steps required for preparation and time needed for administration.\n\n\"We are pleased Opdivo Qvantig, which is co-formulated with our ENHANZE drug delivery technology, is now FDA-approved as the first and only subcutaneously administered PD-1 inhibitor in the U.S.,\" said Dr. Helen Torley, president and chief executive officer of Halozyme. \"This approval represents our ninth co-formulated product and is yet another example of how Halozyme's innovative ENHANZE technology is enabling greater flexibility and optionality for patients.\"\n\nThe FDA approval is based on the results from the Phase 3 randomized, open-label CheckMate-67T trial, which was a noninferiority trial evaluating Opdivo Qvantig co-formulated with Halozyme's proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), compared to intravenous Opdivo, in adult patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma who received prior systemic therapy. In the trial, noninferiority was demonstrated for the co-primary endpoints of time-averaged concentration over 28 days (Cavgd28) and minimum concentration at steady state (Cminss) of Opdivo Qvantig vs. IV Opdivo. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) for Cavgd28 was 2.10 (90% CI: 2.00-2.20) and the GMR for Cminss was 1.77 (90% CI: 1.63-1.93). As a key powered secondary endpoint, the overall response rate (ORR) in the Opdivo Qvantig arm (n=248) was 24% (95% CI: 19-30) compared with 18% (95% CI: 14-24) in the IV Opdivo arm (n=247) showing that Opdivo Qvantig has similar efficacy compared to IV Opdivo as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR).\n\nSelect Safety Profile from CheckMate-67T\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving Opdivo Qvantig. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in >1% of patients who received Opdivo Qvantig were pleural effusion (1.6%), pneumonitis (1.6%), hyperglycemia (1.2%), hyperkalemia (1.2%), hemorrhage (1.2%) and diarrhea (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u226510% of patients) were fatigue (20%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), pruritus (16%), rash (15%), arthralgia (12%) and cough (11%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3 (1.2%) patients who received Opdivo Qvantig; these included myocarditis, myositis, and colitis complications. Study therapy was discontinued in 10% of patients due to adverse reactions. The safety profile of Opdivo Qvantig was comparable with the safety profile of IV Opdivo.\n\n*Refers to the injection time and does not include other aspects of treatment; actual clinic time may vary.\n\nAbout Halozyme\n\nHalozyme is a biopharmaceutical company advancing disruptive solutions to improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies.

            "content": "Bristol Myers Squibb has won FDA approval for an injectable version of its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Opdivo, a regulatory decision that gives patients a more convenient dosing option and provides the pharmaceutical giant a new way to fend off coming competition.\n\nThe pivotal test for injectable Opdivo evaluated the drug in renal cell carcinoma, but the approval announced late Friday spans all of the approved solid tumor indications covered by approvals for intravenously infused Opdivo as a monotherapy. BMS will market the new injectable drug as Opdivo Qvantig.\n\nOpdivo belongs to the class of therapies called checkpoint inhibitors. The drug itself is an antibody designed to block PD-1, a checkpoint protein on immune cells that stops them from recognizing cancer cells. First approved in 2014 as a treatment for melanoma, the drug has gone on to win numerous approvals in additional cancers. In the first nine months of 2024, Opdivo, in all of its approved indications, accounted for $6.8 billion in sales. The immunotherapy is BMS\u2019s top-selling cancer product.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nAntibody drugs are typically administered as intravenous infusions; dosing of Opdivo takes about 30 minutes. BMS said an injection of Opdivo Qvantig takes three to five minutes. In a Phase 3 test that compared monthly injections of Opdivo Qvantig to every-two-week infusions of Opdivo as a treatment for advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, results showed the injectable version met the main goal of achieving comparable exposure throughout the body and similar efficacy. Results also showed the new injectable version\u2019s safety profile was comparable to that of Opdivo.\n\nBeyond Opdivo Qvantig\u2019s approval in most of the solid tumor indications for Opdivo, the new injectable product is approved as a monotherapy maintenance treatment after a patient has completed treatment with Opdivo plus Yervoy, a different BMS immunotherapy. The injectable version of Opdivo may also be used in combination with chemotherapy or the cancer drug cabozantinib. Opdivo Qvantig is not approved for use in combination with intravenously infused Yervoy.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade, Opdivo has evolved as an immunotherapy option used in many indications across tumor types,\u201d Adam Lenkowski, BMS\u2019s executive vice president and chief commercialization officer, said in a prepared statement. \u201cWith this new option, we look forward to further helping cancer patients with an administration method that gives them faster delivery.\u201d\n\n[Paragraph updated with analyst comments.] The faster delivery of Opdivo Qvantig is made possible by Enhanze, a drug delivery technology developed by biotech company Halozyme. Enhanze consists of an engineered enzyme that enables biologic drugs to be administered as subcutaneous injections. The key patent for Opdivo will expire in 2028, opening the door to competition from biosimilar versions of the IV infused drug. Opdivo Qvantig could help BMS retain some of its immunotherapy market share with a patent-protected alternative dosing option. But that could be a tall order. In a Jan. 6 note sent to investors, William Blair analysts said that despite the market presence of subcutaneously injectable formulations, oncology biosimilars have gained significant market share. Based on the market uptake of biosimilars for the Roche cancer drugs Rituxan, Herceptin, and Avastin, William Blair expects \u201cgreater and faster biosimilar adoption for oncology biosimilars (as compared to immunology therapies).\u201d\n\nOther pharma giants are also pursuing subcutaneous dosing for their respective checkpoint inhibitors. In September, Roche won FDA approval for Tecentriq Hybreza, the injectable version of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq. Like Opdivo Qvantig, the Roche immunotherapy is made with Halozyme\u2019s technology. Meanwhile, Merck last month posted positive Phase 3 data for an injectable version of its blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Injectable Keytruda employs enzyme technology from Alteogen.\n\nPhoto: Jeremy Moeller, Getty Images",

(NYSE:BMY) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm\u2019s focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY)\n\n10-Year Revenue CAGR: 11.44%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines for serious diseases, particularly in oncology, cardiovascular conditions, and immunology. It has demonstrated consistent growth, driven by a strong pipeline of new drugs and a robust financial position.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth portfolio revenues increased 20% in Q3 2024 and now account for nearly half of total revenues. The recent FDA approval of Opdivo-based treatment for non-small cell lung cancer and promising clinical data for its nivolumab plus relatlimab combination in lung cancer improved financial results for the third quarter. It\u2019s also advancing its bispecific ADC (Antibody-Drug Conjugates) and radiopharmaceutical pipeline specifically focused on oncology.\n\nDuring Q3 2024, the company generated ~$12 billion in revenue, marking an 8.5% increase compared to the same period in the previous year, driven by sales within the oncology portfolio. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY) is a leading pharmaceutical company with a strong track record of innovation and a promising pipeline of new medicines.\n\nOverall BMY ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of BMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Opdivo Qvantig is not indicated in combination with intravenous ipilimumab.\n\nEfficacy and Safety\n\nThe subcutaneous injection of nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy was evaluated in CHECKMATE-67T (NCT04810078), a multicenter, randomised, open-label trial in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma who received no more than 2 prior systemic treatment regimens. A total of 495 patients were randomised to receive either subcutaneous nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy or intravenous nivolumab.\n\nThe primary objective was to assess the nivolumab exposure of subcutaneous administration of OPDIVO QVANTIG compared to intravenous nivolumab. The key secondary objective was to evaluate overall response rate (ORR), assessed by blinded independent central review. The trial met the predefined acceptance margin for pharmacokinetic endpoints, with the lower boundary of 90 per cent confidence interval of geometric mean ratios of not less than 0.8 for both serum nivolumab Cavg over 28 days and Cmin at steady state. ORR was 24 per cent (95 per cent CI: 19,30) in the subcutaneous nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy arm and 18 per cent (95 per cent CI: 14, 24) in the intravenous nivolumab arm.\n\nIn general, CHECKMATE-67T showed a similar safety profile between OPDIVO QVANTIG and intravenous nivolumab. The most common adverse reactions (\u226510 per cent) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, rash, and cough.\n\nRecommended Dosage\n\nThe recommended dosage depends on the specific indication and is either 600 mg nivolumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase every 2 weeks; 900 mg nivolumab and 15,000 units of hyaluronidase every 3 weeks; or 1,200 mg nivolumab and 20,000 units hyaluronidase every 4 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or as indicated in the prescribing information.",

Subcutaneous administration may offer flexibility to receive treatment where it is best for patients and their providers, may reduce steps required for preparation and time needed for administration.\n\nThe FDA approval is based on the results from the Phase 3 randomized, open-label CheckMate-67T trial, which was a noninferiority trial evaluating Opdivo Qvantig co-formulated with Halozyme\u2019s recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), compared to intravenous Opdivo, in adult patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma who received prior systemic therapy.\n\nIn the trial, noninferiority was demonstrated for the co-primary endpoints of time-averaged concentration over 28 days and minimum concentration at steady state of Opdivo Qvantig vs. IV Opdivo.",

(Credit: MasterTux from Pixabay)\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMS) has received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Opdivo Qvantig (nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy) in most previous Opdivo indications.\n\nOpdivo (nivolumab) is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that helps the body\u2019s own immune system fight against cancer and restore immune response.\n\nOpdivo Qvantig is a combination of Opdivo, co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), administered as a subcutaneous injection.\n\nThe US FDA approved Opdivo Qvantig as monotherapy in most previously approved indications of Opdivo to treat solid tumours in adults.\n\nAlso, the drug is indicated as monotherapy maintenance after Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) combination therapy, or in combination with chemotherapy or cabozantinib.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb executive vice president and chief commercialisation officer Adam Lenkowsky said: \u201cAt Bristol Myers Squibb, we are committed to helping patients in all aspects of their healthcare journey.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade, Opdivo has evolved as an immunotherapy option used in many indications across tumour types. With this new option, we look forward to further helping cancer patients with an administration method that gives them faster delivery.\u201d\n\nThe FDA approval is based on the results from CheckMate-67T, a Phase 3, randomised, open-label, noninferiority trial evaluating Opdivo Qvantig compared to Opdivo.\n\nThe Phase 3 study evaluated the drug in 495 adult patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who received prior systemic therapy.\n\nIn the study, Opdivo Qvantig showed similar efficacy in overall response rate (ORR) and a comparable safety profile compared to intravenous (IV) Opdivo.\n\nAccording to the company, subcutaneous administration may reduce the steps required for preparation and time needed for administration.\n\nWith the FDA approval, Opdivo Qvantig becomes the first and only subcutaneously administered PD-1 inhibitor, offering a faster delivery option than Opdivo.\n\nRoswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centre network clinical trials director and medical oncologist Saby George said: \u201cThis approval of subcutaneous nivolumab gives our patients a new option that can deliver consistent efficacy and comparable safety expected from IV nivolumab and offers a patient-centric treatment experience.\n\n\u201cOpdivo Qvantig offers faster administration, delivered in three to five minutes. It may allow patients, in consultation with their doctors, to choose another treatment method and the flexibility to receive treatment closer to home.\u201d",
