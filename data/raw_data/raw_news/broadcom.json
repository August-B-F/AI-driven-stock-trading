This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

            "content": "Intel Corp. INTC is reportedly strategizing to rejuvenate its chip design and broaden its foundry business, with the potential of securing significant clients such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\n\nWhat Happened: UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri believes Intel\u2019s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, will prioritize the company\u2019s design and foundry capabilities in the immediate plan. Arcuri further stated that Intel is on the verge of securing commitments from Nvidia or Broadcom to utilize its foundry services, while also progressing its 18A manufacturing process, reported Seeking Alpha.\n\nArcuri stated that Nvidia seems more likely than Broadcom to adopt Intel\u2019s foundry technology, possibly for gaming applications, though power consumption remains a significant concern.\n\nIntel is also said to be planning to compete more aggressively with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM enhancing its packaging innovations. The company\u2019s partnership with United Microelectronics Corp. UMC is progressing well, with production expected to start in late 2026. This could establish them as a secondary high-voltage FinFET supplier after TSMC and potentially lead to future collaborations with Apple AAPL.\n\nArcuri stated that further details on Intel\u2019s foundry developments will be revealed at the upcoming Direct Connect event on April 29.\n\nSEE ALSO: Gordon Johnson Defends Tesla Short Thesis As Margins Shrink, Discounts Rise: Jim Chanos Notes 35% YTD Drop In San Diego County Sales\n\nWhy It Matters: The strategic shift comes in the wake of a leadership change at Intel. The company\u2019s stock rallied following the announcement of its new CEO, with shares increasing by approximately 25%. In his first statement after being chosen as the new CEO, Tan pointed towards an overhaul plan including cost-cutting measures, a restructuring of management and a renewed focus on AI chip production.\n\nHe has openly criticized former CEO Pat Gelsinger's approach, especially in manufacturing and decision-making. One of Tan's main priorities is overhauling Intel Foundry, which supplies chips to companies like Microsoft and Amazon. He is also expected to revive AI initiatives beyond servers, focusing on software, robotics, and AI foundation models.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Intel CEO is all set to deliver an opening keynote at Intel Vision 2025 on March 31 in Las Vegas wherein he is scheduled to address how the company aims to empower innovative solutions and accelerate business success in the AI era.\n\nIntel stock climbed 5.35% over the past month. It closed 0.16% lower on Monday at $24.22.\n\nIntel holds a momentum rating of 27.89% and a growth rating of 3.76%, according to Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings.

Maybe other people are involved, but I don\u2019t know. There might be a party. I wasn\u2019t invited.\u201d\n\nThe rumors, sparked by a Reuters report in early March, suggested that Nvidia, along with AMD, Broadcom, and TSMC, was considering a joint venture to acquire Intel\u2019s foundry division. While Broadcom reportedly expressed interest in Intel\u2019s chip design business, Huang\u2019s comments indicate Nvidia has no involvement\u2014at least for now.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel\u2019s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to its integrated manufacturing model, signaling that Intel will remain focused on its foundry and product leadership, despite market speculation.\n\nXiaomi Outpaces Ford and GM in EV Sales\n\nIn a stunning display of market disruption, Xiaomi, which only launched its first EV in March 2024, has already surpassed Ford and General Motors in annual sales. The Chinese tech giant sold 136,854 EVs last year, compared to Ford\u2019s 97,000 and GM\u2019s 114,400.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s SU7 Series, currently exclusive to China, has become a major contender in the world\u2019s largest EV market, leaving U.S. automakers struggling. With China\u2019s EV market now bigger than Europe and the U.S. combined, American carmakers face mounting pressure.\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy even suggested that the \u201cBig Three\u201d automakers may need to consider exiting China altogether, given their dwindling market share.\n\nFollowing the news, Xiaomi\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares climbed 2.2% last week, while Ford and GM stocks posted modest gains of 2.8% and 3.0%, respectively.\n\nTesla Records Its Worst Month in Over a Decade\n\nMarch 2025 is shaping up to be Tesla\u2019s worst month in 15 years, with its stock price down 50% from its peak. The EV giant is grappling with:\n\nSlumping sales : European deliveries fell 50% in January , while global demand continues to weaken.\n\n: European deliveries fell , while continues to weaken.

Autonomous driving setbacks: Investigations into Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and concerns over misleading marketing have cast doubt on its future.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock dropped 7% on March 18, extending its nine-week losing streak, before rebounding by 5.3% on Friday. The stock continued its recovery during pre-market trading on Monday, rising another 3.8%.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Market Volatility and Industry Shifts\n\nAs Nvidia distances itself from Intel acquisition rumors, Xiaomi continues to dominate China\u2019s EV market, and Tesla battles its worst performance in over a decade, the tech and auto industries face increasing volatility.\n\nInvestors will be watching closely as geopolitical tensions, competition, and innovation reshape the semiconductor and EV landscapes.",

            "content": "For the current quarter, numbers have been taken from $1.48 to $1.56, a move of 5%\n\nOngoing investment in next-gen AI accelerators and networking technology is expected to help Broadcom sustain momentum and analysts are lifting their expectations.\n\nWhile AI remains the primary growth engine, non-AI semiconductor segments showed mixed results\u2014broadband saw a recovery, but wireless continued to face seasonal declines.\n\nLooking ahead, Broadcom guided Q2 revenue to $14.9B, once again above consensus, with AI revenue projected to climb to $4.4B. The company emphasized its leadership in AI semiconductor solutions, particularly in optimizing large language models and AI data center connectivity. Management also highlighted expanding partnerships in hyperscale AI.\n\nBroadcom reported earnings in early March, posing a 6% EPS beat. AI-driven growth was the standout, with AI revenue surging 77% YoY to $4.1B, while infrastructure software grew 47% to $6.7B. Gross margins expanded to 68%, and adjusted EBITDA reached $10.1B.\n\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of \u201cB\u201d in Growth and Momentum. However, AVGO has an \u201cF\u201d score in Value with a Forward PE at 29.\n\nThe company employs 37,000 people and has a market cap of $900 billion. It was founded in 1961 and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.\n\nBroadcom has established itself as a leader in high-performance semiconductor solutions while expanding its footprint in infrastructure software, cybersecurity, and networking.\n\nWith a history of strategic acquisitions and a focus on high-margin businesses, Broadcom remains a compelling opportunity for investors looking for long-term growth.\n\nDespite strong earnings momentum in recent quarters, the stock has been trading sideways. However, rising earnings estimates and solid technical support suggest underlying strength.\n\nBroadcom is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a powerhouse in the semiconductor and infrastructure software industries. As AI adoption accelerates and demand for high-speed connectivity surges, Broadcom stands to benefit from increased enterprise spending and data center expansion.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 25, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Broadcom AVGO, as the Bull of the Day and Crown Castle CCI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on \u2014 Pfizer Inc.\u2019s PFE.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the current year, estimates have jumped from $6.31 to $6.56 or 4%.\n\nThe trend continues next year, with analysts going from $7.45 to $7.74, or 4%.\n\nWith those estimates came higher price targets and upgrades. A recent upgrade from Morgan Stanley maintained their Overweight, along with a price target hike to $260, up from $246.\n\nBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart| Broadcom Inc. Quote\n\nThe Technical Take\n\nAVGO has been one of the best performers since 2023, but has stalled after hitting fresh highs late last year. The stock is now consolidating after a 23% pullback from those all-time highs.\n\nThe 200-day moving average has offered support during the market sell off. Let us take a look at that level along with some other price points to focus on:\n\n21-day: $194\n\n50-day: $213\n\n200-day: $183\n\nFibonacci resistance: $215\n\nWhile the stock is finding buyers at that 200-day MA, the goal for the bulls would be to break that $210-215 level. Above that area the resistance is cleared and investors could target the 161.8% Fibonacci extension at $274.\n\nIn Summary\n\nBroadcom continues to stand out as a dominant force in AI and semiconductor solutions, backed by strong earnings momentum and rising analyst expectations.\n\nWhile the stock has been consolidating, solid technical support and improving estimates suggest the potential for a breakout.\n\nWith expanding AI partnerships, a focus on high-margin businesses, and ongoing investment in next-gen technology, Broadcom remains a compelling long-term opportunity. If shares can reclaim key resistance levels, AVGO could be poised for another leg higher in the AI-driven market rally.\n\n\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCrown Castle is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in infrastructure related to telecommunications. Specifically, it owns, operates, and leases cell towers and small cell networks used for wireless communication.\n\nDespite missing earnings expectations in their most recent reports, Crown Castle has experienced a strong rally in 2025, reflecting an overinflated sense of optimism in the stock. Investors could be overlooking the company's challenges, including slowing growth in tower leasing and rising competition in the telecom infrastructure space. With that, analysts are lowering estimates, signaling caution ahead for this stock.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nCrown Castle became a REIT in 2013 and is currently valued at $46B. The company provides infrastructure for wireless carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, allowing them to offer mobile and broadband services.\n\nThe stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \u201cC\u201d in Growth, but \u201cF\u201d in both Momentum and Value.\n\nQ4 Earnings\n\nCrown Castle\u2019s fourth-quarter results came in slightly below expectations, with AFFO of $1.80 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.82, and revenues of $1.60 billion, missing the $1.63 billion forecast.\n\nThe company announced a major strategic shift, including the sale of its Fiber unit to EQT and Zayo for $8.5 billion. This move marks Crown Castle\u2019s transition to a pure-play U.S. tower company, positioning it to focus more heavily on its core business of wireless infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, Crown Castle projects a solid 4.5% organic growth in its tower business for 2025. However, the anticipated challenges from Sprint cancellations and the loss of fiber-related revenue may weigh on the company\u2019s overall performance.\n\nEarnings Estimates Falling\n\nSince the company reported earnings and the fiber segment sale, analysts have been lowering estimates across the board.\n\nFor the current quarter, numbers have dropped 40% over the last two months, from $1.72 to $1.02.\n\nLooking at the current year, estimates have declined 40% in that same period, down from $1.67 to $0.99.\n\nFor the next year, numbers have fallen 30% over the last two months, now at $4.98, down from $7.19.\n\nTechnical Take\n\nThe stock hit seven-year lows earlier this year, but is now trading higher by 16% in 2025. The chart is looking much better, with price above the 200-day moving average.\n\nThe $105 level is providing some resistance and the stock will likely see even more issues at the $110 level. This $105-100 zone was the trading range before the stock fell below $100.\n\nIn Summary\n\nCrown Castle is facing significant challenges despite its recent stock rally. The company's shift to a pure-play U.S. tower business, while strategically focused, comes with risks, including slower growth in tower leasing and the loss of fiber-related revenue.\n\nAnalysts have been lowering earnings estimates, and the stock's technical outlook shows potential for further downside if it fails to hold key support levels. With declining earnings projections and rising competition in the telecom infrastructure space, investors should approach Crown Castle with caution, as the stock may struggle to maintain its momentum in the near term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nPfizer Is Dirt-Cheap & High-Yield, But Is It a Buy?\n\nOf late, pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer Inc.\u2019s stock has struggled, but it remains a bargain with generous dividends. Its financials aren\u2019t in bad shape either. So, is it the right time to bet on the Pfizer stock? Let\u2019s explore \u2013\n\nPfizer Is Now a High-Yield Bargain Stock\n\nPfizer is currently a high-yield quality stock trading at reasonable valuations, indicating a margin of safety that surely curtails investment risks. With the stock market subject to bouts of volatility due to President Trump\u2019s tariffs, Pfizer\u2019s dividend income should be particularly attractive to investors.\n\nPfizer\u2019s dividend yield looks tempting at 6.5%, while the company hiked dividends 5 times over the past five years. Its payout ratio presently sits at 54% of earnings. Check Pfizer\u2019s dividend history here.\n\nPresently, Pfizer looks like a discounted stock as well. This is because, according to the price/earnings ratio, Pfizer stock trades at 8.8X forward earnings. In comparison, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticalsindustry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 17.17.\n\nMore Reasons to be Bullish on Pfizer\n\nOther than trading at a low earnings multiple and providing consistent dividends, Pfizer is actively seeking acquisitions to enhance growth and its pipeline. Pfizer's growth is boosted by Nurtec ODT, acquired from Biohaven and Padcev from the Seagen acquisition.\n\nBy 2030, Pfizer aims to add $25 billion to its top line. Pfizer has already boosted its revenues by almost $20 billion, with the acquisition of oncology company Seagen, a significant contributor. The addition of Seagen helped the company generate $3.4 billion in sales last year, marking a 38% increase on a pro forma basis.\n\nPfizer expects substantial growth in the oncology segment in the next five years. It aims to introduce three more blockbuster drugs for cancer treatment, each estimated to generate more than $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nPfizer, by the way, intends to achieve $1.5 billion in net cost savings by 2027 through its Manufacturing Optimization Program and currently has a strong debt profile. Pfizer\u2019s $20.5 billion in cash is sufficient enough to meet its short-term debt obligations of $6.9 billion.\n\nShould I Buy Pfizer Stock Now?\n\nOne should undoubtedly hold onto the Pfizer stock, banking on meaningful acquisitions and sturdy financial conditions. Of course, being cheap at the current trading levels and cushioning dividends against market declines should also entice new investors.\n\nHowever, Pfizer does have challenges ahead. Sales of the company\u2019s Covid-19 products are much less than they were amid the pandemic. Sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid were about $11 billion in 2024, down from $56.7 billion in 2022.

            "content": "Broadcom AVGO shares have dropped 17.3% year to date (YTD). The company has been suffering from the ongoing sell-off in technology stocks amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Technology companies, including Broadcom, import key parts to international markets, which makes them vulnerable to a trade war.\n\n\n\nHowever, we believe the dip offers a massive opportunity for investors to buy the stock. Growth-oriented investors should ignore the near-term hiccups due to an innovative portfolio and rich partner base, solid VMware business and strong balance sheet as well as free cash flow generating ability. Let\u2019s dig deep to find out more.\n\nAVGO Stock\u2019s Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Portfolio to Boost Broadcom\u2019s Prospects\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META are notable users of Broadcom\u2019s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.\n\n\n\nBroadcom strengthened its AI portfolio with the launch of the industry\u2019s first Face-to-Face (F2F) 3.5D XPUs. 3.5D integration combines 3D silicon stacking with 2.5D packaging. Broadcom\u2019s F2F offers better interconnect density (seven times increase in signal density) and power efficiency (10 times reduction in power consumption in die-to-die interfaces) compared with the Face-to-Back approach.\n\n\n\nAVGO\u2019s innovative portfolio is a key catalyst. The company\u2019s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of its kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment at hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry\u2019s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.\n\n\n\nAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO\u2019s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).\n\n\n\nBroadcom\u2019s rich partner base, including NVIDIA NVDA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.\n\nVMware Buyout Drives AVGO\u2019s Infrastructure Software Growth\n\nVMWare is driving Infrastructure Software (ISG) revenues, which jumped 47% year over year to $6.7 billion and accounted for 45% of first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues. Ongoing conversion from perpetual license for vSphere to subscription (60% completed at the end of fiscal first quarter) based clientele is driving growth.\n\n\n\nBroadcom\u2019s strategy to offer a full stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized, is expanding clientele, with 70% of the largest 10,000 customers adopting VCF at the end of the fiscal first quarter. In collaboration with NVIDIA, Broadcom has 39 enterprises for the VMware Private AI Foundation driven by AVGO\u2019s open ecosystem, superior low balancing, and automation capabilities that allow customers to pull and run workloads across both GPU and CPU infrastructure.\n\n\n\nAVGO expects ISG revenues to increase 23% year over year to $6.5 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nStrong Balance Sheet & Free Cash Flow Aids AVGO\u2019s Prospects\n\nBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nThe strong balance sheet is helping AVGO to pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom paid $2.8 billion in cash dividends.\n\nAVGO\u2019s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.56 per share, up 4% over the past 30 days, indicating 34.7% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nThe consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.56 per share, up 5.4% over the past 30 days, indicating 41.82% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nAVGO\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.44%.\n\n\n\nBroadcom Inc.

Quote\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nAVGO Shares Trading at a Premium\n\nAVGO stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AVGO is trading at 13.73X, higher than its median of 13.39X and the sector\u2019s 5.78X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M)\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nBroadcom\u2019s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. We believe these factors justify the premium valuation.\n\n\n\nBroadcom currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of B, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: 10 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top Goldman Sachs tech stocks to buy.\n\nThe technology sector delivered a strong performance in 2024, driven by chip companies, which played a pivotal role in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Despite a slowdown in the second half of the year due to concerns over high valuations and the AI development timeline, technology remained one of the best-performing sectors as of mid-December. According to Goldman Sachs Research, as of September 2024, U.S. technology stocks have not entered a financial bubble, despite their rapid ascent fueled by AI enthusiasm. Instead, their growth has been underpinned by strong financial fundamentals, with the global tech sector\u2019s earnings per share rising by approximately 400% since the Great Financial Crisis, far outpacing the broader market.\n\nHowever, 2025 has presented new challenges for tech stocks. As of March 5, the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors declined by 4.42%, weighing down the broader index. Market volatility has particularly impacted the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech giants, which collectively lost approximately $2.7 trillion in market value over 50 days. On March 18th, Reuters reported that major U.S. indices, experienced further declines due to economic uncertainties and Federal Reserve policy expectations, reinforcing concerns about tech sector stability.\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, the broader technology outlook remains positive. Deloitte\u2019s 2025 Technology Industry Outlook projects a 9.3% increase in global IT spending, with data center and software segments anticipated to achieve double-digit growth. AI spending is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 29% through 2028, indicating strong long-term demand. A 2024 Morgan Stanley analysis further suggests that hedge funds have increasingly added long positions in technology, media, and telecom (TMT) stocks, particularly in the semiconductor and software sectors, reflecting continued institutional confidence.\n\nWhile AI-driven investments initially centered on data center infrastructure, Goldman Sachs analysts predict a shift toward software companies as AI monetization matures. The focus is expected to transition from AI model training to inferencing, where applications generate revenue, leading to further software sector expansion. Despite emerging AI competitors such as DeepSeek, major cloud computing and tech firms are ramping up AI-related capital expenditures in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nNevertheless, investors should prepare for further market volatility. Reuters reports that hedge funds exited U.S. tech and media stocks at the fastest pace in six months by February 21, reflecting shifting institutional strategies. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio adjustments indicate a slight underweighting of technology stocks.\n\nAs the technology sector navigates both structural growth opportunities and near-term market turbulence, investors must weigh AI-driven innovation against macroeconomic risks. Goldman Sachs has identified key tech stocks poised for future growth, offering strategic opportunities in an evolving landscape.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo develop our list of Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: 10 Stocks to Buy, we ranked the top current holdings of the Goldman Sachs US Technology Opportunities Equity Portfolio according to the highest number of hedge funds ownerships. We have used Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive proprietary Q4 2024 database of hedge funds to arrive at our rankings.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of hedge fund owners \u2013 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology leader specializing in the design, development, and supply of a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Broadcom serves diverse markets such as data centers, networking, software, broadband, wireless, and industrial sectors.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s market positioning is further strengthened by its involvement in artificial intelligence (AI). The company is projected to enter a customer AI chip market worth $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027, driven by its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) projects with multiple customers.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) remains a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, with strong exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure software. For fiscal Q2 2025, the company expects revenue of approximately $14.9 billion, a 19% year-over-year increase. In its latest quarter, Broadcom\u2019s total revenue surged 43.99% from the prior year and 6.13% sequentially, reflecting robust demand for its AI-driven semiconductor solutions. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the company reported revenue of $14.916 billion, marking a 25% increase from the prior-year period. The company also achieved a GAAP net income of $5.503 billion for the quarter.\n\nOn March 7, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock rallied following better-than-expected earnings, offering some relief to AI-focused investors. However, after peaking at a $1 trillion valuation in December, the stock has faced a 22% decline amid broader market corrections. With a market cap of $911 billion, the stock remains highly valued and could see further volatility if market conditions worsen.\n\nDespite near-term fluctuations, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s AI revenue continues to soar, reinforcing its long-term growth potential. Over the past five years, the stock has delivered a staggering 1,058.6% return. Analysts remain bullish, with 89% issuing a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and a strong price target outlook.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of Goldman Sachs tech stocks: 10 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Source Tradingkey\n\nAI Revenue Surge: Broadcom\u2019s AI-related semiconductor revenue hit $10 billion in FY2024, now accounting for 35% of total semiconductor sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Strength: Q1 2025 revenue soared 25% YoY to $14.9 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 68% and $6 billion free cash flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nVMware Acquisition: The $61 billion deal accelerates Broadcom\u2019s shift to software, boosting recurring revenue and strengthening enterprise cloud adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremium Valuation: Broadcom trades at 22.8x EV/EBITDA, a 66% sector premium, requiring sustained AI-driven expansion to justify its high price tag.\n\n\n\nTradingKey - Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has become a leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software through AI-driven expansion and acquisitions.\n\nOn the basis of rising revenues tied to AI, healthy margins, and aggressive cash generation, Broadcom presents a compelling investment case to investors. Broadcom's long-term thesis is based on being positioned to capitalize on the AI wave, expansion of software offerings into enterprises, and competitive strength in networking solutions. The $61 billion VMware acquisition is a transition to a software-led model of expansion that will drive revenue predictability and profitability.\n\nBroadcom's ability to capitalize on the wave of AI is a distinguishing factor that separates it from legacy semiconductor players. While other industry players have their eyes on developing direct AI chips, Broadcom provides connectivity solutions that make operations hassle-free through the help of AI. But even with positive fundamentals, valuation is a concern with it being at a premium. The investors will have to weigh Broadcom's competitive advantage against implementation risks to place their bet on the company's shares.\n\nBusiness Summary: Semiconductors & Software Infrastructure Colossus\n\nBroadcom's business is divided into two primary segments : semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor business involves networking, broadband, wireless, and AI accelerators, while infrastructure software business involves mainframe, cybersecurity, and cloud solutions.\n\nRevenues derived through AI increased 77% YoY to $4.1 billion in Q1 2025 due to hyperscalers ramping up spending on AI XPU and connectivity. The infrastructure software business achieved a still more impressive 47% YoY increase due to adoption by enterprises and VMware integration into Broadcom's ecosystem. Such aggressive revenue expansion in software offsets Broadcom's high-margin semiconductor business model and allows it to ride out industry cyclicality over time.\n\nBroadcom's VMware acquisition secures its cloud and virtualization position while raising concern over risks of implementation. The acquisition will help Broadcom boost its base of recurring revenue by reducing dependency on cyclic semiconductor demand. Broadcom's strategy around AI is to provide connectivity solutions, AI interconnects, and merchant AI accelerators (XPUs) to hyperscale cloud providers.\n\nAs more complex data center infrastructure is needed to handle AI workloads, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends driving demand for high-speed connectivity solutions and network AI based on Ethernet. The company's technology lead around AI interconnects will be key to driving long-term growth.\n\nBroadcom is no longer merely a semiconductor company. Its expansion into software, particularly with VMware, offsets revenue volatility that follows chip demand cycles. However, software integration issues can mute synergistic hopes and slow revenue expansion.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The War Heats Up\n\nThe competitive scenario in the semiconductor and software space is transforming at a very rapid rate with AI-powered infrastructure at their core. Broadcom is competing with semiconductor and software companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Cisco (CSCO).\n\nNvidia is way ahead in AI GPUs with their CUDA platform and deep learning. Broadcom's AI networking and connectivity products remain essential to hyperscalers constructing AI infrastructure. Unlike Nvidia and AMD's focus on compute-centric capabilities in AI, Broadcom's focus remains on high-speed interconnects and merchant AI accelerators that allow it to scale up AI workloads.\n\nEven with such advantages, price pressure will still exist. As hardware margins narrow, Broadcom's pricing power on AI connectivity will be questioned. Furthermore, AMD and Intel continue to expand their AI-focused offerings with additional competition to the broader data center ecosystem. Another risk is that cloud providers design their own customized silicon internally, making Broadcom solutions increasingly dependent over time.\n\nBroadcom's rich IP portfolio with ~21,000 patents and close customer relationship with hyperscalers do provide a competitive moat that cannot be easily replicated. The transition to Ethernet-based networking in AI provides a significant opportunity for Broadcom to gain more market share, particularly as Ethernet-based solutions scale cost-effectively in AI data centers.\n\nBroadcom's role in network AI remains significant but can no longer be taken for granted with Nvidia's threat to move into this space. The battle to control AI infrastructure is heating up, and Broadcom will have to continue to innovate and build good customer relationships. If it can defend its market share while building up its presence in AI connectivity, it will remain a dominant player in the space. But if competitors erode its pricing power or cloud providers build stand-alone solutions, Broadcom's growth will be stifled.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Triple-Threat Growth: How AI, Cloud, and VMware Are Powering Record-Breaking Financials\n\nBroadcom's revenue expansion is driven by three key drivers: VMware integration, enterprise cloud adoption, and growth in AI infrastructure.\n\nFinancials continue to be record-breaking at Broadcom. Q1 2025 revenue was $14.9 billion, up 25% year over year . Adjusted EBITDA was $10.1 billion with a margin of 68%. Free cash flow was $6.0 billion at 40% of revenue and up 28% year over year. The numbers reflect Broadcom's ability to generate high operating leverage as it increases sales of products and software solutions related to AI.\n\nBroadcom has grown revenue every year over the past five fiscal years to $51.6 billion in FY2024 from $23.9 billion in FY2020. The rise is a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21%, indicating that the company has successfully expanded into high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and cloud software. FY2024 was especially notable with a boost coming through increased adoption of AI-related technologies and seamless integration of acquisitions such as VMware.\n\nThe consistent increase in revenues is a reflection of Broadcom's efficient market penetration and diversification in semiconductor and software sectors. Broadcom has effectively developed resilience against market volatility by diversifying its portfolio and reducing dependency on cyclic hardware markets. Plain and simple, Broadcom's steady and increasing revenue growth indicates a well-run company that can effectively capitalize on industry trends.\n\nBroadcom's gross margin expansion over recent years demonstrates its cost management efficiency and pricing strength in markets. From a non-GAAP gross margin of 73.5% in FY2020 to 76.5% in FY2024 , it increased this level. The expansion can be largely attributed to a shift to higher-margin software products and high-margin AI-driven solutions, reflecting a concern with profitability as well as revenue growth.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has also registered impressive growth to reach close to $31.9 billion in FY2024 from $13.6 billion in FY2020. Such a steep increase is a clear indication of Broadcom's high operational efficiency and scalability as it takes advantage of high-margin business segments and efficient cost management strategies.\n\nCost efficiency is a feature of Broadcom's business model. It incurred $9.3 billion in R&D spending in FY2024 to continue innovating while limiting capital spending to a paltry $100 million in Q1 to showcase asset-light operating efficiency. Broadcom's focus on software-driven and AI revenue streams enables it to maintain high adjusted EBITDA margins to justify business model scalability. The fact that it is able to sustain healthy profitability while accumulating a portfolio of AI infrastructure illustrates that it is positioned to be a high-growth, high-margin business.\n\nUltimately, Broadcom's financial well-being is based on its ability to generate plenty of free cash flow while still spending aggressively on R&D. As long as it continues to invest successfully in high-growth AI and software areas, profitability will continue to be healthy. Integration challenges with VMware and competition in AI networking remain top risks that can hinder continued margin expansion.\n\nAI Boom: How Strategic Innovation Turned a Niche Bet into a Powerhouse\n\nBroadcom's AI business has become a rapid growth driver generating $12.2 billion in FY2024 . Starting at less than 5% of revenue in 2019, Broadcom has strategically built up its AI infrastructure capabilities through leading PCIe Retimer technologies. Broadcom offers differentiated advantages with proprietary 5nm silicon solutions such as 35% lower power consumption and 40% longer reach compared to competitors using third-party solutions. This technology advantage provides significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness in AI data centers.\n\nStrategically, Broadcom's positioning within the space of AI is to prioritize high-performance networking and interconnectivity rather than competing head-to-head in Nvidia and AMD's dense compute space. Its revenue trajectory in AI emphasizes a well-executed strategy to capitalize on hyperscale expansion in the data center space, with scalability and efficiency being at the forefront. Its niche focus with heavy R&D investment and industry-leading technology positions Broadcom to continue healthy growth in the high-growth space of AI infrastructure .\n\nAVGO\u2019s Pricey AI Bet: Is Its Premium Valuation Justified?\n\nEven with its strong growth, Broadcom's valuation continues to be a concern to investors. The company's current valuation at higher-than-peer multiples is evident in a forward EV/EBITDA of 22.8x against a sector median of 13.7x, a 66% premium. Similarly, its forward P/E multiple of 28.7x against a sector median of 21.5x suggests that investors are pricing in high levels of expansion in AI. However, looking at a PEG ratio of 1.31x against a sector median of 1.67x, it seems that expansion in AI is not yet fully priced into shares and that upside is present.\n\nBroadcom is a fascinating AI-oriented investment with healthy financials, a lead position in AI networking, and rising software revenues. It is not risk-free, however. It is priced at a premium, so subsequent growth will have to be perfect to justify it. The investor will have to take a long-term position with Broadcom with short-term volatility in mind while understanding that it can dominate AI infrastructure markets. The company's size, diversified revenues, and high free cash flows make it a good institutional portfolio allocation.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nBroadcom\u2019s AI-driven growth, record-breaking revenues, and software expansion position it as a dominant force in AI infrastructure. With AI revenue surge and a strong cash flow engine, its future looks promising. However, its premium valuation requires flawless execution, making it a high-reward but carefully calculated investment.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the markets ending another volatile week that ended after a massive $4 trillion selloff on the flagship S&P 500 since the post-election week at the start. He outlined that one of the reasons that the week was tumultuous was that the President was \u201ccreating pain\u201d and then saying that he was sorry that there was pain. Cramer described Trump as gratuitous and added that the President\u2019s comments had killed the stock market\u2019s rally.\n\nCramer added that Trump \u201ctook stocks that had been going up and reversed them.\u201d Cramer\u2019s \u201cstill trying to figure out where the playbook gets us,\u201d with the playbook being the President\u2019s comments about the economy and the stock market. Following this, co-host Carl Quintanilla asked Cramer his thoughts on rumors that the President was trying to drive the bond market down but the strategy didn\u2019t seem to be working. In response, Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cWell I mean we had that auction yesterday, that didn\u2019t go well. People are kind of so on edge, but it\u2019s not a flight to quality on edge. It\u2019s more of a flight to cash. I mean you know this idea of a flight to quality does include that there\u2019s part of the curve you wanna be on. Now when I was a hedge fund manager, there were these moments where you\u2019d hear flight to quality and that meant that you really wanted to be in 30-day paper. We\u2019re kind of back to that. Because that\u2019s safe. 30-day\u2019s very safe. It\u2019s safe from the President. And, look, I, the President\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s intriguing. But I never really felt that we were in a moment where stocks should go down. When I was close to President Biden, when he would ride the train and I\u2019d see him in Washington. . .I would have the page [inaudible] stock price, he would come over [inaudible] I don\u2019t care about any of those. Well the President does. He wants them lower! He\u2019s creating a sale. I mean I\u2019ve never seen a sale mandated before.

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nBroadcom's estimated fair value is US$202 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nBroadcom's US$192 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\n\nwhich is 24% above our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Broadcom Inc. ( ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$30.9b US$38.5b US$44.2b US$57.4b US$62.5b US$66.5b US$70.0b US$73.2b US$76.1b US$78.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x13 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 6.35% Est @ 5.27% Est @ 4.51% Est @ 3.98% Est @ 3.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$28.4k US$32.6k US$34.4k US$41.1k US$41.2k US$40.3k US$39.0k US$37.5k US$35.8k US$34.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$364b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$79b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (8.7%\u2013 2.8%) = US$1.4t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.4t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$587b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$951b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$192, the company appears about fair value at a 5.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Broadcom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.380. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Broadcom\n\nStrength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Threat Dividends are not covered by earnings. Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

There are just too many trends in their favor for them to stay beaten down for long, and I think a year's worth of financial results will cause them to rejoin that 10-figure club.\n\nBroadcom's custom accelerators are going to power the next phase of AI\n\nBoth Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are heavily involved in the AI race. Broadcom has a ton of products in its portfolio, including mainframe software and hardware, and virtual desktop offerings. Its AI is focused on two areas: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs.\n\nConnectivity switches help direct the flow of information traffic in data centers and are a vital part of every build. XPUs are an alternative to GPUs (graphics processing units) such as those made by Nvidia.\n\nWhen the workload is properly configured, XPUs are more efficient than GPUs at AI training tasks.

Broadcom has a ton of products in its portfolio, including mainframe software and hardware, and virtual desktop offerings. Its AI is focused on two areas: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs.\n\nConnectivity switches help direct the flow of information traffic in data centers and are a vital part of every build. XPUs are an alternative to GPUs (graphics processing units) such as those made by Nvidia.\n\nWhen the workload is properly configured, XPUs are more efficient than GPUs at AI training tasks.

Future launches of the GB200 and GB300 series are expected to further boost NVIDIA\u2019s AI-related revenue in 2025.\n\nBroadcom also benefited from AI-driven demand, with its semiconductor division generating $30.64 billion in revenue, an 8% YoY increase, ranking third. AI chip revenue now accounts for over 30% of Broadcom\u2019s semiconductor solutions. After facing a mid-year downturn in 2024, the company is expected to see strong rebounds in wireless communications, broadband, and server storage in 2025.\n\nAMD secured fourth place with a 14% YoY revenue growth, reaching $25.79 billion. The company saw significant expansion in both its server and client CPU businesses, particularly a 94% surge in server-related revenue. In 2025, AMD will continue focusing on AI PCs, servers, and HPC/AI accelerators, leveraging collaborations with Dell, Microsoft, and Google to sustain its growth momentum.\n\nQualcomm and MediaTek rebounded from previous slowdowns in the smartphone market. Driven by growth in handheld and automotive segments, Qualcomm\u2019s QCT division generated $34.86 billion in 2024, a 13% YoY increase, securing second place. Qualcomm is expected to shift its focus toward AI PCs and edge computing as its legal disputes over ARM licensing are now temporarily concluded, expanding its high-end consumer market presence in 2025.\n\nMediaTek ranked fifth with $16.52 billion in revenue, up 19% YoY, driven by strong performance across smartphones, power management ICs, and Smart Edge solutions. MediaTek\u2019s 5G smartphone penetration is projected to exceed 65% in 2025, with an increasing share in the high-end market bolstering revenue. Additionally, its partnership with NVIDIA on Project DIGITS is expected to sustain growth momentum.\n\nRealtek and Novatek saw shifts in their rankings. Realtek\u2019s revenue climbed 16% YoY to $3.53 billion, reclaiming the seventh spot. Following a period of inventory correction in 2023, the company experienced a recovery in PC and automotive-related shipments in 2024. In 2025, networking and automotive businesses will be Realtek\u2019s key growth drivers, with its Wi-Fi 7 market penetration expected to reach double digits.\n\nWill Semiconductor is projected to achieve revenue of $3.048 billion in 2024, representing a 21% year-over-year increase. Over the recent years, the company has continued to expand its market share in CIS (CMOS Image Sensor). This growth is particularly driven by the increasing proportion of high-end CIS shipments in Android phones and the ongoing penetration of electric vehicles globally, especially in the Chinese region, into autonomous driving applications, which has led to sustained revenue growth.\n\nMPS rounded out the top ten with $2.2 billion in revenue, up 21% YoY. The company\u2019s PMICs have successfully entered the AI server supply chain, driving exponential growth in its Enterprise Data division.",

This is to attend the China Development High-Level Forum (CDF), which will be held for two days from this day.\n\nAccording to the People's Network, an online media outlet of the People's Daily, the newspaper of the Communist Party of China, 86 global corporate CEOs from 21 countries attended the CDF opening ceremony held at the State Guest House in Diaoyutai, Beijing. At a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is waging a \"tariff war\" around the world with China at the center, it is noteworthy that heads of global companies have shown great interest in the Chinese market.\n\nIn Korea, Chairman Lee appeared at the CDF for the first time in two years. Kwak No-jung, president of SK Hynix, also attended. Chairman Lee visited Xiaomi's automobile plant in Beijing the previous day and shared opinions with Xiaomi Chairman Lei Jun and others. Kwak attended the event last year as well.\n\nIn the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Blackstone Chairman Stephen Schwartzman, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Broadcom CEO Tan participated. In Germany, BWM Chairman Oliver Chipze and Mercedes-Benz Chairman Ola Kalenius appeared, while Aramco CEO Amin Nasser appeared in Saudi Arabia. Seventeen companies, including Sweden's Ikea and Canada's Brookfield, attended the CDF for the first time this year.\n\n\"Foreign companies play an important role in China's development,\" Premier Li Chang of the State Council said at the opening ceremony. \"China will welcome all companies from all countries in the future.\" \"I hope more foreign companies will invest in China and participate in the Chinese market,\" he said, adding, \"We want to cooperate with businessmen around the world in a more open manner.\"\n\n\"If the world goes back to the law of the jungle, it will be the end of history and humanity,\" he said. \"If the public insists on economic globalization, that's the right direction.\" \"China does not oppose competition, but supports lowering international tariffs,\" he said, pointing to the Trump administration's protectionist policy.",

But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). To be precise, the stock price is 731% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. Of course what matters most is whether the business can improve itself sustainably, thus justifying a higher price. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 28% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 53% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 86.68.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth March 22nd 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 844%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",

In the latest news, tech giant Tencent has unveiled a suite of new artificial intelligence tools capable of converting text and images into 3D visuals. The move marks the growing Chinese momentum in the field of generative AI.\n\nSimilarly, Baidu has released two new AI models which are freely available to individual users ahead of schedule. ERNIE 4.5 is a native multimodal foundation model, while ERNIE X1 is a reasoning model with deep-learning capabilities. The company aims to increase user involvement across its platforms, attempting to combine these models into its larger ecosystem.\n\nAs major players continue to release new models and tools, the race to dominate the AI landscape intensifies even further.

            "content": "Broadcom Stocks Face Turbulent Times Amid AI Boom Despite a recent downturn in share prices, Broadcom's significant growth in the AI sector presents new investment opportunities.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (AVGO), a giant in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, has seen its stock become a hot topic lately, especially amidst the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). As of late March 2025, the company's shares have experienced a significant decline of 16% over the past month, contrasting with the S&P 500 index's loss of 7.5% during the same timeframe. In the larger context, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Broadcom is part of, has also taken a hit with losses totaling 16.1%.\n\nDespite this short-term decline, the outlook for Broadcom seems more promising, particularly due to the remarkable growth the company has experienced in its AI segment. The firm recently reported 77% sales growth in its AI offerings for the first quarter of FY25, showcasing the substantial market potential ahead. Broader estimates also indicate bright prospects, with a consensus earnings prediction of $1.56 per share, reflecting a striking 41.8% increase from the previous year. Interestingly, this estimate has undergone a positive revision of 6.8% in just 30 days.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Broadcom's consensus earnings estimate sits at $6.56 per share, a 34.7% anticipated growth year-over-year, further revised up by 4.9%. The company is not just resting on its laurels; projections indicate an 18% increase in earnings for the next fiscal year as well.\n\nBroadcom's AI expansion, which positions it as a leader in the tech landscape, focuses on collaborating with major players in the field, namely tech titans such as Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. The strategic partnership has opened doors to a serviceable addressable market estimated between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal 2027. CEO Hock Tan expressed confidence in the company's continued success, stating, \u201cHyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.\u201d\n\nHowever, the recent downturn in stock performance can be attributed to a broader cooling off in the AI hype that surged after the company's spectacular earnings report at the tail end of 2024. Investors are reminded to weigh the long-term benefits of Broadcom\u2019s AI-related growth against the recent market fluctuations. The firm has experienced a meteoric rise, soaring more than 1,300% over the past decade, with a remarkable 200% increase just in the last two years.\n\nUnderpinning this robust performance is Broadcom's continuous innovation in critical technologies. The company recently launched an end-to-end PCIe Gen 6 portfolio and made headlines with the introduction of Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters, marking the industry's first quantum-resistant encryption solution. These advancements not only showcase Broadcom's commitment to staying ahead in the semiconductor space but also address crucial cybersecurity concerns facing today's digital environment.\n\nMoreover, the demand for semiconductors has only increased, with global sales reaching $56.5 billion in January 2025, up 17.9% from January 2024, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Such trends bolster the investment thesis for semiconductor firms, including Broadcom.\n\nAs of now, Broadcom holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), underscoring market confidence in the company's long-term potential. Out of 34 brokerage recommendations tracked by Zacks, 30 classify Broadcom stock as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d This endorsement reflects the broader investor sentiment that expects upward revisions to continue as the year progresses.\n\nWith a recent selloff prompting prices to retract almost 25% from peak levels, investors could find this moment an ideal opportunity to consider buying into Broadcom's stock. The shares are currently trading near their 200-day moving average, suggesting a potential stabilization point as it seeks to build support at this price level.\n\nThe tech sector is highly competitive but remains fertile ground for growth, especially surrounding the innovations that AI promises to deliver. As Broadcom continues to engage in strategies aimed at enhancing its service solutions, it not only seeks to capture a larger market share but also solidify its status as a key player in both the AI and broader semiconductor markets.\n\nIn conclusion, while Broadcom has experienced volatility recently, its dynamic AI growth, strong partnerships, and continuous product innovation set the stage for a promising future. Investors looking for exposure to the semiconductor sector\u2014and particularly to AI developments\u2014might view this as a prime time to invest in Broadcom Inc.",

            "content": "Trade policies of the Trump administration and fears of a potential recession amid tariff wars are weighing on the U.S. stock market. While mega-cap stocks are under pressure, Wall Street remains bullish on some of them due to their robust growth potential. Mega-cap stocks, which have a market capitalization of more than $200 billion, are associated with large, well-established companies with strong track records and generally rank among the leading players in their respective industries. Using TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Broadcom (AVGO), Tesla (TSLA), and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) against each other to find the mega-cap stock that earns Wall Street\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating.\n\nLight Up your Portfolio with Spark:\n\nEasily identify stocks' risks and opportunities.\n\nDiscover stocks' market position with detailed competitor analyses.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nBroadcom is one of the prominent suppliers of semiconductors, enterprise software, and security solutions. AVGO stock is down over 17% so far this year due to broader market weakness amid tariff wars, concerns over chip restrictions, and rising competition in the AI (artificial intelligence) space.\n\nNonetheless, Wall Street is bullish on AVGO stock due to AI tailwinds. Specifically, Broadcom\u2019s custom AI chips, which the company calls application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), are seeing massive demand due to their ability to train and deploy AI models. Notably, Broadcom\u2019s AI revenue in Q1 FY25 jumped 77% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, with the company projecting it will grow further to $4.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nAside from the strength in its semiconductor solutions business, which includes AI revenue, Broadcom is also optimistic about the potential of its infrastructure software business.\n\nIs AVGO Stock a Buy?\n\nRecently JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $250. Sur is bullish on AVGO stock due to multiple reasons that reinforce the company\u2019s solid performance and future growth potential. The 5-star analyst noted Broadcom\u2019s stellar Q1 FY25 results, with revenues from AI semiconductors and software beating estimates and offsetting the weakness in non-AI semiconductor sales. He also highlighted AVGO\u2019s upbeat guidance, thanks to robust demand in AI networking and the early adoption of Google\u2019s (GOOGL) TPU v6 3nm ASIC training chip.\n\nFurther, Sur believes that Broadcom\u2019s expanding pipeline of AI ASIC design wins, including new engagements with prominent companies like SoftBank/Arm Holdings (ARM) and OpenAI, emphasizes its leadership in the AI infrastructure market. He added that AVGO\u2019s diversified portfolio and successful upselling in its infrastructure software business ensure stable revenue growth even amid macroeconomic challenges.\n\nWith 22 Buys and two Holds, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Broadcom stock. The average AVGO stock price target of $252.20 implies 31.6% upside potential.\n\nSee more AVGO analyst ratings\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nTesla stock has plunged more than 38% year to date due to the company\u2019s disappointing electric vehicle (EV) sales amid intense competition, macro pressures, and investors\u2019 concerns about the distraction caused by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s political activities.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s financial performance has been disappointing. Tesla\u2019s revenue grew by just 1% in 2024, while adjusted EPS (earnings per share) plunged 22%. The company generated dismal revenue despite offering price cuts and incentives to boost its sales. Tesla\u2019s weak sales and the 194 basis points contraction in the 2024 operating margin indicate that the company is struggling to maintain its dominance in the highly competitive EV market.\n\nIs TSLA Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOn Thursday, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target for Tesla stock to $450 from $500 but reiterated a Buy rating. While the analyst believes in the company\u2019s ability to reshape the world\u2019s transportation and energy markets, he lowered his 2025 delivery estimate based on the quarter-to-date trends in Tesla\u2019s EVs.\n\nThe 5-star analyst contends that one can\u2019t entirely blame politics for Tesla\u2019s weak deliveries. Rather, he contends that factory shutdowns and the Model Y changeover are the main reasons for the lower deliveries. Potter noted that his price target does not account for the potential contribution from humanoid robots or artificial intelligence-as-a-service. At the current price levels, Potter thinks that TSLA stock is \u201ccheap,\u201d given the opportunities in auto, energy, and full self-driving (FSD).\n\nSeveral analysts don\u2019t share Potter\u2019s optimism. Tesla stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sell recommendations. At $335.32, the average TSLA stock price target implies 34.8% upside potential.\n\nSee more TSLA analyst ratings\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\n\nFast-food chain McDonald\u2019s is known for its resilience during difficult economic periods due to its value offerings. MCD stock is up more than 5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 Index (SPX), which is down 3.4%.\n\nHowever, last month, McDonald\u2019s reported lower-than-anticipated revenue for Q4 2024 due to a decline in its comparable sales in the U.S., reflecting the impact of E.coli outbreak earlier in the quarter. During the conference call, CEO Chris Kempczinski said that based on many factors, he thinks that the company\u2019s performance will recover to \u201cproper form\u201d over the next several quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, McDonald\u2019s plans to expand its global network of more than 43,000 locations by opening over 2,200 restaurants this year, with about 25% of these openings in the U.S. Overall, the company believes that it is on track to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027.\n\nIs McDonald\u2019s Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nRecently, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass lowered his price target for McDonald\u2019s stock to $335 from $340 and reiterated a Buy rating after adjusting estimates based on recent industry trends and company-specific factors. He now expects 2025 global same-store sales growth of 2.6%, versus 3.0% estimated previously and 2.7% projected by the Street, given Q1 revisions. The reduced top-line expectations lead to an EPS estimate of $12.23, down from the previous projection of $12.42 and slightly lower than the consensus Wall Street estimate of $12.25.\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on McDonald\u2019s stock based on 15 Buys and 10 Holds. The average MCD stock price target of $327.29 implies about 7.2% upside potential.\n\nSee more MCD analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is highly bullish on Broadcom stock, cautiously optimistic on McDonald\u2019s stock, and sidelined on Tesla stock. AVGO stock scores Wall Street\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating and could offer an upside of about 32%. Overall, analysts see the pullback in AVGO stock as an opportunity to build a position and gain from the solid AI-led demand for its offerings.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Broadcom Achieves Technical Milestone With RS Rating Surge Stock shows promising signs despite slight sell-off amid market corrections.\n\nOn Thursday, Broadcom (AVGO) marked a remarkable technical achievement as its Relative Strength (RS) Rating escalated into the elite 80-plus category, reaching an impressive score of 84, up from 78 the previous day. This surge is particularly notable for investors, as the RS Rating serves as a key indicator of market leadership, revealing how a stock's performance compares over the past year. Typically, stocks that post an RS Rating above 80 are poised to deliver substantial gains, signaling the potential for a significant price movement.\n\nBroadcom, renowned for manufacturing a spectrum of analog chips targeted at telecommunications, industrial, automotive, and computing sectors, has been notably advancing in the realm of custom artificial intelligence chips as well. According to industry analysts, the boost in its RS Rating suggests stronger performance leading to additional investor interest.\n\nBacking this performance is Broadcom's robust Composite Rating, which stands at 96 out of 99. This metric assesses a company across multiple characteristics pivotal for evaluating winning stocks, placing Broadcom above 96% of its competitors. In addition, its Earnings Per Share (EPS) rating is particularly notable at 98, while its SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity) Rating holds a solid A.\n\nHowever, there exists a slight cautionary note: Broadcom's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is marked C-. This rating indicates that the selling of shares by funds has been marginally outpacing the buying activity, a trend that has surfaced amid an overall correction in the stock market. Interestingly, the number of funds investing in Broadcom shares saw an uptick from 5,481 in June to 6,015 by December, reflecting growing interest despite the minor fluctuations.\n\nFor the last quarter, Broadcom showcased remarkable earnings growth of 45%, an increase from the previous quarter's 28%, with earnings per share reported at $1.60. Nevertheless, the company did observe a decline in sales growth, which decreased from 51% to a commendable 25%, resulting in total sales amounting to $14.9 billion.\n\nMarket analysts remain optimistic, forecasting that Broadcom's EPS will climb by 43% in the upcoming quarter, fueled by an anticipated 19% growth in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet. As it stands in its sector, Broadcom has earned the No. 2 position among 39 other peer companies in the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, with Rambus (RMBS) leading the rank.\n\nBroadcom's stock performance has certainly been a rollercoaster, reaching its record high of $251.88 on December 16th, only to tumble down to a low of $177.61 by March 6th. On the most recent trading day, AVGO's stock was noted to close just above $190, reflecting a slight downturn for the day.\n\nThe unique RS Rating from Investor's Business Daily (IBD) plays a critical role in identifying stock performance comprehensively, indicating market leadership through comparisons over the last 52 weeks against a broad database of stocks. As investors consider their strategies moving forward, monitoring Broadcom's trajectory will be crucial as it attempts to establish a credible consolidation before potential breakout opportunities.\n\nThis article was produced with the assistance of Stats Perform's Wordsmith software, utilizing data and templates provided by Investor's Business Daily, with editorial contributions by journalist James DeTar.",

            "content": "Investors Eye Opportunities Amid Nasdaq 100 Correction Despite recent declines in high-profile stocks, analysts advise long-term investments in Broadcom, Axon Enterprise, and Costco.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index has officially entered correction territory, down 11% from a peak reached last month, showcasing the market's tumultuous nature as it fluctuates between highs and lows. The tech-heavy index, which contains the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, has witnessed significant declines in high-profile stocks including Tesla, Palantir Technologies, and Amazon, with losses hitting 31%, 19%, and 16% respectively since their recent peaks.\n\nThe recent downturn is being felt across the board, but savvy investors recognize it may represent a buying opportunity. Market analysts highlight three specific companies within the index that they suggest could offer great returns despite their current pullbacks.\n\nFirst on the list is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), whose stock is down 17% over the past month and 19% year-to-date, following a cautious second-quarter outlook projected at $14.9 billion in revenue, slightly below the $15.1 billion Wall Street expected. However, analysts note that Broadcom's revenue surged 25% compared to the previous year, and its adjusted earnings reached $1.60 per share, outperforming both company forecasts and market expectations. With AI chip revenue up 77% to $4.1 billion and underpinned by $9.3 billion in cash reserves, Broadcom's fundamentals remain robust, establishing it as a company that could present substantial upside potential for long-term investors.\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), another stock garnering attention, has recently seen its shares rise by 2% despite a notable decline of 25% last month due to an analyst downgrade. However, positive fourth-quarter results showed a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $575 million, significantly exceeding estimates of $566 million. Earnings also topped forecasts at $2.08 per share. As Axon continues to achieve annual growth exceeding 30%, driven by innovative AI-driven tools, analysts believe it remains a dominant player in law enforcement technology, even amid shifting market dynamics.\n\nFinally, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is presented as another solid buy during this stock market downturn. With nearly 1,000 locations globally, including over 600 in the U.S., it provides consumers with value that has consistently attracted a vast membership base of 76.2 million paid subscribers. Although there are concerns surrounding potential price increases due to prospective tariffs, Costco's steady business model allows it to adjust relatively better than many competitors in the retail space. Wall Street maintains a strong buy rating with a target price of $1,029 per share, indicating a healthy 15% upside potential.\n\nIn recent speculative trading news, on March 18, 2025, Caton Frates, Executive Vice President at Costco, affected insider trading by selling 850 shares, reducing his stake in the company to 7,875.772 shares. Such movements are closely monitored as they can signal insider sentiment regarding the company\u2019s future.\n\nThis week, the broader market has also been influenced by active options trading, with the S&P 500 rising by 0.42% early in the week. A remarkable 1,048 instances of unusual options activity were noted, including one significant option trade involving Costco, which points towards investor confidence in the stock\u2019s potential amidst the turbulence. Options strategies including covered calls, married puts, and protective collars are recommended for those looking to capitalize on Costco's strong fundamentals.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Nasdaq 100 has seen alarming declines, the downturn presents a distinctive opportunity for investors. Broadcom, Axon Enterprise, and Costco emerge as three compelling stocks for long-term consideration amidst market corrections. The focus on these quality companies attests to the resilience of certain sectors within the stock market, providing pathways for recovery as the current landscape evolves.",

            "content": "A surge of ransomware attacks leveraging critical VMware virtualization vulnerabilities has triggered global alerts. Threat actors exploit flaws in ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion products to paralyze enterprise infrastructures.\n\nThe vulnerabilities CVE-2025-22224 (CVSS 9.3), CVE-2025-22225 (CVSS 8.2), and CVE-2025-22226 (CVSS 7.1) enable attackers to escape virtual machine (VM) containment, hijack hypervisors, and deploy ransomware across entire clusters.\n\nShadowserver observed that 41,500+ internet-exposed VMware ESXi hypervisors are vulnerable to CVE-2025-22224, a critical zero-day vulnerability actively exploited in attacks, as of March 4, 2025.\n\nVulnerability Trio: A Perfect Storm for Attackers\n\nCVE-2025-22224, a heap overflow flaw in VMware\u2019s VMCI driver, allows attackers with VM administrator privileges to execute code on the host\u2019s VMX process. This serves as the entry point for hypervisor compromise.\n\nAttackers then exploit CVE-2025-22225, an arbitrary write vulnerability, to escalate privileges and gain kernel-level control of ESXi hosts.\n\nFinally, CVE-2025-22226 facilitates credential theft via hypervisor memory leaks, enabling lateral movement to vCenter and other critical systems.\n\nThe attack begins with breaching an internet-facing VM, often via web shells or stolen credentials. Once inside, adversaries exploit CVE-2025-22224 to escape the VM sandbox and execute code on the ESXi host.\n\nPrivilege escalation via CVE-2025-22225 grants kernel access, while CVE-2025-22226 extracts credentials from memory, bypassing network-based detection.\n\nFrom the hypervisor, attackers pivot to vCenter via SSH or exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, often leveraging lax inter-subnet firewall rules. The final stage involves encrypting VM disk files (VMDKs) and deleting backups stored in vSphere datastores, crippling business operations, reads Sygnia report.\n\nSecurity teams face significant monitoring challenges:\n\nHypervisor Blind Spots: Only 38% of organizations monitor ESXi host logs like /var/log/hostd.log for VM management anomalies. Noise Overload: High-volume VMware logs lack security optimization, allowing attackers to blend in. Segmentation Failures: 72% of affected organizations lacked micro-segmentation between management interfaces and production networks.\n\nThe healthcare and financial sectors report the highest attack rates, with adversaries encrypting entire patient record systems and transaction databases within 47 minutes of initial access. Ransom demands average $2\u20135 million, with double extortion tactics threatening data leaks on dark web forums.\n\nBroadcom has already patched the vulnerabilities in VMware products. On March 4, 2025, Broadcom released emergency updates to address three critical vulnerabilities \u2013 CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226 \u2013 affecting several VMware products, including ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.\n\nBroadcom has released the following fixed versions for affected VMware products:\n\nVMware ESXi 8.0: ESXi80U3d-24585383, ESXi80U2d-24585300\n\nVMware ESXi 7.0: ESXi70U3s-24585291\n\nVMware ESXi 6.7: ESXi670-202503001\n\nVMware Workstation 17.x: 17.6.3\n\nVMware Fusion 13.x: 13.6.3\n\nAdditionally, asynchronous patches are available for VMware Cloud Foundation, while Telco Cloud Platform customers should update to a fixed ESXi version.\n\nUrgency to Patch\n\nBroadcom is strongly urging all VMware customers to apply these patches immediately. The vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because:\n\nThey are being actively exploited in the wild. They allow attackers with administrative access to escape the virtual machine sandbox and potentially compromise all VMs running on the same server. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added all three CVEs to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list.\n\nGiven the critical nature and active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, organizations must identify affected systems, apply the patches as soon as possible, monitor systems for unusual activity, and review their security practices.",

Both have been seeing strong growth coming from AI.\n\nAMD holds the No. 2 spot in producing graphics processing units (GPUs) behind Nvidia. These chips have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their powerful processing speeds that can handle AI workloads. However, with about a 10% to 17% market share in the GPU space, it greatly trails Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the market.\n\nAMD's biggest issue has been its inferior software platform compared to Nvidia. The company didn't develop its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software until around 2016, a decade after Nvidia created its CUDA platform. Meanwhile, semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis found its GPUs to generally be unusable for AI training out of the box due to software incompatibilities.\n\nAMD's GPUs have been used more for AI inference, as well as as an alternative to Nvidia chips when they aren't available. AMD has found a strong niche in the central processing unit (CPU) data center market, where it has been taking more market share. While GPUs provide the power, CPUs act more as the brains of the operation. It's not as big of a market, but it's still an important one that is growing quickly along with the AI infrastructure market.\n\nA computer chip with the letters AI on it.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom, on the other hand, doesn't make GPUs or CPUs. Instead, it has been attacking the AI infrastructure market by helping customers develop custom AI chips called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). While these custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs and take more time and money to develop, they outperform GPUs for the specific tasks for which they are designed and they consume less power.\n\nThe company also participates in the networking side of AI infrastructure where it makes components such as Ethernet switches and network interface cards (NICs). These components are integral in managing the flow of data and distributing AI workloads across servers.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's biggest opportunity is in the custom AI chip market. The company currently has seven AI chip customers at various stages of development. For the three farthest along in that development, it predicts that it will have a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2026 (ending October 2026) alone, as these customer look to build AI chip clusters consisting of 1 million AI chips. While Broadcom won't get all of that business (some will likely continue to go to Nvidia), it is a big opportunity. Meanwhile, its newer customers should help drive revenue growth in later years.\n\nAMD grew its data center revenue by 69% last quarter to $3.9 billion, while Broadcom increased its AI-related revenue by 77% to $4.1 billion. That's pretty similar, although Broadcom appears to have the larger AI opportunity moving forward. Broadcom has a number of custom AI chip customers ramping up the next few years that should help propel growth, while AMD will have to continue to try and chip away at Nvidia in the GPU market.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nAMD is the cheaper of the two stocks.

            "content": "Plus, \u201ctwo additional hyperscalers have selected Broadcom to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation frontier models.\u201d In total, AVGO is working with four more AI hyperscalers beyond its three established AI giant clients.\n\nBroadcom collaborates with three AI hyperscalers (tech companies operating massive AI data centers, like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon). AVGO said on its Q1 earnings call on March 6 that it expects these \u201cthree hyperscale customers will generate a Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Broadcom works directly with tech giants like Meta to design their application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Custom AI chips are gaining steam since they can perform AI workloads similar to Nvidia\u2019s industry-leading offerings.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s semiconductor solutions are critical components in telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers, enterprise networking, and beyond. AVGO also provides enterprise software, including cybersecurity and hybrid cloud infrastructure, serving a wide-ranging customer base.\n\nNow looks like a great time to buy Broadcom, down nearly 25% from its peaks, as it finds support near key technical levels. AVGO offers massive AI upside and long-term exposure to growth across industrials, smartphones, and other areas.\n\nThe stock has cooled off after skyrocketing too far, too fast following its blockbuster earnings release in early December.\n\nBroadcom stock has more than quadrupled the tech sector over the past decade (+1,300%), including a 200% run in the last two years. Broadcom briefly surpassed the $1 trillion market cap threshold, joining Nvidia, Apple, and other tech titans.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is a semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions company riding huge growth from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AVGO works directly with multiple AI hyperscalers and posted 77% AI sales growth in its recently reported Q1 FY25.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Impressive Growth Outlook\n\nBroadcom grew its AI sales by 77% in Q1 FY25 (reported on March 6), boosting total revenue by 25% and lifting EPS by 45%.\n\nAVGO\u2019s AI growth offset slowing sales in its non-AI semiconductor segments, such as industrials, wireless, and enterprise networking, which are facing cyclical downturns.\n\nAVGO\u2019s beat-and-raise first quarter of 2025 lifted its earnings outlook once again, earning it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and extending its wave of upward revisions. Broadcom is expected to expand adjusted EPS by 35% this year and 18% in 2026, after 15% growth last year.\n\nCEO Hock Tan said in prepared remarks that AVGO sees continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 as \u201chyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.\u201d\n\nBroadcom is projected to grow its revenue by 20% in FY25 and 15% in FY26, following 44% expansion in 2024.\n\nTime to Buy This Beaten-Down AI Stock on the Dip?\n\nBroadcom shares have soared over 9,000% in the past 15 years, blowing away tech\u2019s 500% and crushing five of the Magnificent Seven stocks\u2014lagging only Nvidia and Tesla. AVGO stock more than quadrupled the tech sector over the past decade (+1,300%), including a 200% run in the last two years.\n\nAVGO\u2019s two-year charge helped it outpace all of the Mag 7 except Nvidia. The AI chip stock outclimbed the entire group over the last year, briefly hitting a $1 trillion market cap in December.\n\nInvestors can buy Broadcom down nearly 25% from its early December peaks. The stock was due for a selloff after skyrocketing following its Q4 release in December. AVGO\u2019s quick fall came alongside the broader AI trade and most of the stock market, washing away nearly all its post-Q4 gains.\n\nThe stock has tumbled from some of its most overheated RSI levels (a widely tracked momentum indicator) in recent years to some of its lowest. On a longer timeframe, Broadcom is at some of its lowest RSI levels in the past decade.\n\nAVGO is finding support above its 50-week, right at its 200-day moving average, and near the top end of its pre-December breakout range.\n\nBroadcom still trades at a premium to the tech sector in terms of forward earnings, which makes sense given its performance and growth outlook. Yet, it\u2019s nearly even with tech on the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio front.\n\nOn top of that, Broadcom pays a dividend, and 30 of the 34 brokerage recommendations tracked by Zacks are \u201cStrong Buys.\u201d\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Last night, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang put technology developed by Mellanox and Deci, two Israeli companies that it acquired over the years, at the center of the company's annual product launch event in San Jose.\n\nThe main products were the Spectrum-X and Quantum-X (no connection to quantum computing) chips, developed in Yokne'am and Tel Aviv, that lower power consumption in data centers through optic technology that obviates the need for existing communications switches.\n\nSuch chips can make construction of data centers considerably cheaper for Nvidia's largest customers, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Oracle, and Elon Musk's xAI, positioning Nvidia better in relation to Broadcom, its rival in both communications and AI chips.\n\nThe other main Israeli launch was the product of the $300 million acquisition of Deci last year.\n\nBefore it was acquired, Deci was one of the Israeli companies developing large language models, the models that are at the basis of artificial intelligence. NVIDIA\u2019s office in Yokneam (credit: NVIDIA)\n\nNow, Nvidia has revealed why it bought the company: a series of basic models for the field of AI agents, more complex AI software capable of solving more difficult problems.\n\nThese are known as large reasoning models and are aimed at companies that seek to develop agentic AI that will carry out complex tasks. The model, based on Meta's open-source Llama training models, is called Llama Nemotron and will be marketed as open-source in order to attract customers to the company's for-pay products.\n\nAbove everything, there hovered the spirit of Chinese company DeepSeek, which rocked Wall Street and Nvidia's stock in particular, wiping almost $600 billion off its value after it launched its R1 model, which is of comparable quality to some of OpenAI's best models and that won praise from leading industry figures such as Sam Altman, Satya Nadella, and even Nvidia itself.\n\nIn a series of slides, Huang presented DeepSeek and its like as a powerful growth engine for his company on the grounds that its launch highlighted the need for many processors. Advertisement\n\nA transition into a world of AI\n\nNvidia claims that the world of AI is in transition from the stage in which graphics processors are mainly bought for the purposes of training models to one in which most processors are bought in order to operate existing models and to provide service to a growing number of users. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nDeepSeek is a guest at the Nvidia event in San Jose and has a stand there.\n\nAs a response to the DeepSeek phenomenon, Huang presented the chip developed before the launch of the Chinese model: Blackwell Ultra (GB300), the graphics processor with the largest memory in the industry (288 gigabytes) that provides inference power 35 times that of the company's Hopper series (H100) and 1.5 times the power of the previous Blackwell generation (GB200).\n\nAnother answer to DeepSeek presented by Huang was a product partially developed in Israel, a software environment called Dynamo that enables companies like OpenAI and xAI to manage the running of reasoning models and spread it over a larger number of graphics processors \u2014 up to a thousand of them.\n\nAccording to Nvidia, Dynamo will make it possible to deliver the same results with 30 times more efficient power consumption on the basis of the same computing power.\n\nNvidia will try to sell its new Blackwell chips in the form of a complete server rack with 72 graphics processors, BlueField communications switches, ConnectX Ethernet adaptors, and the new Quantum-X and Spectrum-X chips, all of them apart from the Blackwell processors products of Nvidia Israel.\n\nThe aim is to represent an alternative to companies such as Dell and HP, or AMD and Broadcom, that sell competing systems at lower prices. Nvidia hopes that the approach of being a single supplier, even if costlier, will give it a competitive advantage.\n\nChallenge to Mobileye\n\nMobileye's share price fell 3.5% yesterday shortly after Huang announced a new driving safety product called Halos, which he said was an AI-based product for controlling vehicle systems and preventing accidents, which is similar to Mobileye's business and to a parallel system from Qualcomm, another competing chip company.\n\nIn a move that should worry Mobileye and other competitors, Huang presented an agreement with General Motors that covers all aspects of the company's development of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nNvidia already has agreements with Mercedes, Jaguar, and Land Rover relating to conventional vehicles.\n\nThe writer is a guest of Nvidia at the GTC AI Conference in San Jose.",

We are enabling Europe\u2019s economic competitiveness across strategic sectors as we support our customers\u2019 ambitions in a rapidly changing world.\n\nEnabling innovation through security, resilience and compliance\n\nWhen Broadcom acquired VMware to build the world\u2019s leading infrastructure technology company, it committed to making VMware products easier to use, buy, and deploy. Hock Tan summarised Broadcom\u2019s approach in an interview with the Financial Times observing the key in the global race for AI is \u201cto use your own data, train your own data and keep your data on your own premise.\u201d\n\nA vital solution to securely and effectively leverage data for AI is sovereign cloud. That\u2019s why VMware Cloud Foundation has sparked such interest from customers \u2013 it combines public cloud scale and agility with private cloud security and resiliency at an industry-leading cost of ownership. It is the most compelling platform for organisations to run the apps they need and to keep their innovative edge safely.\n\nNavigating the wide-ranging requirements of sovereign cloud\n\nRapid cloud adoption has had to compete in recent years with data protection rules and emerging regulations tied to AI. European governments have also enacted stringent national laws that govern how sensitive data can cross borders.\n\nAs Hock noted in his conversations with customers at VMware Explore Barcelona last year, \u201cone message was clear: the strategic importance of data is fuelling demand for sovereign cloud services.\u201d\n\nHow cloud architectures can work in practice and what needs to be done to help European businesses meet both their legal and customer obligations are challenges that Martin Hosken, Field CTO, Cloud Providers at Broadcom and Laurent Blin, Global Product Marketing Manager at OVHcloud, tackle in IT Pro\u2019s podcast \u201cKeeping data safe and flexible with sovereign cloud\u201d. They discuss the rising demand for sovereign clouds and how businesses can embrace the cloud without compromising on their data sovereignty obligations.\n\nA unified approach critical for European competitiveness\n\nOne of the most basic challenges facing sovereign cloud is the lack of a shared definition of \u201csovereign cloud\u201d across the industry. This is in part because governments and private sector groups need sovereign solutions for different reasons. Many governments \u2013 such as the EU, Singapore and Canada among others \u2013 want in-country solutions for the sake of national security. Certain organisations seek out sovereign cloud for the control it provides over their movement of data.\n\nAddressing this challenge forms the basis of new research on the state of sovereign cloud in Europe, authored by Johan David Michels of Queen Mary University of London. The report, titled \u2018Sovereign Cloud for Europe\u2019, and produced with support from Broadcom, unpacks growing opportunities for European CSPs in this complex environment.\n\nTo address the range of demands, and offer a true sovereign cloud product, Broadcom partners with local cloud services providers (CSPs) in each market, meaning the data is always processed and stored in-country.\n\nThis focus on locally-enabled cloud infrastructure is important in building a technology stack that gives European organisations the confidence to pursue innovative solutions in AI and computing in a secure, sovereign environment. By providing solutions that meet the specific European needs, whether they prefer to operate on-premise or in the cloud, Broadcom is enabling partners to grow, compete and navigate an increasingly digital and data-driven landscape.\n\nRead more about Sovereign Cloud from Broadcom.",

An investment of $1,000 made in mid-March 2020 would have grown into a holding worth more than $8,300 thanks to robust demand for the company's chips, which are deployed in a host of applications ranging from smartphones to data centers to cloud computing to broadband to storage, among others.\n\nThe chip designer's returns in the last five years have easily outpaced the 112% gains clocked by the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index. The good part is that Broadcom seems well-placed to outperform over the next five years as well. That's because the company now has a new catalyst that has the potential to add several billion dollars to its top line.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAI is supercharging Broadcom's growth\n\nBroadcom designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are custom chips used for performing specific tasks. That contrasts with central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), which are general-purpose in nature.\n\nDemand for ASICs has increased remarkably because of the growing use of AI software. Cloud computing giants have been using more of the custom chips designed by Broadcom to train and deploy AI models in the cloud because of the cost-efficient nature of these chips. As ASICs are designed to tackle specific workloads, they can deliver faster performance on those tasks than GPUs while consuming less energy.\n\nAs a result, Broadcom's AI revenue in fiscal 2024 jumped by more than 300% from the prior year to $12.2 billion. Its AI revenue is on track to grow at a remarkable pace in its current fiscal year as well.\n\nThe chipmaker witnessed a 77% year-over-year increase in its AI revenue in its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended on Feb. 2) to $4.1 billion. Management is forecasting a sequential jump in its AI revenue in the current quarter as its \"hyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.\"\n\nImportantly, Broadcom is scratching the surface of a massive end-market opportunity in data centers. The company is forecasting that the serviceable addressable market (SAM) for its AI chips will grow to between $60 billion and $90 billion over the next three fiscal years -- and that range doesn't include the four additional customers that are working now with Broadcom to develop custom AI processors. As CEO Hock Tan said on the company's recent earnings conference call:\n\nSo, even as we have three hyperscale customers, we are shipping XPUs in volume today, there are now four more who are deeply engaged with us to create their own accelerators. And to be clear, of course, these four are not included in our estimated SAM of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027.\n\nWhat this means is that Broadcom's actual revenue opportunity in AI chips could be much larger. As such, it won't be surprising to see Broadcom's AI revenue multiplying significantly over the next five years.\n\nAssuming that Broadcom's serviceable opportunity in AI chips jumps to $90 billion after five years (instead of three years) after accounting for the additional customers that it is bringing on board, and further assuming that it takes even half of this market, its AI revenue five years from now could be about $45 billion. That would be almost four times its fiscal 2024 AI revenue.\n\nHowever, Broadcom reportedly controls 70% of the custom AI chip market, according to various third-party estimates. The pace at which the company is adding new customers for its AI processors indicates that it could indeed maintain its dominant share for the next five years. If that's the case, Broadcom's AI revenue alone could exceed $60 billion annually in 2030 (based on the $90 billion SAM estimate). That would be about five times as much as last year.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nThe fact that Broadcom's top line could grow at an incredible pace thanks to its massive AI-related opportunity explains why analysts are upbeat about the company's bottom-line growth prospects as well. Broadcom's earnings are expected to grow by 36% in the current fiscal year to $6.62 per share, followed by healthy double-digit percentage growth over the next couple of years.\n\nAssuming that the company manages to maintain an annual earnings growth rate of even 20% in fiscal 2028 and 2029, its bottom line could hit $13.13 per share after five years. Broadcom is currently trading at 30 times forward earnings, which isn't all that expensive when compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 29.\n\nIf Broadcom is still trading at that earnings multiple after five years, based on this premise, its stock price would have more than doubled to $394. However, investors shouldn't rule out even healthier gains, as the market may reward Broadcom with a premium valuation for its AI-driven growth.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Broadcom Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Broadcom Inc. rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

            "content": "Broadcom Inc ( AVGO , Financial ) is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom's technology is everywhere, whether it's the hyperscalers such as Amazon ( AMZN , Financial ) and Alphabet ( GOOG , Financial ) training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications.\n\nBut the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors.\n\nDespite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors.\n\nThe question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out.\n\nBroadcom beats estimates with strong revenue and FCF momentum\n\nBroadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates.\n\nThe 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms ( META , Financial ), and Apple ( AAPL , Financial ) are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it.\n\nStrong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders.\n\nSince Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead.\n\nOutlook for another strong quarter\n\nQ2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon.\n\nAnd with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution.\n\nFinally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins.\n\nBroadcom's bold investments and key partnerships\n\nBroadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that.\n\nThe company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry.\n\nStrategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's (MSFT, Financial) Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure.\n\nSolid growth outlook supports valuation\n\nBroadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth.\n\nInvestors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software.\n\nSource: Broadcom's Earnings Summary (Seeking Alpha)\n\nLooking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive.\n\nPremium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case.\n\nA deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67.\n\nThe bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate.\n\nBroadcom's future from here\n\nWith a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times.\n\nIn the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years.\n\nSource: Broadcom's Earnings Estimates (Seeking Alpha)\n\nBullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term.\n\nAnd if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case.\n\nSource: Author Generated\n\nBroadcom's insider selling and institutional interest\n\nBroadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag.\n\nIn addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release.\n\nFurthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success.\n\nInstitutional investors are stepping in:Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach.\n\nWhile some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels.\n\nOne of the standout among them is Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) (Trades, Portfolio) , the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares . Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way.\n\nBalancing debt repayment with growth potential:Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage.\n\nThat said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry.\n\nRisks to my thesis\n\nBroadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook.\n\nThe biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years.\n\nAnother concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum.\n\nYour takeaway\n\nBroadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified.\n\nInsider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.",

            "content": "Chip giant Broadcom NASDAQ: AVGO recently posted quarterly results that have many arguing that the AI party isn\u2019t over. The market reaction to the company\u2019s results stood in stark contrast to that of its rival, Marvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL. Marvell released its Q4 2024 earnings on Mar. 5. Afterward, shares plummeted, losing nearly 20% of their value.\n\nBroadcom Today AVGO Broadcom $189.28 -1.26 (-0.66%) 52-Week Range $119.76 \u25bc $251.88 Dividend Yield 1.25% P/E Ratio 154.37 Price Target $231.48 Add to Watchlist\n\nThis was a bit of a shockwave that sent fears through those bullish on the AI revolution. Demonstrating the similarities in their business, Marvell\u2019s results also dragged down Broadcom shares by 6%.\n\nGet Broadcom alerts: Sign Up\n\nBroadcom\u2019s earnings just one day later elicited a much more positive reaction. Shares popped over 8%, assuaging some of the concerns brought on by Marvell.\n\nWhat explains these drastically different results, and why is Broadcom still a strong AI investment? This analysis will compare both companies' results and highlight key management insights.\n\nEarnings Comparison: Broadcom Beating Expectations and Growing Its Pipeline\n\nFor Marvell, its earnings were by no means bad. The company very slightly beat estimates on revenues, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and next quarter guidance for both figures. However, Broadcom shined in comparison. The company beat estimates on revenue and adjusted EPS by over 2% and 6%, respectively. Its revenue guidance for next quarter was $190 million higher than forecasted, a beat of over 1%. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) guidance came in higher than expected by a similar dollar figure. It was 2% higher than forecasted.\n\nOverall, these figures might not seem like massive beats, but they were enough to get markets excited enough to increase the company\u2019s valuation substantially. Many strongly performing tech stocks have needed to significantly beat estimates and raise guidance to keep shares from falling. This was particularly true for Broadcom and Marvell this quarter. Markets hoped recent announcements of hyperscaler firms investing hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure would lead to significant guidance beats.\n\nBroadcom may be the company that is capitalizing on this hope. Aside from the beat and raise, it provided interesting commentary that excited investors. Management mentioned that it is working with two new hyperscaler customers to make custom AI accelerator chips, in addition to two other hyperscalers that it previously revealed it is working with. This was a particularly encouraging sign, showing that Broadcom is continuing to grow its pipeline of deals. Marvell did not provide similar commentary. Overall, investors should view this as a strong sign for Broadcom's future.\n\nVMware: Broadcom\u2019s Ace Up Its Sleeve\n\nOne big advantage Broadcom has over Marvell in terms of investing in AI is its software. The company\u2019s acquisition of VMware has been extremely successful. Broadcom has massively decreased its headcount at VMware and shifted many customers to a recurring subscription model as opposed to lifetime licenses.\n\nBroadcom MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 96th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 22.9% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -1.45 News Sentiment 1.27 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 18.59% See Full Analysis\n\nAdditionally, the company is improving VMware's previous products and expanding the capabilities of VMware's key product, vSphere. vSphere is virtualization software that allows a server to split its computing resources across multiple workloads. Without virtualization software, a server would often go underutilized, as one workload would not be enough to use all of its power.\n\nVMware has expanded this concept to the entire data center through VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). It is also catering to large AI adopters with VMware Private AI Foundation. It adds virtualization for NVIDIA\u2019s NASDAQ: NVDA graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows for the virtualization of AI workloads.\n\nOverall, this provides a highly valuable product for large enterprises that want to run AI workloads in their private data centers. This is as opposed to running them on a public cloud like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT Azure. This private cloud method is ideal for ensuring data security. These changes have allowed Broadcom to increase VMware margins massively while impressively growing revenue. VMWare gives Broadcom two big ways to benefit from the proliferation of AI: hardware and software. For Marvell, hardware is really holding the torch.\n\nAVGO: Still a Solid Way to Play AI\n\nBroadcom looks poised to continue its impressive success in the AI investing landscape. The company\u2019s strong-growing AI semiconductor and infrastructure software segments provide it with two revenue sources with significant AI tailwinds. Additionally, the company\u2019s margins should continue to increase as software becomes a larger part of the firm\u2019s business.\n\nBefore you consider Broadcom, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Broadcom wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Broadcom currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top trending stocks now.\n\nThe volatile tariff policies of the new US administration and a slowdown in AI-related enthusiasm took a toll on the market over the past few weeks. However, some analysts believe a rebound is due.\n\nFundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the US stock market will begin to recover starting April 2. Here is how Lee explained the reasons behind his positive outlook:\n\n\u201cWhen markets fall this quickly from a 52-week high, just remember less than a month ago we were at all-time highs. That is a market pricing in a crisis. I\u2019d say almost 50% pricing in a recession, and we\u2019re assuming there\u2019s no Fed put now. The Fed is in a position to cut rates that really should mitigate the downside. I do think two other things that investors have to keep in mind, because many people just want to get out until April 2nd, is number one, I do think there\u2019s a very high probability that a tariff solution happens before the next three weeks happens. It\u2019s simple to see because China, Europe, Canada, Mexico since April 18th\u2014all of those countries have outperformed the US. I don\u2019t think that markets are that blind to say if Canada and Mexico are about to have a recession, they should outperform the US. The second thing people should keep in mind is that when you have a global crisis brewing\u2014and we highlighted like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014that was a 12-day crisis, but the markets bottomed seven days into the crisis, five days before that crisis ended, the market had already recovered two-thirds of the losses.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks notable Wall Street analysts were discussing recently.

(AVGO) has become a leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software through AI-driven expansion and acquisitions.\n\nOn the basis of rising revenues tied to AI, healthy margins, and aggressive cash generation, Broadcom presents a compelling investment case to investors. Broadcom's long-term thesis is based on being positioned to capitalize on the AI wave, expansion of software offerings into enterprises, and competitive strength in networking solutions. The $61 billion VMware acquisition is a transition to a software-led model of expansion that will drive revenue predictability and profitability.\n\nBroadcom's ability to capitalize on the wave of AI is a distinguishing factor that separates it from legacy semiconductor players. While other industry players have their eyes on developing direct AI chips, Broadcom provides connectivity solutions that make operations hassle-free through the help of AI. But even with positive fundamentals, valuation is a concern with it being at a premium. The investors will have to weigh Broadcom's competitive advantage against implementation risks to place their bet on the company's shares.\n\nBusiness Summary: Semiconductors & Software Infrastructure Colossus\n\nBroadcom's business is divided into two primary segments : semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor business involves networking, broadband, wireless, and AI accelerators, while infrastructure software business involves mainframe, cybersecurity, and cloud solutions.\n\nRevenues derived through AI increased 77% YoY to $4.1 billion in Q1 2025 due to hyperscalers ramping up spending on AI XPU and connectivity. The infrastructure software business achieved a still more impressive 47% YoY increase due to adoption by enterprises and VMware integration into Broadcom's ecosystem. Such aggressive revenue expansion in software offsets Broadcom's high-margin semiconductor business model and allows it to ride out industry cyclicality over time.\n\nBroadcom's VMware acquisition secures its cloud and virtualization position while raising concern over risks of implementation. The acquisition will help Broadcom boost its base of recurring revenue by reducing dependency on cyclic semiconductor demand. Broadcom's strategy around AI is to provide connectivity solutions, AI interconnects, and merchant AI accelerators (XPUs) to hyperscale cloud providers.\n\nAs more complex data center infrastructure is needed to handle AI workloads, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends driving demand for high-speed connectivity solutions and network AI based on Ethernet. The company's technology lead around AI interconnects will be key to driving long-term growth.\n\nBroadcom is no longer merely a semiconductor company. Its expansion into software, particularly with VMware, offsets revenue volatility that follows chip demand cycles. However, software integration issues can mute synergistic hopes and slow revenue expansion.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The War Heats Up\n\nThe competitive scenario in the semiconductor and software space is transforming at a very rapid rate with AI-powered infrastructure at their core. Broadcom is competing with semiconductor and software companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Cisco (CSCO).\n\nNvidia is way ahead in AI GPUs with their CUDA platform and deep learning. Broadcom's AI networking and connectivity products remain essential to hyperscalers constructing AI infrastructure. Unlike Nvidia and AMD's focus on compute-centric capabilities in AI, Broadcom's focus remains on high-speed interconnects and merchant AI accelerators that allow it to scale up AI workloads.\n\nEven with such advantages, price pressure will still exist. As hardware margins narrow, Broadcom's pricing power on AI connectivity will be questioned. Furthermore, AMD and Intel continue to expand their AI-focused offerings with additional competition to the broader data center ecosystem. Another risk is that cloud providers design their own customized silicon internally, making Broadcom solutions increasingly dependent over time.\n\nBroadcom's rich IP portfolio with ~21,000 patents and close customer relationship with hyperscalers do provide a competitive moat that cannot be easily replicated. The transition to Ethernet-based networking in AI provides a significant opportunity for Broadcom to gain more market share, particularly as Ethernet-based solutions scale cost-effectively in AI data centers.\n\nBroadcom's role in network AI remains significant but can no longer be taken for granted with Nvidia's threat to move into this space. The battle to control AI infrastructure is heating up, and Broadcom will have to continue to innovate and build good customer relationships. If it can defend its market share while building up its presence in AI connectivity, it will remain a dominant player in the space. But if competitors erode its pricing power or cloud providers build stand-alone solutions, Broadcom's growth will be stifled.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Triple-Threat Growth: How AI, Cloud, and VMware Are Powering Record-Breaking Financials\n\nBroadcom's revenue expansion is driven by three key drivers: VMware integration, enterprise cloud adoption, and growth in AI infrastructure.\n\nFinancials continue to be record-breaking at Broadcom. Q1 2025 revenue was $14.9 billion, up 25% year over year . Adjusted EBITDA was $10.1 billion with a margin of 68%. Free cash flow was $6.0 billion at 40% of revenue and up 28% year over year. The numbers reflect Broadcom's ability to generate high operating leverage as it increases sales of products and software solutions related to AI.\n\nBroadcom has grown revenue every year over the past five fiscal years to $51.6 billion in FY2024 from $23.9 billion in FY2020. The rise is a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21%, indicating that the company has successfully expanded into high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and cloud software. FY2024 was especially notable with a boost coming through increased adoption of AI-related technologies and seamless integration of acquisitions such as VMware.\n\nThe consistent increase in revenues is a reflection of Broadcom's efficient market penetration and diversification in semiconductor and software sectors. Broadcom has effectively developed resilience against market volatility by diversifying its portfolio and reducing dependency on cyclic hardware markets. Plain and simple, Broadcom's steady and increasing revenue growth indicates a well-run company that can effectively capitalize on industry trends.\n\nBroadcom's gross margin expansion over recent years demonstrates its cost management efficiency and pricing strength in markets. From a non-GAAP gross margin of 73.5% in FY2020 to 76.5% in FY2024 , it increased this level. The expansion can be largely attributed to a shift to higher-margin software products and high-margin AI-driven solutions, reflecting a concern with profitability as well as revenue growth.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has also registered impressive growth to reach close to $31.9 billion in FY2024 from $13.6 billion in FY2020. Such a steep increase is a clear indication of Broadcom's high operational efficiency and scalability as it takes advantage of high-margin business segments and efficient cost management strategies.\n\nCost efficiency is a feature of Broadcom's business model. It incurred $9.3 billion in R&D spending in FY2024 to continue innovating while limiting capital spending to a paltry $100 million in Q1 to showcase asset-light operating efficiency. Broadcom's focus on software-driven and AI revenue streams enables it to maintain high adjusted EBITDA margins to justify business model scalability. The fact that it is able to sustain healthy profitability while accumulating a portfolio of AI infrastructure illustrates that it is positioned to be a high-growth, high-margin business.\n\nUltimately, Broadcom's financial well-being is based on its ability to generate plenty of free cash flow while still spending aggressively on R&D. As long as it continues to invest successfully in high-growth AI and software areas, profitability will continue to be healthy. Integration challenges with VMware and competition in AI networking remain top risks that can hinder continued margin expansion.\n\nAI Boom: How Strategic Innovation Turned a Niche Bet into a Powerhouse\n\nBroadcom's AI business has become a rapid growth driver generating $12.2 billion in FY2024 . Starting at less than 5% of revenue in 2019, Broadcom has strategically built up its AI infrastructure capabilities through leading PCIe Retimer technologies. Broadcom offers differentiated advantages with proprietary 5nm silicon solutions such as 35% lower power consumption and 40% longer reach compared to competitors using third-party solutions. This technology advantage provides significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness in AI data centers.\n\nStrategically, Broadcom's positioning within the space of AI is to prioritize high-performance networking and interconnectivity rather than competing head-to-head in Nvidia and AMD's dense compute space. Its revenue trajectory in AI emphasizes a well-executed strategy to capitalize on hyperscale expansion in the data center space, with scalability and efficiency being at the forefront. Its niche focus with heavy R&D investment and industry-leading technology positions Broadcom to continue healthy growth in the high-growth space of AI infrastructure .\n\nAVGO\u2019s Pricey AI Bet: Is Its Premium Valuation Justified?\n\nEven with its strong growth, Broadcom's valuation continues to be a concern to investors. The company's current valuation at higher-than-peer multiples is evident in a forward EV/EBITDA of 22.8x against a sector median of 13.7x, a 66% premium. Similarly, its forward P/E multiple of 28.7x against a sector median of 21.5x suggests that investors are pricing in high levels of expansion in AI. However, looking at a PEG ratio of 1.31x against a sector median of 1.67x, it seems that expansion in AI is not yet fully priced into shares and that upside is present.\n\nBroadcom is a fascinating AI-oriented investment with healthy financials, a lead position in AI networking, and rising software revenues. It is not risk-free, however. It is priced at a premium, so subsequent growth will have to be perfect to justify it. The investor will have to take a long-term position with Broadcom with short-term volatility in mind while understanding that it can dominate AI infrastructure markets. The company's size, diversified revenues, and high free cash flows make it a good institutional portfolio allocation.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nBroadcom\u2019s AI-driven growth, record-breaking revenues, and software expansion position it as a dominant force in AI infrastructure. With AI revenue surge and a strong cash flow engine, its future looks promising. However, its premium valuation requires flawless execution, making it a high-reward but carefully calculated investment.\n\n\n\n",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top stocks everyone is talking about.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks amid the latest selloff as they keep up with President Donald Trump\u2019s volatile tariff policies and assess the slowing enthusiasm in the AI trade. Trivariate\u2019s Adam Parker said in a latest program on CNBC that while he wants to be bullish on the stocks for a rebound, he believes we haven\u2019t seen the bottom yet. The analyst recommends going on the defense:\n\n\u201cI mean every part of me wants to get bullish again, right? You know, we had the good call of saying the market will be down in the first half and choppy with concerns about tariffs and all that. And you know, now we\u2019ve seen a lot of people who were bullish before throwing in the towel and getting bearish, and I really want to do it, right? But I can\u2019t. And the reason is because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen enough of a blowoff on the positioning. I mean, if you look at the companies that were talking at big conferences in March, a lot of things are slowing. And so I think this is more than a growth scare already\u2014this is actually like a growth slowdown. And so the question is, will we get negative guidance in April? Will we see companies guide down and the stocks not go down? If I see that behavior, then I\u2019ll probably want to get more risk on. But until then, I think we have to play a little bit more defense.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street analysts are showing interest in.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Investors: 128\n\nSteven Dickens from HyperFRAME Research explained in a latest program on Schwab Network why he is bullish on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see some of the macro trends play out here. Obviously, the VIX is up, there\u2019s a lot of volatility, and people are worried about some of the tariffs and some of the posture. But I think what I track from a Broadcom perspective is: are they exposed to the right markets, have they got that product innovation cycle rolling, and are they executing? I think on all three of those, I give them a 10 out of 10. This company\u2019s firing on all cylinders. Hock Tan is certainly starting to step up to be one of what I describe as the mag 8, we are gonna see this company continue to grow.\u201d\n\nBroadcom threw it out of the park with its latest quarterly results. The most important part of the report? The company expects strong AI semiconductor sales growth to continue. It sees AI semiconductor revenue of about $4.4 billion in fiscal Q2, which would be a 42% year-over-year growth. Broadcom reported $6 billion in free cash flow for the quarter. Its software business gross margin came in at about 90%. But what\u2019s Broadcom\u2019s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.\n\nColumbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBroadcom Inc.

That doesn't mean there aren't other contenders for the throne.\n\nTwo large companies vying to make inroads into the AI infrastructure market and steal some Nvlidia thunder are Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Let's look at which of these two AI contenders is the better stock to own.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe AI infrastructure market\n\nAMD and Broadcom are taking different approaches to the AI infrastructure market in a bid to take some market share away from Nvidia. Both have been seeing strong growth coming from AI.\n\nAMD holds the No. 2 spot in producing graphics processing units (GPUs) behind Nvidia. These chips have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their powerful processing speeds that can handle AI workloads. However, with about a 10% to 17% market share in the GPU space, it greatly trails Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the market.\n\nAMD's biggest issue has been its inferior software platform compared to Nvidia. The company didn't develop its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software until around 2016, a decade after Nvidia created its CUDA platform. Meanwhile, semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis found its GPUs to generally be unusable for AI training out of the box due to software incompatibilities.\n\nAMD's GPUs have been used more for AI inference, as well as as an alternative to Nvidia chips when they aren't available. AMD has found a strong niche in the central processing unit (CPU) data center market, where it has been taking more market share. While GPUs provide the power, CPUs act more as the brains of the operation. It's not as big of a market, but it's still an important one that is growing quickly along with the AI infrastructure market.\n\nBroadcom, on the other hand, doesn't make GPUs or CPUs. Instead, it has been attacking the AI infrastructure market by helping customers develop custom AI chips called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). While these custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs and take more time and money to develop, they outperform GPUs for the specific tasks for which they are designed and they consume less power.\n\nThe company also participates in the networking side of AI infrastructure where it makes components such as Ethernet switches and network interface cards (NICs). These components are integral in managing the flow of data and distributing AI workloads across servers.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's biggest opportunity is in the custom AI chip market. The company currently has seven AI chip customers at various stages of development. For the three farthest along in that development, it predicts that it will have a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2026 (ending October 2026) alone, as these customer look to build AI chip clusters consisting of 1 million AI chips. While Broadcom won't get all of that business (some will likely continue to go to Nvidia), it is a big opportunity. Meanwhile, its newer customers should help drive revenue growth in later years.\n\nAMD grew its data center revenue by 69% last quarter to $3.9 billion, while Broadcom increased its AI-related revenue by 77% to $4.1 billion. That's pretty similar, although Broadcom appears to have the larger AI opportunity moving forward. Broadcom has a number of custom AI chip customers ramping up the next few years that should help propel growth, while AMD will have to continue to try and chip away at Nvidia in the GPU market.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nAMD is the cheaper of the two stocks. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 22 based on this year's analyst estimates compared to 28.6 times for Broadcom.\n\nMeanwhile, both companies grew their overall revenue at a similar rate last quarter, with AMD revenue rising 24% year over year and Broadcom revenue jumping 25%. However, I do think Broadcom has the bigger opportunity in front of it with custom AI chips.\n\nI think both stocks are solid options following the recent market sell-off.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks that were highlighted in that article.\n\nThe volatile tariff policies of the new US administration and a slowdown in AI-related enthusiasm took a toll on the market over the past few weeks. However, some analysts believe a rebound is due.\n\nFundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the US stock market will begin to recover starting April 2. Here is how Lee explained the reasons behind his positive outlook:\n\n\"When markets fall this quickly from a 52-week high, just remember less than a month ago we were at all-time highs. That is a market pricing in a crisis. I'd say almost 50% pricing in a recession, and we're assuming there's no Fed put now. The Fed is in a position to cut rates that really should mitigate the downside. I do think two other things that investors have to keep in mind, because many people just want to get out until April 2nd, is number one, I do think there's a very high probability that a tariff solution happens before the next three weeks happens. It's simple to see because China, Europe, Canada, Mexico since April 18th\u2014all of those countries have outperformed the US. I don't think that markets are that blind to say if Canada and Mexico are about to have a recession, they should outperform the US. The second thing people should keep in mind is that when you have a global crisis brewing\u2014and we highlighted like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014that was a 12-day crisis, but the markets bottomed seven days into the crisis, five days before that crisis ended, the market had already recovered two-thirds of the losses.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks notable Wall Street analysts were discussing recently.

Despite the recent geopolitical tensions, including the introduction of pumped-up trade tariffs between China and the U.S., Broadcom is expected to be one of a number of foreign firms making the trip, as are reportedly peers Synopsys (SNPS) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Some, Reuters reported, will even be given the chance to meet President Xi on their travels.\n\nThe forum traditionally sets out Chinese economic development plans and aims for the months ahead and tries to secure co-operation and investment from foreign enterprises to help it achieve its goals.\n\nBeijing is eager to attract more foreign investment to revive what it sees, at least, as an ailing domestic economy. That\u2019s despite growth, of around 5%, that most Western countries would snap a hand or two off for. China wants to boost domestic consumption such as consumer goods and is also keen on further developing its technological capabilities, particularly in the area of AI. According to Reuters, foreign investment into China fell just over 13% last year.\n\nLow-Key Americans\n\nIt has recently had a renewed love-in with the private sector after a number of years when it was left out in the cold. That means tech companies such as Alibaba (BABA) being promised more support in the months ahead to compete with the U.S.\n\nOther major companies also reported to be attending the event include drugs giant AstraZeneca (AZN), mining behemoth Rio Tinto (RIO), Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Indeed, Reuters pointed out that this year a higher proportion of European CEOs and a smaller number of U.S. peers will be attending. That is likely down to those increased political and economic tensions.\n\n\u201cAny trip to China by American CEOs would be very low-key given the current heightened scrutiny on American investment in China from Washington,\u201d a Reuters source said.\n\nInvestors weren\u2019t impressed with AVGO down nearly 3% in pre-market trading.\n\nIs AVGO a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nOn TipRanks, AVGO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 22 Buy and 2 Hold ratings.

Strong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth.\n\nBroadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom\u2019s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best data center stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nData centers have become the foundation of the digital economy, facilitating the storage, processing, and distribution of vast amounts of data that drive industries worldwide. According to McKinsey & Company, the global data center market is set for significant expansion through 2030, fueled by enterprise digital transformation and hyperscale cloud growth. Their analysis projects that global demand for data center capacity could grow annually by 19% to 22% between 2023 and 2030, ultimately reaching between 171 and 219 gigawatts (GW) of annual capacity (compared to 60 GW currently). As per McKinsey, at least double the data center capacity built since 2000 would have to be built in less than one-fourth of the time, to avoid a capacity shortfall.\n\nAt the start of the year, investor sentiment toward data centers soared following the high-profile announcement of Project Stargate, a landmark $500 billion initiative aimed at revolutionizing data center infrastructure. However, enthusiasm has tempered later in the first quarter as discussions have emerged over potential repealing of the CHIPS Act. This legislation was originally designed to strengthen U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, and it has played a key role in reshaping domestic production capabilities. The ongoing debate over its future has introduced uncertainty into the market, influencing investor outlooks.\n\nAmid these discussions, a February 2025 PwC report underscores the strategic importance of expanding data center infrastructure\u2014not only for technological advancement but also for geopolitical stability. Nations are increasingly wary of relying on critical infrastructure in high-risk regions. Geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions continue to expose vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to implement contingency strategies. PwC further adds that expanding into new markets introduces additional challenges, including strict security and data privacy regulations, particularly in non-U.S. jurisdictions with stringent compliance frameworks. As a result, data center operators must carefully balance regulatory requirements, infrastructure investments, and market demand while navigating an evolving global landscape.\n\nIn a March 10 interview with CNBC, Charlie Sanchez, President of Infrastructure Advisory at Black & Veatch, discussed the ongoing surge in AI-driven infrastructure investment, particularly within data centers. He emphasized that despite trade tariffs, the commitment to data center development remains robust, both in the U.S. and globally. Companies recognize AI\u2019s potential to optimize supply chains, enhance energy efficiency, and unlock new value streams. Sanchez also highlighted that AI not only drives demand for infrastructure but also serves as a key enabler for future efficiencies. Moreover, advancements in AI and processing power are already being incorporated into the design of next-generation data centers, reinforcing the necessity for continued development and investment in the sector.",

            "content": "This dilemma of whether to absorb the Broadcom price hikes or embark on the arduous and risky journey of untangling from the VMware ecosystem is triggering a broader C-level conversation around virtualization strategy.\n\n\u201cFor enterprises navigating this uncertainly, the challenge isn\u2019t just finding a replacement for VMware. IT shops of all sizes see Broadcom\u2019s actions as an opportunity to rethink their approach to virtualization, cloud strategy and IT modernization,\u201d says Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND Research.\n\nElliot says that server virtualization has been taken for granted for a long time, and the Broadcom-driven wake-up call is forcing organizations to reevaluate their virtualization strategies at the board level. \u201cThat kind of strategic conversation hasn\u2019t happened for years. Customers are saying, \u2018What can we do as this platform emerges from VMware. How do we think about this relative to our multi-cloud strategy and private cloud and the efficiencies we can gain? Let\u2019s talk about risk reduction. Let\u2019s talk about platform strategy.\u2019 This is an opportunity to identify business value. It\u2019s triggering this plethora of swim lanes.\u201d\n\nCheck the waters before diving in\n\nWhile there are multiple alternatives to the VMware platform, none of them are as good from a feature perspective, and there\u2019s a risk associated with moving off a tried-and-true platform.\n\nIn estimating the cost of a large-scale VMware migration, Gartner cautions: \u201cVMware\u2019s server virtualization platform has become the point of integration for its customers across server, storage and network infrastructure in the data center. Equally, it is a focus of IT operational duties including workload provisioning, backup and disaster recovery. Migrating from VMware\u2019s server virtualization platform would require untangling many aspects of these investments.\u201d\n\nIt would take a midsize enterprise at least two years to untangle much of its dependency upon VMware, and it could take a large enterprise up to four years. Even then, the cost associated with planning and executing the migration might eat up any savings associated with lower licensing costs and might introduce additional risk, says Gartner.",

This development, reported by The Information, introduces a potential rival into Broadcom\u2019s previously exclusive domain, though Google has not severed ties with Broadcom entirely\u2014discussions persist to maintain some level of collaboration on TPU chip design. The shift stems partly from pricing disputes, with MediaTek offering lower costs per chip while leveraging its robust ties with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), the foundry responsible for TPU production, making it an attractive alternative for Google as it seeks to optimize its supply chain.\n\nGoogle\u2019s TPUs are a cornerstone of its expansive AI ecosystem, driving critical operations from internal research to cloud computing and powering consumer-facing services like Google Search, YouTube, and the Gemini AI models. The company\u2019s investment in these chips is substantial, with spending estimated between $6 billion and $9 billion last year, underscoring their strategic importance. Yet, Google\u2019s ambitions extend beyond its current partnerships, as it reportedly aims to bolster its in-house AI chip development, though it will continue relying on external players like Broadcom and MediaTek for production, packaging, and quality assurance. This dual approach highlights Google\u2019s balancing act\u2014maintaining flexibility with suppliers while pushing toward greater self-sufficiency in a competitive AI landscape.\n\nThe broader context reveals Google\u2019s significant footprint in the semiconductor space, evidenced by its $10 billion order of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) cutting-edge Blackwell chips, positioning it as one of Nvidia\u2019s top clients despite the pivot toward MediaTek. Broadcom, a key player in custom silicon, now faces the prospect of sharing the lucrative TPU business, a shift that could reshape its relationship with Google and impact its market positioning. While the stock\u2019s decline reflects immediate investor concerns, the ongoing talks with Google suggest Broadcom retains a foothold, albeit in a more contested arena. As Google navigates cost pressures and supply chain dynamics, its evolving partnerships with MediaTek and Broadcom signal a pragmatic strategy to sustain its AI position amid rising competition and technological complexity.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Today\u2019s modern forces that command the most complete situational awareness of the battlefield at the tactical edge almost always win the day.\n\nTremendous tactical advantages can be gained from a form of edge computing that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) software applications running on devices that are lightweight, small in size, and consume as little power as possible. Such devices can be carried easily by an individual in battle, and even discarded or destroyed if circumstances demand.\n\nAI as Game Changer\n\nYou have probably heard the phrase, \u201cAI is changing everything.\u201d That\u2019s proving increasingly true when it comes to military applications. In fact, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies have been used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for decades. For example, ML algorithms are essential to the rapid data acquisition and targeting command and control capabilities of the Aegis Combat System. But what\u2019s different now is a growing consensus that AI can be a foundational game changer like no other in modern military history. The question now is not whether AI, it\u2019s what kind of AI?\n\nPrivate AI, an architectural approach that brings AI models to data, offers a compelling case for the future for modern enterprises, including the DoD, because it meets the enhanced data security and privacy requirements that will be needed in the AI frameworks of the future. These essential elements to building a modern private cloud, such as enhanced encryption, are not part of any battlespace AI framework today.\n\n\n\nDecision Making in DDIL Environments\n\nBuilding and deploying a highly flexible, adaptive AI framework that leans in on features such as enhanced security, privacy, and data modeling is tailor-made for military applications. Such applications must also be highly collaborative. Joint-force advantage needs situational awareness across a battlespace that is nimble \u2014 not just for mission flexibility but for the battlespace coalition \u2014 and designed to integrate partnerships with other agencies and allied forces.\n\nIn conflict scenarios, the data must be collected and analyzed as close to local conditions as possible. It must enhance the overall situational awareness that the battlespace commander needs to make real-time decisions.\n\nBut make no mistake: this is a complex problem with its own set of challenges. For decades, U.S. military doctrine had essentially taken for granted that our military superiority would always allow networked weapons systems and troops to transmit collected data up the Chain of Command through battlefield and satellite communications systems. The experience of drone communications in Ukraine demonstrates the potential fallacies in that assumption. It is clear now that our adversaries have the technology to disrupt these communications.\n\nAn edge-based approach to data collection, communications, and analytics is required in denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments where cloud and other communications channels could be compromised or eliminated. Military organizations, including our own, no longer have the luxury of \u201cphoning home\u201d for instructions. These systems must now think for themselves in contested battlespace environments with the compute capacity that can be supplied at the edge.\n\nNational Security Demands Private AI Solutions\n\nA software-defined approach to private AI military applications brings the most advanced AI innovation and benefits of the commercial sector to our national defense. Chief among these benefits is that a software-defined approach embraces the open ecosystem of software and hardware vendors that are leading AI innovation today.\n\nIn a BRAVO Hackathon conducted in 2023 among joint all-domain forces and hosted by U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, one of the teams developed a private AI application that allows military forces to identify potential enemy objects in adverse cross-domain environments \u2014 under the sea or on land \u2014 while cut-off from any cloud-based communications and services.\n\nThe private AI model developed for this application demonstrates many of the benefits of private AI using a software-defined approach. It did not require a football field-sized server farm for its processing power. Its AI model was trained on the specific capabilities required for its mission. It integrated various off-the-shelf electronic components and commoditized the hardware needed. It brings with it minimal costs and enormous bang for the buck. And its dramatic tactical benefits demonstrate why the Special Operations community is a major driver inside the U.S. DoD for private AI and edge computing innovation.\n\nA software-defined approach to AI lessens the need to update expensive hardware when upgrading the AI software. That\u2019s a primary reason why a software-defined approach to private AI is the future of the enterprise, including the largest and most complex enterprise in the world, the U.S. DOD.\n\nOur national security demands private AI solutions. A smart marriage between software-defined, managed private AI systems running on top of secure hardware creates weapons systems that are more nimble, agile, and capable. It is at the tactical edge where such advantage-granting capabilities are most essential to our war fighters.\n\nLearn More About Private AI",

You have to go back all the way to Oct. 2023 to find the last time one of the major stock indexes fell more than 10% from its all-time high, marking what's known as a correction.\n\nSometimes those corrections are slow and gradual, as in 2023, and other times the losses come much more swiftly -- as they did recently. From Feb. 19 through Mar. 10, the Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 13%.\n\nThe sell-off was fueled by President Donald Trump's trade policies and fears that he would enact additional tariffs on Taiwan, a key supplier of chips used in AI data centers. As a result, some of the biggest movers were the artificial intelligence stocks that pushed the Nasdaq to new all-time highs in February.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) all saw huge drops in their stock prices. Combined, they lost $1.16 trillion in market cap during that period.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to pick up shares of all three companies at these lower prices, one of them stands out as an incredible value with a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe big fear driving AI stocks lower\n\nThere are numerous factors that have led to the drop in AI stocks over the last few weeks. Greater economic uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence as U.S. trade policies increase geopolitical tensions. If there's one thing markets hate, it's uncertainty.\n\nPerhaps the biggest uncertainty hitting chipmakers, though, is the potential for the Trump administration to enact new tariffs on Taiwan, home of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Nearly all of the biggest chipmakers, including Nvidia and Broadcom, rely on TSMC to produce and package their chips. The foundry, as chip manufacturers are called, attracts nearly two-thirds of all spending on chip fabrication.\n\nA tariff on Taiwan would substantially increase costs for Nvidia and Broadcom (and practically every other chipmaker). As a result, they'd have to increase their prices or take a hit to their profit margins (probably both).\n\nHigher prices also means they could see lower demand for their chips. While the big tech companies buying Nvidia and Broadcom chips have massive budgets, they don't have infinite money. And with increasing pressure on those companies to show meaningful returns on their investments, there's probably not much room in the budget to increase spending.\n\nThat lower demand works its way back to TSMC, which faces the challenge of substantial fixed costs. Lower utilization rates of its facilities means it could see a big drag on profitability if tariffs go into effect or demand declines for any other reason.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nIntel has delayed the opening of its first Ohio chip factory to 2030 or 2031, five or six years later than originally planned.\n\nOther companies, including TSMC and Qualcomm, have reportedly considered acquiring part or all of Intel.\n\nIndustry experts say Intel has fallen behind competitors in the chip market and needs to make significant strides to catch up.\n\nWhen Intel broke ground on its $28-billion factories in New Albany, the company planned to begin production of microchips in Ohio in 2025.\n\nBut following one delay after another and continued financial problems, Intel has delayed the completion and opening of its first chip factory to 2030 or 2031. A second fab is set to now open in 2032.\n\nThe delays mean the first factory won't open until at least five or six years after it was expected to be operational in 2025. On top of the latest delays, President Donald Trump has also called on Congress to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation that is helping to fund Intel's new Ohio One factories.\n\nWith all the headlines the chipmaker garnered the last few weeks, The Dispatch took questions from readers during an \"Ask Us Anything\" online townhall this week on Reddit.\n\nHere are the biggest questions readers had and what we know.\n\nHave other companies expressed interest in buying Intel?\n\nAt this point, it's anyone's guess whether it will be Intel eventually running the chip plants in New Albany or another company altogether.\n\nAs recently as this week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom about taking stakes in a joint venture to operate Intel's factories, Reuters reported. Under the proposal, TSMC would operate the factories.\n\nThe development was hardly the first report of other companies eyeing part or all of Intel's business.\n\nRead More: Is Intel in trouble? How struggling chipmaker's financial issues may impact Ohio factories\n\nAlong with TSMC, Broadcom was said to be looking at acquiring Intel's chip design and marketing business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also previously asked TSMC to consider taking a controlling interest in Intel. San Diego-based Qualcomm has also considered buying Intel.\n\nAnd rumors swirled a month or two ago about whether Elon Musk, the world's richest man and leader of Tesla and SpaceX might be interested in buying Intel. Musk is currently heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative to slash federal spending.\n\nWill CHIPS Act cash still materialize for Intel?\n\nIntel was one of several companies that stood to receive billions of dollars in federal funding from the bipartisan CHIPS Act signed into law by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBut, in a joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump called the CHIPS Act a \"horrible, horrible thing\" and suggested to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress do away with the law.\n\nIt's unclear whether Congress will act on Trump's request. But, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, has told The Dispatch he believes there is still bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and that it will likely remain in place.\n\nIntel has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nDan Tierney, spokesperson for Gov. Mike DeWine, said the governor's office will keep an eye on whether Congress takes action on the CHIPS Act. But, Tierney pointed out that Intel's leaders previously said they would have pursued the company's Ohio One plants even without federal funding.\n\nWill Ohio claw back any state funding for Intel's New Albany fabs?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the state of Ohio will try to claw back any of the funding it's awarded Intel for its chip factories.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Development has an agreement with the company, which states $300 million in grants were made available to help with the construction of each factory completed by the end of 2028. That money was paid out in September 2023, according to the state.\n\nPolicy experts on both sides of the aisle have called for accountability for Intel following its delays and the fallout from its financial problems.\n\nRead More: Intel already spent billions on delayed New Albany chip factory, new report reveals\n\nZach Schiller, research director at Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning think tank with offices in Columbus and Cleveland, said that the trouble with Intel is \"more than just noise.\" Officials should require Intel to annually report the number of jobs its Ohio plants have created along with other metrics such as capital invested, Schiller previously told The Dispatch.\n\nAt the same time, Greg Lawson, a researcher at the right-leaning think tank The Buckeye Institute said the state should enforce its agreement with Intel given how much money it put on the table.\n\n\"You need to have easily enforceable claw backs because what happens in 10 years? Is whoever is in the governor's mansion then really going to do that?\" Lawson said in February.\n\nWhat about the colleges and schools that already started preparing for Intel?\n\nSince Intel announced it was coming to Ohio, local colleges and school districts have begun retooling programs and training students to join the workforce the company will need when its factories open.\n\nIn 2022, Intel said it would give $17.7 million over three years to fund research and training at more than 80 Ohio colleges and universities.\n\nOne Columbus CEO Kenny McDonald said in February that he's not worried about how the latest delay will impact this research and training locally. He encouraged colleges to stay the course in preparation for the factories.\n\nWhen Intel's factories are fully up and running, the Ohio One site is expected to employ around 3,000 workers. As of Dec. 31, Intel's Ohio operation had 163 employees, including 156 who live in Ohio and 7 employees who don't live in the state, according to the chipmaker.\n\nDo industry experts think Intel itself can survive to 2030?\n\nDepending on what happens over the next five years, Intel could look a lot different in 2030 than it does today.\n\nIntel has fallen behind some of its closest competitors and it will take a lot for the chip maker to catch back up with them, experts have told The Dispatch.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., NVIDIA, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have all pulled ahead of Intel, which largely exited the smartphone market years ago, Brady Wang, an associate director at Counterpoint, a Hong Kong-based technology market research firm previously said.\n\nAt the same time, Intel also lags competitors in artificial intelligence \u2014a sector that's growing rapidly right now. Until Intel gains ground in AI, it will struggle to compete, both Wang Counterpoint senior analyst Jeongku Choi have said.\n\n\"Investing in leading edge fabs is a no-brainer to survive,\" Wang said. \"It\u2018s the only way to regain the confidence of their customers.\u201d\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

            "content": "With the Nasdaq Composite down more than 13% from all-time highs reached in late 2024, this market sell-off is creating some potentially nice long-term buying opportunities in the technology sector.\n\nLet's look at five growth stocks investors might want to consider scooping up during this dip.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 5.27%) is the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, where its graphic processing units (GPUs) help provide the processing power needed to train AI models and run inference. The company's growth has been spectacular, with its revenue more than doubling in both its fiscal years 2024 and 2025 (ended in January).\n\nAs long as AI infrastructure spending continues to grow, Nvidia is set to continue to be the biggest beneficiary. Currently, the best way to advance AI models is through more processing power. So, as the AI race continues, companies are committing more and more money to build out AI data centers.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, has created a wide moat in the GPU space through its CUDA software platform, helping it take about a 90% market share. The company got about a 10-year jump on the software side against its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and the CUDA moat is alive and well today, making Nvidia a great growth stock to buy.\n\nNvidia stock is trading down nearly 22% from all-time highs reached in early January, but it still has plenty of growth potential, and that makes its price even more of a bargain.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nWhile Nvidia owns the mass-merchant GPU market, Broadcom (AVGO 2.18%) is carving out a nice niche with custom AI chips. Given Nvidia's high prices, more companies are turning toward Broadcom to help develop customer AI chips that can be used in conjunction with GPUs. These custom chips take time to develop but tend to perform better and be more cost-effective when used for a very narrow set of tasks.\n\nBroadcom currently has three main AI chip customers, which it says combined have a serviceable addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion for its fiscal 2027. In addition, it has recently added four more newer customers, including Apple. While Broadcom won't capture all of this spending, with some inevitably going to Nvidia, it still is a big opportunity for the company.\n\nThe recent sell-off (the stock is down about 23% from all-time highs set in December 2024) lets investors get into the stock at a nice price.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.68%) (GOOG 1.75%) is the market leader in digital advertising through its Google search and YouTube streaming platforms. The company also operates the third-largest cloud computing business and is also a leader in the emerging fields of quantum computing and autonomous driving (Waymo).\n\nWhile some investors worry about the impact of AI on its search business, there has been no meaningful effect on its growth thus far. Meanwhile, the company's huge user base, long history of search data, and an extensive client list of advertisers give it a nice advantage. AI should become a good opportunity for the company, as it should be able to create new ad formats that can help monetize the AI Overviews it now generates. Traditionally, Google has only served ads on about 20% of its search results, so this could be a big new untapped market.\n\nIn addition, the company is seeing great growth with its cloud computing unit, which saw revenue climb 30% last quarter and segment income soar 142%. The company was the first to develop a custom chip with the help of Broadcom, giving it a nice cost advantage moving forward as it builds out its data center infrastructure to help meet soaring demand. The recent sell-off (the stock is down about 21% from highs set early last month) is a great time to get into the stock for the long term.\n\n4. Salesforce\n\nAs AI continues to develop, Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) is looking to become the leader in agentic AI, in which AI agents will perform tasks at a user's behest without the need for much supervision from humans. This has a lot of real-world applications for businesses because these agents could handle customer service issues or analyze market data to help optimize marketing campaigns.\n\nSalesforce leads the way in agentic AI with the launch of Agentforce, which includes several out-of-box AI agent solutions. Customers can also customize agents through the use of no-code and low-code tools built into the platform while placing guardrails on what the agents can and cannot do. Meanwhile, the company recently launched its AgentExchange marketplace with over 200 partners to expand its use cases.\n\nAgentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per interaction, so the opportunity for Salesforce is huge. Thus far, customers have been flocking to try the product, with the company gaining 5,000 Agentforce customers, including 3,000 paying, since its introduction in October. The recent drop in the stock's price (down nearly 26% since December 2024) opens up a nice opportunity to jump into the name.\n\n5. GitLab\n\nTrading off about 31% from early February highs, GitLab (GTLB 4.20%) is a fast-growing DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform that helps customers develop software while integrating cybersecurity throughout the process. This is a high-margin subscription business that is benefiting from AI.\n\nGrowth is being driven by customers upgrading to its higher-tier Ultimate platform, which now represents about half of its annual recurring revenue (ARR). Meanwhile, its Dedicated solution, which is only offered on the Ultimate platform, has also been gaining strong traction. Dedicated offers customers data isolation and regional data residency. In addition, its AI-powered GitLab Duo add-on offering, which helps programmers complete their assignments by offering coding suggestions and automation, has also been helping drive revenue.\n\nThis is helping GitLab both boost its number of new customers and grow within its existing customer base. Last quarter, it saw its number of enterprise customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more climb 29%, while its dollar-based net retention was a robust 123%. Numbers over 100% indicate that existing customers spent more with the company than the year before (including the impact of any churn). Overall, its revenue rose 29% last quarter, marking its sixth straight quarter of between 29% to 33% revenue growth.\n\nThe sell-off is a great opportunity to pick up this high-growth stock.",

Newly grandfathered into the program, I arrived at the recent Broadcom Americas partner event in Orlando, Florida not only to get useful knowledge and hands-on experience, but also to learn more about the Broadcom Knights program: What other certifications do I need to obtain? What does it mean to be a full-fledged Knight? Is that goal even achievable for our company or something we even wanted?\n\nThe event provided the answers to these questions and so much more, including valuable training about how these solutions are helping customers meet \u2013 and exceed \u2013 their business goals.\n\nHelping Broadcom Customers Fully Explore VMware Solution Benefits\n\nConscia is a leading provider of cybersecurity and networking solutions for mission-critical IT infrastructure for Enterprise customers. Conscia\u2019s experts design, implement, and run innovative, customized IT solutions across cybersecurity, networking, and hybrid cloud, supporting our customers throughout their technology lifecycles. Conscia serves large organizations.\n\nI am based in the Dutch office of Conscia, in the Netherlands. In addition to the Netherlands, we have offices in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Slovenia. Our Netherlands team works primarily with hospital organizations, where we often discover that a lot of their VMware solutions are not being utilized in a proper manner (or not at all), and, as a result, are turning into shelfware. The customers have already invested their money in the solutions, but are not using them to their full potential.\n\nOne of my top jobs is helping customers realize the full value of their VMware portfolio. So, I was very excited to attend the hands-on lab in Orlando for Holodeck Toolkit, a tool that enables users to set up multiple environments to test drive VMware solutions such as VMware NSX, VMware vSAN, VMware VCF, and vSphere Supervisor. Using this tool, we can simulate real-world scenarios, refine our technical skills, and provide compelling demonstrations to customers. If a customer wants to see how a product works, I can spin up a new test environment with a click of a button, demo the solution to the customer, and then easily scrap the test environment when the demo is over. Since I\u2019ve returned from Orlando, I\u2019ve actually started using Holodeck within our own company to make sure that our engineers can access this powerful test lab demo environment.\n\nAnother great session focused on the next version of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). There, we gained great insights to help customers, once VCF is available, make sure that they are using it the right way, and only renew the products that they need. In addition to participating in the hands-on training and knowledge sharing at the Orlando event, our team (there were three of us from Conscia) took \u2013 and passed \u2013 the remaining exams that needed to be a Broadcom Knight. In total, we went home with five additional certifications that we all achieved together. We also had a chance to meet both peers from around the world as well as our Broadcom colleagues, whose expertise and partner-enablement resources are instrumental in helping us serve our customers.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nThe Broadcom Knights program is not just about technical mastery; it cultivates a strong community of technical professionals who support each other with insights and solutions across all products of the VMware by Broadcom infrastructure. As Broadcom continues to evolve this ecosystem, the Knights program ensures that we remain at the forefront of technological excellence whether troubleshooting issues, exploring new features, or refining best practices.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about Broadcom investing in their partners; it\u2019s about the partners investing in their relationship with Broadcom. While the information, hands-on training and certification exam prep at the Orlando event was free, our company paid our expenses to travel there because they recognized the importance of the Broadcom Knights program to our customers and the company at large. For example, the certificates we earned not only help to make us more valuable to our customers, but they also are needed for our company\u2019s partner status within the Broadcom Partner Program. It also gave us a great opportunity to showcase our own expertise and value to our customers.\n\nThe next step for the three of us from my company who attended the event is to work with our colleagues in the other countries to get them on board as well. I already know a few of them who have expressed interest in attending the Broadcom Knights event in Amsterdam in March . The Orlando event proved to be a great platform to align on the latest technical advancements and reinforce the knowledge-sharing culture that defines the program. It was a great way to kick off the year and get us excited about what\u2019s ahead for Broadcom\u2019s VMware portfolio.",

            "content": "Shares of Broadcom (AVGO -1.08%) are up more than 780% in the last five years, pole-vaulting its market cap to over $900 billion. Besides being one of the most valuable companies in the world, it is also one of the most exciting investment opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHere's why Broadcom's innovation is kicking into a higher gear, and why this growth stock is a buy now.\n\nA balanced business\n\nDiversification is the single most compelling reason to invest in Broadcom over other semiconductor stocks. Nvidia makes most of its sales and operating income from graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers and AI applications. Advanced Micro Devices has a growing GPU business but is still heavily dependent on CPU sales for consumers, professional clients, and gaming. And it hasn't yet proved that it can take market share from Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom is unique because it combines a rapidly growing AI segment with an established networking business and a massive infrastructure software business thanks to its acquisition of VMware. The semiconductor segment provides networking solutions, server storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial solutions for enterprise clients, hyperscale data centers, and residential clients.\n\nThe infrastructure software segment provides solutions for mainframes, cybersecurity storage area networking, and cloud infrastructure. In total, Broadcom has an integrated global-connectivity product and services business that is in a league of its own.\n\nHyperscalers love Broadcom's accelerator chips\n\nThe company's blend of legacy products and services and upside potential from AI makes it an intriguing stock for investors looking for a balance of growth and value. In its latest period, which was the first quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenue grew 77% to $4.1 billion -- meaning AI alone made up 27.5% of total revenue.\n\nThe infrastructure software segment grew 47% thanks to the impact of VMware. So, Broadcom is benefiting from a savvy acquisition and industry tailwinds in AI.\n\nIts AI is centered around its XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers. XPUs are accelerator chips, more formally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). They are built for specific tasks and can be cheaper but less flexible than GPUs.\n\nThe company's accelerator chips and connectivity switches are received well by hyperscalers. And Broadcom plans to massively improve the efficiency of this hardware in the coming years. Management believes it will rapidly grow sales to the three hyperscale clients that make up its core, and two more hyperscalers that have become increasingly interested in its solutions.\n\nManagement is pouring money into research and development to build the next generation of high-processing-power XPUs and clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. Eventually, it believes it can reach clusters of 1 million accelerators for these customers, which will help the company tap into its addressable market that is forecast to reach $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027.\n\nThe growth in AI is helping offset a cyclical slowdown in other areas of its business. Semiconductor revenue not associated with AI fell 9% year over year, which Broadcom attributed to a seasonal decline in wireless sales and a bottoming out in broadband sales.\n\nLeveraging hardware and software\n\nGrowing demand for Broadcom's XPU chips is a significant catalyst for long-term growth, as is its software segment. VMware cloud foundation (VCF) is a software-as-as-service platform for computing, storage, networking, and cloud management services.\n\nOn the latest earnings call, CEO Hock Tan said the following about potential growth in the software business:\n\nWe are upselling customers to a full-stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized. And this enables customers to create their own private cloud environment on-prem [on premises]. And as of the end of Q1, approximately 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these customers consume VCF, we still see a further opportunity for future growth.\n\nBroadcom's combination of network connectivity hardware, AI accelerator chips, and software solutions for enterprise customers and data centers illustrates the sheer depth and breadth of the business. With multiple avenues for monetizing AI, the company can get more business from its top hyperscale clients.\n\nA good value and a growing dividend\n\nBroadcom is a complete business with tremendous growth potential. The only question now is whether the stock is still a good value or has become too expensive.\n\nAnalyst consensus estimates for fiscal 2025 earnings are $6.60 per share, and $7.81 per share in fiscal 2026. After popping 8.6% on March 7 in response to its earnings and guidance, the stock is now around $195 per share.\n\nAt that price, it has forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.2 based on fiscal 2025 results. That's reasonable for a high-octane growth stock with multiple ways to profit from AI.\n\nThe cherry on top of Broadcom's underlying investment thesis is its dividend. Thanks to exponential earnings growth, the company rapidly increased its dividend. Even after the stock's massive run-up in recent years, it still yields 1.2%.\n\nThat's comparable to the yield of the S&P 500 even though Broadcom is growing far faster than the average company in the index.\n\nA high-conviction buy\n\nBroadcom remains one of the best chip stocks (and tech stocks in general) to buy now. Nvidia also stands out as a solid buy, but Broadcom is arguably a better foundational holding because of its diversification and track record for earnings and dividend growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia's growth has exploded higher over the last couple of years, making it more difficult to value.\n\nBroadcom generates plenty of free cash flow to ramp up spending on research and development, allowing it to push the bounds of what is possible in AI. Add it all up, and it's one of the best all-around stocks to buy now.",

Cherney\n\n(Reuters) -Broadcom CEO on Thursday assuaged investor worries about AI chip demand with a strong second-quarter forecast and hinted about new potential customers that could boost revenue in a highly competitive market.\n\nIts forecast eased concerns about the thirst for AI chips, a day after Marvell Technology's spooked the market with a tepid forecast. Broadcom shares, which closed down 6%, surged 14% in extended trading after the results.\n\nThe chipmaker expects revenue of around $14.90 billion, compared with estimates of $14.76 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nBroadcom is seeing red-hot demand for its custom artificial intelligence chips from cloud computing companies looking for an alternative to the costly processors designed by Nvidia as they expand their AI infrastructure.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company expects revenue of $4.4 billion in the second quarter for its AI semiconductors as hyperscale customers invest in custom AI chips for data centers.\n\nAnalysts expect Broadcom to benefit further from large tech companies moving away from off-the-shelf chips to in-house processors as computing needs for AI tasks get more complex and personalized.\n\nBroadcom now has four more hyperscale customers who are \"deeply engaged\" with it to create their own custom chips separate from the current three that use its processors, CEO Tan said in a post-earnings call.\n\nThese four are not included in its estimate of revenue opportunity of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027, he said.\n\nReuters reported last month OpenAI is working with Broadcom to finalize its first custom chip design and reduce its reliance on Nvidia.\n\n\"The company is enabling hyperscalers and others who want to build custom AI accelerators to control their designs and costs,\" said Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nBroadcom is one of several companies that is evaluating Intel's most advanced manufacturing process, known as 18A. It has run test wafers through the Intel factories that evaluate portions of chips, not complete designs.\n\n\"Broadcom is much better positioned compared to its peers as its exposure in AI market is relatively more diversified with multiple AI ASIC customers,\" Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan said.\n\nApplication-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASICs, are chips designed for specific tasks. Designing and manufacturing an ASIC helps companies save the amount of energy chip use and boost performance.\n\nBroadcom reported first-quarter revenue of $14.92 billion, beating estimates of $14.61 billion. AI revenue surged more than 77% to $4.1 billion on strong adoption of its custom-made accelerators.\n\nRevenue in its infrastructure software segment rose more than 47% to $6.70 billion, while analysts expected $6.49 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru and Max A.

Tan will succeed Interim Co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus. He will also return to the Intel board of directors, a position he vacated in August 2024.\n\nZinsner will maintain his role as the executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus will continue as the CEO of Intel Products. Frank D. Yeary, who acted as the interim executive chair of the board during the CEO search, will resume his position as the independent chair of the board once Tan steps into his new role.\n\nMalaysia-born Tan has previously served as the CEO of Cadence Design Systems CDNS for over a decade.

Intel\u2019s shares have declined nearly 52% over the past year. For decades, the company designed and manufactured its own chips internally, but it eventually fell behind competitors in recent times.\n\nInterestingly, the new CEO appointment comes on the heels of TSMC TSM approaching Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Broadcom Inc. AVGO to form a joint venture to operate Intel's foundry division, which customizes chips for clients.\n\nTan stated on the company website \"In areas where we have momentum, we need to double down and extend our advantage,\" He also said, \"In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog. And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find ways to pick up the pace.\u201d\n\nTan\u2019s appointment as CEO was met with a positive market response, as Intel\u2019s stock rallied in after-hours trading following the announcement.\n\nIntel holds a momentum rating of 17.87% and a growth rating of 80.70%, according to Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings.

            "content": "The semiconductor industry has taken a significant hit amid broader market volatility, with the S&P Semiconductor SPDR ETF (XSD) down 14% year-to-date. Yet, seasoned investors know that every temporary setback can pave the way for a robust rebound.\n\nDespite disappointing January data, seasoned investors see opportunity amid the evolving AI landscape. Citi analysts have pinpointed two hard-hit semiconductor stocks, Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO), as compelling buys for long-term growth in artificial intelligence.\n\nRecent figures show monthly semiconductor sales dropped to $50.8 billion in January, a 14% month-over-month decline. Nonetheless, this drop comes against a backdrop of robust AI demand, which now accounts for roughly 20% of semiconductor consumption. Citi analyst Christopher Danely remains optimistic, citing anticipated inventory replenishment in the analog segment throughout 2025.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on market corrections, MU and AVGO offer strategic entry points. With strong fundamentals and solid AI-driven prospects, these stocks could emerge as top performers.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at these two stocks.\n\nAI Stock #1: Micron Technology\n\nBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology (MU) is a pioneer player in the semiconductor industry, renowned for its AI-driven memory and storage solutions that power everything from consumer electronics to advanced computing systems. Over the past several years, Micron has pushed technology boundaries with high-performance DRAM, NAND flash memory, and emerging innovations like 3D XPoint.\n\nValued at $98 billion by market cap, shares of Micron have been quite volatile over the past year. After rallying in the first half of 2024 and hitting a 52-week high of $157.54 in June, the stock has plunged nearly 43% from that peak. However, the stock has still managed to remain in positive territory, up 14% year-to-date.\n\nAfter the correction, Micron stock is now trading at 14.3x forward earnings, significantly cheaper than the industry average of 22.5x. It also represents a discount of more than 80% from its historical average multiple of 83x forward earnings.\n\nThe company outperformed in its latest quarterly earnings, delivering a double beat against consensus estimates. Despite this, shares tumbled 16% after the release due to soft guidance that fell short of expectations.\n\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, revenue surged 84% to $8.7 billion, driven by strong data center sales, which grew 40% sequentially and over 400% year-over-year. Moreover, the company's improved margins, fueled by favorable demand-supply dynamics in the memory market, helped it swing from a loss of $0.79 per share in the previous year to a profit of $1.67 per share.\n\nLooking ahead, management expects revenue of $7.9 billion and EPS of $1.43 for Q2, reflecting massive year-over-year improvements. For the full fiscal year, analysts project earnings to surge by an impressive 950%, reaching $6.08 per share, with an additional 75% increase expected next year to $10.67 per share.\n\nMicron will continue benefiting from strong AI-driven demand, particularly for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions, as data centers expand. Mordor Intelligence projects HBM growth at a CAGR exceeding 25% by 2030.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about MU stock\u2019s growth prospects. The group of 30 analysts covering the stock have assigned a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, with a mean price target of $132.45, representing a 40% premium to current levels.\n\nAI Stock #2: Broadcom\n\nBased in San Jose, California, Broadcom (AVGO) is a global technology leader specializing in infrastructure software solutions. The company focuses on high-performance networking, broadband communications, and wireless connectivity, serving industries from smartphones and data centers to automotive and industrial applications. After briefly hitting a $1 trillion market cap in December, Broadcom fell below that milestone amid a broader market selloff and now stands at $893 billion.\n\nBroadcom stock is down 16% year-to-date, mirroring the broader semiconductor slump. Yet, over the past 52 weeks, it has still soared 50%, thanks to a powerhouse December rally on the back of blockbuster AI-driven earnings.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Broadcom trades at premium pricing, with 34x forward earnings and 13.8x forward sales, both higher than the sector averages of 21x and 2.8x.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s fundamentals remain solid, having surpassed consensus estimates in each of the last four quarters. In its latest quarter, revenue climbed 25% to $14.9 billion. Recently, the company has become the largest supplier of custom AI chips to major tech firms. This drove a 77% increase in AI-related revenue to $4.1 billion as cloud providers ramped up investments in proprietary AI chips to compete with Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) GPUs.\n\nOn the profitability front, adjusted earnings per share reached $1.60, with EBITDA up 41% and free cash flow margins at 40%.\n\nLooking forward, management projects next-quarter revenue of $14.9 billion, marking 19% year-over-year growth. Analysts estimate Q2 EPS of $1.26 and full-fiscal-year EPS of $5.40.\n\nIn December 2024, CEO Hock Tan announced plans to deploy millions of AI chip clusters by 2027, targeting a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity spanning chips and networking hardware. With an annual AI revenue run rate of approximately $16 billion, growth potential remains significant.\n\nTill then, Broadcom holds a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating, with an average price target of $250.31, suggesting over 28% upside potential.",

[Related: AWS Launches New Agentic AI For Bedrock, \u2018The Next Frontier In Computing\u2019] At the same time, cutting edge agentic AI technology is taking automation to \u201cjust a whole other level,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is not going to take your job. Somebody that knows AI might take your job. That\u2019s probably what we\u2019re going to see playing out,\u201d said Keblusek. Keblusek is the longtime CTO of Sentinel Technologies, a top-notch cybersecurity, AI, networking, cloud and services specialist. The Downers Grove, Ill.-based solution provider was named to CRN\u2019s 2025 Security 100 list, which highlights some of the world\u2019s best MSPs with cloud-based security services. Sentinel has strategic partnerships with the likes of Cisco, Microsoft, Broadcom-VMware and Dell Technologies. In an interview with CRN, Keblusek explains what Sentinel is doing for Broadcom-VMware customers worried about price increases, his bets on Cisco and Microsoft security, and Sentinel\u2019s AI and agentic AI strategy in 2025.\n\nSentinel is a longtime VMware partner. With Broadcom changing VMware\u2019s portfolio and prices, what are you hearing from your Broadcom-VMware customers? You\u2019ve got customers asking what their options are to leave because their price has gone up as they\u2019ve repackaged their licenses and offers. There was obviously the disruption with our customers where: they wanted to renew, they\u2019re were use to a certain price, and now they have to buy VCF (VMware Cloud Foundation) or VvF (VMware vSphere Foundation) or some different bundling where they\u2019re getting additional capabilities that they\u2019re not using, but they\u2019re also being charged more than they were used to in the past. That created quite a bit of a stir. So we actually developed a workshop to run through all the value that VMware Broadcom was bringing to the customer, as well as what alternatives might be of interest. What we ultimately found is everybody wanted to keep VMware, but they wanted to get their price down. So we more recently developed a workshop of, \u2018How do you adopt some of these great capabilities that you\u2019re getting now? And how do we optimize your data center for the spend?\u2019 Because a lot of our customers had really over provisioned things because they could. There wasn\u2019t really a subscription penalty. They were buying additional hardware. Now, that\u2019s coming back to bite them a little bit. So we\u2019re having the right size and having to look at even more modern server platforms with higher processing power to potentially reduce cores, but then they\u2019ll adopt VCF and all the capabilities and really build private clouds that are AI ready.\n\nAs a leading Cisco security partner, how is Sentinel\u2019s Cisco business? Cisco doubled down on security a few years back and we\u2019re really starting to see the return on that. Our security growth was up triple-digits last year. It\u2019s been fantastic. They\u2019ve got some excellent leadership that they\u2019ve brought in a few years back and we\u2019re starting to see the products form. Really the conversation around their overall platform has been resonating with the market. Some of their new releases like Cisco\u2019s XDR and their secure access are outstanding. We\u2019ve had a lot of customer interest to either move from other platforms to Cisco XDR, or adopt and replace things like traditional VPN services and cloud access services with a more unified platform from Cisco. So it\u2019s been really, really strong on the security side of things. We\u2019ve seen a big push forward with Cisco, but also with Microsoft. Microsoft is one of our biggest growing practices and a lot of it is around security. A lot of its around Modern Work and Copilot as well. We\u2019ve seen a big uptick in Microsoft\u2019s XDR, Modern Workplace, some of the AI capabilities and security to really leverage the same things that the bad actors are leveraging to attack you, so you can detect and stop them more closer to real time than ever before. Is CEO Chuck Robbins the right person to lead Cisco in the AI era? For us, what Chuck\u2019s done has been excellent. Some of his leadership like Cisco\u2019s [Chief Product Officer] Jeetu Patel has brought some innovation back. He\u2019s got a great team under him as well. That\u2019s where you start to see their security story really tightening up and resonating now over some of the moves that Chuck was orchestrating over the past number of years. Financially, they\u2019re doing fairly well. They went through their big Splunk acquisition. Overall, the execution is good. We\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits today.\n\nWhat is Sentinel\u2019s strategy for AI agents or agentic AI in 2025? AI, generative AI and agentic AI are all big bets for Sentinel. I\u2019ve actually got a team under me in my office of innovation that focuses exclusively now on AI, both internally and externally. We call it our Fusion AI strategy. It\u2019s really about being the thought leaders with our customers to talk about and education on. So we need to educate them on AI because everybody\u2019s curious. But if you\u2019re a manufacturer or you\u2019re in healthcare, it\u2019s not your everyday job to stay up to speed. So we help our customers bridge that gap with our knowledge. We also partner with Gartner. So we\u2019re having constant communications with them in what they\u2019re seeing in the market from the thousands of customers they talk to on a regular basis. Then we\u2019re also using a lot of use cases our own, where we\u2019ve developed things internally or we\u2019ve developed things for customers, as well as industry use cases that we see in the market to have conversations with our customers on how they might adopt AI. Agentic is starting to surface, where you\u2019re going to start to see the automation make of the decision making and taking action. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re also on top of and talking to our customers about. Customers are adopting generative AI and even traditional AI right now. They\u2019re starting to do POCs. And the POCs are really moving from the art-of-the-possible into business ready platforms.",

TSMC is leading the conversation, talking with Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom about joining forces to run Intel\u2019s manufacturing facilities. In this plan, TSMC would keep its ownership to 50% at most, and it looks like Qualcomm has also been approached for a chat. Intel\u2019s current struggles\u2014with its chip production not keeping pace and financial losses piling up, even leading to the cancellation of a planned factory in Magdeburg\u2014have set the stage for this potential collaboration. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s still in the early stages, but it\u2019s catching the eye of industry experts who see this as a smart move to improve manufacturing processes and meet modern technical standards.\n\nThe challenge, however, isn\u2019t just about getting everyone on board; it\u2019s also about making sure the different production methods work well together. Intel and TSMC each have their own way of doing things, developed over many years, and meshing these technologies isn\u2019t going to be simple or cheap. Extensive research and development will be needed to align their processes so that they can work efficiently together. Besides the technical challenges, there\u2019s also the issue of getting the deal through US regulatory approval. The government is cautious about allowing a major part of the country\u2019s chip production to fall under foreign control, even if TSMC is widely recognized for its manufacturing capabilities. Balancing these technical and regulatory issues will be key to whether the joint venture can take off successfully.\n\n",

            "content": "Incremental improvements in the state of the economy and a potential groundbreaking collaboration in the chip industry helped spark a broad-based market rally.\n\nInvestors and consumers have all grown weary of persistent inflation, and the state of the economy has been top of mind on Wall Street and Main Street alike. There was finally some good news on that front, as the latest read on inflation was better than expected, igniting a broad-based market rally. Adding fuel to the enthusiasm was the potential for a groundbreaking collaboration among some of the most widely known names in the semiconductor space.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) jumped 6.7%; computer and semiconductor specialist Intel (INTC 15.09%) rose 4.2%; chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.28%), commonly referred to as TSMC, jumped 3.7%; and semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO -1.08%) rallied 3.7%, as of 12:35 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nGood news on inflation\n\nThe latest monthly report on inflation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that inflation cooled somewhat last month, a welcome development for struggling consumers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely followed gauge of inflation, rose 2.8% in February compared to the year-ago period. Prices also decreased by 0.2% month over month.\n\nBoth numbers came in better than expectations, as economists predicted inflation to increase 2.9% year over year and 0.3% sequentially. \"Core\" data, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 3.1% compared to this time last year and climbed 0.2% sequentially, both lower than expectations of 3.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank continues to chase its elusive inflation goal of 2%, but Wall Street was thankful for any signs of improvement, sending some investors on a buying spree.\n\nA groundbreaking collaboration\n\nThere were also key developments in the chip space that helped fuel the semiconductor rally.\n\nReports emerged that TSMC had floated a plan that would see Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices join forces and take stakes in a joint venture (JV) to operate the foundry belonging to beleaguered chipmaker Intel. TSMC would run the factories, which are currently focused on custom semiconductors, but would own less than 50% of the JV.\n\nThe discussions were reportedly sparked by a request from President Donald Trump, who enlisted TSMC to help Intel in its turnaround efforts. Any potential deal would require the approval of the Trump administration, which has made it clear it doesn't want Intel or its foundry business to be fully acquired by a foreign company. Talks are still in the early stages and are continuing, as TSMC is seeking an additional chipmaker to join the JV, according to reports.\n\nIntel has been struggling for years, as evidenced by last year's results. Revenue declined 2% in 2024, but the company lost $18.8 billion, marking its worst performance since 1986.\n\nReports also suggest that any potential deal would face headwinds, as the processes used by Intel and TSMC are very different. There are also fears regarding the protection of trade secrets by the various potential participants in the collaboration.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe struggles at Intel have been well-documented. Late last year, CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out after less than four years at the helm of the beleaguered company. Intel has suffered years of market share losses and a muddled strategy to profit from the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and investors grew impatient with its lack of progress. TSMC is widely regarded as the world's most advanced chipmaker, and its expertise -- if enlisted -- could be the catalyst that sparks a turnaround for Intel.\n\nFor their part, Nvidia and Broadcom have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution, but have faced supply constraints as demand continues to outstrip supply. While any benefit from the proposed JV would probably still be years away, investors were eager for any positive developments and bid up shares of the chipmakers, even as the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.66%) remains mired in correction territory.\n\nOn the bright side, Broadcom, Nvidia, and TSM are now much more attractively priced after the recent market downturn, with the semiconductor specialists selling for 30 times, 26 times, and 20 times forward earnings, respectively.",

The event brought together telecommunications industry leaders from around the world, including many from Asia Pacific. It featured fascinating presentations about technology trends and innovation reshaping the industry.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s team was part of the lineup, leading a great session about on-device artificial intelligence and the shift to edge processing.We also appeared on Fierce Networks TV to discuss how telcos are modernizing their network operations, which you can view here.\n\nMWC25 Observations from an APAC Perspective\n\nThroughout MWC25, there was a lot of excitement about the possibilities presented by traditional and generative AI, the Internet of Things, 5G-Advanced, the cloud repatriation, and even glimpses of 6G. However, it has also been clear that many telcos are struggling with two major challenges: effectively monetizing investments in areas such as 5G, and transforming their networks in ways that improve performance while being cost-effective and secure.\n\nOur view is that telcos should see the current period of rapid technology change as an opportunity to reinvent their network infrastructures to be more robust and agile. The transition from 4G to 5G is a good example of how this can work. 4G networks predominantly used virtualized, virtual machine\u2013based functions at their core, while 5G is moving towards cloud- and container-based infrastructures. This aligns with the industry\u2019s broader adoption of modern cloud technologies, but can result in telcos adding disparate and multi-vendor systems to their networks, as well as continuing to maintain siloed, vertical, and vendor-specific technology stacks that can be complex and hard to manage.\n\nOur Strategy for Telco Operators\n\nBroadcom\u2019s strategy is to help telcos move from siloed, vertical stacks to a more horizontal approach, multi-vendor and interoperable model. Here, the goal is to create on-prem telco cloud infrastructure that is agnostic to silicon and workloads, and empowers telcos to adapt quickly to market changes and optimize resources. The centerpiece of this approach is the VMware Telco Cloud Platform powered by VMware Cloud Foundation. This has been built to support:\n\nFlexibility by ensuring smooth technology transitions;\n\nby ensuring smooth technology transitions; Modernization and AI readiness by helping telcos transition from legacy systems to cloud-native architectures;\n\nby helping telcos transition from legacy systems to cloud-native architectures; Scalability and service agility through faster deployments and minimal downtime, which allows telcos to focus on new revenue streams;\n\nthrough faster deployments and minimal downtime, which allows telcos to focus on new revenue streams; Unified cloud experiences that enable seamless operations across IT and telco environments;\n\nthat enable seamless operations across IT and telco environments; Cloud-smart automation, which delivers a unified automation layer with a hybrid orchestration framework.\n\nEmbracing the Telco Ecosystem\n\nOther key parts of the puzzle are partnerships and standardized application programming interfaces throughout the industry. To succeed in their cloud-native transformations, telcos need high-level collaboration between network equipment providers, silicon vendors, and ecosystem partners.\n\nOperators are modernizing, but they face a dual challenge to adopt cloud-native architectures while still supporting VNFs. Some legacy VNFs are in transition, while others will remain for much longer. VMware Telco Cloud Platform provides ongoing support for VNFs while also enabling the CNFs deployments and network modernization.\n\nOur platform bridges IT and Network standardized API gaps by providing a hybrid orchestration framework that can support different orchestration options like GitOps and ETSI based on customer and NEPs vendor needs.\n\nWe are seeing this in practice in Asia Pacific as telcos undergo digital transformation. Across the region, much like telcos in Europe and the United States, they are adopting VMware\u2019s solutions for long-term commitment to support both VNFs and CNFs. - For example, a leading Japanese telecom operator successfully deployed GitOps-based CNF automation alongside ETSI-based orchestration as they transitioned to a cloud-native model.\n\nAI Adoption Readiness\n\nAnother key theme at MWC25 is that telcos are preparing to handle much higher levels of traffic as data-hungry AI and machine-learning systems come online worldwide. This data growth will increase operational complexity and the need for automation. In turn, this will require telcos to deploy more AI-powered tools to achieve greater network visibility, support predictive maintenance and intelligent traffic routing, and improve customer experiences and security.\n\nThese and other factors, such as cost, latency, and requirements to keep data within sovereign borders, are driving telcos to move workloads from public cloud providers to on-premises and hybrid models. These models make it possible to run AI workloads alongside core network functions in single, highly efficient data centers. Greater simplicity, automation, and flexibility are also helping telcos roll out new features and next-generation services that customers value, allowing the telcos to solve the monetization challenges I mentioned earlier. VMware software delivers AI-ready infrastructure that enables telcos to deploy a range of AI-powered use cases.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nTelcos face unique constraints as they seek to modernize and streamline their operations. They are critical providers of services that consumers, businesses, and governments depend on, and their networks have been built around industry-specific interfaces and standards that shape the pace of technological change. Even so, it\u2019s also clear we\u2019re seeing a convergence of telco and broader IT approaches that\u2019s being accelerated by the current shifts in network technologies, cloud computing models, and AI-driven dataflows and capabilities.\n\nAs a major supplier to telcos and enterprise IT customers worldwide, Broadcom is deeply engaged in these trends and building solutions that bridge both worlds. We offer a unified approach to delivering telco cloud infrastructure through a platform that meets the industry\u2019s present requirements for flexibility, scalability, and carrier-grade reliability while being well prepared to meet tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\n\nI encourage you to explore our industry-focused VMware solutions or get in touch with me or our team to discuss your strategies and requirements.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other top semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nThe global semiconductor industry reported a collective revenue of $626 billion in 2024, an 18.1% increase YoY, as per Gartner. Data centers accounted for the second largest sector for semiconductors, behind Smartphones, with revenues in this sector nearly doubling from $64.8 billion in 2023 to $112 billion in 2024. The International Data Corporation estimated that global demand for semiconductors will grow by 15% in 2025.\n\nThe U.S. semiconductor sector is a critical component of the global technology landscape, and its performance has significant implications for the broader economy. In recent years, the industry has experienced both growth and challenges, shaped by several factors. According to analysts, the growth is driven by the increasing reliance on technology in various sectors, including consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe industry has been at the forefront of technological innovation, with companies investing heavily in research and development. This has led to the development of more advanced chips, such as those using smaller process nodes and new materials, enabling greater performance and efficiency. The rapid pace of technological innovation continues to drive demand for more advanced semiconductors. As mentioned earlier, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies is particularly important as these applications require high-performance chips that US companies are well-positioned to provide.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, with companies from other countries, particularly in Asia, posing a significant challenge to U.S. companies. This competitive environment has led to increased pressure on pricing and a further need for innovation to maintain a competitive edge. The industry is increasingly affected by geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China have created uncertainty and challenges for the semiconductor industry. These tensions have led to restrictions on trade and investment, which can disrupt supply chains and limit market access for US companies. However, they have also spurred efforts to diversify supply chains and increase domestic production, which could benefit the US semiconductor sector in the long run.\n\nThe U.S. government has recognized the strategic importance of the semiconductor industry and has taken steps to support its growth. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which provides significant funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, is a prime example of this support.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks have taken a beating over the past month. While AI-fueled enthusiasm caused several stocks to boom in 2024, investors now appear to be experiencing angst over valuations in the face of potential tariffs, trade restrictions to China, or a digestion period in AI spend.\n\nTwo 2024 winners were Broadcom (AVGO -1.21%) and Marvell (MRVL -2.27%). Their portfolios are somewhat similar, so much so that Marvell is sometimes called \"baby Broadcom.\"\n\nHowever, when each stock reported last week, Marvell plunged, while Broadcom soared. It was an interesting dichotomy and may have reflected a few changing dynamics in the AI races.\n\nMarvell fails to reassure investors\n\nWhile there are differences between the two, both Marvell's and Broadcom's portfolios are weighed toward infrastructure chips for networking and communications, along with custom ASIC IP that cloud hyperscalers use in their custom AI accelerators, called XPUs.\n\nAll eyes in recent years have been on custom ASICs, which have seen hypergrowth as the AI buildout has accelerated. Marvell CEO Matt Murphy noted that two years ago, Marvell projected about $200 million in ASIC revenue in calendar 2023 and $400 million in 2024. But Marvell wound up exceeding $1.5 billion in 2024, with management projecting more than $2.5 billion in 2025!\n\nHowever, the topic of ASICs is also where things got dicey for Marvell during its conference call.\n\nYou see, Marvell's ASIC revenue is highly concentrated in a single customer: Amazon (AMZN -3.27%) Marvell also also works with Alphabet on Alphabet's new Arm-based CPU, but not its AI accelerator, as we'll see.\n\nAlthough Murphy noted that it has great visibility into ASIC revenue this year and next , one analyst asked about rumors of potential competition for the business of its all-important customer. Murphy answered:\n\n[T]o be crystal clear, we do expect revenue from these custom XPUs with this customer, not only to grow in fiscal '26, which is the year we're in, but to grow in fiscal '27 and beyond. And I just want to also note that I'm not including revenue here that would be from other products, access networking connectivity that would be incremental to custom. And certainly, we've got a great setup, I think, overall with this account relative to the opportunity set, but it's really on both. And then with respect to the question that our customer may be working with someone other than Marvell on a next-generation XPU, it's just something we can't comment on.\n\nThat last line was likely the one that spooked investors, especially in a nervous market in which investors seem to be looking for reasons to sell. A lack of a definitive \"no,\" to the rumors about Amazon switching all or part of its custom chipmaking off Marvell's IP may have worried investors over the sustainability of Marvell's ASIC growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom reported more potential customers\n\nOn the other hand, not only did Broadcom report blowout AI numbers of its own, but CEO Hock Tan also noted Broadcom had engaged with two additional potential ASIC customers.\n\nCurrently, Broadcom has three major ASIC customers. Its biggest is Alphabet for its tensor processing units (TPUs), along with what many believe to be Meta Platforms and China's Bytedance, the owner to Tik Tok. On its previous earnings call in December, Broadcom noted that it had engaged an additional two customers for custom ASICs.\n\nBut on last week's earnings call, Broadcom said it has now engaged with an additional two potential custom ASIC customers on top of the previous two. While we don't know who those two new customers of interest might be, it could suggest a potential engagement with Amazon. Of course that's highly speculative at this point.\n\nBefore Marvell investors freak out, some industry sources believe the original two new customers announced in December were Apple and OpenAI, while the two new customers alluded to last week may be Oracle and Elon Musk's xAI. But again, those four potential customers have not been confirmed by Broadcom.\n\nIn any case, the prospect of having Broadcom add even more customers to its already-larger roster of custom ASIC customers bolstered its stock. Meanwhile, doubts over Marvell hanging on to its single biggest customer longer-term likely dented sentiment.\n\nAnd don't forget about valuation\n\nIn addition to the differing narratives over custom ASIC customers, valuation likely played a role in both Broadcom's and Marvell's recent fortunes. While Broadcom has more custom ASIC customers and a more diversified business with its high-margin software segment, it still traded at a lower valuation than Marvell heading into last week.\n\nBoth companies' valuations look extremely high on a GAAP basis, since each has a lot of amortization of intangible assets on its income statements, because of both companies' history of acquisitions. However, unlike the depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, intangibles amortization isn't really an ongoing cost that has to be replaced by capital expenditures, as depreciation is. So in these cases, looking at both companies valuations on a non-GAAP basis is probably appropriate.\n\nMarvell made a little over $1.3 billion, or $1.57 per share on a non-GAAP basis in its fiscal year ended in January, which makes its current P/E ratio on adjusted earnings about 46.8 times. Prior to its report earlier this week, the stock traded at 57.3 times. And at its January highs, Marvell traded at 81.2 times trailing earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom currently trades around 36.3 times trailing-12-month adjusted EPS. Heading into earnings, that figure for Broadcom was just 33.5.\n\nMarvell may have been valued higher since it's a smaller company, and most investors seem to think that the smaller a company is, the larger its growth prospects. However, Broadcom has been able to defy those limitations of large numbers. After all, Broadcom's 25% growth last quarter was nearly as fast as Marvell's 27% growth, despite Broadcom being about nine times as large.\n\nLessons to draw\n\nWhen comparing two companies, two big elements to consider are customer concentration, as well as valuation. Even though Marvell and Broadcom reported quite similar results, Broadcom's lower valuation and more diversified customer base inspired more confidence relative to Marvell's sky-high valuation and dependence on a large single customer.\n\nAs we've seen from the excellent results across the Magnificent Seven stocks, big companies can still find ways to grow, especially since only large companies can credibly participate in capital-intensive megatrends such as cloud computing and AI. So in this new world of transformative technology megatrends, sometimes bigger is in fact better.",

With the change in licensing model came a significant increase in fees to remain with VMware, resulting in Telef\u00f3nica Germany deciding to review its options and ultimately broaden Spinnaker\u2019s focussed support.\n\nHolger Berndt, Professional Lead Software Asset Management, Telef\u00f3nica Germany GmbH & Co. OHG discussed the ongoing partnership with Spinnaker: \u201cWe have been delighted with the unparalleled service Spinnaker has delivered for the last two years, supporting us with our digital transformation.

            "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this chipmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Broadcom Inc. is 22.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 30.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 19.8%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Broadcom Inc. is 36.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -12.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.6%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Broadcom Inc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBroadcom Inc. has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Broadcom Inc. is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms. With a fast-growing customer base (already 50+ million) and a diverse set of cutting edge solutions, this stock is poised for big gains. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point,\u2019 Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said the nearly $60 billion tech giant is not currently interested in any mergers and acquisitions amid reports Broadcom was eyeing the purchase of Intel\u2019s chip design business.\n\nWhen asked during Broadcom\u2019s first fiscal quarter financial earnings report last week if it was looking at any M&A, Tan said the company is \u201ctoo busy\u201d investing in AI and still working through its blockbuster $69 billion acquisition of VMware that closed about 16 months ago.\n\n\u201cM&A? No, I\u2019m too busy. We\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point,\u201d said Tan. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking of it at this point.\u201d\n\n[Related: Broadcom\u2019s CEO On $4B AI Sales, Tariffs, VMware And \u2018Stepping Up\u2019 Cloud R&D]\n\nTan\u2019s comments came after reports surfaced last month that Broadcom was eyeing the purchase of Intel\u2019s chip design business.\n\nBroadcom reportedly was in discussion with advisers on making an acquisition bid specifically for Intel\u2019s large chip design business, which includes its Core and Xeon CPUs for PCs and servers. Reports said the deal would have depended on another company buying Intel\u2019s chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart move by Broadcom to not pursue it right now,\u201d said one top executive from a Broadcom-VMware partner who declined to be identified. \u201cIt would be too much, too fast. \u2026 It\u2019s just not the right time. Maybe next year if things keep looking good and the purchase becomes more favorable to [U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration].\u201d\n\nThe executive said Broadcom has a history of acquiring companies, followed by slashing costs and portfolio consolidation with the ultimate goal of achieving better profitability.\n\n\u201cIntel sort of needs a Broadcom-like acquirer right now, but I don\u2019t think [Broadcom] has the time and integration energy. They need to focus on finishing moving VMware customers around and see where they all land,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel Woes\n\nIntel has been the source of acquisition rumors this year in light of growing financial challenges that prompted the semiconductor giant last August to announce a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that resulted in the company slashing more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nEven before acquisition rumors began to pop up, Intel had taken steps to separate its Intel Foundry chip manufacturing business from its Intel Products chip design business.\n\nFor Intel\u2019s most recent fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, the company reported $14.3 billion in sales, down 7 percent year over year.\n\n\u201cBroadcom would likely tear up the [Foundry] business somewhat and make changes to things like Intel\u2019s AI chips and things like networking,\u201d said the executive.\n\nIntel has already canceled plans for its next-generation AI chip, which had been code-named Falcon Shores.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready for another massive integration and cost-cutting project right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a partner, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not overbooking themselves because they have a lot going on.\u201d\n\nVMware Momentum\n\nBroadcom generated $14.9 billion in total sales during its first fiscal quarter 2025, besting Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $14.62 billion. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company\u2019s $14.9 billion in revenue represents a 25 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom\u2019s net income increased by 315 percent to $5.5 billion in first-quarter 2025 compared with $1.3 billion year over year.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s infrastructure software division, which includes VMware software, reached $6.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, representing an increase of 47 percent year over year.\n\nTan said VMware\u2019s growth was due to two reasons.\n\n\u201cOne, we\u2019re converting from a footprint of largely perpetual license to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60 percent done,\u201d Tan said. \u201cTwo, these perpetual licenses were only largely for compute virtualization, otherwise called vSphere.\u201d\n\nVMware vSphere is now part of the VMware Cloud Foundation packaged bundle offering.\n\nTan said Broadcom is \u201cupselling customers to a full-stack VCF\u201d that enables customers to virtualize their data center and \u201ccreate their own private cloud environment\u201d on-premises.\n\n\u201cAs of the end of Q1, approximately 70 percent of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF,\u201d he said. \u201cAs these customers consume VCF, we still see a further opportunity for future growth.\u201d",

That's down to about 16,000, two sources said.\n\nWall Street loves CEO Hock Tan's M&A playbook.\n\nBroadcom's aggressive cost-cutting strategy has at least halved VMware's workforce while pleasing Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe chip giant closed one of the biggest tech deals ever when it acquired cloud software provider VMware in late 2023. Since closing the acquisition, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has focused on making the subsidiary more profitable.\n\nBroadcom has been cutting jobs in the past year, including cuts to VMware's salesforce in October and to its professional services team last week, according to current and former employees and LinkedIn posts. In addition, Broadcom has reduced the workforce in other business units or offices over the past few months.\n\nVMware stated that it had more than 38,000 employees as of February 2023, according to a regulatory filing, though many employees and executives departed before the deal closed. Attrition has also contributed to the shrinking workforce.\n\nBy this January, VMware had around 16,000 employees, according to two sources. Employees in marketing, partnerships, and VMware Cloud Foundation have been let go over the past few months, according to former staff and LinkedIn posts.\n\nBroadcom has implemented other workplace changes at VMware, such as requiring employees to return to the office. In cases where not enough employees badged into certain offices, Broadcom has shut down those locations and cut staff there, one former employee said. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment last week.\n\nTan has concentrated on VMware's largest customers and switched to a subscription-based business model from a perpetual license approach. He said on Thursday's earnings call that 60% of customers had so far been converted.\n\nThe company also raised prices. VMware customers have said they've faced massive hikes due to product bundling, which means multiple products are packaged together and customers have to pay for them all.\n\n\"The VMware kicker\"\n\nBroadcom's stock has climbed about 40% in the past year. In December, Broadcom's market cap hit $1 trillion.\n\nAnalysts have largely been pleased by Broadcom's handling of the merger integration.\n\n\"The VMware kicker continues to execute, which shouldn't be a surprise, given Hock Tan's expertise on his wash, rinse, and repeat M&A playbook,\" said Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, ahead of Thursday's blockbuster earnings release.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts called VMware the \"star in software,\" saying it was an \"opportunity for Broadcom to drive sustained software growth and potentially reduce the impact of heightened customer churn going into 2027.\"\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Broadcom made steep job cuts and consolidated teams at VMware, as BI previously reported. Broadcom had cut at least 2,000 employees around that time.\n\nBroadcom also divested some business units, such as End-User Computing.\n\nHave a tip?

Learn More\n\nManaging lots of different business units with all manner of applications is generally not an easy data management task. Making sense of all that information with data analytics can be even more challenging.\n\nAs Broadcom has grown through the acquisition of numerous software and hardware companies, the company has grappled with the challenge of integrating disparate data sources and systems.\n\nParticularly, When the tech giant closed its $61 billion acquisition of VMware in late 2023, it faced a monumental data integration challenge. VMware operated with 1,800 disparate applications and a staggering 187,000 product SKUs. For most acquiring companies, the playbook would be familiar \u2014 implement master data management systems, build elaborate data lakes and create complex integrations to bridge the systems while gradually migrating them over several years.\n\nBroadcom took a dramatically different approach. Instead of adding layers of complexity to manage existing systems, it wiped the slate clean. The company has also consolidated multiple data analytics tools, standardizing on just one platform from Incorta, which now works across all Broadcom\u2019s business units, including VMware.\n\n\u201cVMware had a significant disparity of applications,\u201d Alan Davidson, Broadcom CIO, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe actually deprecated every single one to consolidate to our single source management plane for the data model.\u201d\n\nDavidson explained that the data model is Broadcom\u2019s source of truth for data. The goal is to consolidate and simplify the data landscape to enable more effective reporting, analytics and decision-making.\n\nThe technical mechanics of Broadcom\u2019s data consolidation\n\nBroadcom\u2019s consolidation approach focused on cleaning data at the source rather than transforming it later in the process. This philosophy has guided their integration strategy.\n\nThe technical process involved several critical components:\n\nERP consolidation : VMware had seven enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms. Davidson joked that they had a different one for every day of the week. Broadcom consolidated that down to one.\n\n: VMware had seven enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms. Davidson joked that they had a different one for every day of the week. Broadcom consolidated that down to one. SKU rationalization : VMware had 187,000 SKUs \u2014 but has now gotten that down to just 500. This radical simplification eliminated countless compatibility issues, pricing variations and support scenarios that would have otherwise required complex mapping.\n\n: VMware had 187,000 SKUs \u2014 but has now gotten that down to just 500. This radical simplification eliminated countless compatibility issues, pricing variations and support scenarios that would have otherwise required complex mapping. Master data restructuring : Rather than building elaborate translation layers between disparate systems, Broadcom has enforced a single master data structure. This created one authoritative source for customer records, product information, procurement data and supplier details.\n\n: Rather than building elaborate translation layers between disparate systems, Broadcom has enforced a single master data structure. This created one authoritative source for customer records, product information, procurement data and supplier details. Contract and provisioning integration: A critical element was a tight integration between contracts and orders to serial numbers and provisioning. This ensures that when customers purchase software, there\u2019s a clear line of sight from contract terms to actual usage and entitlements.\n\nThe result was a dramatically simplified architecture that eliminated the need for complex data transformation.\n\nStandardizing on data analytics to enable enterprise insights at scale\n\nA unified and clean source of data is the foundation of Broadcom\u2019s data operations.\n\nExtending that out, Davidson said his company has also chosen to unify and standardize its data analytics on a single platform. To power analytics across its massive data footprint, Broadcom chose Incorta after evaluating numerous alternatives. Currently, Broadcom has more than 17,000 internal users relying on Incorta for analytics on top of over 200 terabytes of operational data.\n\n\u201cGo look at any competitor in the landscape \u2014 Microsoft Power BI, Snowflake, Tableau \u2014 there\u2019s a plethora of user interfaces (UIs), but they all come with baggage,\u201d said Davidson. \u201cThere\u2019s never really a complete end-to-end where I get a flexible UI, self-service capability for thousands of end users and scale in terms of usage and multiple data maps.\u201d\n\nBroadcom\u2019s diverse business units, each with their own go-to-market models and data requirements, presented a significant challenge. Davidson highlighted Incorta\u2019s ability to manage scale and link disparate data sources. Simply put, Incorta\u2019s flexibility in segmenting data access and enabling self-service analytics has been a game-changer.\n\n\u201cI need to enable the segmentation, as well as link the dots together and manage the scale of the user,\u201d Davidson explained.\n\nIncorta\u2019s AI and automation capabilities expand data analytics\n\nBroadcom is now set to benefit from a series of AI and automation updates as part of Incorta\u2019s latest product updates.\n\nIncorta CEO and co-founder Osama Elkady explained to VentureBeat that organizations are always looking to improve access to data. To address these needs, Incorta has introduced Nexus, which provides Broadcom and other customers with generative AI capabilities.\n\nWith Nexus, users can leverage advanced natural language processing (NLP) for tasks like data cleansing, model building and connecting machine learning (ML) to gen AI. The goal is to empower Broadcom\u2019s users with the ability to quickly and easily access the data they need, without the burden of manual data preparation or complex dashboard creation.\n\nApplying AI with a data-first mindset\n\nWhile many enterprises rush to implement gen AI without addressing underlying data quality issues, Broadcom is taking a more measured approach \u2014 focusing first on data integrity.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing we can do is leverage AI and get inaccurate data; especially with financials and telemetry, accuracy is super important,\u201d Davidson emphasized. \u201cIf all you\u2019re given is garbage, all you\u2019re going to do is get the wrong answer really quick.\u201d\n\nWith Incorta\u2019s Nexus, Broadcom is carefully applying AI where it adds clear value \u2014 primarily in democratizing data access.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the AI stuff with Incorta is transparency of data and easy access to data, without having to create your own dashboard or work hard to generate the data,\u201d Davidson explained.\n\nWhat this means for enterprise data leaders\n\nFor enterprises facing data complexity challenges \u2014 whether from acquisitions, organic growth or digital transformation initiatives \u2014 Broadcom\u2019s approach offers several lessons:\n\nQuestion the need for complex data lakes: Instead of accepting data complexity as inevitable, consider if radical simplification at the source might be more effective. Standardization beats flexibility in core systems: While it requires difficult decisions, having one system of record creates fewer integration headaches than supporting multiple platforms. Self-service analytics requires guardrails: Broadcom\u2019s success comes from giving users freedom within a carefully managed framework, not unlimited freedom that creates maintenance burdens. AI implementation requires data discipline first: Before implementing advanced AI, ensure your core data is accurate, accessible and well-structured.\n\nAs Davidson succinctly put it: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make things simple, and it\u2019s easy to make things really complicated. So we try to do hard things and make them simple.\u201d\n\nIn a technology landscape often cluttered with new tools aiming to solve integration problems, Broadcom\u2019s approach of ruthless simplification presents a compelling alternative for enterprises undergoing significant mergers and acquisitions. By doing the difficult work of data cleaning first, they\u2019ve created a foundation that enables, rather than inhibits, future growth.",

However, to manage AI workloads, Broadcom\u2019s custom AI accelerators, designed in collaboration with Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, compete directly with NVIDIA\u2019s graphic processing units (GPUs). In this context, let\u2019s explore which one of them has the upper hand and is a better buy.\n\nReasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock\n\nThe threat from DeepSeek\u2019s cost-efficient large language model has been blown out of proportion, and it shouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on NVIDIA. This is because low-cost models will, in due course, drive more use of computing power and assist NVIDIA. The semiconductor giant, nevertheless, has the necessary resources to create affordable products and enhance the AI ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers at the moment prefer NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software platform more than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform. Moreover, any change from CUDA to ROCm is unlikely due to the unmanageable infrastructure transitions.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s market leadership in the GPU market has already given the company a competitive edge and will drive future growth. Additionally, NVIDIA\u2019s latest quarterly sales for the Blackwell AI processor exceeded Wall Street expectations due to its insane demand. This demand is likely to persist thanks to Blackwell\u2019s faster AI interface and enhanced efficiency.\n\nReasons to be Bullish on Broadcom Stock\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom\u2019s custom AI accelerators and application-specific integrated chips is set to drive revenue growth. Broadcom expects to tap into the demand for custom AI accelerators, projecting a market size of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s revenues from custom AI accelerators and connectivity switches were $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024, up 220% from fiscal 2023. Broadcom expects AI revenues to grow for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025.\n\nAcquiring VMware has benefited Broadcom\u2019s infrastructure software solutions. The company has added more than 4500 of its top customers to VMware Cloud Foundation for deploying private cloud environments on-premises.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom has generated substantial cash flows in fiscal 2024, which enabled it to pay out dividends. The company also spent on share repurchases as management remained confident about future earnings.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Better Buy Than AVGO Stock?\n\nEbbing DeepSeek concerns, GPU dominance, and high demand for Blackwell chips will continue to boost NVIDIA. On the other hand, strong demand for custom AI accelerators will benefit Broadcom.",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc., like many computer chipmakers , has benefited from the increasing use and demand for artificial intelligence (AI) tools and programs. From its roots in Hewlett-Packard \u2019s labs to its dominance in semiconductors and software for corporate customers, Broadcom has both influenced and been shaped by the evolution of modern technology .\n\nThe Palo Alto, California\u2013based company plays a critical role in industries ranging from data centers to cybersecurity. But Broadcom\u2019s story is more than one of innovation: It\u2019s a narrative of bold acquisitions, regulatory scrutiny, and efforts to shape the technologies of tomorrow.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s technology products and services\n\nBroadcom structures its commercial offerings into two categories\u2014products and solutions.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s products include hardware like network storage and system components, essential for cloud computing and data storage; wireless network infrastructure, like Wi-Fi systems and components that enable mobile connectivity; and optical products such as LED displays used in consumer electronics. On the software side, Broadcom creates tools for running applications on mainframe computers, automating repetitive business tasks, and securing systems against cyberattacks.\n\nIts solutions are designed to address specific challenges facing businesses and industries. Examples include broadband and wired networking systems that connect homes and offices to the Internet; wireless and mobile communication systems for smartphones and other devices; and the hardware and technologies used at data centers to store, process, and analyze large data sets.\n\nAlso included are products for corporate customers to improve security, such as zero-trust systems that restrict access to verified users and cybersecurity tools for industries such as financial services. For companies using mainframe computers, Broadcom sells hardware and software that help integrate AI into their operations, enabling older systems to process and analyze modern workloads.\n\nVMware\u2019s role within Broadcom\n\nVMware, spun off from Dell Technologies in November 2021 and acquired by Broadcom in 2023 for $61 billion, is known for making virtualization software that allows one computer to act like many machines, making computing more efficient. VMware also develops software for managing data centers, making it a key part of Broadcom\u2019s strategy to expand its cloud computing presence and enterprise technology\u2014tools and systems designed to meet the complex needs of corporations and other large organizations.\n\nVMware\u2019s virtualization software complements Broadcom\u2019s focus on data center technologies, creating synergies that enhance both cloud management and AI workloads.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s evolution from HP to a global tech leader\n\nHP origins. The organization known today as Broadcom began as a division of Hewlett-Packard in 1961. The HP team introduced the first commercially available LED billboards in the 1960s. In the 1970s, HP developed technologies such as the HP interface bus, a system that standardized communication between instruments and computers, helping to establish its role in data communications.",

            "content": "Last week, semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO) impressed investors with its upbeat performance for the first quarter of Fiscal 2025 and a solid outlook. Mainly, the 77% jump in the company\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence) revenue to $4.1 billion and the 47% surge in infrastructure software revenue to $6.7 billion impressed investors. Overall, Broadcom\u2019s Q1 results and its outlook for continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue reinforced analysts\u2019 bullish thesis for AVGO stock.\n\nWhile AVGO stock is down about 16% on a year-to-date basis due to weakness in the broader market amid macro uncertainties and tariff concerns, analysts see solid upside potential owing to AI tailwinds.\n\nAnalysts Remain Bullish on AVGO Stock\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nFollowing the Q1 print, Truist Securities analyst William Stein raised the price target for Broadcom stock to $267 from $260 and reiterated a Buy rating. Stein thinks that the company offered a \u201cvery encouraging view\u201d of demand for its AI offerings and innovation. The analyst noted that the upside in AVGO\u2019s AI revenue more than offset the weakness in the company\u2019s heritage semiconductor markets.\n\nWhile management reiterated its previous outlook of its three hyperscaler customers generating a $60-90 billion serviceable addressable market (SAM) by Fiscal 2027, Stein expects the four \u201cpre-customers\u201d highlighted by the company to accelerate CAGR (compound annual growth rate) above 30%.\n\nLike Stein, Citi analyst Christopher Danely is also bullish on AVGO stock and reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $220.00. Danely noted the company\u2019s Q4 results and robust outlook, supported by continued strength in its AI business. He expects Broadcom\u2019s AI strength to offset any downside risks from Bytedance sanctions (about 2% of Fiscal 2025 sales) or loss of wireless share at Apple (AAPL) (nearly 2% of Fiscal 2025 sales) as the iPhone maker is developing its own Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip.\n\nDanely also mentioned AVGO\u2019s announcement about two new AI customers. Also, the company stated that the shipments for two other AI customers, who the analyst believes are Apple and OpenAI, are on track for \u201ctape outs\u201d (the final stage of the design cycle for semiconductors) by the end of this year.\n\nIs AVGO Stock a Good Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Broadcom stock based on 26 Buys and two Hold recommendations. The average AVGO stock price target of $248.36 implies 27.4% upside potential.\n\nSee more AVGO analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Consequently, the financial estimates for earnings per share for fiscal years 2025 through 2027 have been raised by 4%, 2%, and 6%, respectively.

Trump announced a one-month reprieve on some tariffs for Mexico and Canada, but concerns remain as new tariffs are still set to take effect in April. \"These exemptions don't do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty,\" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, according to media reports. Businesses are cautious, and consumers are bracing for inflation.\n\nTrump, however, dismissed concerns that his tariff policies are rattling markets. \"I'm not even looking at the market,\" he said in the Oval Office on Thursday, blaming falling stock prices on \"globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago.\"\n\nTrending: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum\n\nAI Stocks and Retail Struggles Weigh on Wall Street\n\nAdding to the market's pain, AI stocks\u2014once Wall Street's biggest winners\u2014are seeing losses. Marvell Technology MRVL dropped nearly 20% despite reporting solid earnings. Nvidia NVDA fell 5.7%, and Broadcom AVGO slipped 6.3% ahead of its earnings report. Investors who had grown accustomed to AI stocks consistently outperforming expectations are now re-evaluating their positions.\n\nRetailers are also feeling the pressure. Macy's M reported weaker-than-expected revenue, and Victoria's Secret VSCO fell 8.2% after giving a disappointing forecast. These reports signal that consumer spending, a key pillar of economic stability, may be softening.\n\nSee Also: Mark Cuban Backs This Innovative Startup That Turns Videos into Games \u2014 Claim Your Share Now\n\nLarry Fink: Buy the Dip Despite Market Turmoil\n\nWhile some fear more losses ahead, BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink sees an opportunity. Speaking at the recent RBC Capital Markets Global Financial Institutions Conference in New York, he reassured investors: \"The world's fine\u2026 The United States will get by.\" He acknowledges 2025 will be volatile but believes in long-term growth. \"If there's a big dip, good. Good time to buy.\"\n\nFink highlighted AI's potential, though he admitted its high costs are keeping it out of reach for smaller companies. He also pointed to Europe's economic rebound, citing increased defense spending and financial reforms.\n\nWith uncertainty high, Cramer's question\u2014\"Do we just keep selling because everyone is selling?\"\u2014captures the mood on Wall Street. Whether investors follow Larry Fink's advice to buy the dip or continue the sell-off remains to be seen.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nBottom line: Broadcom's acquisition of VMware has yielded impressive financial results, according to the company's recent quarterly earnings report. For the quarter ending February 2, Broadcom reported revenue of $14.92 billion, marking a significant 25% year-over-year increase. Net income surged to $5.5 billion, a remarkable 315% rise compared to the same period last year.\n\nA key driver of this growth is the integration of VMware into Broadcom's infrastructure software business unit, which posted revenue of $6.7 billion in Q1 2025 \u2013 up from $4.55 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAlthough Broadcom no longer reports VMware's revenue separately, the substantial increase suggests VMware's contributions have been considerable. Before the acquisition, Broadcom's software sales experienced only modest growth, with increases of 3% in FY 2023 and 4% in FY 2022.\n\nTo better understand the impact of VMware, it helps to examine Broadcom's software revenue before the acquisition. In Q4 2023, Broadcom recorded $1.97 billion in software revenue, bringing its full-year total for FY 2023 to $7.6 billion. VMware, in its last quarter as an independent company, reported $3.4 billion in revenue. Given these figures, Broadcom has successfully increased VMware's quarterly revenue by approximately $1 billion in just over a year.\n\nThis sharp revenue growth is largely attributed to Broadcom's strategy of bundling VMware products into higher-priced subscription packages rather than selling them as standalone licenses.\n\nThe largest of these bundles is VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), which includes a full stack of VMware technologies. During Broadcom's earnings call, CEO Hock Tan revealed that by the end of Q1, approximately 70% of the company's top 10,000 customers had adopted VCF. The shift to VCF, combined with higher costs for existing customers, likely accounts for the substantial revenue increase.\n\nAdditionally, some of the rise in net income can be attributed to cost-cutting measures at VMware. In its final standalone quarter, VMware reported an operating margin of 16%. In contrast, Broadcom's software business delivered a 76% operating margin in Q1 2025, up from 59% a year ago.\n\nDespite the apparent financial success of the acquisition, Broadcom's handling of VMware has sparked widespread customer dissatisfaction.\n\nReports indicate that some customers have faced price hikes ranging from three to six times their previous costs, with the most extreme case being a reported twentyfold increase. As a result, many are now at a crossroads, debating whether to remain with VMware or seek alternative solutions.\n\nWhile Broadcom's financial results suggest its strategy has effectively driven revenue growth, the long-term implications remain uncertain, as concerns persist about potential customer migrations away from VMware.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Gu, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nGu: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2025 results, guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment.\n\nWe will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan: Thank you, Gu. And thank you everyone for joining today. In our fiscal Q1 2025, total revenue was a record $14.9 billion, up 25% year on year. And consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record again, $10.1 billion, up 41% year on year. So let me first provide color on our semiconductor business. Q1 semiconductor revenue was $8.2 billion, 11% year on year. Growth was driven by AI, as AI revenue of $4.1 billion was up 77% year on year. We repeat our guidance for AI revenue of $3.8 billion due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers on AI. Our hyperscale partners continue to invest aggressively in the next generation Frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators as well as AI data centers with larger clusters.\n\nConsistent with this, we are stepping up our R&D investment on two fronts. One, we\u2019re pushing the envelope of technology in creating the next generation of accelerators. We\u2019re taping out the industry\u2019s first two-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D, as we drive towards a 10,000 teraflops XPU. Secondly, we have a view towards scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. We have doubled the radix capacity of this of the existing Tomahawk 5. And beyond this, to enable AI clusters to scale up on Ethernet towards one million XPUs. We have taped out our next-generation 100 terabit Tomahawk 6 switch running 200G SerDes and 1.6 terabit bandwidth. We will be delivering samples to customers within the next few months. These R&D investments are very aligned with the roadmap of our three hyperscale customers as they each race towards one million XPU clusters by the end of 2027.\n\nAnd, accordingly, we do reaffirm what we said last quarter, that we expect these three hyperscale customers will generate a serviceable addressable market or SAM in the range of $60 to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. Beyond these three customers, we had also mentioned previously that we are deeply engaged with two other hyperscalers in enabling them to create their own customized AI accelerator. We are on track to tape out their XPUs this year. In the process of working with the hyperscalers, it has become very clear that while they are excellent in software, Broadcom is the best in hardware. Working together is what optimizes large language models. It is therefore no surprise to us since our last earnings call, the two additional hyperscalers have selected Broadcom to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation Frontier models.\n\nSo even as we have three hyperscale customers, we are shipping XPUs in volume today. There are now four more who are deeply engaged with us to create their own accelerators. And to be clear, of course, these four are not included in our estimated SAM of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. So we do see an exciting trend here. New Frontier models and techniques put unexpected pressures on AI systems. It\u2019s difficult to serve all classes of models with a single system design point. And therefore, it is hard to imagine that a general-purpose accelerator can be configured and optimized across multiple Frontier models. And as I mentioned before, the trend towards XPUs is a multiyear journey. So coming back to 2025, we see a steady ramp in deployment of all our XPUs and networking products.\n\nSo Q1 AI revenue was $4.1 billion, and we expect Q2 AI revenue to grow to $4.4 billion, which is up 44% year on year. Turning to non-AI semiconductors, revenue of $4.1 billion was down 9% sequentially on a seasonal decline in wireless. In aggregate, during Q1, the recovery in non-AI semiconductors continues to be slow. Broadband, which bottomed in Q4 2024, showed a double-digit sequential recovery in Q1 and is expected to be up similarly in Q2 as service providers and telcos step up spending. Server storage was down single digits sequentially in Q1 but is expected to be up high single digits sequentially in Q2. Meanwhile, enterprise networking continues to remain flattish in the first half of fiscal 2025 as customers continue to work through channel inventory.\n\nWireless was down sequentially due to a seasonal decline. It remained flat year on year. In Q2, wireless is expected to be the same, flat again year on year. Resales in industrial were down double digits in Q1 and are expected to be down in Q2. So reflecting the foregoing puts and takes, we expect non-AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 to be flattish sequentially even though we are seeing bookings continue to grow year on year. In summary, for Q2, we expect total semiconductor revenue to grow 2% sequentially and up 17% year on year to $8.4 billion. Turning now to infrastructure software. Q1 infrastructure software revenue of $6.7 billion was up 47% year on year and up 15% sequentially, exaggerated though by deals which slipped from Q4 to Q1. Now this is the first quarter Q1 2025 where the year on year comparables include VMware in both quarters.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing significant growth in the software segment for two reasons. One, we\u2019re converting from a footprint of largely perpetual licenses to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60% done. Two, these perpetual licenses were only largely for virtualization, otherwise called vSphere. We are upselling customers to a full stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized and enables customers to create their own private cloud environment on-prem. And as of the end of Q1, approximately 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these customers consume VCF, we do see a further opportunity for future growth. As large enterprises adopt AI, they have to run their AI workloads on their on-prem data centers, which will include both GPU servers as well as traditional CPUs. And just as VCF virtualizes these traditional data centers using CPUs, VCM will also virtualize GPUs on a common platform and then enable enterprises to import AI models to run their own data on-prem.\n\nThis platform, which virtualizes the GPU, is called the VMware Private AI Foundation. And as of today, in collaboration with NVIDIA, we have 39 enterprise customers for the VMware Private AI Foundation. Customer demand has been driven by our open ecosystem, superior load balancing, and automation capabilities, which allow them to intelligently pool and run workloads across both GPU and CPU infrastructure, leading to very reduced costs. Moving on to Q2 outlook for software, we expect revenue of $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year. So in total, we\u2019re guiding Q2 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14.9 billion, up 19% year on year. And we expect this will drive Q2 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears: Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance. From a year on year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter. Consolidated revenue was $14.9 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross margin was 79.1% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher infrastructure software revenue and more favorable semiconductor revenue mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion was for R&D. Q1 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 44% from a year ago with operating margin at 66% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.1 billion or 68% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%.\n\nThis figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 55% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 11% year on year. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was approximately 68%, up 70 basis points year on year driven by revenue mix. Operating expenses increased 3% year on year to $890 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors, resulting in semiconductor operating margin of 57%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software of $6.7 billion was 45% and up 47% year on year based primarily on increased revenue from VMware.\n\nGross margin for infrastructure software was 92.5% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 76%. This compares to operating margin of 59% a year ago. This year on year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware and sharp focus on deploying our VCF strategy. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6 billion and represented 40% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and cash taxes due to the mix of US taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of section 174, and the impact of Corporate AMT.\n\nWe spent $100 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 41 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 8% sequentially, to support revenue in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 65 days in Q1 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $68.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we repaid $495 million of fixed-rate debt and $7.6 billion of floating-rate debt with new senior notes, commercial paper, and cash on hand, reducing debt by a net $1.1 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $58.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and 7.3 years respectively.\n\nThe weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $6 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.4% and 3.8 years respectively. And our $4 billion in commercial paper is at an average rate of 4.6%. Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $59 per share. We spent $2 billion to repurchase 8.7 million AVGO shares from employees as those shares vested or withholding taxes. In Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.95 billion shares. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q2 is for consolidated revenue of $14.9 billion with semiconductor revenue of approximately $8.4 billion, up 17% year on year. We expect Q2 AI revenue of $4.4 billion, up 44% year on year.\n\nFor non-AI semiconductors, we expect Q2 revenue of $4 billion. We expect Q2 infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year. We expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be about 66%. For modeling purposes, we expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 20 basis points sequentially on the revenue mix of infrastructure software. As Hock discussed earlier, we are increasing our R&D investment in leading-edge AI in Q2 and accordingly, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 and fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14%. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now open for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one one again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Avago Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) Follow Avago Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot and congrats on the results. Hock, you talked about four more customers coming online. Can you just talk a little bit more about the trend you\u2019re seeing, can any of these customers be as big as the current three? And what does this say about the custom silicon trend overall and your optimism and upside to the business long term? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan: Well, very interesting question, Ben. And thanks for your kind wishes. But what we\u2019re seeing is and by the way, these four are not customers as we define it. As I\u2019ve always said, you know, in developing and creating XPUs, you know, we are not really the creator of those XPUs, to be honest. We enable each of those hyperscalers partners we engage with to create that chip and to basically, to create that compute system. Call it that way. And it comprises the model, the software model, working closely with the compute engine, the XPU, and the networking that ties together the clusters of those multiple XPUs as a whole to train those large Frontier models. And so you know, and the fact that we create the hardware it still has to work with the software models and the algorithms of those partners of ours before it becomes fully deployable and scale, which is why we define customers in this case as those where we know they have deployed at scale and we\u2019ll receive the production volume to enable it.\n\nRight. For that, we only have just the three. The four are, I call it partners, who are trying to create the same thing as the first three and to run their own Frontier models, each of it on there to train their own Frontier models. And as I also said, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. To do the first chip, could take would take typically a year and a half. And that\u2019s very accelerated and which we could accelerate given that we essentially have a framework and a methodology that works right now. It works for the three customers. No reason for it to not work for the four. Still need those four partners to create and to develop a software which we don\u2019t do to make it work, and to answer your question, there\u2019s no reason why these four guys would not create a demand in the range of what we\u2019re seeing with the first three guys.\n\nBut probably later. It\u2019s a journey. They started it later. And so they will probably get there later.\n\nBen Reitzes: Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon, and great job on the strong quarterly results, Hock and team. Great to see the continual momentum in the AI business here in the first half of your fiscal year, and the continued broadening out of your AI ASIC customers. I know, Hock, last earnings, you did call out a strong ramp in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by new three-nanometer AI accelerated programs kinda ramping. You just help us either qualitatively, quantitatively, profile the second half step up relative to what the team just delivered here in the first half? Has the profile changed? Either favorably less favorably versus what you thought, maybe ninety days ago because quite frankly, I mean, a lot has happened since last earnings. Right? You\u2019ve had the dynamics like deep seek and focus on AI model efficiency. But on the flip side, you\u2019ve had strong CapEx outlooks by your cloud and hyperscale customers. So any color on the second half AI profile would be helpful.\n\nHock Tan: You\u2019re asking me to look into the minds of my customers. And I hate to tell you they don\u2019t tell me, they don\u2019t show me the entire mindset here. But one why are we beating the numbers so far in Q1? Seems to be encouraging in Q2. Pardon me? From improved networking shipments, as I indicate that\u2019s to foster those XPUs and AI accelerators even in some cases GPUs together, for the hyperscalers. And that\u2019s good. And partly, also, we think there is some pull-ins of shipments and acceleration, call it that way, of shipments yes, in fiscal 2025.\n\nHarlan Sur: And on the second half, that you talked about ninety days ago, the second half three-nanometer ramp, is that still very much on track?\n\nHock Tan: Alan, thank you. I only got you two. Sorry. Let me let\u2019s not speculate on the second half.\n\nHarlan Sur: Okay. Thank you, Hock.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on these pretty great results. It you know, it seems from the news headlines about tariffs and about Deepseek that there may be some disruption. Some customers and some other complementary suppliers seem to feel a bit paralyzed perhaps. Have difficulty making tough decisions. Those tend to be you know, really useful times for great companies to sort of emerge as something bigger and better than they were in the past. You\u2019ve, you know, grown this company in a tremendous way over the last, you know, decade plus. And you\u2019re doing great now, especially in this AI area. But I wonder if you\u2019re seeing that sort of disruption from these dynamics that we suspect are happening based on, you know, headlines of what we see from other companies. And how aside from adding these customers in AI, sure there\u2019s other great stuff going on, but should we expect some bigger changes to come from Broadcom as a result of this?\n\nHock Tan: You post a very interesting set of issues and questions. And those are very relevant interesting issues. And don\u2019t need issue the only problem we have at this point is I would say it\u2019s really toward to no way we\u2019re all linked. I mean, there\u2019s the threat, the noise of tariffs, especially on chips, that has a material lines in it. Nor do we know how it will be structured. So we don\u2019t know. But we do experience and we are leaving it now. Is the disruption on that is paused in a positive way. I should add a very positive disruption in semiconductors, on a generative AI. Generative AI for sure. And we I said that before, so at the risk of repeating, you know, but it\u2019s we feel it more than ever. Is really accelerating the development of semiconductor technology.\n\nBoth process and packaging as well as design. Towards higher and higher performance accelerators and networking functionality. We\u2019ve seen that innovation that those upgrades occur on a every month. As we face new interesting challenges. And when particularly with XPUs. We\u2019re trying within as to optimize to Frontier models of our partners, our customers, as well as our hyperscale partners. And we it\u2019s a lot of I mean, it\u2019s a it\u2019s a privilege almost for us to be to participate in it and try to optimize. And by optimize, I mean, you look at an accelerator. You can look at it for simple terms, high level, to to perform, to want to maybe mention not just on one single mentoring, which is compute capacity, how many teraflops? It\u2019s more than that.\n\nIt\u2019s also tied to the fact that this is a distributed computing problem. It\u2019s not just the sing the compute capacity of a single XPU or GPU. It\u2019s also the network bandwidth. It ties itself to the next adjacent XPU or GPU. So that has an impact. So you\u2019re doing that. You\u2019ll have the balance with that. Then you decide, are you doing training or you\u2019re doing prefilling? Post training. Fine tuning. And again then comes how much memory do you balance against that? And with it, how much latency you can afford, which is memory bandwidth. So you will look at the at least four variables, maybe even five. If you\u2019re in clone in memory bandwidth. Not just memory capacity, when you go straight to inference. So we we have all these variables to play with and we try to optimize it.\n\nSo all this is very, very I mean, it\u2019s a great experience for our engineers to push their envelope on how to create all those chips and so that\u2019s the biggest disruption we see right now. From sheer trying to create and push the envelope on generative AI. Trying to create the best hardware infrastructure to run it. Beyond that, yeah, there are there are other things too that come into play because with AI, as I indicated, just not just drive hardware for enterprises, it drives the way the architect their data centers. You know, data requirement they keep keeping data private on on under control becomes important. So suddenly, the push of what loads towards public cloud. May take a little pause as large enterprises particularly, have to they have to take direct device that you want to run AI workloads.\n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking very hard about running them on-prem. And suddenly, push yourself to a saying, got to upgrade your own data centers. To do you know, and manage the your own data to run it on-prem. And that\u2019s also pushing a trend that with we have been seeing now over the past twelve months. Hence, my comments on VMware Private AI Foundation. This is to especially enterprises pushing direction at quickly recognizing that how where do they run their AI workloads. So those are trends we see today and a lot of it coming out of AI, a lot of it coming out of sensitive rules on sovereignty, in cloud and in data. On as far as you\u2019re mentioning tariffs is concerned, I think that\u2019s too early for us to figure out where to online. And probably maybe give it another three, six months we probably have a better idea where to go.\n\nWilliam Stein: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore: May I speak to a ask a question. I want to go back to the XPU side of things. And going from the four new engagements, not yet named customers, two last quarter and two more today that you announced. I wanna talk about going from kind of design winded deployment. How do you judge that? Because there is some debate about, you know, tons of design wins, but the deployments actually don\u2019t happen either that they never occur or that the volume is never what is originally promised. How do you view that kind of conversion ratio with there a wide range around it? Or is there some way you could help us kind of understand how that works?\n\nHock Tan: Well, it\u2019s and, Ross, the interesting question I\u2019ll take the opportunity to say the way we look at designing is probably very different from the way many of our peers look at it out there. Number one, to begin with, we believe design win when we know our product is at in produced in scale, at scale and is actually deployed. Literally deployed in production. So that takes a long lead time because from taping out getting in the product, it takes a year. Easily from the product in the hands. Of our partner to when it goes into scale production, it will take six months to a year. It\u2019s our experience that we\u2019ve seen. Number one and number two. I mean, producing and deploying five thousand SKUs that\u2019s that\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s not real production in my in our view.\n\nAnd so we also limit ourselves in selecting partners to people who really need that large volume. You need that large volume from our viewpoint in scale right now. In mostly framing, training of large language models from tier models in a continuing trajectory. So we limit ourselves to how many customers or how many potential customers that exist out there, Ross. And we tend to be very selective who we pick. The beginning. So when we say design win, it really is at scale. It\u2019s not something that starts in six months and die or a year and die again. Basically, it\u2019s a selection of custom. It just the way we run our ASIC business in general for the last fifteen years. We pick and choose the customers because we know this guy and we do multi multi-year roadmaps with these customers because we know these customers are sustainable.\n\nI put it bluntly. We don\u2019t do it for start-ups.\n\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\n\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go to the three customers that you do have in volume today. And what I wanted to ask was is there any concern about some of the new regulations or the AI diffusion rules that are gonna get put in place supposedly in May impacting any of those design wins or shipments. It sounds like you think all three of those are still on at this point. But anything you could tell us about worries about new regulations or AI diffusions impacting any of those wins would be helpful.\n\nHock Tan: Thank you. In this era or this current era of geopolitical tensions, and fairly dramatic actions all around by governments, yes, always some concern at the back of everybody\u2019s mind. But to answer your question directly, no. We don\u2019t have any concerns.\n\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. So none of those are going into China? Or to Chinese customers then?\n\nHock Tan: No comment. Are you trying to locate who they are?\n\nStacy Rasgon: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Hock, whenever you have described your AI opportunity, you\u2019ve always emphasized the training workload. But the perception is that the AI market could be dominated by the inference workload, especially with these new reasoning models. So what happens to your opportunity and share if the mix moves more towards inference, does it, you know, does it create a bigger TAM you than the $60 to $90 billion? You know, does it keep it the same, but is there is a different mix of product? Or does a more inference-heavy market favor a GPU over an XPU? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan: That\u2019s a good interesting question. By the way, I never I do talk a lot about training. We do out check our experience as also focus on inference as a separate product line. They do. And that\u2019s why I can say the architecture of those chips are very different from the architecture of the training chips. And so it\u2019s a combination of those two, I should add. That adds up to this $60 to $90 billion. So if I had not been clear I do apologize. It\u2019s a combination of both. But having said that, the larger part of the dollars come from training. Not inference. If within the server service, the same that we have talked about so far. Thank you.\n\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Broadcom team. And again, great execution. Just talk had a quick question. We\u2019ve been hearing that almost all of the large clusters that are 100k plus they\u2019re all going to Ethernet. I was wondering if you could help us understand the importance of when the customer\u2019s making a selection, you know, choosing between a guy that has the best switch ASICs such as you, versus a guy that might have to compute there. Can you talk about what the customer is thinking and what are the final points that they wanna hit upon when they make that selection for the mixed cards?\n\nHock Tan: Okay. I see. No. It\u2019s a com yeah. It\u2019s down to in the in the case of the in the case of the hyperscalers, now very much so, it\u2019s very driven by performance. And it\u2019s performance what you\u2019re mentioning about on connecting scaling up, and scaling out those AI accelerators, be they XPU or GPU. Among extra scalers. And in main most cases, among those hyperscalers we engage with, when it comes to connecting those clusters. They\u2019re very driven. By performance. I mean, you if you are in the race to really get the best performance out of your hardware as you train and continue to train your Frontier models, that matters more than anything else. So the basic first thing they go for is proven. That\u2019s a proven piece of hardware is a proven net it\u2019s a proven system subsystem in our case that makes it work.\n\nAnd in that case, we tend to have a big advantage. Because, I mean, networking is ours. You know, switching and routing is ours for the last ten years at least. And the fact that it\u2019s AI just makes it more interesting for our engineers to work on. And but it\u2019s basically based on proven technology and experience in pushing that and pushing the envelope on going from 800 gigabit per second bandwidth to 1.6 and moving on to 3.2, which is exactly why we keep stepping up the rate of investment in coming up with our products where we take a ton of five. We doubled the radix to deal with just one hyperscaler because they want high radix to create larger clusters while running, bandwidth that are smaller but that doesn\u2019t stop us from moving ahead to the next generation of Tomahawk 6 and I dare say, we even planning to come out 7 and 8 right now.\n\nAnd we\u2019re speeding up the rate of development. And it\u2019s all actually for that few guys, by the way. So we\u2019re making a lot of investment for very few customers, hopefully, with very large serve available markets. That\u2019s if I\u2019m nothing else, that\u2019s the big bets we are placing.\n\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you, Hock.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Hock, in the past, you have mentioned XPU units growing from about two million last year to about seven million, you said, in the 2027, 2028 time frame. My question is, do these four new customers, do they add to that seven million unit number? I know in the past, you sort of talked about an ASP. It was, you know, twenty grand by then. So those three the first three customers are clearly a subset of that seven million units. So do these new four engagements drive that seven higher, or do they just fill in to get to that seven million? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan: Thanks, Tim, for asking that. To clarify, as I made I thought I made it clear in my comments. No. The market we\u2019re talking about include when you translate the unit it\u2019s only among the three customers we have today. The other four, we talk about engagement partners, we don\u2019t consider that as customers yet, and therefore, are not in our served available market.\n\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. So they would add to that number. Okay. Thanks, Hock.\n\nOperator: Thanks. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I\u2019ll have to follow-up on your prepared remarks and comments earlier around optimization with your best hardware and hyperscalers with their great software. I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re expanding your portfolio now to six mega scale kind of frontier models. Will enable you to, you know, a more plush, you know, share tremendous information, but at the same time, a world where these six truly wanna differentiate. So, obviously, you know, the goal for all of these players is exaflops, per second per dollar of capex per watt. And I guess to what degree are you aiding them in these efforts? And where does maybe the Chinese wall kinda start where they wanna kinda differentiate and not share with you kind of some of the work that you\u2019re doing.\n\nHock Tan: You. Oh, you know, we only provide very base basic fundamental technology in semiconductors to enable these guys to use what we have and optimize it to their own particular models. And algorithms that relate to those models. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we do. So that\u2019s the level of a lot of that optimization we do for each of them. And as I mentioned earlier, there are maybe five degrees of freedom. Yeah. We do. And we play with that. And so even if there are five degrees of freedom, there\u2019s only so much we can do at that point. But it is and how did you and then basically, how we optimize it is all tied to the partner telling us how they want to do to do it. So that\u2019s only so much we also have visibility on. But it\u2019s but it\u2019s what we do now is what the XPU model is.\n\nShe optimization translating to performance but also power. That\u2019s very important how they play. It\u2019s not just cost. The power come translates into total cost of ownership. Eventually. It\u2019s it\u2019s how design it in power and how we balance it in terms of the size of the cluster and whether they use it for training. No. Pretraining? Post training? Inference you know, time test time scaling, all of them have their own characteristics. And that\u2019s the advantage of doing that XPU and working closely with them to create that stuff. Now as far as your question on China and all that, frankly, I don\u2019t have any opinion on that at all. To us, it\u2019s a technical game.\n\nCJ Muse: Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Rolland: Hey. Thanks so much for the question. And this one\u2019s maybe for Hock and for Kirsten. I\u2019d love to know just because you have kind of the complete connectivity portfolio, how you see new greenfield scale-up opportunities playing out here between you know, could be optical or copper or really anything and what additives this could be for your company. And then, Kirsten, I think, OpEx is up. Maybe just talk about where those OpEx dollars are going towards within the AI opportunity and whether they relate. Thanks so much.\n\nHock Tan: Your question is very broad-reaching. In our portfolio. Yeah. We deploy we have the advantage as a and a lot of the customer hyperscalers they\u2019re talking about a lot of expansion. But it\u2019s all almost all greenfield. You know, bless soul brownfield. It\u2019s very greenfield. It\u2019s all expansion. And it all tends to be next generation. That we\u2019re doing. Which is very exciting. So the opportunity is very, very high. And we deploy I mean, we are both we can do it in copper, but what we see a lot of opportunity from is when you connect provide the networking connectivity through optical. But there are a lot of active elements including either, you know, multimode lasers which are called VCSELs or intervening lasers. For basically single mode.\n\nAnd we do both. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity just as in scale scale-up versus scale-up. We used to do we still do a lot of other protocols beyond Ethernet to consider PCI Express where we on the leading edge of that PCI Express. And that architecture on networking, switching, so to speak, we offered both. One is a very intelligent switch which is, like, our Jericho family. We\u2019ve a Dominic or a very smart NIC, we\u2019ve got down switch, which is a Tomahawk. We offer both architectures as well. So, yeah, we have a lot of opportunities from it. All things said and done, all this nice white portfolio and all that, adds up to probably, as I said in prior quarters, about 20% of our total AI revenue maybe going to 30%. Though last quarter, we hit almost 40%, but that\u2019s not the norm.\n\nI would say typically, all those other portfolio products still end up to a nice decent amount of revenue for us, but within the sphere of AI, they add up to I would say on average, be close to 30%. And XPUs, the accelerators, is 70%. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re driving at, perhaps that give you some shed some light on towards where, how one matters over the other. But we have a wide range of products connectivity, networking side of it. They just add up though to that 30%.\n\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Hock.\n\nKirsten Spears: And then on the R&D front, as I outlined at a consolidated basis, we spent $1.4 billion in R&D in Q1, and IT stated that it would be going up in Q2. Hock clearly outlined in his script the two areas where we\u2019re focusing on. Now I would tell you the company we focus on R&D across all of our product lines so that we can stay competitive with next-generation product offerings, but he did line out that we are focusing on taping out the industry\u2019s first two-nanometer AIXPU package in 3D. That was one in the script, and that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re focusing on. And then he mentioned that we\u2019ve doubled the radix capacity of existing Tomahawk 5. To enable our AI customers to scale up on Ethernet. Towards the one million XPUs. I mean, that\u2019s a huge focus of the company.\n\nChristopher Rolland: Yep. Thank you very much, Kirsten.\n\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Thanks. Just a question on the networking side. Just wondering how much does up sequentially on the AI side? And any thoughts around M&A going forward? Still a lot of headlines around the include products, Blue Care, so thanks.\n\nHock Tan: On the networking side, as indicated, Q1 showed a bit of a surge. But I don\u2019t expect that to be that mix of sixty-forty-sixty is compute and forty percent networking to be something that is normal? I think the norm is closer to seventy, thirty, maybe. At best, thirty percent. And so who knows what Q2 is? We cannot see Q2 as continuing but that\u2019s just, at my mind, a temporary flip. The norm will be seventy thirty. If you take it across, a period of time, like six months, a year, that\u2019s your question. M&A, no. I\u2019m too busy we\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point. We\u2019re not thinking of it. At this point.\n\nVijay Rakesh: Thanks, Hock.\n\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gu for any closing remarks.\n\nGu: Thank you, Sherry. Broadcom currently plans to report its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 after close of market on Thursday, June 5th, 2025.

[Related: Accenture Exec: Why $2.5B Google Cloud-Salesforce AI Alliance Is \u2018Beautiful\u2019] In terms of VMware and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), Broadcom is focused on \u201cupselling customers to a full-stack VCF,\u201d which enables the entire data center to be virtualized to enable customers to create their own private cloud environment on-prem. \u201cAs of the end of Q1, approximately 70 percent of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF,\u201d he said. CRN breaks down the five biggest highlights and boldest remarks from Hock Tan on the chipmaker and software company\u2019s Q1 2025 results and future. Broadcom\u2019s Q1 Earnings Results Before jumping into Tan\u2019s biggest statements, let\u2019s take a quick look at the Broadcom\u2019s financial results for first quarter 2025, which ended Feb. 2, as the tech giant continues to drive AI on a global basis. Broadcom generated $14.9 billion during the first quarter, which bested Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $14.62 in total sales. The $14.9 billion in revenue represents a 25 percent year-over-year increase compared to approximately $12 billion during Q1 2024. Broadcom\u2019s net income increased a whopping 315 percent to $5.5 billion in Q1 2025 compared to $1.3 billion year over year. Here is what Hock Tan said regarding its AI revenue, VMware momentum, potential tariff impact on business and enabling hyperscale cloud providers with Broadcom\u2019s innovation.\n\nBroadcom AI Sales Hit $4.1 Billion Broadcom said it generated $4.1 billion in AI sales during the quarter, representing a 77 precent increase year over year. Artificial intelligence sales were driven by strong shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers leveraging Broadcom\u2019s Tomahawk switches and high-performance accelerator chips. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing the envelope of technology in creating the next generation of accelerators. We\u2019re [building] the industry\u2019s first two-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D as we drive toward a 10,000 teraflops XPU,\u201d Tan said. \u201cSecondly, we have a view toward scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. We have doubled the RAID X capacity of the existing Tomahawk sites.\u201d Broadcom\u2019s AI sales are included as part of its semiconductor solutions business, which grew 11 percent year over year to $8.21 billion in Q1 2025. Broadcom\u2019s AI Projection In Q2: Looking ahead, Broadcom is projecting AI revenue to grow to $4.4 billion during its current second quarter 2025, which would represent a 44 percent increase year over year.\n\nHock Tan On Potential Tariff Impact Tan was questioned about if global tariffs that the Trump administration is seeking to implement would impact Broadcom in any way. \u201cIt\u2019s really too early to know where we all land. I mean, there\u2019s the threat, the noise of tariffs\u2014especially on chips that hasn\u2019t materialized yet, nor do we know how it will be structured,\u201d Tan said. Tan said his company is trying to look at global tariff disruptions \u201cin a positive way\u201d regarding the semiconductor industry as new AI innovation and data sovereignty rules are evolving at breakneck speed. \u201cAs far as you mentioning tariffs is concerned, I think that\u2019s too early for us to figure out way,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably give it another three to six months. We will probably have a better idea of where to go.\u201d\n\nSales And Innovation Momentum With Giant Providers Broadcom is currently developing custom AI chips with three large cloud customers. The world\u2019s three cloud computing market share leaders are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google Cloud. \u201cTo enable AI clusters to scale up on Ethernet toward 1 million XPUs, we have [built] our next-generation 100-terabit Tomahawk 6 switch running 200G studies at 1.6 terabit bandwidth. We will be delivering samples to customers within the next few months,\u201d said Tan. \u201cThese R&D investments are very aligned with the roadmap of our three hyperscale customers as they each race toward 1 million XPU clusters by the end of 2027,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect these three hyperscale customers will generate a Serviceable Addressable Market in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.\u201d In addition to those three large cloud customers, Tan said his company had \u201cdeeply engaged\u201d with two other hyperscalers, and is working with four other potential customers to develop their own custom AI chips. \u201cIn the process of working with the hyperscalers, it has become very clear that while they are excellent in software, Broadcom is the best in hardware. Working together is what optimizes large language models,\u201d he said.\n\nVMware Momentum; 60 Percent Finished With Converting VMware Licenses To VCF Broadcom\u2019s infrastructure software division, which includes VMware software, reached a total of $6.7 billion in sales during the quarter. This presents a 47 percent increase year over year compared to $4.6 billion in Q1 2024. This software spike in growth is due to two reasons. \u201cOne, we\u2019re converting from a footprint of largely perpetual license to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60 percent done,\u201d Tan said. \u201cTwo, these perpetual licenses were only largely for compute virtualization, otherwise called vSphere.\u201d VMware vSphere is now part of the VMware Cloud Foundation packaged bundle offering. Tan said Broadcom is \u201cupselling customers to a full-stack VCF\u201d that enables customers to virtualize their data center and \u201ccreate their own private cloud environment\u201d on-premise. \u201cAs of the end of Q1, approximately 70 percent of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these customers consume VCF, we still see a further opportunity for future growth,\u201d he said. As large enterprises adopt AI, they need to run their AI workloads on their on-prem data centers, which will include both GPU servers as well as traditional CPUs. \u201cJust as VCF virtualizes these traditional data centers using CPUs, VCF will also virtualize GPUs on a common platform and enable enterprises to import AI models to run their own data on-prem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis platform, which virtualized the GPU, is called the VMware Private AI Foundation. As of today, in collaboration with Nvidia, we have 39 enterprise customers for the VMware Private AI Foundation.\u201d",

AVGO stock jumped Friday after its fiscal first-quarter report.\n\nBroadcom late Thursday delivered a beat-and-raise earnings report. The fabless chipmaker and infrastructure software provider earned an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $14.92 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 2. On a year-over-year basis, Broadcom earnings increased 45% while sales advanced 25%.\n\nFor the current quarter ending May 4, Broadcom forecast revenue of $14.9 billion, up 19% year over year.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Broadcom announced that it had scored two additional AI chip customers, bringing its total to seven. It currently is supplying custom AI chips for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and TikTok owner ByteDance. It also reportedly is designing chips for Apple (AAPL) and OpenAI.\n\nThe two new customers could be xAI and Oracle (ORCL), Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a client note. Another possible customer is the alliance of SoftBank (SFTBY) and Arm (ARM), JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a note.\n\nOn the stock market today, AVGO stock rose 8.6% to close at 194.96.\n\n\"Broadcom's results support our view that the AI trade remains alive and well as hyperscalers and enterprises continue to view AI as top priority to increase productivity and remain competitive,\" William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji said in a client note. He rates AVGO stock as outperform.\n\nBroadcom's report highlights the competitive advantages of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for AI, JPMorgan's Sur said.\n\n\"These engagements underscore Broadcom's expanding design win pipeline and confirm our belief that internally developed custom ASIC silicon programs offer opportunities for differentiation, efficiency gains, and improved silicon economics,\" Sur said.\n\nHowever, Pajjuri said some of Broadcom's AI chip engagements are still early. He rates AVGO stock as market perform, or neutral.\n\n\"We expect intense competition from Nvidia and there is no guarantee that new (Broadcom) customers will proceed with volume deployment of custom ASICs,\" he said.\n\nIn the AI chip market, Broadcom competes with rival ASIC designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) and makers of graphics processing units (GPUs) led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nMarvell Misses Q1 Sales 'Whisper Number.'

That beat analyst estimates at $14.6 billion.\n\nInvestors were particularly impressed with the company's artificial intelligence (AI) revenue growth, which was up 77% to $4.1 billion, driven by 47% growth in infrastructure revenue to $6.7 billion. In its other segment, semiconductor solutions, revenue rose 11% to $8.2 billion.\n\nBroadcom continued to generate exceptional profit margins, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $10.1 billion, or a 67% margin. On the bottom line, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.60, up from $1.10 in the quarter a year ago, and ahead of the consensus at $1.51.\n\nTouting strength across its business, CEO Hock Tan said, \"We expect continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue of $4.4 billion in Q2, as hyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.\"\n\nWhat's next for Broadcom?\n\nBroadcom has long been seen as a winner from AI, and that forecast is starting to bear fruit, as these numbers and Tan's comments indicate.\n\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, the company expects revenue of $14.9 billion, up 20% from the quarter a year ago and in line with estimates.

But will these hold?\n\nThis is a reasonable question as we watch the rise of homegrown XPUs for AI processing by the hyperscalers and cloud builders. They are all in various stages of creating their own Arm-based CPUs and vector/tensor math engines for AI workloads and, maybe someday, for supporting some traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads.\n\nThe hyperscalers and cloud builders may design these CPUs and GPUs, but they get help, and Broadcom and Marvell have a lot more experience, either directly or through acquisitions, and they are the ones who are doing the helping. They have a hand in guiding the designs and providing IP blocks like SerDes or PCI-Express or memory controllers. They also get paid to get the custom chips through the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co foundry (and if Intel is lucky, maybe some day one of its fabs using 18A or 14A processes) as well as to implement various dimensioned \u2013 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and 3.5D \u2013 packaging.\n\nThis work to help bring these custom CPU and XPU compute engines into being has been a boon for Marvell and Broadcom alike. But as you might imagine, selling services and technology to the likes the hyperscalers cloud builders is no easy task.\n\nMarvell has lined up Amazon Web Services (Inferentia 2 and Trainium 2, with Trainium 3 in the works), Google (for the Axion Arm CPU), Meta Platforms (for a new DPU), and Microsoft (for a future AI accelerator, presumably the \u201cAthena 2\u201d Maia 200). Broadcom has Google (for its TPU AI accelerators), Meta Platforms (presumably for the MTIA AI accelerator), and ByteDance (also presumably for a custom AI accelerator). Broadcom is rumored to be working with Apple and OpenAI on their own AI accelerators, too.\n\nThese are the toughest customers in the IT sector, and they want to pay the least amount of money possible for the highest level of service. These homegrown CPUs and XPUs have to cost a lot less than Intel and AMD CPUs and Nvidia and AMD GPUs to make it all economically worthwhile. Otherwise, why bother?\n\nBoth Broadcom and Marvell also have a variety of interconnects and electro-optical components that they sell to the hyperscalers and cloud builders, for both their generic compute networks and their new AI back-end networks.\n\nAt the moment, Broadcom\u2019s AI business alone is about the size of all of Marvell\u2019s business, but Marvell is growing its datacenter business fast and it is an alternative in many of the markets that Broadcom plays in. So much of Broadcom\u2019s revenue comes from legacy big iron software and now VMware, but in the chips racket overall, Broadcom is about four times the size of Marvell. Size matters, but so does optionality, and that is why we can expect for both companies to have a growing business both selling their own chips and helping others bring their own to market.\n\nThe business is lumpy, as has always been the case with high performance computing because capacity needs are fulfilled in large chunks rather than a continuous stream to make the economics work better. Buying a big cluster every three or four years gets you a better deal than buying a third or a quarter of a system every year. This was true of HPC centers since the 1970s until today and it is true of every AI center.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, which was the first of its fiscal 2025 and which ended on February 2, Broadcom posted sales of $14.92 billion, up 24.7 percent from the year ago period. The company brought $5.5 billion to the bottom line, a factor of 4.2X higher than a year ago when it was digesting VMware and restructuring.\n\nBroadcom ended the first fiscal quarter with $9.31 billion in the bank and $66.58 billion in debts. It does not seem to be in a hurry to pay down its debts, but they are down a smidgen from this time last year.\n\nBroadcom is split into two groups \u2013 Infrastructure Software and Semiconductor Solutions \u2013 and this is the first quarter when we do not have all that much visibility into VMware. On the call, Broadcom chief executive officer Hock Tan said that 70 percent of the top 10,000 VMware customers had been upsold from the vSphere/ESXi server virtualization hypervisor with perpetual licenses to the full VMware Cloud Foundation suite, which virtualizes servers, networks, and storage. Very little was said about VMware revenues, other than they were growing. We think revenues came in at $4.61 billion because overall software revenues were up 47 percent year on year but we do not think the Computer Associates conglomerate of mainframe and Unix databases and tools grew all that much. For the math to work, VMware would have to post that much in sales, which is a factor of 2.2X increase. But, as we say, this is an informed guess with those assumptions. We do this for you in the absence of data.\n\nThe Infrastructure Software group had $6.71 billion in sales, up 46.7 percent year on year; operating income for the group was just a tad under $5.1 billion, up by 87.7 percent. As we all expected, Tan has cut deep enough and restructured the VMware products enough to pull a lot of profit out of the few that are still in the SKU stack. This is something that prior VMware managers could have done \u2013 Pat Gelsinger when he ran VMware from 2012 to 2021 or Michael Dell after he bought VMware in 2016 alongside of EMC \u2013 but chose not to, making VMware a takeover target as soon as it went public for the second time when Dell was over owning and needed to pay down some of its debts from the VMware and EMC acquisitions.\n\nTan is extracting 76 percent of software revenues as operating income, which is pretty high even for Broadcom and its legacy and largely captive software businesses.\n\nIn Q1 F2025, Broadcom\u2019s Semiconductor Solutions chip business had $8.21 billion in sales, up 11.1 percent and down a tad sequentially. Operating income was $4.68 billion, up 13.7 percent and accounting for 57 percent of revenues. This is about as high as Tan can push it usually, given the enormous investments necessary in its Ethernet merchant silicon business and now its AI compute engine shepherding business.\n\nRather than give out precise growth figures or share figures for Q1 F2025 for its chip business, as it has done in the past, this time around Broadcom gave Wall Street vague ranges for growth among its five operating divisions in the Semiconductor Solutions group. We have pumped our best interpretations of the tea leaves that Broadcom gave us to figure out where each business is at.\n\nAs best we can figure, the core Networking group at Broadcom was up 35.2 percent to $4.52 billion, which was only up 1.6 percent sequentially. Server storage connectivity was up 8.5 percent to $962 million in our model, and wireless chippery was up a mere 1 percent year on year to just a tad over $2 billion, which was down 6,2 percent sequentially. Broadband chips brought in $539 million, down 43 percent, but up 16 percent sequentially.\n\nWhich brings us to AI chip co-design and manufacturing shepherding revenues and networking revenues relating to AI workloads.\n\nWe think that Broadcom had $4.12 billion in AI chip sales, up 77 percent year on year and up 15.2 percent sequentially. This was significantly better than the $3.8 billion guidance that Broadcom gave for the quarter thirteen weeks ago.\n\nAll other semiconductor sales accounted for $4.09 billion, down 19.2 percent year on year. You see why Broadcom wants to talk about AI XPUs and AI networks a lot.\n\nWithin this, AI compute was the big winner this quarter, but it was pretty slow last quarter as partners took a breather. In Q1 F2025, AI XPU sales were $2.47 billion, up 63.4 percent. AI networking revenues were more than double at $1.65 billion, but down 51.3 percent sequentially as far as we can tell.\n\nLooking ahead to Q2 F2025, Tan said Broadcom expected AI sales of $4.4 billion, which would be an increase of 44 percent compared to Q2 F2024.\n\nAs a teaser for future quarters, Tan said it is in the process (pun intended) of taping out the industry\u2019s first AI XPU based on 2 nanometer processes and using 3.5D packaging, which will push up to a 10,000 teraflops device. (Ah, but at what precision?) Tan added that Broadcom has taped out its \u201cTomahawk 6\u201d StrataXGS Ethernet switch ASIC, which will have an aggregate bandwidth of over 100 Tb/sec and which has 200 Gb/sec SerDes to drive 1.6 Tb/sec Ethernet ports. First samples of Tomahawk 6 will be shipped to initial customers in the next few months.\n\nTo keep track: Broadcom has three hyperscaler and cloud builder customers it is making compute engines for, it has two more in the works (Apple and OpenAI, as noted above) and now we come to find out that two more hyperscalers have tapped Broadcom to make custom AI accelerators for training. (We do not yet know who they might be, but the list ain\u2019t long, is it?)\n\nLooking ahead, Broadcom is expecting for revenue to be flat sequentially in Q2 F2025 to $14.9 billion, which is an increase of 19.3 percent year on year. The company said further thar it expects for Infrastructure Software to post $6.5 billion in sales in Q2, which is 23 percent growth and which will probably be down $200 million in sales. The good news is that Semiconductor Solutions will see around a $200 million bump offsetting this decline, rising 16.6 percent year on year to $8.4 billion. We think the custom ASIC business will represent a lot of that sequential growth.\n\nIf this all stabilizes and the world economy doesn\u2019t get thrown into recession by trade wars and actual wars \u2013 wars are always trade wars, but trade wars are not always wars \u2013 then it looks like Broadcom will be in a position to start paying down its massive debts with net income roughly equal to 40 percent of revenues. You gotta love sticky legacy software businesses with long time horizons and no easy alternatives.\n\nFinally, that brings us to Marvell. Imagine how terrible the past few quarters would have been if Marvell had not bought the custom silicon business that was formerly part of IBM and was more recently part of GlobalFoundries as well as the aptly named Inphi, which supplies PHY communication transport circuits used in electro-optical interconnect components.\n\nIt would have been bad. But, as it turns out, it has been good. In fact, Marvell is making money \u2013 meaning net income \u2013 for the first time in a nine quarters and really the first time five years. And if this is sustainable, Marvell will be able to grow revenues and retain profits like it has not done in a decade and a half.\n\nIn the quarter ended on February 1, which was the fourth quarter of Marvell\u2019s fiscal 2025 year, the company booked $1.82 billion in sales, up 27.4 percent and up 19.9 percent sequentially. Operating income was $235 million, a sharp reversal from the $33 million loss a year ago, and net income was $200 million, an even better reversal compared to the $393 million it lost a year ago.\n\nMarvell ended the quarter with $948 million in cash and $3.93 billion in debt. The company\u2019s datacenter business, which includes various kinds of compute engines and controllers as well as custom CPU and XPU ASIC services, had sales of $1.37 billion, up 78.5 percent year on year and up 24 percent sequentially. Enterprise networking, which is mainly the Teralynx switch ASIC line from its Innovium acquisition plus some homegrown Ethernet stuff, had $171 million in sales, down 35.3 percent but rebounding from a three quarter trough that we think was caused by a shift in focus away from general purpose infrastructure toward AI clusters.\n\nThe other Marvell groups are not all that interesting to us, and frankly Datacenter plus Enterprise Networking comprised 84.6 percent of the company\u2019s revenues. This is, in effect, the Marvell business.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025 year, the Datacenter group had $4.16 billion in sales, up 87.9 percent, and Enterprise Networking group had sales of $626 million, down 49 percent.\n\nWhat everyone wants to know is how AI compute engines and AI electro-optics (Inphi stuff again) are doing. And we listened to the same call that Wall Street did and took a crack at building a model of AI sales at Marvell. Marvell provided guidance earlier in the fiscal 2025 year that its AI revenues would be at least $1.5 billion for the year, and expected sales to break through $2.6 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nAs Matt Murphy, Marvell\u2019s chief executive officer, put it on the call going over the latest financials with Wall Street, the company \u201cblew by\u201d its F2025 estimate for AI sales, and expects to do better than its original forecast for F2026, too. But it didn\u2019t say by how much. After looking at other models and talking with some peer model builders, we reckon Marvell did about $1.85 billion in AI revenue in F2025 and that it will do over $3 billion in F2026 \u2013 perhaps even higher than $3.5 billion if this custom AI XPU and AI networking thing takes off and there is heavy demand for electro-optics.\n\nAs best we can figure, Marvell did $272 million in custom AI XPU revenue in Q4, up by a factor of 10.7X compared to a year ago, and electro-optics for AI rose by 3X to $580 million. Add it up, and AI revenues at Marvell were $852 million in Q4 F2025, up 3.9X year on year. AI comprised 62.4 percent of Datacenter group sales, and Datacenter comprised more than three-quarters of overall revenues. Which is another way of saying that Marvell is now a datacenter player like it has always wanted to be.\n\nIn our model for the full F2025 year, Marvell raked in $711 million in AI XPUs, up by nearly 9X compared to F2024. Electro-optics brought in the other $1.14 billion that gets the company to $1.85 billion in AI sales for the year.\n\nWe think that Marvell can do at least $1.15 billion in AI XPU revenue in F2026, with electro-optics bringing in another $1.87 billion. We shall see. A lot depends on Marvell finding new hyperscaler and cloud builder customers, or helping to convince tier two service providers and government labs to collaborate on a shared AI XPU design that gives them benefits over just buying Nvidia GPUs. Admittedly, for these companies, buying Nvidia GPUs is the safest bet, and it is not like GPUs are not holding a lot of their value over time in the open market. A GPU is perhaps a better investment than a lot of stocks and bonds are right now. Which is why we call them Hoprcoin.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025.\n\nThe market has been reversing its gains earlier in the year, so much so that the S&P 500 is now down 1.5% year-to-date. The past two years have seen the same index post stellar gains back-to-back, and those gains were mostly spearheaded by big-cap stocks.\n\nHowever, historically speaking, the market delivering a third year of such returns would be unprecedented. Investors believe that 2025 will likely be a year when the market starts to cool off, and recent events have started a trend toward just that.\n\nBig-cap stocks are now leading the way down as tariff and AI-related fears hurt them the most. Many big-cap companies have invested significantly in these tech trends, which investors have now soured on.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on the big-cap losers year-to-date. Many of them have declined enough to open up buying opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the worst-performing big-cap stocks year-to-date.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Broadcom Inc (AVGO) Is Plunging So Far in 2025?\n\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 161\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the biggest semiconductor companies.\n\nThe stock is down significantly so far in 2025 as investors are concerned about AI spending and new tariff announcements by the Trump administration. There are also risks of expanded chip restrictions on China along with new restrictions on Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nMost AI-related stocks have pulled back, and since Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is sitting on significant gains, it isn\u2019t unusual that some shareholders are taking profits.\n\nThe consensus price target of $225 implies 20% upside.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is down 19.13% year-to-date.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Broadcom Inc. ((AVGO)) has held its Q1 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nBroadcom Inc. Earnings Call Highlights Robust AI and Software Growth\n\nThe recent earnings call for Broadcom Inc. painted a picture of robust financial performance, underscored by impressive growth in the AI and infrastructure software segments. The company reported significant AI revenue growth and strategic investments in research and development, which have been pivotal in driving this success. However, challenges persist in the non-AI semiconductor sector, which is experiencing a slow recovery and seasonal declines. Despite these hurdles, the positive momentum in AI and software growth appears to outweigh the negatives in other areas.\n\nRecord-Breaking Revenue and EBITDA\n\nBroadcom Inc. achieved record-breaking financial results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, with total revenue reaching $14.9 billion, a 25% increase year over year. The company\u2019s consolidated adjusted EBITDA also saw a remarkable rise, hitting $10.1 billion, up 41% from the previous year. These figures highlight Broadcom\u2019s strong market position and operational efficiency.\n\nAI Revenue Growth\n\nAI-related revenue was a standout performer in Q1, amounting to $4.1 billion, which represents a 77% increase year over year. Looking ahead, Broadcom expects AI revenue to continue its upward trajectory, projecting growth to $4.4 billion in Q2, a 44% year-on-year increase. This growth underscores the company\u2019s strategic focus on AI technologies.\n\nInfrastructure Software Surge\n\nThe infrastructure software segment also experienced significant growth, with Q1 revenue reaching $6.7 billion, a 47% increase year over year. This surge was driven by increased revenue from VMware and a strategic shift from perpetual licenses to full subscriptions, reflecting a successful adaptation to changing market demands.\n\nR&D Investment in AI\n\nBroadcom is ramping up its R&D investment in AI, focusing on developing new accelerator technologies and scaling for hyperscale customers. The company anticipates a significant serviceable addressable market by 2027, positioning itself for long-term growth in the AI sector.\n\nSeasonal Decline in Non-AI Semiconductor Revenue\n\nDespite the overall positive performance, Broadcom faced challenges in the non-AI semiconductor sector, where revenue declined by 9% sequentially. This decline was attributed to seasonal factors affecting the wireless segment, as well as a slow recovery in areas like server storage and enterprise networking.\n\nResales in Industrial Down\n\nThe industrial segment saw a downturn, with resales dropping by double digits in Q1. This trend is expected to continue into Q2, indicating ongoing challenges in this part of the business.\n\nChallenges with New Customer Engagements\n\nBroadcom is exploring new partnerships in the AI space, with four potential partners identified. However, these engagements are still in the early stages and have not yet contributed to the company\u2019s projected serviceable addressable market of $60 to $90 billion by 2027.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking forward, Broadcom has provided guidance for the second quarter, projecting total revenue to remain steady at approximately $14.9 billion, with an anticipated adjusted EBITDA margin of 66%. The company expects semiconductor revenue to grow by 2% sequentially and 17% year over year, driven by a continued rise in AI revenue. In the infrastructure software segment, Q2 revenue is expected to be around $6.5 billion, marking a 23% increase year over year.\n\nIn summary, Broadcom Inc.\u2019s earnings call highlighted a strong financial performance, driven by robust growth in AI and infrastructure software segments. While challenges remain in the non-AI semiconductor sector, the company\u2019s strategic investments and forward-looking guidance suggest a positive outlook. Investors and market watchers will be keen to see how Broadcom navigates these dynamics in the coming quarters.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Key Takeaways The S&P 500 added 0.6% on Friday, March 7, after the February jobs report showed a slight recovery in hiring from the previous month.\n\nBroadcom shares soared after the chipmaker topped quarterly estimates, highlighting strong AI-driven growth.\n\nShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise dropped after the IT services provider issued soft profit guidance and announced cost-cutting measures.\n\nMajor U.S. equities indexes staged an afternoon rally to end with daily gains, wrapping up a turbulent trading week in which investors fixated on shifting trade policies.\n\nThe partial recovery on Friday came after the latest labor market data showed that the U.S. economy added 151,000 jobs in February, up from the prior month but below economists' expectations.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 0.6% on Friday. The Dow closed 0.5%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.7%. Despite the uptick heading into the weekend, all three market gauges ended solidly in negative territory for the full week.\n\nThe top performance in the S&P 500 on Friday belonged to shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which surged 8.6% after the chipmaker topped quarterly sales and profit forecasts. The semiconductor firm highlighted strength in its artificial intelligence (AI) business. Broadcom's revenue guidance for the current quarter also came in ahead of consensus estimates, with the company anticipating continued strength in AI processing units and data center connectivity solutions.\n\nShares of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a manufacturer of wireless connectivity chips for smartphones, tablets, and other devices, jumped 8.5%. The move higher came despite a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors regarding its revenue outlook. Skyworks shares plunged a month ago after the chipmaker predicted a slowdown in mobile revenue driven by decreasing business from Apple (AAPL), its largest customer.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) agreed to a $10 billion buyout deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners, and shares of the drugstore operator popped 7.5% higher. Sycamore said it would pay $11.45 per share for the pharmacy chain, approximately 8% higher than Thursday's closing price. The transaction to take the company private follows a difficult period for Walgreens, which announced plans in October to close around 1,200 underperforming locations.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares plummeted 12.0%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock after the IT services provider issued lower-than-expected quarterly and full-year profit guidance. The maker of data center equipment indicated that pricing pressure on its traditional servers could strain near-term sales growth and announced cost-cutting plans that include reducing staff by around 5%.\n\nShares of Costco Wholesale (COST) dropped 6.1% after the membership warehouse club operator reported mixed financial results for its fiscal second quarter. Although revenue exceeded forecasts, boosted by higher traffic in stores and online, net income fell shy of expectations, reflecting increased merchandise costs.\n\nCooper Companies (COO) missed quarterly sales estimates, and shares of the consumer medical equipment maker fell 6.6%. The company reported soft revenues in its CooperVision business in the Asia-Pacific region as well as its CooperSurgical fertility business. Stifel analysts trimmed their price target on Cooper Companies stock but maintained their \"buy\" rating.\n\n",

            "content": "Broadcom\u2019s acquisition of VMware appears to be a big success, on the balance sheet at least, after the company announced a big majority of its top 10,000 customers have decided to acquire its Cloud Foundation stack and posted strong growth.\n\nThe chips-and-code company today announced its results for the quarter ended February 2nd, its first for FY 2025. Revenue of $14.92 billion represented 25 percent year-on-year growth. Net income of $5.5 billion was a 315 percent increase on the result from Q1 2024.\n\nBroadcom no longer breaks out VMware revenue: sales of Virtzilla\u2019s wares are all now lumped into its infrastructure software business unit, which posted $6.7 billion revenue for Q1, up from $4.55 billion for the same quarter last year. Direct comparisons of those numbers are not wise as Broadcom owned VMware for four fifths of Q1 2024.\n\nConsider, instead, the $1.97 billion Q4 2023 and $7.6 billion FY 2023 software revenue that Broadcom recorded before it acquired VMware. Know, also, that Broadcom\u2019s software sales grew by just three percent in FY 2023 and four percent in FY 2022.\n\nThat slow growth means the jump from $1.97 billion software revenue in Q4 2023 to $6.7 billion in Q1 2025 is likely due to VMware, which in its last quarter as an independent company reported $3.4 billion revenue.\n\nIt therefore looks a lot like Broadcom has added around $1 billion to quarterly VMware revenue in a little over a year.\n\nHow did it do that? As The Register has often explained, Broadcom stopped selling standalone VMware products and now only sells bundles of code and support under subscriptions that are more costly that Virtzilla\u2019s previous licenses.\n\nThe biggest of those bundles is VMWare Cloud Foundation (VCF) and on Broadcom\u2019s earnings call CEO Hock Tan told investors \u201cWe are upselling customers to a full stack VCF \u2026 and as of the end of Q1, approximately 70 percent of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF.\u201d\n\nBigger bills for existing VCF customers, and upselling others to VCF, probably explains the extra revenue.\n\nSome of the extra net income probably comes from cutting costs at VMware, which in its final standalone quarter reported operating margin of 16 percent. Broadcom\u2019s software business delivered 76 percent operating margin in Q1, an improvement on the 59 percent reported a year ago.\n\nThe Register continues to hear of big migrations away from VMware, but on the numbers Broadcom\u2019s plans appear to have succeeded.\n\nHyperscale heaven\n\nThe other eye-catching news in Broadcom\u2019s results came in the form of news that two additional (and un-named) hyperscalers have engaged the company to create custom AI accelerators. Broadcom already had three active customers for those \u201cXPUs\u201d. Now it has four that Hock Tan described as \u201cdeeply engaged\u201d.\n\nBuyers of custom silicon tend not to reveal the specs of the stuff they buy, but Tan gave a hint by revealed Broadcom is taping out \u201cthe industry's first two nanometer AI XPU packaging as we drive towards a 10,000 teraflops XPU.\u201d He also mentioned work to deliver current hyperscale customers clusters that run 500,000 accelerators, then push to the million-accelerator clusters Broadcom\u2019s three existing hyperscale customers want to run by 2027.\n\nTan mentioned accelerated R&D on Broadcom\u2019s Tomahawk Ethernet switches and said million-accelerator clusters will use Ethernet too.\n\nSemiconductor revenue hit $8.2 billion, an 11 percent year-on-year lift.\n\n$4.1 billion of it came from AI-related products, 77 percent year-on-year growth and $300 million ahead of forecasts thanks to \u201cstronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers on AI.\u201d\n\nSelling to, and living with, Donald Trump\n\nOn the same day as Broadcom\u2019s results announcement, the CEO also used his blog to suggest the US government should build more VMware-powered on-prem private clouds in line with what he described as the second Trump Administration\u2019s \u201ctwo key objectives: reduce excessive federal government spending and advance the modernization of the federal government\u2019s IT infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTan\u2019s post reveals that since acquiring VMware, Broadcom has consolidated 42 datacenters into seven facilities.\n\nAsked about the Trump administration\u2019s policy of introducing tariffs, Tan said it is too early to predict their impact.\n\nFor what it is worth, Broadcom\u2019s share price is off by about 25 percent for the calendar year. One likely reason is the hit all AI-related stocks took after DeepSeek\u2019s debut led to a rethink of how much hardware will be needed to run AI workloads. Trump\u2019s tariffs may be another, as most Broadcom products are manufactured outside the USA.\n\nAfter-hours trading following Broadcom\u2019s earnings announcement saw its scrip jump from around $180 to settle at just over $200 apiece. That\u2019s still well below the price for most of January and February 2025, but above the price per share through calendar 2024.\n\nOne more thing: Tan was asked if he\u2019s shopping for more companies. \u201cNo, I'm too busy,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe're too busy doing AI and VMware. We're not thinking of it at this point.\u201d\n\nSo maybe those rumors about Broadcom buying a chunk of Intel were just that \u2013 rumors. \u00ae",

Revenue in the last quarter rose 25% from $11.96 billion a year earlier.\n\n\n\nThe company said net income increased to $5.5 billion, or $1.14 per share, from $1.33 billion, or 28 cents per share, in the same period last year.\n\nBroadcom's artificial intelligence business is at the center of the company's recent boom, which saw its stock price more than double last year. The company is one of the primary data center infrastructure vendors for AI, working both on Google's custom AI chips as well as providing essential components for networking thousands of other chips together to develop advanced AI software.\n\nPrior to the after-hours pop, the stock was down about 23% so far in 2025, as investors rotate out of risk partly due to concern about President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nBroadcom said it recorded $4.1 billion in AI revenue during the first quarter, which is 77% higher on a year-over-year basis. Those sales are reported as part of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions business, which grew 11% on an annual basis to $8.21 billion during the quarter.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects \"continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue,\" reaching a projected $4.4 billion in the second quarter.\n\nIn December, Broadcom said it was developing custom AI chips with three large cloud customers. Tan said on Thursday that in addition to those customers, the company had \"deeply engaged\" with two other hyperscalers, and is working with four other potential customers to develop their own custom AI chips.\n\nTan said that Broadcom closely chooses partners for developing custom AI chips who can deploy the resulting product in large quantities.\n\n\"To put it bluntly, we don't do it for startups,\" Tan said.\n\nThe other major part of Broadcom's revenue comes from its infrastructure software division, which includes software from the company's acquisition of VMware in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023.

            "content": "Broadcom is urging organizations, MSSPs, and others running VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion to apply patches immediately to protect against zero-day vulnerabilities that the IT giant said are being exploited in the wild.\n\nThe security flaws \u2013 tracked as CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226 \u2013 that can allow bad actors that already have privileged access to break out of the compromised virtual machine (VM) and grab control of the underlying host system. That gives them a launching pad into other parts of the system.\n\nThe most critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-22224 , lets attackers who already have administrative access inside a VM to execute code on the host, which could give giving them control over all the other VMs running on the same server, according to Patrick Tiquet, vice president of security and architecture at Keeper Security.\n\nCritical Flaws\n\n\u201cThe danger here is that once attackers gain access at this level, they can spread across the entire system, steal data, and install backdoors to maintain access,\u201d Tiquet said.\n\nBroadcom issued an alert about the vulnerabilities this week and a notice in GitHub . The company gave one flaw, CVE-2025-22224, a criticality score of 9.3 out of 10, and said it affects VMware ESXi and Workstation. An attacker with local administrative privileges on a VM can exploit it to run code on the host system.\n\nAnother vulnerability, CVE-2025-22225 (with a score of 8.2), is described as an arbitrary write flaw on ESXi that also can enable an attacker to escape the operating system sandbox by executing malicious code and take control of the host. The third vulnerability, CVE-2025-22226 (7.1), affects ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion and allows a hacker to leak information.\n\nThere are no workarounds for any of the vulnerabilities. CISA also has put them on its list of exploited vulnerabilities , adding the federal agencies have until March 25 to apply the patches.\n\nEscaping the Sandbox\n\nIn its GitHub notice, Broadcom wrote that \u201cyou are affected if you are running any version of VMware ESX, VMware vSphere, VMware Cloud Foundation, or VMware Telco Cloud Platform prior to the versions listed as \u2018fixed\u2019 in the VMSA [VMware Security Advisory].\u201d\n\nBroadcom, which bought VMware in 2023 for $69 billion, didn\u2019t detail how the security flaws were being exploited by threat actors. Broadcom noted that Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center reported the active exploitation of the vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough the three vulnerabilities share the goal of escaping the virtual machine sandbox to compromise the hypervisor, they differ technically,\u201d said Jason Sokoro, senior fellow at Sectigo. \u201cTheir varied profiles give attackers multiple options. One flaw can be exploited independently, or they can be chained to build a more robust attack path, increasing the chance of a successful breach.\u201d\n\nSokoro said that the attackers likely are sophisticated state-sponsored or advanced persistent threat (APT) with the necessary resource to get past initial defenses. He added that \u201ctheir end goals include establishing deep, persistent access to virtualized infrastructures, bypassing security boundaries, moving laterally, exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying additional malware, and disrupting services.\u201d\n\nKeeper Security\u2019s Tiquet said that given that the vulnerabilities are being exploited by bad actors, organizations need apply the patches immediately and take other steps, including enforcing strict access controls and implementing strong authentication for administrators.\n\nRansomware Groups and ESXi\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen both cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups exploit VMware vulnerabilities in the past to establish long-term persistence,\u201d he said.\n\nRansomware groups have targeted ESXi in particular in the past. Forescout researchers last year wrote that the trend of such groups exploiting the hypervisor started to ramp up in 2021 after the source code for the Babuk ransomware was leaked and that it accelerated in 2023 and 2024 , with such ransomware gangs as Akira and Cactus targeting ESXi.\n\nSentinelOne in 2023 identified 10 ransomware families \u2013 including BlackCat/ALPHV, Conti, Black Basta, and LockBit \u2013 using ESXi lockers based on the 2021 Babuk source code, and Microsoft last year wrote about attackers exploiting another vulnerability in the hypervisor\n\n\u201cESXi hypervisors host virtual machines that may include critical servers in a network,\u201d Microsoft wrote. \u201cIn a ransomware attack, having full administrative permission on an ESXi hypervisor can mean that the threat actor can encrypt the file system, which may affect the ability of the hosted servers to run and function.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft also noted that \u201cit also allows the threat actor to access hosted VMs and possibly to exfiltrate data or move laterally within the network.\u201d",

Like Marvell, Broadcom is a player in the connectivity-chips space -- and investors are selling out of both stocks as investors become more cautious about the stock market's near-term outlook.\n\nReaction to Marvell's Q4 report is driving bearish momentum for other AI stocks\n\nMarvell published its fourth-quarter results yesterday, and performance came in broadly better than Wall Street's expectations. The business notched non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.60 on revenue of $1.82 billion. For comparison, the average Wall Street analyst forecast had estimated that Marvell would report per-share earnings of $0.59 on revenue of $1.8 billion for the quarter.\n\nStrikingly, Marvell's forward guidance also beat the average Wall Street estimates -- with its midpoint target for revenue of $1.875 billion exceeding the average analyst estimate's forecast for sales of $1.87 billion in the period. Marvell's stock is down 18.9% as of 2:30 p.m. ET in Thursday's trading, and the bearish reaction to the company's earnings report is extending to Broadcom and other AI stocks.\n\nWhat's next for Broadcom?\n\nBig sell-offs for Marvell stock despite a mostly strong Q4 report highlight the potential for Broadcom stock to continue to see high levels of volatility in the near term.

He is being recognized for his \u201cpioneering research and commercialization of broadband communication and networking technologies, and promotion of STEM education.\u201d The news was announced on 20 February in New York City at a dedicated press conference.\n\nSamueli is the first recipient of the IEEE Medal of Honor since its monetary prize was increased to US $2 million from $50,000. IEEE sponsors the annual award.\n\nReceiving the honor \u201cis overwhelming when I think about all the past recipients,\u201d Samueli said at the press conference. They include technology pioneers and IEEE Life Fellows Robert Kahn, Vint Cerf, and Mildred Dresselhaus.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at that list, it really is humbling to even be considered,\u201d Samueli said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply honored.\u201d\n\nWhile an engineering professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the late 1980s, Samueli and one of his Ph.D. students conceived digital signal processing architectures for broadband communications chips and designed the world\u2019s first chips for digital interactive television. After publishing their research, they decided to commercialize their product and in 1991 founded Broadcom in San Jose, Calif. They built the first digital cable set-top-box modem chipset, which served as the cable signal receiver.\n\nToday Samueli is chairman of the company\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cThrough broadband, Henry Samueli helped revolutionize how the world is connected, fostered cultural and economic paradigm shifts of countless industries, and positively changed how we do everything today,\u201d 2022 IEEE President and CEO K. J. Ray Liu said at the news conference. Liu is also the chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on Raising the Prestige of IEEE Awards. \u201cIn addition, his prolific philanthropy has deeply impacted many lives for the better\u2014from generous support of STEM education to a pledge to give away the majority of his money during his lifetime. These contributions are exemplary for technologists, modeling the impact they can have not just on the world they live in but for those who follow them.\u201d\n\nOne engine of Samueli\u2019s philanthropy, the Samueli Foundation, supports science, technology, engineering, and math education; integrative health; youth services; and social justice programs.\n\nThis year\u2019s Medal of Honor, along with other high-profile IEEE awards, will be presented at the IEEE Honors Ceremony, to be held on 24 April in Tokyo.\n\nDeveloping broadband technology\n\nSamueli, who grew up in Los Angeles, was inspired to pursue a career in electrical engineering after building an AM/FM shortwave radio using a Heathkit electronics kit for a shop class, according to a 2021 Institute profile of Samueli. After graduating high school, he attended UCLA, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1975, a master\u2019s degree in 1976, and a doctorate in 1980, all in electrical engineering. He then joined defense contractor TRW at its Redondo Beach, Calif., campus as a member of the technical staff.\n\nWhile there, he also taught engineering courses at California State University, Northridge, and UCLA. In 1985 he accepted UCLA\u2019s offer to become an EE professor. In addition to teaching, he supervised research programs in broadband communications circuits and digital signal processing. It was at UCLA that he and one of his Ph.D. students founded Broadcom.\n\nSamueli took a leave of absence from UCLA to work at Broadcom full time as its CTO. He served in that position until 2018, two years after the company merged with semiconductor manufacturer Avago Technologies, also of San Jose.\n\nSupporting STEM education\n\nSamueli has made major societal, educational, and economic impact through his philanthropic work, donating more than $1 billion to organizations focusing on STEM education, underserved youth, and integrative health.\n\nIn 2000 he and his wife, Susan, donated $30 million to UCLA\u2019s engineering school, which then was named after him. In 2019 the Samueli Foundation donated $100 million more.\n\n\u201cThrough broadband, Henry Samueli helped revolutionize how the world is connected, fostered cultural and economic paradigm shifts of countless industries, and positively changed how we do everything today.\u201d \u2014K. J. Ray Liu\n\nThe foundation also gave $200 million in 2017 to the University of California, Irvine. The university used the gift for the construction and endowment of the Samueli College of Health Sciences, which focuses on interdisciplinary integrative health.\n\nSamueli and his wife founded the Samueli Academy in Santa Ana, Calif., an underserved community in Orange County. The public charter school is for middle and high school students, some of whom live in foster care.\n\nThe Samuelis are members of the Giving Pledge, a group that consists of leading philanthropists who promise to give away the majority of their money during their lifetime.\n\nAdvice for the next generation of engineers\n\nAfter the press conference in New York, Samueli joined 2025 IEEE President and CEO Kathleen Kramer, the organization\u2019s Executive Director and COO Sophia Muirhead, and Liu, for a fireside chat. Samueli explained the role IEEE has played in his career, and he spoke to the next generation of engineers.\n\nHe joined IEEE when he was a UCLA undergraduate, he said, because he wanted to access the research of faculty and students from around the world.\n\n\u201cIEEE has been an invaluable resource for me throughout my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to accomplish anything without IEEE\u2019s resources.\u201d\n\nSamueli, an eminent member of the IEEE\u2013Eta Kappa Nu honor society, received the 2021 IEEE Founders Medal for \u201cleadership in research, development, and commercialization of broadband communication and networking technology with global impact.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Muirhead to advise current students and young professionals, he said: \u201cFasten your seat belts because the world is changing at a pace now that we have never seen before.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished my college career and was entering the engineering profession as a researcher in semiconductors and communications, we had so-called Moore\u2019s Law, which is predictable,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I don\u2019t know anybody who can say they know what artificial intelligence is going to bring us in five years, let alone in one year or two years.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged students and young professionals to be adaptable and flexible, and not to worry about failing, because it\u2019s to be expected.\n\nTo learn more about his career and philanthropic work, read IEEE Spectrum\u2019sprofile of him in the upcoming May print edition.",

            "content": "Broadcom is giving its VMware customers some all-too-familiar advice once again: Install updates to patch vulnerabilities in VMware offerings, this time for three actively exploited zero-day flaws found in its ESXi, Workstation and Fusion products.\n\nThe flaws, reported to Broadcom by researchers at Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, are tracked as CVE-2025-22225, a high-severity arbitrary write vulnerability in VMware ESXi; CVE-2025-22224, a critical-severity Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability in VMware ESXi and Workstation; and CVE-2025-22226, a high-severity information disclosure vulnerability in VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion.\n\nOn the upside for VMware customers, the flaws require that attackers already have administrative access to the system for exploitation to succeed. On the downside, cyber threat actors already have found a way to achieve such exploitation, which prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) to add the flaws to its known exploited vulnerabilities database. Attackers also can exploit the flaws individually or chain them together for a more powerful attack.\n\nOf the three flaws, the critical CVE-2025-22224 is the most worrying one for enterprises, as it potentially gives attackers control over all the other VMs running on the same server, said Patrick Tiquet, vice president of security and architecture at security firm Keeper Security.\n\n\"The danger here is that once attackers gain access at this level, they can spread across the entire system, steal data and install backdoors to maintain access,\" he said in an email with Cybersecurity Dive.\n\nFurther, what's most dangerous about the chained vulnerabilities is their ability to allow attackers to break out of guest OS sandboxes and seize hypervisor control, \u201cextending their reach to all hosted virtual machines and the underlying infrastructure,\" said Jason Soroko, senior fellow at certificate life cycle management firm Sectigo.\n\n\"In a worst-case scenario, this breach permits reconfiguration of the hypervisor, lateral movement across systems, exfiltration of sensitive data, disruption of services and the deployment of additional malware, effectively compromising the entire virtualized ecosystem,\" he said in an emailed statement.\n\nHistory of VMware vulnerabilities\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities have represented a persistent issue for VMware virtualization products, which are ubiquitously used across cloud-based enterprise environments and therefore can present a broad attack surface for threat actors. The frequency of flaws in its products have led to criticism of the vendor's security strategy, especially given its widespread use in enterprise cloud deployments.\n\n\u201cRecent cyberattacks targeting VMware products pose a significant and ongoing threat,\" said Chris Gray, field CTO at security firm Deepwatch, via emailed comments to Cybersecurity Dive. Even when patches have been released, \"incomplete application of these remediations leaves systems vulnerable to compromise,\" he added.\n\nThis type of approach to securing VMware products is unacceptable, especially given the company's dominant position in the virtualization market, Gray said. The company holds approximately 42.7% market share \u2014 nearly 300% that of its nearest competitor, with over half of that share in the U.S.\n\n\"Once attackers exploit initial vulnerabilities, they can uncover further weaknesses, creating a cascade effect,\" he said. \"Incomplete vulnerability management and the presence of orphaned virtual machines and cloud instances exacerbate these risks, making virtualization platforms an attractive target for attackers.\"\n\nVarious security companies, including Rapid7 and Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs, joined Broadcom in urging customers to patch affected systems immediately to alleviate risk. Customers can find patch information in Broadcom's security advisory.\n\nCybersecurity Dive had not received comment from Broadcom at this posting.",

            "content": "U.S. technology giant Broadcom is warning that a trio of VMware vulnerabilities are being actively exploited by malicious hackers to compromise the networks of its corporate customers.\n\nThe three vulnerabilities \u2014 collectively dubbed \u201cESXicape\u201d by one security researcher \u2014 affect VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion, which are widely used software hypervisor products that allow multiple virtual machines to be managed on a single server. Hypervisors are commonly used to reduce the need to take up physical server space.\n\nBroadcom, which acquired VMware in 2023, said that the vulnerabilities (tracked as CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226) could allow an attacker with administrator or root privileges on a virtual machine to escape its protected sandbox and gain broader unauthorized access to the underlying hypervisor product.\n\nWith access to the hypervisor, an attacker can gain access to any other virtual machine, including virtual systems owned by other companies within the same physical data center.\n\nBroadcom says it has \u201cinformation to suggest\u201d that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild.\n\n\u201cThe impact here is huge, an attacker who has compromised a hypervisor can go on to compromise any of the other virtual machines that share the same hypervisor,\u201d Stephen Fewer, principal security researcher at threat intelligence company Rapid7, told TechCrunch.\n\nBroadcom did not share any details about the nature of the attacks or the threat actors behind them and did not say whether any customer data had been accessed. A spokesperson for Broadcom did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions. Microsoft, which discovered and reported the vulnerabilities to Broadcom, also didn\u2019t respond by press time.\n\nSecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont said in a post on Mastodon that the three vulnerabilities are actively being exploited by an as-yet-unnamed ransomware group.\n\nVMware vulnerabilities are frequently targeted by ransomware groups due to their ability to be exploited to compromise multiple servers during a single attack, and given that sensitive corporate data is often stored in these virtualized environments.\n\nMicrosoft discovered in 2024 that multiple ransomware groups were exploiting a VMware hypervisor flaw in attacks deploying Black Basta and LockBit ransomware in data-stealing campaigns targeting corporate data. The previous year, a large-scale hacking campaign, dubbed \u201cESXiArgs,\u201d saw ransomware groups exploit a two-year-old VMware vulnerability to target thousands of organizations worldwide.\n\nBroadcom has released patches for the three vulnerabilities, which are classed as \u201czero-day\u201d bugs due to the fact they were exploited before a fix was made available. Broadcom described its security advisory as an \u201cemergency\u201d change and is urging customers to apply the patches as soon as possible.\n\nU.S. government cybersecurity agency CISA is also warning federal agencies to patch against the bugs, which it has added to its running catalog of vulnerabilities known to be under attack.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.",

AVGO stock is down 19% so far in 2025 due to concerns over tariff wars with China and other countries and chip export restrictions. Wall Street expects Broadcom to report a more than 37% year-over-year jump in Q1 FY25 EPS (earnings per share) to $1.51.\n\nFurther, revenue is expected to rise 22.2% to $14.62 billion. Broadcom\u2019s top line is expected to gain from higher infrastructure software revenue due to the successful integration of VMware and solid semiconductor business, driven by the demand for the company\u2019s AI custom accelerators (XPUs) and Ethernet networking portfolio. It is worth noting that Broadcom has exceeded Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates in each of the quarters of the past three fiscal years.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views on AVGO Stock Ahead of Q1 FY25 Earnings\n\nHeading into the Q1 FY25 earnings, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $300. Muse expects the company to deliver a modest beat for Q1 FY25 and an in-line outlook for the April quarter. The analyst thinks that normal wireless seasonality and flattish trends across Custom Silicon will be largely offset by improved AI/non-AI networking business.\n\nMuse expects management to maintain its positive outlook for AI revenues. The analyst estimates FY25 and FY26 AI revenues of $17.8 billion and $24 billion, respectively, fueled by major \u201cstep-ups\u201d in Custom Silicon and continued growth in AI Networking and Storage. Overall, Muse believes that Broadcom remains an AI powerhouse as it moves towards winning a significant market share within its $60 billion to $90 billion AI SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) in FY27 across both Compute and Networking.\n\nMeanwhile, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom stock and raised the price target to $250 from $225. Rolland expects the company to report \u201cgenerally in line to slightly better results/guidance,\u201d fueled by continued AI-led growth and optimization of the VMware portfolio. The five-star analyst added that demand checks by his firm were favorable, as hyperscalers continue to boost AI investments despite DeepSeek fears, with the Stargate project offering additional upside. However, the analyst noted concerns about Apple (AAPL) developing an in-house Wi-Fi/BT (Bluetooth) chip that could replace Broadcom\u2019s offering as soon as the upcoming iPhone 17.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate Major Move on Broadcom\u2019s Q1 Earnings\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry, the Options tool does this for you.\n\nIndeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting about 10% move in either direction in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s Q1 results.\n\nIs AVGO Stock a Good Buy Now?\n\nAhead of Broadcom\u2019s upcoming Q1 FY25 results, Wall Street is highly bullish on Broadcom stock. AVGO stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 23 Buys and two Holds. The average Broadcom stock price target implies about 29.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more AVGO analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

HPE recently retained prominent litigator Beth Wilkinson to represent it in an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Justice Department over the company\u2019s proposed $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks Inc.\n\nSchultz had a lead role in the Juniper \u201cintegration planning and strategy and helped drive the introduction of new sustainable technology offerings,\u201d HPE said. The Spring, Texas-based company also credited Schultz\u2014a former partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\u2014with retaining \u201ckey talent\u201d and maintaining \u201chigh levels of employee engagement.\u201d\n\nThe two legal chiefs are among the highest-paid in the technology industry. Apple Inc. last year awarded $27.7 million in total compensation to its general counsel Katherine Adams. Microsoft Corp.'s Brad Smith, at $23.4 million, and Intuit Inc.'s former general counsel-turned-chief people and places officer Laura Fennell, at $15.8 million, are also among the leaders. Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com Inc. have yet to file proxy statements detailing their legal chiefs\u2019 compensation.\n\nBrazeal had a key role handling the integration of VMware after the transaction closed following its approval by Chinese regulators. Broadcom said he also \u201cdemonstrated leadership in managing legal strategy and risks,\u201d while overseeing commercial litigation, compliance and ethics, corporate governance, cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, and government relations.\n\nThe large stock grant that supersized Brazeal\u2019s pay will vest over four years and was awarded by the San Jose, California-based company\u2019s compensation committee due to his \u201ccriticality to the success of Broadcom\u2019s strategy that includes mergers and acquisitions.\u201d A \u201chyper-competitive market for executive talent\u201d and a \u201cdesire to mitigate retention risks\u201d also led Broadcom to entice Brazeal to remain with the company going forward and continue his contributions to its \u201ctransformative growth strategy,\u201d per its proxy.\n\nSecurities filings show that Brazeal has sold off almost $28.7 million in Broadcom stock within the past year. He still owns company shares valued at more than $60 million, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nHPE, the information technology business that named a new general counsel last year, was formed less than a decade ago when it split with computer hardware company HP Inc. HP didn\u2019t list legal chief Julie Jacobs among its seven highest-paid executives in 2024, according to a proxy filing last week.\n\nJacobs succeeded Harvey Anderson II after joining HP in late 2022.

A VM escape is a vulnerability that allows an attacker who has already compromised a virtual machine\u2019s guest OS and gained privileged access to move into the hypervisor itself.\n\nThe bugs affect all supported versions of VMware ESX, VMware vSphere, VMware Cloud Foundation, and VMware Telco Cloud Platform. They were assigned severity scores 9.3, 8.2, and 7.1, respectively.\n\nTargeting VMware\n\n\u201cBroadcom has information to suggest that exploitation of these issues has occurred \u201cin the wild,\u201d the company said in the advisory.\n\nSince VMware solutions are often found in both enterprise and SMB environments, they are a popular target among cybercriminals looking to access sensitive company data. To tackle the constant threat, Broadcom continuously scans for vulnerabilities and patches them.\n\nIn mid-November 2024, for example, Broadcom warned of two flaws plaguing its VMware vCenter Server product, which were being exploited in the wild. Just as today, the company then urged users to apply the patch immediately, and warned there were no workarounds. The vulnerabilities could be used to cause quite the damage to compromised networks.\n\nEarlier still, in March 2024, VMware patched a whole host of security vulnerabilities affecting a number of its key business products. The vulnerabilities affected ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion products, and are tracked as CVE-2024-22252, CVE-2024-22253, CVE-2024-22254, and CVE-2024-22255. The first two are described as use-after-free flaws in the XHCI USB controller, affecting all three products. For Workstation and Fusion, they carry a severity score of 9.3, while for ESXi, it\u2019s 8.4.\n\nAre you a pro?

In fact, Ready said the VMware changes have enterprise CIOs and partners rethinking their commitment to the VMware architecture. \u201cThere is no trust,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you run a business if your main vendor partner is thrashing things around like this? At the end of the day no matter where this settles down\u2014if it ever does settle down\u2014there is a broken trust between the vendor and the customer and between the vendor and the partners.\u201d Broadcom-VMware declined to comment on Ready\u2019s comments. Scale Computing has put on a full-court press to recruit VMware partners and attract VMware customers. The company has implemented a \u201cVMware Rip & Replace Offer\u201d providing a 25 percent software and services discount for VMware customers. In addition, it is offering a full system exchange trade-up plus no-cost coverage for the remaining VMware term with its \u201cSeamless Switch: Trade Up To Scale Computing\u201d promotion. As part of its enterprise march, Scale has dramatically increased its R&D investment to add enterprise features to its product set. In midyear, Scale is adding a new Fleet Manager capability that supports application delivery. \u201cIt underscores just how different the future I am describing is from what you see happening at Broadcom,\u201d said Ready. One sign of Scale Computing\u2019s ascent in the wake of the Broadcom-VMware changes is the growth of Scale Computing\u2019s Platform partner conference scheduled for May 13 to 15 at Resorts World in Las Vegas. This year, Ready said, Scale Computing will host 1,000 attendees, up from only 300 attendees two years ago. \u201cWe expect it to be a sell-out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an expanding ecosystem including backup vendors and security vendors. The same pressure that customers feel about Broadcom-VMware is what partners feel about Broadcom-VMware. It is also what other vendors feel. Other vendors who for a long time had their product working on VMware find they now need to shift gears, so we have become a natural place for them to partner.\u201d Below is an excerpt from the CRN interview with Ready.\n\nScale has traditionally been viewed as a midmarket company. How have the Broadcom-VMware issues impacted your position in the enterprise market? Our enterprise business is up 400 percent. We were a midmarket-focused business and we picked up some enterprise customers along the way [before the Broadcom-VMware changes]. But at this point 50 percent of our pipeline is enterprise and 50 percent is midmarket. That's a wild shift from where it was 18 months ago. At that point it was probably 10 percent enterprise and 90 percent midmarket. It\u2019s a huge, huge shift. The VMware-Broadcom thing is a catalyst. Imagine you\u2019re a CIO and you\u2019re thinking about the future. You\u2019ve got AI written down as a priority. You\u2019ve got edge computing written down as a priority. But then the Broadcom thing lands like a bomb in your lap. Now they are saying, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to do something about this.\u2019 So they are sort of pulling in these other projects [AI and edge computing] and rethinking that [VMware] architecture. It still seems like every other week Broadcom is changing something. It is the pricing. It is the partner program. Partners are kicked out. They are invited back in. The pricing is five times more. It is three times more. There is no trust. How can you run a business if your main vendor partner is thrashing things around like this? At the end of the day no matter where this settles down\u2014if it ever does settle down\u2014there is a broken trust between the vendor and the customer and between the vendor and the partners. In the past we have seen other vendors be a channel company and then go direct and then after they are direct for a while they decide to switch back to a channel company. That is painful for partners. But this constant you are out of the program\u2014you are in the program or you can get into the program but the minimums now are more than your entire annual business\u2014that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo you don\u2019t see it settling down in terms of the changes impacting partners from Broadcom-VMware? No. One of the reasons we are getting so much enterprise pipeline is if you are a partner and you are fortunate enough to get invited to bid on a project for a Fortune 500 company, if you take that to Broadcom they are taking that direct. They have said that. These aren\u2019t my words. Their words are that their top 2,000 customers are now direct. So what does a partner do with that? You bring them to us. We are 100 percent partner all the time so you can change that conversation around. We expect this year to be just as big or bigger than what we saw last year. The starting number is bigger so even the same growth rate is a much bigger dollar amount of growth for the year. We expect to add 1,000-plus partners and probably 1,000-plus new customers. We are also seeing quite a bit of global expansion. All these trends we are talking about affect everybody. So what percentage of your business do you think will be enterprise in 2025 versus 2024? The enterprise business will grow over 100 percent this year. It grew 400 percent in 2024. It may grow 200 percent this year. Enterprise is half of our sales pipeline. We are also still working on thousands of individual midmarket transactions. We do them all. I love all the customers. I am just as happy to talk to a dental office that needs one server or Coca-Cola. I love talking to them both. At our Platform event last year I got asked the question, \u2018How do you define success at Scale?\u2019 The answer I gave was to me it is how many people can we help with the technology we develop, That means when I help that CIO at the dental office and I help the CIO at Coca- Cola, those are both wins to me. It is all about solving people\u2019s problems and making things better. That is why I get so excited about talking to customers and partners. Today I told partners in a boardroom if you have a customer who you think a meeting, phone call or email from me will help to close a deal, just tell me. I\u2019ll send an email before I even respond to you that I am going to send the email.\n\nWhat kind of investments is Scale making to meet that enterprise virtualization demand? First, on the go-to-market side we created an entire enterprise team. As partners bring in these kinds of opportunities, they will still work with the same channel representatives they have always had but those individual deals will get escalated to an enterprise team within Scale. So partners with enterprise opportunities are dealing with co-sellers on our side who are familiar with the ins and outs of selling to the enterprise, which is very different than selling to the midmarket. It is a longer and more complex sales cycle. We are shoulder to shoulder with partners there. On the R&D side, we are doing a ton of hiring. It is the biggest area of investment we have for 2025. It was also the biggest area of investment for 2024. One of the unexpected side effects of us moving into this enterprise market and building out features that they need is that there is often much more customization required in these accounts. But we have found that as we develop these features, which we tag on our \u2018to-do\u2019 list tag as enterprise-specific features, almost all of them end up being wanted by the midmarket as well. A lot of the R&D spend is around enterprise and scalability, interoperating with other systems. It is much more common in an enterprise that you are just a piece of a bigger puzzle than in the midmarket where you might be the entire infrastructure.\n\nDo you see a future where you will have to split the product line and have something that is more enterprise-specific? So far I don\u2019t, but I would have given you a different answer last year. I would have thought there would be much more splitting. We are adding engineering teams to do this work. That doesn\u2019t mean when the midmarket sends in their feature requests we are not paying attention to those. There is a team still working on those midmarket requests too. Certainly there are midmarket features that are less applicable to the enterprise. But most of the enterprise features apply everywhere. I am expecting that is going to continue for some time. Part of this is because of the rise of edge computing where you have distributed systems. And when you start distributing systems, any individual deployment can kind of look more like a midmarket deployment than a traditional big enterprise. Instead of 1,000 servers in one location you have one server in a thousand locations. You are still managing 1,000 servers. It is still an enterprise-scale problem. But the solution set is different and the solution set to manage 1,000 one-server sites is a lot like managing a single one-server site. That said, we are also getting those 1,000 servers in one site centralized type of opportunities.",

            "content": "Two of the biggest names in artificial intelligence (AI) investing are Nvidia (NVDA -0.58%) and Broadcom (AVGO -1.38%). Both companies' businesses benefit significantly from the AI arms race, which is why investors are so interested in them.\n\nHowever, investors may be torn as to which one is the better stock to buy right now. So, if you're looking to add to one of these massive winners, which one should you pick?\n\nNvidia and Broadcom are competing for computing hardware market share\n\nFirst, let's take a look at what each company does best.\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and various hardware and software to support their use. While GPUs got their start in gaming graphics, they can also be used to mine cryptocurrencies, process engineering simulations, and help autonomous vehicles navigate. These are large use cases but are dwarfed by the massive demand for GPUs from the AI sector.\n\nGPUs are popular because they can process multiple calculations in parallel and be connected in clusters to further amplify this effect. Nvidia is the top GPU producer, and its stock performance backs up that statement.\n\nBroadcom is a much broader business than Nvidia. It has products ranging from mainframe computers and software to cybersecurity solutions and virtual desktop software. However, the two product lines that excite AI-focused investors are its custom accelerators and connectivity switches.\n\nBroadcom's connectivity switches help direct traffic in data centers and are a vital part of making efficient systems. Its custom AI accelerators are a direct competitor to Nvidia's GPUs and are designed by Broadcom and its tech giant partners (like Alphabet (GOOG -2.59%) (GOOGL -2.62%)) to better handle AI workloads. But these custom accelerators will not dethrone GPUs, as they are only a better choice when a workload is specifically configured to be run through a Broadcom-designed accelerator.\n\nBroadcom sees a huge market for these custom accelerators and believes it will be in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. Given that Broadcom's AI revenue base was $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2024 (which includes its connectivity switches and custom accelerators), this would represent massive growth. It would also likely take market share away from Nvidia, which posted data center revenue of $115 billion in fiscal year 2025 (ending Jan. 26).\n\nWhile I'm not going to debate whether GPUs or custom accelerators will be the way of the future, it is important to watch some of Nvidia's biggest clients to see if they begin discussing using their proprietary designs solely or continue to order mountains of Nvidia GPUs.\n\nWhile it's impossible to know how this will play out, one stock clearly looks like a better buy right now.\n\nNvidia's stock is far cheaper than Broadcom's\n\nWhen comparing these two stocks' valuations, using a trailing earnings metric is impossible because Broadcom has a one-time effect that throws this metric out of whack. Instead, I'll use the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess each stock's valuation.\n\nAt 27 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock is a fair bit cheaper than Broadcom's. This is noteworthy, as Nvidia is growing far faster than Broadcom.\n\nWhile investors are excited about the prospects of Broadcom's AI hardware, the reality is that it only makes up a fraction of the company's total revenue. In 2024, its AI-related revenue was $12.2 billion, about 24% of total revenue. While these segments were growing quickly, they were drowned out by their overall business.\n\nAt face value, Broadcom looked like it grew 44% year over year, but Broadcom's VMware acquisition heavily influenced that. Without that purchase, Broadcom's revenue only grew 9% organically. Contrast that with Nvidia's fiscal year 2025 growth of $130.5 billion, up 114% year over year, and it's clear that Nvidia is the better stock to buy.\n\nWhile Broadcom may be a darling in the market's eyes, it's clear that Nvidia is still the better stock to buy right now. With Nvidia's stock a bit weak following earnings, investors should use this opportunity to scoop up shares of this dominant AI player.",

            "content": "Exclusive Broadcom has quietly started a closed beta of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) version 9, a major release that fully expresses the tech giant's vision for what a private cloud should be.\n\nPrashanth Shenoy, Broadcom\u2019s chief marketing officer and marketing veep for Cloud Platform, Infrastructure, and Solutions, on Monday told The Register a select group of customers this week received the beta code and suggested wider testing will follow.\n\nAmong the features in this release are the ability to create a private cloud from within VMware\u2019s central management tool vCenter. That\u2019s a chore that previously required a collection of tools. Single sign-on across the many component parts of a private cloud has been delivered, license management tools beefed up, and automation improved. We\u2019re told self-service provisioning of virtual machines, Kubernetes resources, and storage, have also been enhanced.\n\nThe VCF 9 beta matters because before it took over at VMware, Broadcom said it intended to make Virtzilla\u2019s products easier to implement and consume by fully integrating its compute, storage, and network virtualization tools.\n\nWhile users waited for that promise to be realized, Broadcom stopped selling discrete VMware apps and moved to subscriptions for a handful of software bundles. While the (now-notional) prices of the components in those bundles fell, the requirement to buy multiple products that customers may not have needed or wanted, plus support, meant users saw their VMware bills increase markedly.\n\nMany customers were angered by those rises, and even VMware partners like Rackspace sought relief by moving to rival platforms for some workloads.\n\nAre you testing VCF 9, or know more? The Register is always happy to hear from VMware users. Contact us here in confidence.\n\nThrough 2024, Broadcom insisted that the pain was worth it because implementing VCF paid for itself by giving users a highly manageable private cloud \u2013 even as it promised to address significant shortcomings in the suite.\n\nVMware offered some improvements to VCF with the July 2024 release of version 5.2, which made it possible to import existing discrete deployments of VMware products into VCF and added welcome updates, like live patching of the ESXi hypervisor.\n\nSince August 2024, VMware has touted VCF 9 as the release that would deliver on its full vision and prove the value of its bundles by offering users private clouds that are easy to deploy and manage, and cheaper than public clouds.\n\nThat promise seemingly did not improve customers\u2019 moods. In November 2024, analyst firm Gartner told us VMware customers were all miserable.\n\nShenoy suggested that view is a \"lagging indicator\" of customer sentiment, and that VMware revenue is a better way to measure intentions.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting statement as Broadcom\u2019s most recent quarterly results announcement included news of accelerating sales, vastly reduced costs, and a decision to stop reporting VMware revenue and costs on a standalone basis.\n\nFinancial data describing the success of VCF 9 may therefore be hard to find.\n\nShenoy, as you\u2019d expect, believes the release will do just fine.\n\nHe admitted that Broadcom\u2019s past software acquisitions mean many VMware customers were wary after the acquisition of the virtualization software house, but said Broadcom has won them over.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we have changed is a lot of customers are more comfortable with what we are doing,\u201d he told The Register. \u201cA year later we have given them confidence that we focus on R&D and innovation,\u201d Shenoy said.\n\nHe told The Register evidence of that confidence includes users who have deployed earlier versions of VCF accelerating repatriation of public workloads to the VMware stack and increasingly deploying containerized and AI software workloads to the platform.

The Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) stock price afforded investors more than an 8.5% decrease from its peak in January, which resulted in a shift to bear market classification. Sources from the industry have found that Chinese customers evade export restrictions through third-party brokers located in Malaysia and Taiwan alongside Vietnam. Singapore's government started a probe into suspicious trading methods, which deepened the market uncertainty.\n\nThe performance of Broadcom (AVGO, Financial), along with AMD (AMD, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial), declined sharply when stock market demands surged. Taiwan Semiconductor's (TSM, Financial) stock prices dropped by more than 4%, although President Trump made public notice of investing $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing in the coming years. Taiwan Semiconductor persists as the dominant force in the global foundry business, while Intel experienced a 4% share decrease after Apple (AAPL, Financial) and AMD announced their major partnership with the company.\n\nThe situation became more unstable when President Trump declared his commitment to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports starting Tuesday with no signs of future dialogue. Trade policy changes and uncertain supply chains sent all major U.S. stock indices, including Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500, into turmoil.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Shares of semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO -1.21%) were tumbling today after it was reported that the company is testing out Intel's manufacturing chip process. Broadcom designs its chips, but doesn't manufacture them. Most of the company's processors are currently made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC).\n\nBroadcom investors evidently don't like the idea of the company potentially using Intel as its manufacturer, and sent the stock down by as much as 4.2% today. Broadcom's shares fell by 2.2% as of 11:25 a.m. ET.\n\nTesting out a potential manufacturer\n\nIt's not uncommon for chip designers to occasionally run tests with chip manufacturers to see if their process could be beneficial. But Broadcom's test of Intel's 18A process caught investors' attention, likely because Intel has struggled to get its particular advanced processing production off the ground.\n\nIntel delayed its potential manufacturing contracts for its 18A process until 2026, and recent reporting from Reuters shows that the timeline has been pushed back an additional six months.\n\nThe 18A process is for making advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, which is the bread and butter of Taiwan Semiconductor's manufacturing. Broadcom investors may be concerned that if the company moves some of its chip manufacturing to Intel, it could slow down production or delay the release of new processors.\n\nNothing is set in stone yet\n\nNeither company made comments about a partnership or new deals, and no official contracts have been announced. That means Broadcom investors should take a wait-and-see approach to this news and not make any investment decisions based on preliminary testing.\n\nEven if the company decided to move some of its chip manufacturing to Intel, it's unlikely it would make a drastic transition at a time when Intel is still trying to find its footing amid production slowdowns. Broadcom is most likely trying to figure out what manufacturing options it has available and how well Intel's 18A process has developed.",

In a historic two-day rally in mid-December of last year, the price skyrocketed from $180 to $250 per share but has fallen back to $186 per share.\n\nAs a global player in semiconductor and infrastructure software, Broadcom was hit hard with news of uncertainty in AI and tech. That\u2019s in line with the sell-off seen with other AI names, like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and NVIDIA (NVDA) to name just two.\n\nBroadcom is expected to report earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.51 on $14.59 billion in revenue. Both estimates are higher than last quarter, when Broadcom failed to exceed revenue estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that said, Broadcom did report strong numbers in the previous earnings call. Hock Tan, president and CEO of Broadcom, offered positive sentiment: \u201cBroadcom's fiscal year 2024 revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue grew to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware.\u201d\n\n\u201cSemiconductor revenue,\u201d Tan continued, \u201cwas a record $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue, which grew 220% year-on-year, was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.\"\n\nThese are massive numbers, but there's still a lot of uncertainty priced into this week's earnings call. We can look at the implied volatility of the options market for context around what the market expects from Broadcom earnings, and right now we're seeing an 8% stock price move expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcom is currently trading at $188, and the expected stock price range for this week is +/- $17.15. With most company earnings, we see an expected range between 5%-10% of the notional value of the stock price. Broadcom comes in at 8%, which puts it on the higher end of the range of most equities.\n\nLooking further out in time, we see a +/- $31.93 expected move through the May expiration cycle. That means this week's earnings report accounts for over 53% of the implied stock price range over the next 74 days. Even though they're posting plenty of strong numbers, the market is telling us that uncertainty is still apparent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullish on AVGO stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on AVGO stock for earnings, you're looking for another big EPS and revenue result on Thursday. If they can beat EPS and revenue estimates and sprinkle in growth possibilities for the rest of the year, we could see the stock begin to recover from recent lows.\n\n\n\n\n\nBearish on AVGO stock for earnings\n\nAVGO bears have some interesting angles to pursue this week, and it doesn't necessarily have to do with the earnings report at all. Yes, we could certainly see the company\u2019s stock drop if EPS and revenue numbers are missed, or if tariff talk issues arise, but the overall stock market has seen real volatility in recent weeks. The NASDAQ is down 2,000 points from recent highs, and investors may be skittish to open new bullish positions on a chip stock not named NVIDIA (NVDA). High implied volatility surrounding the earnings announcement also tells us there is an unknown element to this earnings call, and that's not necessarily a good thing.\n\nEither way you look at it, we should expect to continue to see large market moves leading up to and after the earnings announcements this week.

It is yet unknown when the testing period will start.\n\nBroadcom's previous Intel testing last year apparently fell short of expectations, which begs questions about Intel's production capacity. But Intel signed a contract to build a bespoke artificial intelligence chip for Amazon (AMZN, Financials), indicating more general interest in its contract manufacturing operations in September 2024.\n\nFollowing announcements that TSM and Broadcom were contemplating purchasing some of the business, Intel's shares rose in February.

            "content": "Nvidia and Broadcom are both testing chips using Intel's new 18A manufacturing process, reports sources to Reuters, indicating that these well-known projects continue. Intel's 18A process is the company's first fabrication technology to rely on gate-all-around RibbonFET transistors and a backside power delivery network named PowerVia. The Intel 18A process is broadly comparable to TSMC's N2 node. However, 18A is thought to be faster, while N2 is a denser chip.\n\nReuters sources suggest that both Nvidia and Broadcom's tests are not being conducted on complete chip designs, but the companies want to understand how 18A works in both behavior and performance. It's common to test processors before committing to purchasing them outright.\n\nThis isn't entirely new information, as there have been reports that Broadcom had been testing 18A since as early as September 2024. Back then, it was claimed that Broadcom's tests using 18A did not meet expectations, but that was not confirmed, with Broadcom merely saying the tests were ongoing.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has claimed as far back as 2022 that Nvidia would consider using Intel-fabricated chips, and noted the company had test chips under active testing in 2023. In 2024, Tom's Hardware quizzed Intel Foundry Services chief Stu Pann about the company's RAMP-C project, in which Nvidia is a formal partner. This program gives companies federal funding to build test chips on Intel's 18A process node for military applications.\n\nIntel recently launched a dedicated website to advertise its 18A process, and consumer Panther Lake processors are set to enter mass production in mid-2025.\n\nAn Intel spokesperson told Reuters: \"We don't comment on specific customers but continue to see strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.\"\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nWhile Intel's 18A process is reportedly garnering interest from big-name clients, Reuters claims to have reviewed supplier documents that indicate a problem with some unnamed third-party IP providers. Reuters claims this situation is causing \"potential further delays in Intel's ability to deliver chips for some contract manufacturing customers\" that could stretch the launch times for small and mid-size customers to mid-2026. Intel responded that it remains on track to begin fabricating chips in the second half of this year.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted in December 2024, despite being one of the key people to lead Intel toward developing 18A, a product that could theoretically compete with TSMC's dominance.\n\nFormer Intel CEO Craig Barrett said on the matter: \"In my opinion, a far better move might be to fire the Intel board and rehire Pat Gelsinger to finish the job he has aptly handled over the past few years.\u201d\n\nWhile Broadcom and Nvidia are likely to be testing 18A chips, Intel is in a position where it needs to lock down big clients for its next process node. Intel isn't expecting a quick pathway to profitability with its Foundry, as the company doesn't predict it will break even until 2027.",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has established itself as a significant player in the semiconductor and infrastructure software sectors, capitalizing on the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expansion of data centers. If you're convinced that AI networking and cloud computing are the future, you might see Broadcom as a long-term option, especially since its AI-driven expansion has boosted both income and earnings.\n\nBroadcom's valuation is huge compared to a lot of its competitors. At one point, its P/E ratio hovered around an eye-popping 170, and that alone could scare off some folks who want a quick return. Sure, there's a decent dividend and reliable cash flowwhich is a big plusbut if you're just jumping in right now, you might want to wait and see if the price settles a bit. I'd personally keep an eye on it before committing new money.\n\nYou might also want to wait and see whether Broadcom can actually sustain its exceptional performance, or whether it'll face more pressure from NVIDIA, AMD, and Texas Instruments as the next earnings date of March 6, 2025 approaches.\n\nFinancial Performance: Awaiting the March 6 Earnings Report\n\nWith Broadcom's Q1 2025 earnings report scheduled for March 6, a lot of eyes are on whether the company can keep up its impressive AI-driven growth. Last year, Broadcom's AI revenue shot up by a whopping 220% year-over-year, which helped push total revenue to $51.6 billion. That's huge, but here's the real question: can Broadcom maintain that momentum?\n\nAnalysts are currently predicting an EPS of $1.51 for the quarter, with an expected range of $1.44 to $1.55slightly higher than last quarter's $1.42. Broadcom has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the past 12 months, whereas its peers have only managed it about 66.88% of the time. If Broadcom outperforms again, it might give investors more confidence in its lofty P/E of 172.87. But let's face it: any slip-up could trigger a steep sell-off.\n\nShould You Invest in Broadcom Inc? A Detailed Stock Breakdown\n\nOn the revenue side, forecasts for Q1 2025 come in at $14.62 billion, up from $14.05 billion last quarter, with projections ranging between $14.39 billion and $14.83 billion. Broadcom has beaten sales estimates 75% of the time, outperforming the industry average of 67.37%. Still, this quarter is a big testwill AI infrastructure and software revenues keep surging?\n\nBeyond EPS and revenue, you'll want to pay attention to free cash flow (FCF) and debt management. Broadcom's FCF margin stood at 39% last quarter, which helped extend its 14-year dividend growth streak. However, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 97.94%, the company's financial leverage is higher than that of its peers. If Broadcom can keep its cash flow stable and allocate capital efficientlyespecially given how capital-intensive AI can beit might keep investors happy.",

The latest jobs report for February, due Friday, could be in the spotlight as well, amid concerns about emerging weakness in the labor market.\n\nUpdates to consumer credit levels, the U.S. trade balance, factory orders, and manufacturing and Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surveys are also expected, along with scheduled earnings from Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), Target (TGT), and others.\n\nMonday, March 3\n\nS&P manufacturing PMI (February)\n\nISM manufacturing PMI (February)\n\nConstruction spending (January)\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem is scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nOkta (OKTA) and GitLab (GTLB) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nTuesday, March 4\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to address joint session of Congress\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams is scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD), Target, AutoZone (AZO), Ross Stores (ROST), Best Buy (BBY), and Nordstrom (JWN) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nWednesday, March 5\n\nADP employment (February)\n\nS&P services PMI (February)\n\nISM services PMI (February)\n\nFactory orders (January)\n\nFederal Reserve Beige Book\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Zscaler (ZS), MongoDB (MDB), Campbell\u2019s (CPB), Brown-Forman (BF.A), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nThursday, March 6\n\nInitial jobless claims (Week ending March 1)\n\nU.S. trade deficit (January)\n\nU.S. productivity - final (Q4)\n\nWholesale inventories (January)\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nBroadcom, Costco, Kroger (KR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Burlington Stores (BURL), Gap (GAP), and Macy\u2019s (M) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nFriday, March 7\n\nU.S. employment report (February)\n\nConsumer credit (January)\n\nFed Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman and New York Fed President John Williams are scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nFinal day before Federal Reserve blackout period ahead of March 18-19 meeting\n\nTrump To Address Congress as Tariffs Take Effect\n\nPresident Trump is set to address a joint session of Congress at 8 p.m. EST on Tuesday, March 4. The address could offer an opportunity for Trump to lay out his agenda and highlight his administration's early actions, including the tariffs scheduled to take effect the same day.\n\nFresh Jobs Report To Come Amid Focus on Labor Market\n\nThe February jobs report scheduled for Friday comes after employers added fewer positions than expected last month, raising worries the labor market may be softening. Those concerns were reinforced last week when jobless claims came in higher than expected.\n\nReports on weekly initial jobless claims and private sector hiring in February are due earlier in the week. Federal Reserve officials have pointed to strength in the labor market as helping influence their recent decision not to lower interest rates at their January meeting.\n\nFed Officials To Speak Ahead of Blackout Period\n\nIt\u2019s the last week for Federal Reserve officials to deliver remarks before the start of the blackout period ahead of the March 18-19 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, New York Fed President John Williams, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are scheduled to give remarks. The Fed's latest Beige Book is also due for release Wednesday, offering a qualitative review of economic conditions.\n\nSeveral economic indicators this week could provide updates on the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, including PMI survey results for February, wholesale inventories data, U.S. fourth quarter productivity, and factory orders. January consumer credit data could also provide insight into the strength of consumers, coming as retailers like Walmart (WMT) have projected lower-than-expected sales growth in coming quarters.\n\nEarnings Due From Broadcom, Target, Costco and More\n\nBroadcom is set to report earnings Thursday, after chip stocks sold off last week in the wake of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings. Nvidia's results surpassed Street estimates, but they may not have been good enough for investors amid some concerns about AI spending and economic uncertainty. Analysts have so far largely remained bullish on Nvidia's stock as well as Broadcom's, pointing to the chipmakers' potential to benefit from growing AI demand.\n\nOther tech companies scheduled to report this week include Marvell Technology, HP Enterprise, MongoDB, GitLab, CrowdStrike, Zscaler, and Okta. Several big retailers are also scheduled to release quarterly results, with Ross Stores, Best Buy, and Target reporting Tuesday, with Costco set to follow on Thursday.\n\nKroger's report Thursday follows the grocery chain\u2019s weak report last quarter and represents the first since its failed efforts to merge with Albertsons (ACI).\n\n",

            "content": "For artificial intelligence to begin its next chapter driven by extreme performance, it's going to need more high-performance hardware from Broadcom.\n\nObviously, nobody can predict the future with absolute certainty. Investors can, however, connect informational dots to create a probable picture.\n\nTo this end, a confluence of factors has set a very bullish stage for communications technology giant Broadcom (AVGO -1.55%).\n\nBroadcom's place in the AI movement\n\nUnlike Nvidia or Amazon, who pretty much are industry darlings in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, Broadcom hasn't been much in the AI limelight.\n\nHowever, there's an issue of concern: AI driven data centers are hitting a wall. However, computer processing power isn't the problem; Nvidia's hardware is more than up to the task. The surprising bottleneck is the speed at which a rack of processors communicates with one another within a data center. AI platforms are creating and processing digital data faster than it can be disseminated.\n\nEnter Broadcom, which makes the tech connecting an AI data center's many processors. Its recently introduced Brocade G710 24-port 64G switch, for instance, can handle speeds up to 64 gigabits, while the entire switch itself boasts bandwidth of up to 1.5 terabytes per second.\n\nThat may not mean much to a layperson, but for data center operators, that blazing-fast speed opens the door to new artificial intelligence functionality.\n\nAnd that's just one item on Broadcom's tech menu. Hyperfast (200 gigabits per second) digital signal processors and a 51.2 terabytes-per-second fiberoptic Ethernet switching platform are also part of its lineup.\n\nHere comes the rush\n\nData center interconnection technology is nothing new. However, it required the advent of artificial intelligence to highlight how little had been done of late to advance this interconnectivity tech. No other company is as well positioned as Broadcom to close this gap.\n\nIt's now starting to be closed in earnest though. As Broadcom CEO Hock Tan commented in December, the market for AI networking components could be worth $60 billion to $90 billion per year by 2027.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, while Broadcom enjoys a commanding lead of this market, it still only did a little over $12 billion worth of such business last year.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best magic formula stocks for 2025.\n\nThe Magic Formula, as defined by Joel Greenblatt in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market, entails evaluating companies based on two metrics: earnings yield (EBIT/enterprise value) and return on capital. Greenblatt is one of the few fund managers who have regularly achieved double-digit percentage returns during their careers on Wall Street. His former business, Gotham Capital, had an incredible run from 1985 until 1994. During this time, the fund generated a net return of 34%. That said, even he was conscious that this method seemed too wonderful and easy to be true, which is why, throughout his book, he frequently questions the reader: what is the assurance, if any, that this investment technique genuinely works and is not just a fluke? In any case, he frequently underlines that the Magic Formula investment technique does not encourage investing in firms with average or low return on capital since the strategy creates a rating system to identify top companies with the best return on capital and earnings yield.\n\nHowever, like with any method, there is some risk involved, and the Magic Formula does not ensure success. Since the strategy is based on past data, it\u2019d be difficult to say if it could work well in the future, especially if market conditions change. Incidentally, a backtest of market performance from 2003 to 2015 found that the Magic Formula approach produced annualized returns of 11.4%, while the S&P 500 produced returns of 8.7%, thus failing to live up to Greenblatt\u2019s inflated claims despite beating the benchmark. Greenblatt himself admits that the Magic Formula fails in many cases and performs poorly in some others, particularly when the holding time is too short. The investor stated the following:\n\n\u201cMost people just won\u2019t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won\u2019t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy\u2014 usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it.\u201d\n\nMore recently, however, Joel Greenblatt\u2019s fund appears to have lagged behind the overall market as a result of his investment strategy. As of the end of January, the Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has only returned 10.86% over the last five years, while the S&P 500 has returned 15.17%. Nonetheless, the Magic Formula is one of many investment strategies that investors can opt for as they navigate the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best Magic Formula stocks, we ranked the stocks in Gotham Asset Management\u2019s Q4 2024 SEC filings by their stake value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 161\n\nGotham Asset Management\u2019s Q4 2024 Stake: $49.9 million\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), one of the world\u2019s leading technological companies, has a significant presence in both hardware and software. The company\u2019s key competence is in offering networking and custom chips for a wide range of applications.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.05 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 51% year-over-year gain. AI sales increased 220% from the previous year to $12.2 billion, while semiconductor revenue reached a new high of $30.1 billion. The company\u2019s cutting-edge AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions were considered the primary drivers of this growth.\n\nCiti maintained a Buy rating and $220 price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) on January 13, despite anticipated regulatory headwinds. The firm expressed worry over recent allegations that there might be more limitations on AI chip shipments to China. Notably, Bytedance, AVGO\u2019s third-largest ASIC client, may be harmed by these limits, possibly affecting $2-$3 billion in fiscal year 2025 sales, or 3%-5% of the company\u2019s estimated sales for the year. Nonetheless, even with uncertainties centered on government policy, Citi remains optimistic about Broadcom\u2019s prospects. While the firm recognizes the difficulty of anticipating government initiatives, it believes that overall growth in the AI sector would more than make up for any potential loss of sales to Bytedance.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC made the following comment about AVGO in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the fourth quarter as the company\u2019s third quarter results demonstrated continuing strength for its AI networking and custom accelerator semiconductor business. The company also gave long-term guidance for the service addressable market (SAM) opportunity for its AI-related business, indicating a market opportunity of $60 billion to $90 billion, which only includes contributions from its current three customers. This long-term outlook for AI semiconductor content exceeded investor expectations. Broadcom\u2019s quarterly results also showed the company is ahead on its VMware integration timeline to achieve $8.5 billion in EBITDA, which will support long-term gross and operating margin expansion for the company.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best magic formula stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The S&P 500 briefly erased its year-to-date gains, dragged down by mega-cap tech stocks, while tariff fears cast a shadow over investor sentiment. With a pivotal jobs report and key economic data on deck, will markets regain their footing\u2014or is more volatility ahead?\n\nWall Street was in a tug-of-war last week, with conflicting narratives shaping the market\u2019s tone. On one hand, AI-driven spending and strong corporate profits provided a reason for optimism. On the other, softening economic data and trade policy concerns kept investors on edge.\n\nS&P 500: -1.0% | Nasdaq: -3.5% | Dow Jones: +1.0%\n\nThe biggest pain point? Tech stocks took a beating. The so-called \"Magnificent 7,\" which fueled much of last year\u2019s rally, stumbled into correction territory. As a result, the Nasdaq posted its worst weekly performance of the year, shedding 3.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest Consumer Confidence Index fell for the third consecutive month, signaling that Americans are feeling the pinch. With new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU looming, investors worry this could slow spending even further. Tech\u2019s dominance is fading\u2014at least for now. But with earnings still strong in other sectors, this could be a rotation rather than a full-blown retreat.\n\nNext Week\u2019s Outlook\n\nThe upcoming February jobs report is the market\u2019s main event this week. With economic data already showing cracks, a weaker-than-expected payroll number could reinforce recession fears. On the flip side, a strong report might push the Federal Reserve to stay cautious on rate cuts. Jobs data will dictate the market\u2019s next move. A downside surprise could reignite fears of a slowdown, while a strong print might delay the Fed\u2019s next move.\n\nNext week\u2019s earnings lineup features major names across retail and tech, offering insight into consumer spending and semiconductor demand.\n\nTarget TGT 0.00%\u2191 kicks things off Tuesday morning, with analysts expecting a 27.9% drop in earnings to $2.15 per share on declining revenue .\n\nBroadcom AVGO 0.00%\u2191 reports Thursday after the close, projected to post a strong 37.3% EPS growth , fueled by AI-driven chip demand .\n\nCostco COST 0.00%\u2191 also reports Thursday, expected to show steady growth, with earnings up 4.6% as shoppers stick to bulk-buying essentials.\n\nShare\n\nWeekly Portfolio Pulse Check\n\nDespite the broader market decline, the portfolio managed a modest gain of 0.30% for the week to $148,143.51 and Profit/Loss Booked: $12,233.99 (mostly from options trades) We\u2019re keeping dry powder (cash) on hand for opportunities\n\nThis week trades included:\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the portfolio, check out the following page.\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Market on Edge?\n\nThe market is sending mixed signals. Tech\u2019s stumble, falling consumer confidence, and trade tensions suggest caution. But resilient earnings and AI-driven investment could keep the bull case alive.\n\nWill the jobs report calm fears or fuel the next sell-off? Stay tuned.\n\n\ud83d\udcac What\u2019s your take\u2014more downside ahead, or a buying opportunity? Drop your thoughts in the comments!\n\nShare Vitta Insight",

He also targeted European Union\u2019s goods, including automobiles, and said he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nThe sweeping trade measures rattled markets, triggering broad-based sell-offs, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of risk aversion.\n\nA plunge and a crypto heist\n\nThough seeing a small uptick after it plunged below $80,000 in early Friday trading, Bitcoin is entering a bear market after dropping more than 20% from its peak. Sentiment in the digital asset space worsened following a massive security breach at Bybit, where hackers stole $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in one of the largest crypto heists in history.\n\nBitcoin tokens and a price chart are seen in this illustration picture taken November 21, 2024.\n\nChip darling can't save the day\n\nThe high-flying artificial intelligence sector took a hit as investors reassessed its lofty valuations.

While the fourth-quarter gross domestic product remained unchanged at an annualized 2.3% growth rate, inflation metrics for the same quarter were revised higher.\n\nIn January, personal spending contracted by 0.2% on the month, marking the first negative reading since March 2023. The Personal Consumption Expenditure price index \u2014 Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge \u2014 came in at 2.5% as expected, remaining above the 2% target.\n\nHousing data also disappointed, with pending home sales plunging 4.6% in January to their lowest level on record. Elevated mortgage rates continued to strain affordability, further cooling demand in the housing market.\n\nThe labor market showed signs of softening, as weekly jobless claims jumped by 22,000 to 242,000, marking the highest level in over two months.\n\nGM boosts dividend\n\nGeneral Motors Co. rewarded shareholders with a dividend hike and a fresh buyback plan. The automaker raised its quarterly dividend by three cents to 15 cents per share, effective with its next payout in April. GM also authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program, including a $2 billion accelerated buyback initiative.\n\nBenzinga is a financial news and data company headquartered in Detroit\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Trump trade measures rattle markets, Bitcoin falls",

I think when it comes to the cost of AI inference, it\u2019s going to go through the floor. Sam Altman said after DeepSeek that they expect the cost of tokens to go down 10 to 12x per year for their second-tier model. I mean, that\u2019s basically through the floor.

I think you\u2019re going to see some just profound impacts. And so I\u2019m still bullish on this market.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is positioned to benefit from ARM\u2019s expansion into chip design. The analyst believes major tech companies are increasingly turning to custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for AI accelerators to improve power and compute efficiency.

Broadcom maintains a strong focus on strategic areas, including cloud computing, data centers, networking, broadband, and wireless communications, positioning itself as a key enabler of the 5G and AI transformations.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, Broadcom slipped 21.5% from its 52-week high of $251.88, achieved on Dec. 16, 2024. Over the past three months, AVGO stock gained 23.9%, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI)3.3% losses during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of Broadcom climbed 52.6% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming DOWI\u2019s 11% returns over the last year.

However, the stock has been trading below its 50-day moving average recently.\n\nBroadcom's AI revenue has surged over 220% in 2024, reaching $12.2 billion. CEO Hock Tan foresees a massive AI opportunity over the next three years. The company has unveiled its PCIe Gen 6 portfolio, offering early access to its Interop Development Platform, simplifying system design. Additionally, collaborating with industry leaders like Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) and Teledyne LeCroy, Broadcom ensures fully validated PCIe Gen 6 building blocks for AI platforms. This commitment to open ecosystem and scalable solutions positions Broadcom as a leader in transitioning from PCIe 5 to PCIe 6.\n\nOn Dec. 12, AVGO reported its Q4 results, and its shares closed up more than 24% in the following trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $1.42 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $1.39. The company\u2019s revenue was $14.05 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts of $14.06 billion.

            "content": "Semiconductor bellwether Broadcom (AVGO -1.55%) has clocked impressive gains of 69% on the stock market in the past year as of this writing, but it has witnessed an indifferent start in 2025.\n\nBroadcom stock fell big time last month after Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek claimed that it had developed a competent AI model at an incredibly low cost, calling into question the billions of dollars that are being spent by many tech giants to build out their AI infrastructure. As Broadcom has been a beneficiary of the huge AI infrastructure spending, its shares crashed significantly following DeepSeek's revelation.\n\nIt is worth noting that Broadcom has clawed back a nice chunk of those losses, though the stock is still down 6% in 2025. However, the chip designer's upcoming fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, scheduled for release on March 6, could give it a nice shot in the arm. Let's see why.\n\nAI spending could help Broadcom deliver stronger results and outlook\n\nBroadcom's impressive rally in the past year has been driven by the healthy demand for its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The company pointed out on its December 2024 earnings conference call that its custom AI chips are being used by three major cloud hyperscale customers for tackling AI workloads. Shipments of custom processors to these customers doubled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, while there was a 4x jump in shipments of Broadcom's networking equipment used in AI servers.\n\nEven better, Broadcom reports that it has been chosen to supply its next-generation custom AI processors for two additional cloud hyperscalers. Reports suggest that the three big cloud computing companies currently using Broadcom's chips are Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nMore importantly, two of those companies are set to increase their capital spending substantially in 2025 to support the rollout of AI infrastructure. Alphabet, for instance, is forecasting an increase of almost $23 billion in capital expenditure this year, while Meta's capex could rise by a remarkable 60% to $65 billion.\n\nThe new customers that Broadcom talked about on its previous conference call could be Apple and OpenAI. According to a Reuters report, OpenAI is reportedly looking to reduce its reliance on Nvidia's graphics cards for tackling its AI workloads. It has reportedly partnered with Broadcom to design its custom in-house AI chip.\n\nAnother report suggests that consumer electronics giant Apple is also working with Broadcom to develop an AI server chip. Meanwhile, Broadcom may have won more business from Apple for providing radio frequency components used in iPhones, as the latter has reportedly started dual-sourcing those chips instead of buying them solely from another chipmaker -- Skyworks Solutions.\n\nSkyworks management admitted on the latest earnings conference call that it could witness a 20% to 25% decline in content at its largest customer, and that could be good news for Broadcom investors, as per Wall Street analysts. As such, there are multiple reasons why the chipmaker could be on track to beat consensus expectations once again and issue robust guidance as well.\n\nThe company has guided for $14.6 billion in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which would be a 22% increase from the year-ago period. Its earnings are forecast to jump by a solid 37% year over year to $1.51 per share. However, the new business that Broadcom is likely to have landed of late could help it exceed its guidance, and that could send the stock soaring following its upcoming earnings report.\n\nMore importantly, Broadcom's AI business is likely to take off remarkably over the next three years, which is why it makes sense to buy this AI stock before it starts heading higher.\n\nThe bigger picture points toward better times ahead\n\nBroadcom generated $12.2 billion from sales of AI chips in the previous fiscal year. While the company hasn't issued a forecast for fiscal 2025 yet, investors can expect this figure to head substantially higher over the next three years as the company sees its addressable opportunity in custom AI processors and networking chips rising to a range of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027.\n\nGiven that Broadcom controls an estimated 55% to 60% of the custom chip market, it is in pole position to make the most of the lucrative multibillion-dollar opportunity. Not surprisingly, Broadcom carries a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.62 based on the five-year earnings growth that it is expected to deliver, as per Yahoo! Finance.\n\nA PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric that takes into account a company's long-term earnings growth potential. A reading of less than 1 means that the particular stock is undervalued with respect to the growth that it could clock. So, investors can buy Broadcom at an attractive level right now, and they may not want to miss this opportunity, considering that its next earnings report could send it on a bull run.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC discussed the massive tech sell-off on the back of a new AI LLM model from Chinese startup DeepSeek. Cramer was frank and honest about the level of confusion in the market and said he does not know the implications of the new model on US tech stocks given the lack of data and specifics. He thought out loud about the factors that can weigh on US companies after the breakthrough achieved by DeepSeek:\n\n\u201cThere could be some serious buyer\u2019s remorse now. Maybe all the spending going to (Jensen Huang\u2019s company) was needless overpay. Maybe the gigantic number of data centers being built, which are a huge driver of growth in our country, simply aren\u2019t needed. Maybe all the cooling process expenses are a big mistake. Maybe the rush to reopen old nuclear plants, put up more renewable generation, and even bring back coal is totally unnecessary. Today, the air went out of every one of these balloons.\u201d\n\nCramer said he\u2019d be looking out to know how many chips DeepSeek required to reach this software breakthrough to gauge the impact on demand for US AI chip companies. He said stocks could either rebound from all of this or continue to slide:\n\n\u201cAnd whether numbers now have to come down because there will be a freeze in spending as clients reassess those multi-billion dollar orders. Maybe it\u2019ll be like the pause in the internet build-out of 2000 that turned out not to be a pause at all, but a collapse.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about in his programs on CNBC.

More recently, selling from the pattern\u2019s top trendline has accelerated, with the price falling below the respected 50-day moving average (MA) on increasing trading volume.\n\nWhile the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bearish momentum with a reading below 40, the indicator sits at a level that often coincides with local bottoms in the stock.\n\nBelow, we identify three support levels that could be worth watching if the shares continue to fall and key overhead areas to monitor if the stock resumes its longer-term move higher.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Watch\n\nThe first lower level in play sits around $185. This area, currently positioned just below the descending channel, could find support near the top trendline of a prior ascending triangle on the chart and the nearby 200-day MA.\n\nA decisive close below this price could see the shares decline to the $160 level, a location that may provide a floor near several troughs that formed on the chart in June and November last year.\n\nFurther selling could bring lower support around $140 into play. Such a drop may attract investors looking for buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a range of similar price points on the chart from March through to September.\n\nKey Overhead Areas to Monitor\n\nIf Broadcom shares resume their longer-term uptrend, investors should watch how the price responds to the descending channel\u2019s top trendline. The upper area of the pattern currently sits at about $230 near the 50-day MA, but will move lower over time.\n\nFinally, investors could forecast a more speculative upside target by using the bars pattern tool. This technique works by taking Broadcom\u2019s trending move higher from late November to mid-December and repositioning it from the descending channel\u2019s lower trendline, which projects a target of around $295. This analysis assumes that a continuation move may play out in the stock.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Ramaswami said many customers had multi-year contracts with VMware and a hardware refresh was needed for the conversion to Nutanix.\n\nMigrating customers could go to Nutanix on the public cloud, such as AWS, or on-premises. They could migrate within the existing virtual machine environment or modernize (containerize) the workload and move to Kubernetes. Some VMware Cloud Foundation on AWS customers have already migrated to Nutanix running in AWS.\n\nSome existing three-tier architecture customers are still looking to move to a hyperconverged environment, which was the core Nutanix attraction. That has now been bolstered with the VMware migration opportunity. Ramaswami said customers like this are re-evaluating their entire IT stack \u201cbecause if they\u2019re being forced to look at an alternative and migration, it\u2019s also a good time for them to reexamine the overall stack.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a big-picture [level], that means, OK, maybe I should take some of these applications, put them in the cloud, maybe that should modernize some portion of my estate, and maybe I should move to a new stack.\u201d\n\nCustomers are moving toward a modern stack that can handle virtual machines and containers, as well as work on-prem and in the public cloud, \u201cand that\u2019s the kind of platform that we are providing today in the market.\u201d\n\nRamaswami also sees AI inferencing driving more GPT-in-a-Box and Nutanix Enterprise AI (NAI) software stack sales over the next few years.\n\nNutanix\u2019s original steady growth vector of three-tier customers converting to hyperconverged storage is being strengthened by distressed VMware customers fleeing from Broadcom and also by existing customers building up their Nutanix environments to support AI inferencing. These three trends have multi-year time scales and Nutanix sees itself positioned to benefit from them for quite some time.\n\nNext quarter\u2019s revenue outlook is for $625 million \u00b1 $5 million, a 19 percent increase over the year-ago Q3. The full FY 2026 outlook is for $2.505 billion \u00b1 $10 million, which is a $46 million increase on its original full year outlook and a 17 percent uplift from a year ago at the midpoint. This assumes the high customer acquisition rate continues as well as continuing revenue expansion with existing customers and good subscription renewal performance.",

A new white paper from the VeloCloud division of Broadcom, VeloRAIN: Next-Gen Security for AI-Driven Networks, examines these shifts. Organizations adopting AI applications are discovering that traditional network architectures, designed primarily for client-server web traffic, struggle to handle the unique demands of AI workloads. These challenges extend beyond just network performance issues. They represent fundamental shifts in how networks must be architected and secured.\n\nThe new networking reality of GenAI\n\nGenerative AI applications exhibit characteristics that break conventional networking assumptions. Unlike traditional web traffic, which primarily flows downstream to users, AI workloads generate symmetrical traffic patterns with comparable upload and download volumes. These applications are remarkably sensitive to latency, with even minor delays potentially disrupting distributed AI processing and leading to unreliable results. Add to this the unpredictable, bursty nature of AI traffic, and it becomes clear why organizations need to rethink their network infrastructure.\n\nEmerging security challenges\n\nThe security implications are equally profound. As AI applications become more prevalent, they introduce new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities that traditional security measures weren't designed to address. Organizations must now contend with threats like adversarial attacks on AI models, data poisoning attempts, and the emergence of shadow AI \u2014 the unauthorized use of AI tools that could expose sensitive corporate data. Traditional threat detection methods, which rely heavily on signature-based approaches, simply cannot keep pace with these evolving challenges.\n\nSecurity solutions from VeloCloud\n\nTo address these complex demands, the VeloCloud division of Broadcom has a suite of solutions anchored by the innovative VeloRAIN architecture. Short for VeloCloud Robust Artificial Intelligence Networking, VeloRAIN represents a fundamental reimagining of how enterprise networks should operate in the AI era.\n\nAt the foundation is VeloCloud SD-WAN, which provides robust security through multiple layers of protection. The solution implements strong encryption between all network components, enables sophisticated network segmentation to isolate different types of traffic, and includes advanced inspection capabilities through its Enhanced Firewall Service. These features ensure that AI workloads remain protected while maintaining the performance levels they require.\n\nComplementing VeloCloud SD-WAN capabilities is Symantec SSE for VeloCloud, the cloud-based security service that specifically addresses the challenges of protecting distributed AI applications. Key features include:\n\nMachine learning-based malware detection that can identify and block emerging threats\n\nHigh-speed decryption and re-encryption of SSL/TLS traffic to uncover threats hidden in encrypted communications\n\nInline cloud access security broker (CASB) capabilities to combat shadow AI risks\n\nAdvanced data protection leveraging AI-powered data loss prevention (DLP) engines\n\nVeloCloud SD-Access delivers path-optimized zero-trust networking specifically designed for distributed users and AI workloads. The solution provides end-to-end encryption using advanced protocols, supports encrypted peer-to-peer traffic essential for distributed AI processing, and implements granular, identity-based access controls that ensure only authorized users and devices can access sensitive resources.\n\nBalancing security with simplified management\n\nThe business benefits of this integrated approach are substantial. Organizations gain not only enhanced security against emerging threats but also improved performance for their AI workloads through intelligent traffic management and optimization. Centralized management and visibility across security components simplifies operations, while the architecture's inherent flexibility ensures it can adapt to future changes in the threat landscape.\n\nAs AI continues to reshape the enterprise technology landscape, organizations need partners who understand both the opportunities and challenges this transformation brings. VeloCloud's comprehensive security solutions demonstrate our commitment to helping customers navigate this new reality safely and successfully. By combining advanced threat protection, intelligent network optimization, and zero-trust principles, we're enabling organizations to embrace AI innovation while maintaining the highest levels of security and performance.\n\nTo learn more about how VeloCloud solutions help secure AI-driven network infrastructure, read the full white paper.",

            "content": "With a three year cadence between PCI-Express bandwidth increases and a three year span between when a gear shift is first talked about and when its chippery is first put into the field, it is extremely difficult to not be impatient for the next PCI-Express release to get into the field.\n\nAnd so, there are a lot of toes tapping as people await PCI-Express 6.0 ports on servers and switches and retimers to extend them and interlink them. But, according to Broadcom, which bought its way into the PCI-Express switching market when its parent company, Avago Technologies, acquired PCI-Express switch maker PLX Technology back in June 2014 for $309 million. That acquisition happened \u2013 and before Avago bought Broadcom and took its name in May 2015 for $67 billion \u2013 in part because system architects were trying to stuff lots of GPUs, other kinds of accelerators, flash storage, and network interfaces into a server which had too few ports. Hence the need for some kind of switch. Moreover, companies were also looking for a way to aggregate compute at rackscale that had lower latency and lower cost than using InfiniBand and Ethernet networks. PCI-Express switching fit both of the bills.\n\nFlash forward a decade, and it is entirely normal to have lots of PCI-Express switches inside a server and at the top of racks, although Nvidia has done one better with its proprietary NVSwitch architecture, which boasts a lot more bandwidth to couple GPUs and now CPUs together with shared memory inside of a node and even across nodes.\n\nThe world wants an open and affordable alternative to NVSwitch for glueing together components to create server nodes or rackscale systems, and PCI-Express switching is central to that. PCI-Express 6.0, which is a particularly pesky speed jump because so many things are changing at the same time because they have to if the bandwidth is to be doubled and the latency is to be help more or less constant with a messier set of error correction needs as signaling rates go up.\n\nAs we discussed in detail way back in August 2020, PCI-Express 6.0 moves to PAM-4 encoding (as Ethernet and InfiniBand already have), which gets two bits per signal to effectively double the data rate compared to Non Return To Zero (NRZ) encoding that predates PAM-4 and only has one bit per signal. But PAM-4 has a dirtier signal, with a bit error rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than PCI-Express 5.0 and its NRZ encoding at the same clock speed. The high error rate required forward error correction, or FEC, which adds to latency. Whoops. So the PCI-SIG, lead by Intel, Broadcom, and others, used a mix of flow control unit (FLIT) and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection that only increased latency for small packet sizes and actually reduces latency for large packet sizes by half. Home run!\n\nIt is a pity that server platforms and Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnects are refreshed every two years while it is taking three years for PCI-Express ports, retimers, and switches to get into the field \u2013 something we have lamented about as an impedance mismatch for a number of years. But it is what it is.\n\nBroadcom has kept to the cadence that the PCI-SIG sets, with multiple generations of its \u201cAtlas\u201d PCI-Express switches and \u201cVantage\u201d retimers, the latter of which we detailed back in March 2024. The retimers are becoming more and more important because every time you boost the bandwidth on a copper wire by a factor of two, the noise on the wire gets so bad that you can only mitigate the noise by cutting the length of the wire in half. So you need a retimer to boost the signal to push it a distance that used to pretty much come for free with a lower bandwidth.\n\nHere is the roadmap for PCI-Express switches and retimers from last year:\n\nAnd here is the one that is being released this week:\n\nThe Vantage 5 retimers support both PCI-Express 5.0 32 Gb/sec NRZ and PCI-Express 6.0 PAM-4 encoding, which is accomplished through the \u201cTalon 5\u201d SerDes created by Broadcom. We strongly suspect that the Talon 5 SerDes are also used in the Atlas 3 PCI-Express switches and provide the PAM-4 support.\n\nFor those looking to build more open and cheaper AI and HPC systems, you can imagine that PCI-Express 6.0 cannot get here fast enough. The good news is that it is on track, Sreeni Bagalkote, product line manager for PCI-Express switching at Broadcom\u2019s Data Center Solutions Group, tells The Next Platform. This week, Broad trotted out its PCI-Express 6.0 Interop Development Platform, which includes the \u201cAtlas 3\u201d PEX90144 switch and companion the \u201cVantage 5\u201d BCM85668A1 retimer, shown in the feature image at the top of this story.\n\n\u201cPCI-Express Gen 6 is probably the most important step function in the PCI-Express world,\u201d says Bagalkote. \u201cWe are not just announcing the portfolio of switches and retimers, we are also seeding our partners in the ecosystem with an Interop Development Platform. Gen 6.0 is going to be a tough transition because so many things are changing. That transition will happen first among the testers. Some people have already started building their test equipment using our Atlas 3 switches. And then after that, you will see companies move into manufacturing test, and by the end of the third quarter or the early part of the fourth quarter, you will start seeing manufacturing of systems with Gen 6 devices. The real AI servers with Gen 6 will start ramping up sometime next year.\u201d\n\nBack in the PCI-Express 3.0 days and into the early part of the PCI-Express 4.0 transition, it was Intel, and to a lesser extent, IBM and AMD, that drove the adoption rate for PCI-Express switches and retimers because these were tied to their CPU rollouts. By the PCI-Express 5.0 generation, it was the need for higher bandwidth PCI-Express switches and retimers and the need to cram more accelerators, flash, and network interfaces into an AI server that drove the timing. And with the PCI-Express 6.0 generation, the AI server is the main reason companies are pulling so hard to get the next step function in performance, says Bagalkote. A typical AI server with eight GPUs has four PCI-Express switches, and in the case of Broadcom Atlas 2 and 3 devices, each switch has 144 lanes that are implemented as 72 ports. That is 2.25X more lanes than will be available with alternative PCI-Express 6.0 switches, according to Bagalkote; we are not certain where that data is coming from. (We have not seen PCI-Express 6.0 announcements from Microchip, but they should be coming soon. Astera Labs is out there with its Scorpio line of PCI-Express switches, which we are going to analyze shortly.)\n\nWhat we do know is that more and faster lanes are needed in a modern AI server, and not just for connectivity, but for telemetry and troubleshooting these complex systems.\n\n\u201cUnlike in traditional PCIe, where all the traffic flows through the CPU, in an AI server there is no central CPU orchestration because AI accelerators are talking to each other with GPUDirect, and using GPUDirect for storage they are talking to the storage. The accelerators and the network interfaces are talking among themselves using peer to peer. So there is a lot of interaction going on between these devices, and the complexity is high. So we not only need to be very robust a PCI-Express switch, but we also discovered that we also, unwittingly and almost by happy accident, became a telemetry and diagnostic hub in most of the AI servers in the world. We have always had a huge amount of debug ability, but our realization is that it is just not enough. We need to enable the AI ecosystem at the rack level to be able to debug, so we kind of coherently stitched all our underlying capabilities and started exposing it to server vendors and also the AI deployers, the hyperscalers.\u201d\n\nThe Interop Development Platform is about bringing partners and customers together to build a coherent set of telemetry as well as to make things work.\n\nThis interop tool includes the ASICs from Broadcom as well as LeCroy exercisers and analyzers from Teledyne as well as interfaces to flash drives from Micron Technology.\n\nThis is all well and good, and we love that PCI-Express is moving along. But we have a thought here. Yes, the PCI-Express switches are good for lashing the flash and NICs to the accelerators and the CPUs in an AI server, or indeed any kind of HPC server or data analytics server.\n\nBut perhaps what we need is something that looks and smells a little bit more like NVLink ports and NVSwitches? What about aggregating PCI-Express ports like Nvidia does with NVSwitch? You would need to create a matching NVLink analog on the compute engines so they could be linked to each other or to host CPUs. Something a lot fatter than PCI-Express x16 lane aggregations.\n\nNvidia has not done as much magic as perhaps it gets credit for with NVLink and NVSwitch. The NVSwitch 4 ASIC, which we detailed back in March 2024, has 57.6 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth across an aggregate of 288 lanes running at 200 Gb/sec. Nvidia takes 72 lanes to make an NVLink 5 port, and each NVSwitch 4 therefore has a mere four ports. That NVLink 5 port delivers 1.8 TB/sec of bandwidth, which seems crazy but which is sometimes necessary with AI workloads.\n\nThe PCI-Express lanes run at 64 Gb/sec with PCI-Express 6.0, and with an x16 aggregation of lanes, that gives you 256 GB/sec of bandwidth (duplex). If you created what is in a sense an x64 port, you would have 1 TB/sec of bandwidth, and you would have 16 lanes of PCI-Express 6.0 left over to play with for some other use in the 144 lane switch. You could call it PCI-Link 1.0, and then set about to get more bandwidth into the PCI-Express 6.0 switches than they currently have. Throw some CXL memory addressing on the CPUs and GPUs, and you can do coherent memory over it, too.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

Shares of CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) both traded 5% higher at that time.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nWithout question, investors are turning their attention to AI chip king Nvidia and the company's release of its fiscal year fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results after the market closes. Wall Street analysts on average project earnings per share of $0.85 and quarterly revenue to have grown 72% year over year to $38.1 billion.\n\nHowever, the market will also be paying close attention to CEO Jensen Huang's comments on a variety of topics critical to the broader AI ecosystem, including the emergence of DeepSeek and its broader implications on AI capital spending and how easy and inexpensive it eventually could be to replicate large language models. Furthermore, analysts will also likely question management about the Trump administration's potential policies regarding export controls on chips and how they may impact the company if they go into effect.\n\nIn company-specific news, Meta might be in talks to build a new data center campus to house its artificial intelligence projects. The cost of the campus could surpass $200 billion, according to The Information, which first reported the news, citing anonymous sources. It seems that almost every other day, Meta is discussing some new massive AI infrastructure project, although a spokesperson from the company reportedly denied these rumors, calling them \"pure speculation.\"\n\nBank of America analyst Tal Liani reiterated his buy rating on CrowdStrike today and increased his price target to $420. Liani wrote that he expects the company to meet or beat consensus estimates when CrowdStrike reports its earnings on March 4. Liani believes the company's core business will continue to show growth, while there could be increased revenue from cross-selling and up-selling.\n\nWhile there wasn't a ton of news about Broadcom today, the company did announce yesterday the release of new technology that enables further interoperability between AI data centers.\n\nA potential inflection point, although risks remain\n\nNvidia's latest results clearly could be an inflection point for the AI sector. After dealing with some adversity in 2025, good results and guidance from Nvidia and positive comments from Huang could get AI stocks back on track. Meanwhile, bad results and comments that concern investors could mean further declines ahead.\n\nThat said, these are short-term concerns. Longer term, AI stocks are still vulnerable to the higher-for-longer rate environment and potentially concerns over a weakening consumer and potential recession, although a recession could also bring further rate cuts.\n\nTrading at 90 times forward earnings, I don't see any need for investors to jump into CrowdStrike, despite the company running a solid business. Broadcom and Meta look a little more appealing these days, trading at nearly 34 and 27 times forward earnings estimates, respectively. Broadcom's custom chip business and Meta's ability to monetize AI have been highlighted by many analysts. I don't own any of these large AI stocks right now, but I think these are solid and more affordable options over peers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, AI's impact extends beyond the tech world, also disrupting the way people are going to work in the evolving landscape.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence isn\u2019t just another invention, Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently remarked. Now that it is disrupting entire industries and economies, it may also hold the power to set up an entire economy in motion.\n\n\u201cBut [generative AI] isn\u2019t just another invention. It\u2019s a turning point, forcing us to rethink not just what work is, but what it means to be human at work.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, artificial intelligence is pushing us into a new work era.\n\n\u201cFor centuries, work was about our physical abilities on farms, and then again in the factories. It\u2019s only been the past couple decades that work has been about our intellectual abilities\u2026\n\nAccording to Raman, physical tasks are now being handled by automation, and intellectual ones are being taken over by AI. This leaves humans to be defined by their social abilities, he said. He further noted that in this era, human innovation and unique human skills, such as social and emotional intelligence, are going to be key determinants.",

Broadcom Knights, who have advanced training and certification requirements, have long been key to this success. They are masters when it comes to the ins and outs associated with sales, pre-sales, implementation, architecture and support for Broadcom\u2019s software solutions. So, we are excited to offer a similar program for our partners to support our VMware customers. Broadcom Knights with a specialty in VCF will allow us to help these customers to deploy VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform within their unique infrastructure. They will also enable our Expert Advantage Partners (EAP) to drive greater impact while enhancing and growing VCF in-region partnerships and expertise across the globe. We had our first training event for these technical professionals last month at our Americas partner event in Orlando.\n\nHelping Partners Deliver Exceptional Value to VCF customers\n\nTraditionally, most software organizations focus on the reselling and delivery of licenses. As products get more complex and the business problems get larger, services play a much more integral role in the success of adopting the product. Traditionally, services partners were always brought in late as part of the discussion. We learned from our previous acquisitions of the CA and the Symantec products that services partners can make a big difference in terms of making sure customers are getting the most out of the product. Metrics have shown that when we involve services earlier, customers are able to make full use of their solutions and thereby achieve their business objectives more easily, consistently and cost-efficiently.\n\nAt Broadcom, we\u2019re not interested in just selling licenses. We want to build long-term relationships with our customers and make sure they are hitting their big business objectives. By investing in Broadcom Knights with a specialty in VCF, our Expert Advantage Partners can show customers how to take pieces of VCF that they might not have used previously and then apply it to their business. In addition to fully leveraging VCF, these Knights can help customers fully integrate and become more efficient with their existing Broadcom solutions such as Clarity. The risk is if the customers don\u2019t realize the full value of their software, it becomes \u201cdreaded\u201d shelfware.\n\nShowcasing Broadcom Expert Advantage Partner Innovations on INSIGHTS\n\nJust as Expert Advantage Partners have always been able to showcase their Broadcom Knights on our INSIGHTS Platform, they now will be able to promote Broadcom Knights with a specialty in VCF as well. This dynamic database enables customers to discover solutions, integrations and other resources developed by our Expert Advantage Partners, enhancing their experience with Broadcom Software and VMware products. I am continuously impressed with our Expert Advantage Partners\u2019 technical innovations, integration successes, enablement capabilities and overall consistency and trust that they have demonstrated with our customers.\n\nFor example, in addition to designing \u201cjumpstart\u201d packages to help customers easily adopt VMware and Broadcom solutions, our partners are using their own tools or intellectual property to make assessments and deployment recommendations to customers. They also are actively leveraging Broadcom\u2019s own partner tools, developed in-house, such as the VMware Optimization Assessment, the VMware Cloud Maturity Model Assessment, and the VMware Health Analyzer.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s shift to more partner-led services provides a big opportunity for both our consulting services partners and our customers. We\u2019re counting on our partners to help our customers fully adopt our technologies to help drive better business outcomes. Our focus is on our customers\u2019 long-term success. With our partners by our side, we can spend time with our customers to ensure they are using our solutions to the fullest.\n\nPartner with an Expert Advantage Partner to Better Serve Your Customers\n\nAs President and CEO Hock Tan wrote in a blog, our partner ecosystem is essential to our customers\u2019 success. The customers we serve must meet very complex requirements and have very complex IT environments with many silos; it\u2019s not easy to integrate those silos into a streamlined platform. That takes heterogeneous integration and technical expertise. As the new program for Broadcom Knights with a specialty in VCF continues to roll out, we will be bringing you new updates and benefits.\n\nIf you are a customer, we invite you to check out Partner INSIGHTS to find the right partner and services for you. If you are a partner without a service practice but want to offer services to your customers, find an expert on the INSIGHTS portal and start a conversation. You can also connect with the Broadcom Partner Help Desk to determine which partner can best support you and your customers. Similarly, if you believe your services practice would benefit by joining the Expert Advantage Partner Program, connect with the Partner Help Desk at partner.helpdesk@broadcom.com.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for investors. The technology is poised to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC. That's a huge opportunity, but with so many companies touting their AI chops, it's difficult to know the best places to invest your money.\n\nTwo popular options are the conversational AI company SoundHound AI (SOUN -3.74%) and the semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO -1.55%). Let's look at each one's AI opportunities to see which company is the best AI stock to buy.\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nBroadcom designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are used in AI data center infrastructure. These AI chips help some of the world's most prominent tech companies -- including Alphabet and Meta -- stay ahead of the AI curve amid escalating competition.\n\nWhile there are many ways to benefit from AI, the largest tech companies are choosing to build out massive data centers to train AI models and power advanced AI software and services. Spending on AI data centers could reach an estimated $2 trillion over the next five years, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nBroadcom has already benefited from this AI spending bonanza, with the company's artificial intelligence revenue spiking 220% in 2024 to $12.2 billion. And more could be on the way. On Broadcom's recent earnings call, CEO Hock Tan said that over the next three years, there will be a \"massive\" AI opportunity for the company.\n\nBroadcom's stock isn't cheap. The company's shares have a forward price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 37, compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24. I don't think that makes Broadcom a stock to avoid, but it's always good to know when you're paying a premium for something.\n\nThe case for SoundHound AI\n\nWhile most people think of AI in the form of a chatbot that you interact with by typing questions, conversational artificial intelligence is quickly gaining momentum. SoundHound AI has some of the best conversational AI available. Its platform is used by Stellantis to bring voice-enabled commands to its vehicle brands, and by Chipotle in its automated drive-thrus.\n\nSoundHound's ability to expand its customer base, which now includes more than 200 enterprise customers, has also helped it diversify its sales. Consider that last year, 72% of SoundHound's revenue came from its largest customers, but they now account for just 12% of sales. Its customers were nearly all concentrated among automakers in 2023, but they're now spread across autos, financial services, restaurants, healthcare, and insurance.\n\nConversational AI could be worth an estimated $152 billion by 2033, and SoundHound is already reaping the benefits from the increasing demand. The company's sales jumped 89% in the most recent quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2024) to $25.1 million, and management estimates that 2025 sales will double from the previous year, reaching $83.5 million at the midpoint of guidance.\n\nSoundHound's stock has been on a wild ride over the past year, with a huge run-up followed by a recent pullback. But its shares are still up nearly 3x over the past 12 months, and that's made SoundHound AI's stock a bit pricey. The company's shares have a price-to-sales multiple of 50, making the stock very expensive by nearly any standard.\n\nVerdict: Broadcom is the better AI stock\n\nBoth of these AI stocks have a promising future, but I'm selecting Broadcom for the win for two reasons: market potential and price.\n\nTech companies around the globe are ramping up their AI data center infrastructure spending (potentially by $2 trillion), and Broadcom's tapping into it. As the AI wars heat up, I think Broadcom and other companies like it will continue to see increasing hardware demand.\n\nWhile Broadcom's stock isn't exactly cheap, it still looks less expensive than SoundHound. I'd feel far more comfortable paying a bit of a premium for data center infrastructure stock at a time when spending is ramping up than paying a hefty price for a conversational AI stock where the long-term market demand may not be as high.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other top dividend stocks.\n\nThe sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nDividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market\u2014excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.\n\nGlobal dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nAnalysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.",

            "content": "With a three year cadence between PCI-Express bandwidth increases and a three year span between when a gear shift is first talked about and when its chippery is first put into the field, it is extremely difficult to not be impatient for the next PCI-Express release to get into the field.\n\nAnd so, there are a lot of toes tapping as people await PCI-Express 6.0 ports on servers and switches and retimers to extend them and interlink them. But, according to Broadcom, which bought its way into the PCI-Express switching market when its parent company, Avago Technologies, acquired PCI-Express switch maker PLX Technology back in June 2014 for $309 million. That acquisition happened \u2013 and before Avago bought Broadcom and took its name in May 2015 for $67 billion \u2013 in part because system architects were trying to stuff lots of GPUs, other kinds of accelerators, flash storage, and network interfaces into a server which had too few ports. Hence the need for some kind of switch. Moreover, companies were also looking for a way to aggregate compute at rackscale that had lower latency and lower cost than using InfiniBand and Ethernet networks. PCI-Express switching fit both of the bills.\n\nFlash forward a decade, and it is entirely normal to have lots of PCI-Express switches inside a server and at the top of racks, although Nvidia has done one better with its proprietary NVSwitch architecture, which boasts a lot more bandwidth to couple GPUs and now CPUs together with shared memory inside of a node and even across nodes.\n\nThe world wants an open and affordable alternative to NVSwitch for glueing together components to create server nodes or rackscale systems, and PCI-Express switching is central to that. PCI-Express 6.0, which is a particularly pesky speed jump because so many things are changing at the same time because they have to if the bandwidth is to be doubled and the latency is to be help more or less constant with a messier set of error correction needs as signaling rates go up.\n\nAs we discussed in detail way back in August 2020, PCI-Express 6.0 moves to PAM-4 encoding (as Ethernet and InfiniBand already have), which gets two bits per signal to effectively double the data rate compared to Non Return To Zero (NRZ) encoding that predates PAM-4 and only has one bit per signal. But PAM-4 has a dirtier signal, with a bit error rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than PCI-Express 5.0 and its NRZ encoding at the same clock speed. The high error rate required forward error correction, or FEC, which adds to latency. Whoops. So the PCI-SIG, lead by Intel, Broadcom, and others, used a mix of flow control unit (FLIT) and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection that only increased latency for small packet sizes and actually reduces latency for large packet sizes by half. Home run!\n\nIt is a pity that server platforms and Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnects are refreshed every two years while it is taking three years for PCI-Express ports, retimers, and switches to get into the field \u2013 something we have lamented about as an impedance mismatch for a number of years. But it is what it is.\n\nBroadcom has kept to the cadence that the PCI-SIG sets, with multiple generations of its \u201cAtlas\u201d PCI-Express switches and \u201cVantage\u201d retimers, the latter of which we detailed back in March 2024. The retimers are becoming more and more important because every time you boost the bandwidth on a copper wire by a factor of two, the noise on the wire gets so bad that you can only mitigate the noise by cutting the length of the wire in half. So you need a retimer to boost the signal to push it a distance that used to pretty much come for free with a lower bandwidth.\n\nHere is the roadmap for PCI-Express switches and retimers from last year:\n\nAnd here is the one that is being released this week:\n\nThe Vantage 5 retimers support both PCI-Express 5.0 32 Gb/sec NRZ and PCI-Express 6.0 PAM-4 encoding, which is accomplished through the \u201cTalon 5\u201d SerDes created by Broadcom. We strongly suspect that the Talon 5 SerDes are also used in the Atlas 3 PCI-Express switches and provide the PAM-4 support.\n\nFor those looking to build more open and cheaper AI and HPC systems, you can imagine that PCI-Express 6.0 cannot get here fast enough. The good news is that it is on track, Sreeni Bagalkote, product line manager for PCI-Express switching at Broadcom\u2019s Data Center Solutions Group, tells The Next Platform. This week, Broad trotted out its PCI-Express 6.0 Interop Development Platform, which includes the \u201cAtlas 3\u201d PEX90144 switch and companion the \u201cVantage 5\u201d BCM85668A1 retimer, shown in the feature image at the top of this story.\n\n\u201cPCI-Express Gen 6 is probably the most important step function in the PCI-Express world,\u201d says Bagalkote. \u201cWe are not just announcing the portfolio of switches and retimers, we are also seeding our partners in the ecosystem with an Interop Development Platform. Gen 6.0 is going to be a tough transition because so many things are changing. That transition will happen first among the testers. Some people have already started building their test equipment using our Atlas 3 switches. And then after that, you will see companies move into manufacturing test, and by the end of the third quarter or the early part of the fourth quarter, you will start seeing manufacturing of systems with Gen 6 devices. The real AI servers with Gen 6 will start ramping up sometime next year.\u201d\n\nBack in the PCI-Express 3.0 days and into the early part of the PCI-Express 4.0 transition, it was Intel, and to a lesser extent, IBM and AMD, that drove the adoption rate for PCI-Express switches and retimers because these were tied to their CPU rollouts. By the PCI-Express 5.0 generation, it was the need for higher bandwidth PCI-Express switches and retimers and the need to cram more accelerators, flash, and network interfaces into an AI server that drove the timing. And with the PCI-Express 6.0 generation, the AI server is the main reason companies are pulling so hard to get the next step function in performance, says Bagalkote. A typical AI server with eight GPUs has four PCI-Express switches, and in the case of Broadcom Atlas 2 and 3 devices, each switch has 144 lanes that are implemented as 72 ports. That is 2.25X more lanes than will be available with alternative PCI-Express 6.0 switches, according to Bagalkote; we are not certain where that data is coming from. (We have not seen PCI-Express 6.0 announcements from Microchip, but they should be coming soon. Astera Labs is out there with its Scorpio line of PCI-Express switches, which we are going to analyze shortly.)\n\nWhat we do know is that more and faster lanes are needed in a modern AI server, and not just for connectivity, but for telemetry and troubleshooting these complex systems.\n\n\u201cUnlike in traditional PCIe, where all the traffic flows through the CPU, in an AI server there is no central CPU orchestration because AI accelerators are talking to each other with GPUDirect, and using GPUDirect for storage they are talking to the storage. The accelerators and the network interfaces are talking among themselves using peer to peer. So there is a lot of interaction going on between these devices, and the complexity is high. So we not only need to be very robust a PCI-Express switch, but we also discovered that we also, unwittingly and almost by happy accident, became a telemetry and diagnostic hub in most of the AI servers in the world. We have always had a huge amount of debug ability, but our realization is that it is just not enough. We need to enable the AI ecosystem at the rack level to be able to debug, so we kind of coherently stitched all our underlying capabilities and started exposing it to server vendors and also the AI deployers, the hyperscalers.\u201d\n\nThe Interop Development Platform is about bringing partners and customers together to build a coherent set of telemetry as well as to make things work.\n\nThis interop tool includes the ASICs from Broadcom as well as LeCroy exercisers and analyzers from Teledyne as well as interfaces to flash drives from Micron Technology.\n\nThis is all well and good, and we love that PCI-Express is moving along. But we have a thought here. Yes, the PCI-Express switches are good for lashing the flash and NICs to the accelerators and the CPUs in an AI server, or indeed any kind of HPC server or data analytics server.\n\nBut perhaps what we need is something that looks and smells a little bit more like NVLink ports and NVSwitches? What about aggregating PCI-Express ports like Nvidia does with NVSwitch? You would need to create a matching NVLink analog on the compute engines so they could be linked to each other or to host CPUs. Something a lot fatter than PCI-Express x16 lane aggregations.\n\nNvidia has not done as much magic as perhaps it gets credit for with NVLink and NVSwitch. The NVSwitch 4 ASIC, which we detailed back in March 2024, has 57.6 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth across an aggregate of 288 lanes running at 200 Gb/sec. Nvidia takes 72 lanes to make an NVLink 5 port, and each NVSwitch 4 therefore has a mere four ports. That NVLink 5 port delivers 1.8 TB/sec of bandwidth, which seems crazy but which is sometimes necessary with AI workloads.\n\nThe PCI-Express lanes run at 64 Gb/sec with PCI-Express 6.0, and with an x16 aggregation of lanes, that gives you 256 GB/sec of bandwidth (duplex). If you created what is in a sense an x64 port, you would have 1 TB/sec of bandwidth, and you would have 16 lanes of PCI-Express 6.0 left over to play with for some other use in the 144 lane switch. You could call it PCI-Link 1.0, and then set about to get more bandwidth into the PCI-Express 6.0 switches than they currently have. Throw some CXL memory addressing on the CPUs and GPUs, and you can do coherent memory over it, too.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

How might the sale of Intel\u2019s manufacturing and design businesses impact competition and technological innovation? And most importantly, what does this shift mean for the future of semiconductor manufacturing on a global scale?\n\nThe Complex Landscape of Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing has undergone a remarkable evolution since the development of the first integrated circuits. Over the years, the industry has witnessed numerous breakthroughs, with each advancement paving the way for more complex and powerful devices.\n\nThe early days of semiconductor manufacturing were marked by small-scale production processes, with individual companies handling their own manufacturing needs. However, as the industry grew and became more complex, the need for specialised facilities and expertise became apparent. This led to the establishment of semiconductor foundries, which offer contract manufacturing services to a wide range of clients.\n\nThe Cost Challenges of Semiconductor Fabrication\n\nFoundries provide access to advanced equipment, trained personnel, and research facilities, allowing manufacturers to focus on design and product development while leaving the manufacturing process to the experts. Today, foundries are a crucial component of the semiconductor industry, with many companies relying on them for the bulk of their manufacturing needs.\n\nHowever, foundries are not without their faults nor challenges, with the most significant challenge faced by semiconductor manufacturers being the high cost associated with cutting-edge facilities. The development and maintenance of advanced manufacturing facilities require substantial investments, with costs running into billions of dollars. The construction of a new facility can take years, with numerous delays and setbacks along the way. Once operational, the facility must be continuously updated with the latest equipment and technologies to remain competitive.\n\nTechnical Challenges in Chip Miniaturisation\n\nAs technology advances, the size of features on chips continues to shrink, making them increasingly difficult to produce. The transition from 20nm to 10nm and beyond has presented numerous technical challenges, with manufacturers struggling to achieve the desired level of precision and accuracy. The introduction of new materials and manufacturing techniques has helped to address some of these challenges, but the limitations of current technology have made it difficult to scale down chip size further.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is known for its rapid market changes, with demand for certain products and technologies shifting almost overnight. The challenge of keeping up with such demand fluctuations while maintaining production capacity is a daunting task for manufacturers. The impact of global supply chains on delivery schedules is another critical factor that manufacturers must consider. Disruptions in supply chains can lead to delays in production, resulting in missed delivery deadlines and lost revenue.\n\nProcess Nodes and Their Impact on Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nMaking matters worse, companies such as Intel have traditionally tied their products to specific process nodes, with each node representing a specific level of technological advancement. This tight integration of technology advancements with process nodes has led to potential setbacks for manufacturers as the failure to achieve desired results at a specific node can result in costly delays and setbacks, making it challenging for manufacturers to stay on schedule.\n\nThe semiconductor industry operates in a fast-paced environment, with a continuous need for research and innovation to stay ahead of the curve. The pressure to innovate while managing costs and operational efficiencies is a significant challenge that manufacturers face on a daily basis. The need to balance short-term goals with long-term vision is a delicate balancing act that requires careful planning and execution. Manufacturers that fail to adapt to changing market demands and technological advancements risk falling behind their competitors, making innovation a critical component of survival in the semiconductor industry.\n\nIntel Exploring Sale of Chip Manufacturing Business to TSMC and Broadcom\n\nIn a move that could reshape the semiconductor industry, Intel is reportedly considering the sale of its chip manufacturing business to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Broadcom. According to sources, TSMC is in talks with Intel to acquire its manufacturing facilities, while Broadcom is eyeING the company's chip design business.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that such a deal could accelerate semiconductor industry consolidation, potentially leading to increased dependence on a smaller number of key players. As TSMC and Broadcom expand their foothold, concerns over supply chain resilience and market competition may prompt further scrutiny from regulatory authorities across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIntel\u2019s Declining Market Position and Competitive Challenges\n\nThe development comes as Intel's fortunes have been in decline over the past few years. The chipmaker's market value has plummeted, and it has undergone significant restructuring efforts, including the termination of its former CEO, Pat Geling, and the layoff of thousands of employees. Despite this, Intel has managed to maintain its position as a major player in the industry, with a focus on innovation and research.\n\nDespite these restructuring efforts, Intel continues to face mounting competition from fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia and AMD, both of which have leveraged TSMC\u2019s advanced manufacturing processes to deliver cutting-edge semiconductor solutions. This shift raises questions about whether Intel\u2019s pivot towards chip design alone will be sufficient to maintain long-term market relevance.\n\nGeopolitical Concerns and Government Involvement\n\nIntel's interim executive chairman, Frank Yerary, is leading the discussions with potential suitors, including TSMC and Broadcom. The Trump administration is also involved in the talks, with officials expressing concerns about the fate of a critical national security company. Intel was set to benefit from the US CHIPS Act under the previous Biden administration, but the company did not receive the necessary funding before the administration changed.\n\nThe potential sale of Intel\u2019s manufacturing arm to TSMC has raised national security concerns in Washington, with policymakers wary of increasing foreign control over critical semiconductor infrastructure. Given the U.S. government\u2019s push to revitalise domestic chip production through the CHIPS Act, regulators may impose additional conditions on any deal to ensure continued investment in American semiconductor capabilities.\n\nThe potential sale of Intel's manufacturing business to TSMC would be a significant development in the semiconductor industry. TSMC is already a major player in the field, with a strong reputation for producing high-quality chips. If the sale were to go through, it would likely have a major impact on the industry, with potential implications for competition and market share.\n\nTSMC\u2019s Growing Dominance in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nA successful acquisition could reshape the global semiconductor landscape, cementing TSMC\u2019s dominance as the industry\u2019s go-to manufacturer. However, such consolidation may also introduce new risks, including increased supply chain vulnerabilities and potential price fluctuations due to reduced competition in high-end chip fabrication.\n\nThe sale of Intel's chip design business to Broadcom would also be a significant move. Broadcom is a well-established company with a strong track record in the semiconductor industry. The acquisition of Intel's chip design capabilities would give Broadcom a major boost, allowing it to expand its product offerings and increase its market share.\n\nWith this acquisition, Broadcom is expected to leverage Intel\u2019s chip design expertise to strengthen its position in data centre and AI-driven semiconductor markets. The company\u2019s focus on networking and high-performance computing could benefit from Intel\u2019s legacy in x86 architecture, potentially leading to new advancements in cloud computing and AI acceleration hardware.\n\nReimagining Roles and Shaping Tomorrow's Semiconductor Industry\n\nThe semiconductor industry stands on a knife edge in its history, with the sale of Intel's manufacturing business to TSMCs and Broadcom. The shift from early, integrated circuit production to the current model of highly specialised foundries reflects the increasing complexity of the manufacturing process, but this sale could threaten this very model that has otherwise proven to be massively successful.\n\nAs we move forward, several key trends will undoubtedly shape the semiconductor industry's future. The rise of foundry dominance is likely to continue, with TSMCs and Samsung solidifying their positions as industry leaders, with this consolidation allowing foundries to operate more efficiently, but it also raises the risk of monopolisation and the potential loss of competition in the industry. The dependency of global semiconductor supply on a limited number of foundry companies may create new geopolitical and supply chain challenges, particularly as nations strive to secure their own semiconductor sovereignty.\n\nGeopolitical Influence on Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nGeopolitics and supply chains will also play a significant role in the industry's future. The semiconductor industry has become a critical area of focus for governments around the world, with the U.S. and EU investing heavily in domestic semiconductor production capabilities. The CHIP Act in the U.S., for example, aims to reduce the country's reliance on Asian foundries and promote domestic production for national security and economic purposes. If Intel's manufacturing business is sold to TSMC, it could prompt further government intervention to ensure that domestic production remains viable.\n\nThe role of artificial intelligence (AI) and new materials will also become increasingly important in the industry's future development. As transistors approach their physical limits, alternative approaches such as advanced packaging techniques, new materials like gallium nitride (GaAs) and silicon carbide, and AI-driven chip design will be essential for continued innovation. AI is expected to play a key role in streamlining research and development processes, enabling more rapid innovation cycles and more efficient manufacturing processes.\n\nAI and New Materials Driving Future Innovation\n\nThe end of Moore's Law, which has driven the semiconductor industry's growth for decades, is also a significant trend that will shape the industry's future. While the industry has traditionally relied on transistor shrinkage to achieve performance gains, it is now shifting focus to architectural innovations such as 3D chiplets, heterogeneous integration, and advanced packaging techniques. This shift allows the industry to continue progressing, even as physical limits are approached, while the exploration of new materials and technologies, such as quantum computing, can help to achieve further performance gains.\n\nThe reshaping of industry leadership is another key trend that will impact the semiconductor industry's future development. If Intel exits the chip manufacturing business, it will likely become a more agile and innovative company focused on design and software solutions, similar to AMD. TSMC and Broadcom, on the other hand, will solidify their positions as industry leaders, shaping the future of semiconductor manufacturing. New entrants may also emerge, particularly those with specialised chip designs that leverage the latest technologies and innovations. The acquisition of Intel's design business by Broadcom could lead to a new era of competition in the industry, driving innovation and product differentiation.\n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry is at a critical juncture, with several key trends shaping its future development. The rise of foundries, geopolitical considerations, the role of AI and new materials, the end of Moore's Law and the shift to new technologies, and the reshaping of industry leadership will all play important roles in determining the industry's future trajectory. Companies that can adapt to these trends and navigate the complexities of the industry will be well-positioned for success in the years to come.",

(TSMC) and Broadcom are separately considering deals to split Intel apart, with Broadcom interested in the chip design and marketing side of the business and TSMC potentially interested in the chip factories. That story came on the heels of a report from eeNews Europe, which suggested an alternative scenario in which Intel could merge with GlobalFoundries, a firm born out of AMD\u2019s manufacturing division that was spun off some years back when the then-struggling chipmaker decided to go fabless.\n\nThere\u2019s no confirmation that Intel is going to be sold off to any of the potential suitors rumored to be sniffing around, but there are obstacles that any buyer will need to be aware of. One, of course, is that the US government isn\u2019t likely to be keen on allowing a foreign entity like TSMC to run Intel\u2019s chip business. Another issue, which Digit to Dollars brought to light back in November 2024, could further complicate any deal.\n\nBroad cross-licensing agreements\n\n\u201cWe are frequently asked some version of \u2018Will someone acquire Intel?\u2019\", the site noted. \"At this point, we think it is highly unlikely, but these are highly unpredictable times. Setting aside all the principal considerations \u2013 like money, strategy, and regulatory approval \u2013 there are a few other hurdles. Chief among those is Intel\u2019s license for x86.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, when Intel and AMD resolved their multi-decade dispute over x86, the cross-license agreement held provisions about transferability. If either company is acquired, the other has the right to cancel the license, effectively blocking the deal. When this was signed, we have to think everyone involved assumed it would be AMD getting acquired, but the provision seems to be mutual, and times change.\u201d\n\nChange they do indeed. While AMD is performing well, Intel\u2026 isn\u2019t. Hence all the speculation surrounding its potential acquisition.\n\nThe broad cross-licensing agreements, which aren\u2019t limited purely to the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA), mean Intel and AMD can use each other\u2019s patents and will avoid accidental infringement lawsuits. There are strict rules over what they can do, so for example, Intel can\u2019t make chips for AMD\u2019s sockets and vice versa.\n\nThe cross-license agreement states that if either AMD or Intel merges with another firm or gets acquired, the deal ends and will require the remaining chipmaker to negotiate a new agreement with the new owner. If Broadcom were to buy Intel, that could create an interesting scenario.\n\nAre you a pro?

Broadcom, however, is far ahead in 11th place, which shows its industry clout.\n\nA licensing agreement between AMD and Broadcom would be in both companies\u2019 interests, but what form that might take is anyone\u2019s guess right now.",

            "content": "The chipmaking giant could be devoured by two of its biggest industry peers.\n\nIntel (INTC 14.48%) might be split up and sold to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.38%), also known as TSMC, and Broadcom (AVGO -1.54%), according to the latest rumors. The chipmakers haven't responded to those reports, but such a deal could shake up the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe most recent report from The Wall Street Journal claims Intel held \"informal\" talks to sell its foundry business to TSMC and its chip design business to Broadcom. Both rumored deals would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny, but we should discuss how Intel got here -- and what its breakup and sale might mean for TSMC and Broadcom.\n\nHow did Intel fall this far?\n\nIntel is still the world's largest designer and manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. However, it missed the leap to mobile chips and ceded that growing market to Arm's power-efficient chip designs, and its foundries fell behind TSMC and Samsung in the \"process race\" to manufacture smaller and denser chips.\n\nAs Intel struggled with shortages and delays, its smaller x86 competitor, AMD, pulled ahead with a stable supply of cheaper and more power-efficient chips by outsourcing its production to TSMC. Instead of catching up to TSMC, Intel repeatedly shifted its short-term strategies under three CEOs over the past decade.\n\nUnder Pat Gelsinger, who served as Intel's CEO from 2021 to 2024, the chipmaker tried to expand and upgrade its foundries to catch up to TSMC and Samsung. But those capital-intensive efforts coincided with the broader slowdown of the PC market, and it struggled to ramp up its production of its Meteor Lake CPUs to fend off AMD. Its CPUs also became less relevant than Nvidia's GPUs as companies scrambled to upgrade their data centers to handle the latest artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nIntel won't go bankrupt anytime soon, but it's clearly being left behind in the semiconductor race. That's why it isn't too surprising that the chipmaker, which still lacks a permanent CEO, might be mulling a sale to TSMC and Broadcom.\n\nWhat would that deal mean for TSMC?\n\nTSMC is already the world's largest and most technologically advanced contract chipmaker. The top fabless chipmakers -- including Nvidia, AMD, and Apple -- all outsource the production of their smallest chips to TSMC.\n\nTSMC controls 64.9% of the global foundry market, according to TrendForce. Samsung ranks a distant second at 9.3%, while Intel only holds 1% of the market. Therefore, buying Intel's foundries would only slightly increase TSMC's market share, but it would snub Intel's fledgling efforts to pull away some of its fabless clients.\n\nTaking over Intel's U.S. foundries could also accelerate TSMC's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base beyond Taiwan and reduce its exposure to the Trump administration's tariffs.\n\nHowever, such a deal would likely be challenged by TSMC's investors, who might think it's unnecessary to inherit Intel's weaker foundry business, or antitrust regulators. TSMC also doesn't need to increase its exposure to the sluggish x86 CPU market when high-end data center GPUs (mainly from Nvidia) are driving most of its growth.\n\nWhat would that deal mean for Broadcom?\n\nBroadcom already sells a wide range of chips for the mobile, wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial markets. It also significantly expanded its infrastructure business by acquiring CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security division, and the cloud software giant VMware over the past seven years.\n\nIf Broadcom acquires Intel's chip design division, it could develop its own x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. That would complement its own growth in the data center market, where it's experiencing robust sales of networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips for AI-oriented data centers. In fiscal 2024 (which ended last October), its sales of AI-oriented chips more than tripled to $12.2 billion and accounted for 24% of its top line.\n\nIf Broadcom bundles all those chips together, it could simultaneously challenge AMD, Nvidia, and more diversified chipmakers like Texas Instruments. But just like TSMC, Broadcom would need to clear a lot of regulatory hurdles to seal that deal.\n\nMoreover, AMD holds a multi-decade cross-licensing deal with Intel, which grants it the power to veto any sale of Intel's x86 design business. Such a deal would also contradict Broadcom's previous strategy of inorganically expanding its infrastructure software business to reduce its exposure to the cyclical semiconductor market.\n\nIt's all speculation for now\n\nThese potential deals are generating a lot of buzz, but investors should be skeptical of these rumors. Even if TSMC and Broadcom are interested in carving up Intel, it could take years for those deals to be approved. It also seems more likely that TSMC and Broadcom could simply invest in those businesses instead of buying them outright.\n\nSo instead of buying these stocks based on those potential deals, investors should focus on them as stand-alone investments. Intel will remain the penalty box for the foreseeable future, but TSMC and Broadcom are both stable long-term investments.",

Primark, one of the best in the business, embraces a cloud future with VMware Cloud Foundation and Azure VMware Solution to ensure its continued agility.\n\nShare \"Primark Fashions Cloud Future with Broadcom\" on Twitter\n\nShare \"Primark Fashions Cloud Future with Broadcom\" on Facebook\n\nShare \"Primark Fashions Cloud Future with Broadcom\" on LinkedIn\n\nAs fashion retailers compete across their bricks-and-mortar and online stores, it has become critical to establish an adaptive IT infrastructure. Point of Sale (POS) terminals must operate without fail, and real-time stock updates are critical to optimize inventory management. With 430 stores in 18 countries, 75,000 employees, and a turnover of EUR \u20ac10 billion, Primark understands the value that speed, agility and scalability bring. The company relies on and takes action based on daily business reports.\n\n\u201cInnovation is in how we manage our business,\u201d says Stephen Byrne, head of global infrastructure, Primark. \u201cAnd, as a business that innovates, we look for opportunities regarding automation, value, and speed. None of that can happen without the underlying IT services being in place to support it.\u201d\n\nMade-to-measure data centers\n\nPrimark is growing and anticipates having 530 stores by 2026. Even with this growth, the company is on track to reduce its physical data center footprint. Thus, Primark required a new, highly agile infrastructure and a cloud-first approach, or precisely, a cloud strategy that allows critical applications to be kept on a private cloud all while allowing the option to seamlessly move those applications to, or back from, the public cloud when appropriate.\n\nThe new infrastructure is built on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) technology and was designed and implemented by partner Triangle Technology Services, the 2023 VMware EMEA Customer Lifecycle Award Winner.\n\n\u201cInitially, we partnered with Primark on a large Oracle project, and over the subsequent years, we have transformed its VMware footprint and SaaS estate from legacy environments to a fully-fledged VMware software-defined stack,\u201d says Donal Byrne, CTO, Triangle Technology Services. \u201cPrimark now has an IT infrastructure that matches the speed of the business.\u201d\n\nTriangle leveraged VCF (and Advanced Services for VCF) to design and implement the migration of four data centers into two and create a third one on Azure VMware Solution, which provides a VCF environment in the Azure cloud.\n\nMission-critical applications can therefore be moved back and forth seamlessly between the two new private cloud data centers and the Azure VMware Solution public cloud environment. In fact, Primark has already moved certain applications to the Azure VMware Solution environment, and VMs can be rapidly added as usage scales up. Over 50 virtual machines are in the public cloud, and the number is growing. Primark enjoys automated capacity reporting and has experienced zero outages in the last six months.\n\nIn addition, Triangle has successfully migrated workloads to Azure VMware Solution. The migration maintains the standard security profile for all workloads, addressing one of the retailer\u2019s essential risk requirements and audit points.\n\nA secure environment that\u2019s also cost-effective meets our needs in terms of how we manage it and the value it provides. Stephen Byrne,\n\nHead of Global Infrastructure, Primark.\n\nVMware Cloud Foundation Automation offers capacity reporting, enabling Primark to project future workloads using real-time predictive analytics across the data centers, including cloud endpoints. Moreover, the project was transitioned to Primark managed service practices, and Triangle manages the entire infrastructure according to strict SLAs for availability and stability.\n\nScalability to avoid bursting at the seams\n\nTriangle has transformed the entirety of Primark\u2019s operations, including changing the license type from perpetual to subscription. Portability of VCF subscriptions to and from Azure VMware Solution is now offered by Broadcom and Microsoft, providing Primark the agility to deploy on-premises or in the cloud as preferred.\n\nVMware Cloud Foundation provides the cornerstone for standardization and self-service, infrastructure stability, and superior performance and capacity with built-in scalability to the cloud.\n\n\u201cOur reliability has improved drastically since we modernized our data centers,\u201d says Cian O'Leary, data center operations lead, Primark. \u201cWith Primark\u2019s aggressive opening of new stores, we\u2019ve needed to leverage our software-defined data center (SDDC) platform to scale quickly when needed. Although store planning can take up to three years, from an infrastructure point of view, we're ready to go at a flick of a switch.\u201d\n\nThe company increased its retail store footprint by 5 percent, 22 stores, in 2024. There was a 100 percent improvement in stability and performance tickets during peak trading periods and zero store outages and incidents compared to weekly critical incidents seen previously.\n\nThe success of the platform built on VCF is evident in the evolving architecture supporting the company's growth without significant operational overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe impact we\u2019ve seen is incredibly positive,\u201d says Byrne. \u201cThe business can't grow without us being able to provide these services, and we\u2019re doing this seamlessly.\u201d",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Broadcom Inc. falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of +36.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.31 points to a change of +29.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.45 indicates a change of +18.2% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Broadcom Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $14.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22.2%. The $61 billion and $69.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.3% and +14.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nBroadcom Inc. reported revenues of $14.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.2%. EPS of $1.42 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.06%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

            "content": "Ranking among the major players in the infrastructural arena of artificial intelligence, Broadcom Inc. AVGO essentially provides the backbone for data centers. Primarily, its products undergird networking, custom accelerator and storage solutions. However, concerns related to a possible buyout of the chip design and marketing business of Intel Corp. INTC has seen AVGO stock decline conspicuously. Ultimately, though, history has proven such dips tend to spark buying activity.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Broadcom has garnered a reputation for its ability to acquire, integrate and extract value from major acquisitions. Notably, the tech giant bought out VMware, at the time a leading cloud computing and virtualization company. Broadcom rebranded the acquired firm and incorporated it into its existing infrastructure and security software solutions unit. Still, the latest report puts this reputation to the test.\n\nEarly last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom has been analyzing the viability of acquiring Intel's chip design and marketing unit. On the other end, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM is exploring the prospect of acquiring Intel's chip plants. Broadcom and TSMC are not working together and the talks remain preliminary.\n\nNevertheless, the prospect of Broadcom buying a component of Intel's business worried several investors. Among the major tech players, Intel has lagged the competition through a variety of missteps and self-inflicted wounds. Naturally, a possible deal would raise concerns about integration challenges and broader financial implications.\n\nInvestors Usually Come Around to Bolster AVGO Stock\n\nWhile circumstances aren't particularly favorable for AVGO stock at the moment, traders should note that historically, the security benefits from an upward bias. To be clear, this framework doesn't guarantee long-side success. Generally speaking, though, bullish traders \u2014 based on prevailing trends \u2014 are likelier to be rewarded for their acquisitiveness. What's more, investors tend to view dips in AVGO as buying opportunities.\n\nLet's consider the raw numbers. Using data from January 2019, a position entered in AVGO stock at the beginning of the week has around a 57% chance of rising by the end of it. Over an eight-week period, this baseline probability varies but eventually culminates in long odds of approximately 69%. Again, traders who adopt a bullish perspective are more aligned with AVGO's natural rhythm.\n\nWhat's really interesting is that this behavior tilts even more favorably for the bulls whenever AVGO encounters volatility. Last week, the equity lost just under 5%. Under similar circumstances, the subsequent week following the negative anchor event sees long odds dip below the baseline probability to approximately 54%. Therefore, it's not surprising that this week started off in the red.\n\nImage by author\n\nNevertheless, based on past data, the dynamic long odds (accounting for data within specific parameters) from the second week onward tend to rise above the baseline probability. Stated differently, investors eventually buy the discount in AVGO stock.\n\nTo reiterate, history isn't guaranteed to repeat itself. However, AVGO stock may be one of the more reliable trading ideas to bet on because it's so heavily traded. In other words, the pricing behavior is a tad more predictable. Case in point is AVGO's behavior under extreme volatility. Back when the DeepSeek impact cratered tech stocks, AVGO followed a predictable pattern, which appears to have only been undone by the aforementioned Intel buyout report.\n\nBack At The Wheel Again\n\nIn anticipation of Broadcom stock eventually bouncing back from its downward spell, aggressive traders can target long-side options strategies for derivatives expiring March 7. Historically, AVGO tends to post a median return of around 5.7% two weeks following a five-day period of modest volatility, assuming the materialization of the positive scenario.\n\nWith this forecast in mind, speculators may look to the 220/225 bull call spread. This transaction involves buying the $220 call and simultaneously selling the $225 call, using the proceeds from the short call to partially offset the debit paid of the long call. Granted, this setup caps the upside reward at the $225 short call strike price. However, the benefit is that the net transaction is significantly cheaper than buying the $220 call outright.\n\nOne wrinkle to consider is that Broadcom will disclose its first-quarter earnings report on March 6. As such, market makers are likely pricing in a volatility crush, which may be why the same 220/225 bull spread expiring March 21 features the same net debit cost \u2014 which is $210 at time of writing \u2014 as the earlier-expiring spread.\n\nUltimately, the deciding factor will come down to the trader's perspective and risk tolerance. Still, for speculators seeking to extract a quick profit, the March 7 spread may be more attractive, especially in mitigating opportunity costs from an unnecessarily lengthy spread.",

It\u2019s a reality David Simpson, senior vice president of Cloud Practice growth at Kyndryl, knows well.\n\n\u201cAt Kyndryl, we have a long and extensive track record of designing, building, managing, and modernizing the complex, mission-critical information systems organizations around the world rely on every day,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cWorking with a strong and extensive cadre of partners and many thousands of customers \u2013 from new innovators to the world\u2019s most established and successful brands \u2013 our teams are hard at work addressing the challenges and the opportunities emerging in light of transformative computing trends that are accelerating and growing in importance across the globe.\u201d\n\nThe depth of the company\u2019s solutions suite and services offerings reflect the scope and breadth of these challenges and opportunities and encompass applications, data and AI, the digital workplace, core enterprise systems, networks, the edge, and cyber resilience and security. All are supported by a deep bench of IT and cloud experts within Kyndryl Consult, a global network of technology strategy and implementation consultants with extensive experience helping customers create a winning digital transformation strategy, an enterprise architecture that ideally addresses their unique needs, and the culture required to realize its full potential.\n\nThis applies to all of the industries Kyndryl serves. These include the automotive; banking and finance; energy; government; healthcare; insurance; manufacturing; retail; technology, media and telecommunications; travel and transportation; and chemical, oil and gas.\n\nKyndryl\u2019s cloud portfolio consists of a full range of offerings in four focus areas: cloud consult, public cloud, private cloud, and modern operations. Kyndryl\u2019s experts also provide the insights and real-world experience needed to help organizations across the spectrum of cloud maturity, from those who want to start their cloud journey to stalwarts committed to refining their IT infrastructure with an extensive portfolio of managed cloud services.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on being a trusted partner our customers can turn to when they must navigate an IT environment that is marked by new developments that impact each organization in unique ways,\u201d adds Simpson. \u201cThat reality is particularly apparent when you look at the hybrid, multi-cloud approach that is increasingly prominent today.\u201d\n\nThe need for hybrid, multi-cloud acumen \u2013 is greater now than ever\n\nSimpson stresses that as many customers have matured in their cloud migration journeys, many have already moved most of their easy \u201clift-and-shift\u201d workloads to the cloud and are now looking at second- and third-wave workloads that demand a more nuanced and specific approach that takes into account the particular strengths and limitations not only of different cloud approaches \u2013 private, public and hybrid or multi-cloud \u2013 but also the specific clouds offered by major hyperscalers and niche or industry-specific cloud providers.\n\n\u201cAs customers have come to look at deeply integrated and expansive workloads, most have come to realize that using one cloud is not an option,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cWe recommend they look at the characteristics of the workload, the data requirements, and determine the best platform for each workload across a public, private, and traditional IT landscape. We provide the capabilities to help organizations be productive, secure, technically and financially manage across a hybrid landscape.\u201d\n\nSimpson notes that enterprises are rightly being more strategic. More specifically, he stresses that a true multi-cloud program empowers organizations to seek best-of-breed technologies, experiment with new innovations, fill performance gaps \u2013 for example, those related to quantum computing \u2013 engage with cloud providers in specific geographies to address sovereignty, performance, and latency needs, and importantly to keep certain mission-critical workloads on premises.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, we are living in a time in which edge computing is driving more than half of data and infrastructure outside of the data center according to IDC,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cOn the edge is where workloads and use cases drive revenue and customer sentiment, but they all require local or on-premise resources to perform well. When you also consider efforts to mitigate data privacy laws, embrace new applications of high-performance computing, utilize virtual desktop infrastructure, and continue to get the most out of existing core, on-premises systems \u2013 among them customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, and business intelligence assets, we clearly also live in a time when there is a corresponding drive to keep data within enterprises\u2019 four walls. This, and AI workloads that require self-learning applications and intellectual property not be exposed to the internet, is driving private cloud adoption even as the hybrid cloud approaches proliferate.\u201d\n\nNotably, Kyndryl\u2019s work to address the needs of public, hybrid, and private cloud strategies draws on its experience with customers. It also relies on partnerships, such as the extensive relationship with VMware, and its expertise and use of VMware by Broadcom Technologies.\n\n\u201cOver the past two decades we amassed many thousands of VMware certifications and created a corps of VMware experts \u2013 all while working closely with VMware\u2019s development teams,\u201d adds Simpson. \u201cToday, we oversee more VMware assets than any other provider and are more excited by their future than ever, particularly as we look at the singular capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation and its application with Kyndryl Bridge, our AI-powered open-integration platform that lets enterprises observe, integrate and orchestrate their entire technology environment with ease.

The technology is poised to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC. That's a huge opportunity, but with so many companies touting their AI chops, it's difficult to know the best places to invest your money.\n\nTwo popular options are the conversational AI company SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) and the semiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Let's look at each one's AI opportunities to see which company is the best AI stock to buy.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nBroadcom designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are used in AI data center infrastructure. These AI chips help some of the world's most prominent tech companies -- including Alphabet and Meta -- stay ahead of the AI curve amid escalating competition.\n\nWhile there are many ways to benefit from AI, the largest tech companies are choosing to build out massive data centers to train AI models and power advanced AI software and services. Spending on AI data centers could reach an estimated $2 trillion over the next five years, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nBroadcom has already benefited from this AI spending bonanza, with the company's artificial intelligence revenue spiking 220% in 2024 to $12.2 billion. And more could be on the way. On Broadcom's recent earnings call, CEO Hock Tan said that over the next three years, there will be a \"massive\" AI opportunity for the company.\n\nBroadcom's stock isn't cheap. The company's shares have a forward price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 37, compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24. I don't think that makes Broadcom a stock to avoid, but it's always good to know when you're paying a premium for something.\n\nThe case for SoundHound AI\n\nWhile most people think of AI in the form of a chatbot that you interact with by typing questions, conversational artificial intelligence is quickly gaining momentum. SoundHound AI has some of the best conversational AI available. Its platform is used by Stellantis to bring voice-enabled commands to its vehicle brands, and by Chipotle in its automated drive-thrus.\n\nSoundHound's ability to expand its customer base, which now includes more than 200 enterprise customers, has also helped it diversify its sales. Consider that last year, 72% of SoundHound's revenue came from its largest customers, but they now account for just 12% of sales. Its customers were nearly all concentrated among automakers in 2023, but they're now spread across autos, financial services, restaurants, healthcare, and insurance.\n\nConversational AI could be worth an estimated $152 billion by 2033, and SoundHound is already reaping the benefits from the increasing demand. The company's sales jumped 89% in the most recent quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2024) to $25.1 million, and management estimates that 2025 sales will double from the previous year, reaching $83.5 million at the midpoint of guidance.\n\nSoundHound's stock has been on a wild ride over the past year, with a huge run-up followed by a recent pullback. But its shares are still up nearly 3x over the past 12 months, and that's made SoundHound AI's stock a bit pricey. The company's shares have a price-to-sales multiple of 50, making the stock very expensive by nearly any standard.\n\nVerdict: Broadcom is the better AI stock\n\nBoth of these AI stocks have a promising future, but I'm selecting Broadcom for the win for two reasons: market potential and price.\n\nTech companies around the globe are ramping up their AI data center infrastructure spending (potentially by $2 trillion), and Broadcom's tapping into it. As the AI wars heat up, I think Broadcom and other companies like it will continue to see increasing hardware demand.\n\nWhile Broadcom's stock isn't exactly cheap, it still looks less expensive than SoundHound. I'd feel far more comfortable paying a bit of a premium for data center infrastructure stock at a time when spending is ramping up than paying a hefty price for a conversational AI stock where the long-term market demand may not be as high.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $798,425!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 161\n\nSICM\u2019s Equity Stake: $16.17 Million\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global technology company with a legacy rooted in the innovation of AT&T, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard. The company has grown through strategic acquisitions, including LSI, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade, CA Technologies, Symantec\u2019s enterprise security business, and VMware, strengthening its position in the semiconductor and infrastructure software industries.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) organizes its offerings into two main categories: products and solutions. Its product lineup includes hardware such as network storage components crucial for cloud computing, wireless infrastructure like Wi-Fi systems for mobile connectivity, and optical products such as LED displays used in consumer electronics. On the software side, Broadcom develops tools for mainframe computing, business process automation, and cybersecurity to protect systems from digital threats. The company\u2019s solutions cater to industry-specific challenges, including broadband and wired networking systems for internet connectivity, wireless communication technologies for mobile devices, and data center hardware for large-scale data processing.\n\nAccording to analysts, the company\u2019s impressive performance is driven by strong demand for its networking products and its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are increasingly critical in powering next-generation artificial intelligence applications. The company\u2019s expanding AI-focused portfolio, combined with a robust network of industry partnerships, positions it for continued revenue growth and market leadership.\n\nDespite these strengths, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) faces challenges stemming from broader economic uncertainties and its substantial debt burden. Macroeconomic headwinds, including fluctuating interest rates and global supply chain disruptions, could impact future profitability. Additionally, managing high levels of debt remains a key concern, as it may limit the company\u2019s financial flexibility. However, Broadcom\u2019s consistent innovation and strong market demand suggest it is well-positioned to navigate these challenges while continuing its upward trajectory.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Core Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the fourth quarter as the company\u2019s third quarter results demonstrated continuing strength for its AI networking and custom accelerator semiconductor business. The company also gave long-term guidance for the service addressable market (SAM) opportunity for its AI-related business, indicating a market opportunity of $60 billion to $90 billion, which only includes contributions from its current three customers. This long-term outlook for AI semiconductor content exceeded investor expectations. Broadcom\u2019s quarterly results also showed the company is ahead on its VMware integration timeline to achieve $8.5 billion in EBITDA, which will support long-term gross and operating margin expansion for the company.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of top stocks to buy according to sustainable insight capital management. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Editor's take: We are frequently asked some version of the question, \"Will someone acquire Intel?\" At this point, we think it is highly unlikely, but these are unpredictable times. Setting aside all the principal considerations \u2013 like money, strategy, and regulatory approval \u2013 there are a few other hurdles. Chief among these is Intel's license for x86.\n\nEditor's note: We published this opinion article in November 2024, ahead of most recent Intel hurdles, CEO ousting, and growing speculation about a takeover or company split. Due to increased interest in how these developments might impact AMD, we're resurfacing this article.\n\nApparently, when Intel and AMD resolved their multi-decade dispute over x86, the cross-license agreement included provisions about transferability. If either company is acquired, the other has the right to cancel the license, effectively blocking the deal. When this was signed, we have to think everyone involved assumed it would be AMD getting acquired, but the provision seems to be mutual, and times change.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nGuest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory, a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile, networking, gaming, and software industries.\n\nSo just for fun, let's think through how that would play out. Right now, the most likely potential buyer of Intel is Broadcom. What would happen if they approached AMD about this license?\n\nAMD would have a few options. Their default position would likely be to just refuse and block the deal. Broadcom is a fearsome competitor, and even if they do not directly compete in every area, a revitalized Intel under Broadcom would be a serious threat to AMD.\n\nThat said, a failed Intel would also be a major problem for AMD, if for no other reason than the two are now linked at the hip when it comes to x86, which AMD needs to remain healthy. All of which is to say there is room for negotiation.\n\nWhat would AMD ask for to grant that approval? Obviously, they would take some cash. However, there is only so much Broadcom would be willing to pay before the Intel deal becomes unappealing. That probably amounts to a few billion dollars. Beyond cash, there are things AMD could ask for that might be worth far more strategically.\n\nFor starters, they could ask Broadcom for help in their fight against Nvidia. This is an area of shared interest between the two companies, and there are likely multiple ways both could benefit from a deeper partnership. For example, Broadcom could invest more heavily in AMD's Ultra Ethernet and other networking initiatives. Alternatively, Broadcom could design an entire networking stack optimized for AMD's Mi300 series of AI accelerators.\n\nGoing further, AMD could request that Broadcom encourage its AI ASIC customers to adopt AMD-friendly networking interfaces. We imagine there are plenty of novel ways that Broadcom could promote AMD's interests in their combined fight against Nvidia.\n\nAlternatively, AMD could ask Broadcom to steer business toward ZT Systems. After AMD acquires ZT, they plan to sell off ZT's manufacturing side. Securing a healthy backlog of Broadcom orders would certainly make that business more attractive.\n\nAMD would also want to ensure Broadcom continues spinning off Altera, which competes with AMD's Xilinx division. They could even push Broadcom to commit to incorporating more Xilinx products into future designs and reference platforms.\n\nThe point of these demands is that they would cost Broadcom relatively little while potentially offering AMD significant strategic value.\n\nWhile this thought experiment is just for kicks, it highlights one more hurdle for anyone interested in buying Intel. Few potential buyers could offer AMD comparable strategic benefits. For instance, a private equity buyer for Intel would likely have only cash to offer, which might not be enough to get AMD on board. The deal is unlikely, but if it happened, it would shake up many corners of the industry.",

            "content": "Credit: Shutterstock\n\nIn a significant move, Apple is set to debut its in-house Wi-Fi chip in the upcoming iPhone 17 series, according to renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This development follows the introduction of Apple's C1 modem chip, marking another step in the company's strategy to reduce reliance on external suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, a prominent Taiwanese tech equity analyst, recently shared on his X account that Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips will be replaced by Apple's in-house chips at a faster pace, following the transition from Qualcomm modems. Kuo noted, \"My latest industry survey indicates that all new 2H25 iPhone 17 models will feature Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chips (vs. only the slim iPhone 17 will adopt Apple's C1 modem chip). Beyond cost reduction, the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\"\n\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to debut in mid-to-late September 2025, keeping with Apple's tradition of annual launches.\n\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support Wi-Fi 7, allowing them to utilize the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with compatible routers. This will enhance data transfer speeds, reduce latency, and improve connection stability. Qualcomm has highlighted that Wi-Fi 7 can achieve peak speeds exceeding 40 Gbps, making it up to four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E.\n\nApple's self-designed Wi-Fi 7 chips are likely to be produced using advanced processing nodes. Currently, the 6nm node process is used for Wi-Fi 7 chips available on the market. However, if Apple integrates more components for better energy efficiency and performance, it might opt for even more advanced nodes like 4/5 nm or even 3nm. Given that Apple's C1 and its transceiver have been mass-produced on TSMC's 4nm and 7nm technologies while the 4nm chip yields at TSMC Arizona have reached satisfactory levels, there's a possibility that the new Wi-Fi chips could be produced at TSMC's Arizona facility in the future.\n\nTaiwan's Commercial Times has reported that Apple's second-generation in-house 5G modem, codenamed 'Ganymede', is expected to be mass-produced on TSMC's 3nm process. This could be the C2 modem that Apple is currently testing. Following the C2, Apple is rumored to launch 'Prometheus', potentially the C3, as part of its aggressive push to integrate in-house baseband chips across its devices. The second fab of TSMC Arizona is dedicated to producing 2/3nm chips and is expected to start operation by 2027-2028.\n\nAs Apple continues to expand its in-house chip development, the company is poised to reduce costs and enhance the performance and connectivity of its devices. With the introduction of the in-house Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 17 series, Apple is taking significant strides towards a more integrated and efficient wireless setup, setting the stage for future innovations in chip technology.\n\nTo have more chips produced in America is a trend that TSMC\u2019s customers will be striving to do, as US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose 25% tariffs on semiconductors imported to America. Although producing chips in America costs much more than in Asia, having chips made in America will help avoid the tariffs and reduce geopolitical uncertainties, while getting a better PR image in the Trump era.",

            "content": "After being the best-performing stock market sector in 2024, communications is getting a curtain call in 2025. Year to date, communications is, yet again, the top performer of the 11 stock market sectors.\n\nThe epic run-up may come as a surprise, since red-hot stocks like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Palantir Technologies are all in the technology sector. But communications has some advantages that could help the sector continue to outperform major indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nThe Vanguard Communication Services exchange-traded fund (ETF) (NYSEMKT: VOX) is a simple, low-cost way to invest in the sector. With just a 0.09% expense ratio, or 90 cents for every $1,000 invested, the fund is an inexpensive way to mirror the performance of the communications sector.\n\nHere's what's driving the sector to new heights, and why the Vanguard Communication Services ETF could be worth buying now.\n\nA two-headed monster\n\nNearly half of the communications sector is in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). While it's common for a handful of companies to be highly weighted, no other sector is as concentrated in just two companies as communications.\n\nVanguard Sector ETF Top Two Holdings Allocation in Top Two Holdings Vanguard Communications ETF Meta Platforms and Alphabet 48.5% Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF Amazon and Tesla 40.8% Vanguard Energy ETF ExxonMobil and Chevron 34.4% Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple and Nvidia 30.7% Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF Costco Wholesale and Walmart 27.2% Vanguard Materials ETF Linde and Sherwin-Williams 21.9% Vanguard Health Care ETF\n\nEli Lilly and UnitedHealth Group 18.6% Vanguard Utilities ETF\n\nNextEra Energy and Constellation Energy 18.4% Vanguard Financials ETF\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway 16.5% Vanguard Real Estate ETF\n\nPrologis and American Tower 11.6% Vanguard Industrials ETF\n\nGE Aerospace and Caterpillar 7.2%\n\nAlthough the Vanguard Communication Services ETF has 117 holdings, it's not that diversified when looking at the weights of the top holdings. What's more, 11.8% of the fund is in media giants Netflix, Walt Disney, and Comcast. 10.4% of the fund is in telecom companies AT&T, Verizon Communications, and T-Mobile.\n\nAdd it all up, and the fund is essentially betting big on a small number of companies.\n\nThe social media effect\n\nThe sheer size of Meta Platforms and Alphabet showcases just how valuable social media has become relative to traditional communications companies. Stock valuations aside, Meta and Alphabet arguably have two of the best business models on the planet.\n\nGoogle Services, which includes YouTube ads, Google Search, Google Network, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, earned $304.93 billion in 2024 revenue and $121.27 billion in operating income for an operating margin of 39.8%.\n\nThis doesn't even factor in Google Cloud, which is Alphabet's fastest-growing segment by revenue. However, the segment is currently low-margin because Alphabet is pouring investment dollars into building capacity to keep up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nIn comparison, Meta Platforms' family of apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.) earned $164.5 billion in 2024 revenue and $87.1 billion in operating income -- for an operating margin of 53%.\n\nAlphabet and Meta have such high margins because of the capital-light nature of their advertising business models. Netflix, Disney, and Comcast spend billions every year producing content. Telecom companies must invest in and maintain physical infrastructure and customer service programs.\n\nAlphabet and Meta don't have high operating costs, which allows them to convert more sales into profit. The main expenses are labor and maintaining their platforms. Content creators on YouTube and Instagram essentially do the work for them. It is a completely different business model than trying to produce content in the hope audiences receive it well.\n\nHigh margins allow both companies to support massive research and development programs, repurchase stock, and (as of last year) pay dividends. In 2025, Meta is investing $65 billion in capital expenditures (capex) -- mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) -- to boost engagement across its platforms and allow advertisers to run more precise campaigns. Its (highly unprofitable) Reality Labs division invests in virtual and augmented reality software and hardware. But, again, Meta can afford these investments because the ad business is so strong.\n\nAlphabet has embedded AI functionality into Google Search and is scaling cloud infrastructure. It is forecasting a staggering $75 billion in 2025 capex. Despite myriad advantages, Alphabet sports a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 20.4, compared to 28.4 for Meta Platforms. However, Meta's advertising business is growing faster and is arguably better than Alphabet's, so the premium valuation makes sense.\n\nStill, both stocks have lower forward P/Es than many other mega-cap tech names. And that's factoring in Meta's massive 245% gain in the last three years.\n\nTwo strong industry leaders that give the communications sector room to run\n\nInvesting in the communications sector is a big bet on Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which is why the bulk of this discussion centered around those two stocks. Despite the outperformance of the sector in 2024, and so far in 2025, both stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth prospects, suggesting they could still both be worth buying now.\n\nAs long as both stocks keep putting up strong gains, the Vanguard Communication Services ETF can continue outperforming the S&P 500. The ETF is a good bet if you're interested in Alphabet and Meta and want some diversification beyond those two stocks. The ETF has a 1% yield and a 23 P/E ratio. That's far less expensive than other growth-focused ETFs, like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, which has a 38.5 P/E and just a 0.6% yield.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a variety of mega-cap growth stocks without the restrictions that come with investing in stocks in a given sector, it may be worth taking a closer look at the Vanguard Growth ETF or the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure is set to see a big boost this year, which will undoubtedly help a number of semiconductor stocks with ties to AI chips.\n\nFor example, the big three cloud computing companies -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- budgeted a combined $255 billion in growth capital expenditures (capex), largely related to AI infrastructure, this year. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms announced that it will spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure. Not to be outdone, a consortium of companies led by Japan's Softbank and OpenAI committed to spending $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next few years through Project Stargate.\n\nLet's look at the AI chip companies set to reap the benefits.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA -0.91%) is the leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the main chips used in AI training and inference due to their superior processing speeds. The chips were originally designed to help speed up graphics rendering in video games. But later, the company let customers program the chips for other tasks through its CUDA software program. Today, through its CUDA X platform, which was built on top of CUDA, it offers GPU-accelerated microservices and libraries designed specifically for AI.\n\nCUDA helped give Nvidia customers a superior experience and created a wide moat for the company. This can be seen in its approximately 90% market share in the GPU space. As such, the company is poised to be one of the biggest winners from increased AI infrastructure spending.\n\nIn addition, the stock is attractively priced, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25 times 2025 analysts' estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of 0.5, with PEGs below 1 considered undervalued.\n\nBroadcom\n\nWhile Nvidia is the leader in mass merchant GPUs, Broadcom (AVGO -1.80%) has become the leader in helping customers design their own custom AI chips. While these application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, lack the flexibility of GPUs, they generally have better performance and more efficient power consumption for the specific task for which they were designed.\n\nBroadcom's first custom AI chip customer was Alphabet, as it helped it design its tensor-processing unit (TPU) called Trillium. Since then, it added other customers that are believed to include Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and most recently, Apple. Broadcom noted that just its top three customers could deploy up to 1 million AI chips in 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027. While Nvidia will likely get a nice piece of that revenue with its GPUs, Broadcom also has a huge opportunity as well.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom also makes components needed for AI infrastructure such as switches and NICs (network interface cards). The stock is reasonably priced at a 30 times forward P/E.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.88%) is a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, the company carved out a niche with its GPUs for AI inference. As AI continues to grow, so will this market.\n\nHowever, where AMD shines is with its central processing units (CPUs) designed for data centers. While GPUs provide the power, CPUs provide the brains. Its EPYC CPUs continued to gain market share in the data center space. Last quarter, it said its market share was well above 50% at hyperscalers, which are companies that operate massive data centers.\n\nWhile the number of CPUs used in AI infrastructure is not nearly as many as the number of GPUs, they still play an important role, and this part of AMD's business should continue to grow. Meanwhile, its CPUs have also been gaining share in the personal computer (PC) space as well. The company should see good AI-related growth from both its CPU and GPU offerings.\n\nTrading at 24 times 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is attractively valued given the opportunity ahead of it.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nWith more AI chips will come more chip manufacturing, which is where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.52%), or TSMC, steps in. The company is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, counting companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nChip manufacturing is not an easy process, and TSMC has become the clear leader and a valued partner to its customers in the chip-making process. With competitors such as Intel and Samsung struggling, TSMC garnered strong pricing power over the years and is slated to see a price increase this year as well. This led to both strong revenue growth as well as improving margins, which is a great combination.\n\nIn addition, TSMC continues to expand its manufacturing capacity by building new foundries (chip-manufacturing plants) to keep up with demand. New facilities in Arizona and Japanese went online in Q4, and it currently has plans to build two more facilities, one in Arizona and one in Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock is cheap, trading at a forward P/E of 22 times and a PEG of under 0.8.",

            "content": "Andre M. Chang/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that two semiconductor chip makers\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Broadcom\u2014are each weighing the possibility of buying part of Intel, another competitor in the space. Both Intel and the Trump administration are apparently interested in making a deal. But depending on what happens, it could be an example of one recipient of corporate welfare acquiring another.\n\nIntel was once a dominant force in personal computing\u2014perhaps the dominant force, designing and building the majority of all microprocessors used in both personal and commercial applications. But its fortunes have shifted since the early 2000s, owing to increased competition and its ill-fated decision not to take Apple's 2007 offer to supply chips for the first iPhone.\n\nIntel's stock lost over 60 percent of its value in 2024, making it the year's worst performer on the entire Nasdaq composite index, as competitors Nvidia and AMD soared. In November, the Dow Jones Industrial Average replaced Intel on its index with Nvidia, which Dow Jones officials felt was \"more representative\" of \"the semiconductors industry.\"\n\nThe deals that Broadcom and TSMC are apparently exploring would split Intel in two: Broadcom wants to take over Intel's design and marketing, while TSMC, separately, is eyeing its manufacturing facilities. (Broadcom \"would likely only do so if it finds a partner for Intel's manufacturing business,\" the Journal noted, while TSMC's bid would leave the design side alone.)\n\n\"The Trump administration has encouraged TSMC to do the deal,\" The New York Times reported last week. \"Howard Lutnick, President Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, has been involved in the conversations and considers them one of the most consequential challenges of his new job.\" (The Senate confirmed Lutnick to that position this week.)\n\nThe Journal separately confirmed the Trump administration's push for a TSMC deal but added, \"A White House official said the president was unlikely to support a deal that involved a foreign entity operating Intel's factories.\"\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, passed during Joe Biden's presidency, apportioned $39 billion in direct incentives for semiconductor manufacturing. On its way out the door, the Biden administration authorized numerous CHIPS Act grants, including $7.865 billion for Intel on promises that the company would spend tens of billions of dollars by the end of the decade building or expanding factories in four states.\n\nOfficials initially approved a grant for $8.5 billion but later trimmed the amount over fears about the company's viability: Intel had already scaled back the scope of its current projects, and as The New York Times reported, \"it has struggled to convince customers that it can match TSMC's technology.\"\n\nIntel lost $16.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024\u2014the biggest loss in its history\u2014and it would lose another $126 million the following quarter. (Intel stock rose 10 percent this week amid news of an impending acquisition.)\n\nNotably, as a condition of the CHIPS Act grant, \"Intel was required to maintain a majority share of its factories if they were spun off into a new entity,\" the Journal reports\u2014meaning an acquisition could void that deal.\n\nBut if TSMC acquired Intel's manufacturing facilities, the taxpayer won't be off the hook, because that company also benefited from a generous CHIPS Act grant.\n\n\"Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced\u2026up to $6.6 billion in direct funding\" and \"up to $5 billion of proposed loans\" to TSMC for its planned construction of three semiconductor fabrication facilities in Arizona, according to a November 2024 press release from the Department of Commerce.\n\nAs of this writing, TSMC has a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion; $6.6 billion in free government money is likely a nice perk, but the company could certainly afford to build the factories without it.\n\nIn fairness, Broadcom\u2014Intel's other potential bidder\u2014has received its share of corporate welfare, though none from the CHIPS Act.\n\nThere is plenty of upside if TSMC acquires Intel's manufacturing facilities: The company currently produces more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and as recently as 2023, all production took place in Taiwan. With that nation under increasing threat from China, expanding to the United States would help secure the supply chain, benefiting both the business and its customers.\n\nBut TSMC has more than enough cash to do that on its own. Further, an acquisition would suggest that Intel was not a worthwhile recipient of billions of taxpayer dollars. The companies should make their own business decisions and leave the taxpayers out of it.\n\nThe post TSMC May Acquire Fellow CHIPS Act Beneficiary Intel appeared first on Reason.com.",

With the iPhone 17 launch happening later this year, the four models may not feature their own baseband chip, but a new report claims that Apple will be introducing its first custom Wi-Fi chip.\n\nThe custom solution reportedly arriving to all iPhone 17 models could support the Wi-Fi 7 standard\n\nAs reported by MacRumors, Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities, stated in a research note that a major hardware change was arriving to the iPhone 17 lineup later this year. Apple intends to incorporate a custom Wi-Fi chip into all four models, making it the first time that any product would feature such an in-house solution. Unfortunately, the exact version of the wireless chip was not mentioned, but given that all iPhone 16 models feature a Wi-Fi 7 adapter, it only makes sense that this solution will support the same standard.\n\nAs for the iPhone 17 Air, Pu has not mentioned if Apple will treat this particular model to a custom Wi-Fi 7 chip, but it is possible that this handset becomes the odd one out and only ships with a custom 5G modem. By switching to a custom Wi-Fi 7 chip, Apple can reduce reliance on Broadcom while allowing the iPhone 17 series to flaunt exceptional battery life.\n\nWith the iPhone 16e, Apple claims that users can experience better endurance than any other 6.1-inch iPhone thanks to the C1, but if that is the case, then why will this baseband chip not find a place in the iPhone 17\u2019s innards? The answer likely lies in the C1\u2019s lack of mmWave support, which may give the impression that this in-house 5G modem is a low-tier one. Fortunately, even if the iPhone 17 models will not feature custom baseband silicon, Apple is already said to be testing the C2, with the possibility that it will have mmWave capabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not expect the C2\u2019s launch until the arrival of the iPhone 18. By then, Apple would not only have a custom Wi-Fi 7 chip to add to other devices, but it could also leverage its 5G modem.",

            "content": "Very few investors can claim to be in the same league as Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest investor ever. But billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is one of them. Druckenmiller worked as a fund manager for George Soros, another legendary investor, and he's never posted a year in the red, while putting up impressive returns over decades of investing. Today, Druckenmiller still invests through his own fund, the Duquesne Family Office. All funds with at least $100 million in assets under management must file 13F forms within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter, which recently occurred for the fourth quarter of 2024 on Feb. 14. The 13F discloses what stocks funds held at the end of each quarter. In the fourth quarter, Duquesne revealed that it exited its positions in Broadcom (AVGO -1.87%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.27%) and piled into these three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks instead.\n\nSelling Broadcom and Microsoft\n\nAccording to Duquesne's 13F, the fund sold its nearly 240,000 shares of Broadcom and its nearly 43,100 shares of Microsoft. Broadcom had a superb year in 2024, with its stock rising nearly 108%, while Microsoft underperformed the broader market, only posting a 12% gain.\n\nDruckenmiller has been in and out of Broadcom since 2023. He purchased a new stake in the company in the third quarter of 2023 and then sold in the following quarter. He repeated this trend in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Druckenmiller looks to have done OK on his trades with Broadcom, selling for higher average prices than he bought the stock for with gains in the 9% to 16% range based on his average purchase and sale prices.\n\nBroadcom has captivated the market with its ability to make custom chips for companies that can be used to carry out specific artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. For instance, one of Broadcom's clients is Meta Platforms. The two teamed up to build the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator chip. Meta plans to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into AI technology. Many analysts and investors also think Broadcom has secured a relationship with OpenAI.\n\nDruckenmiller has been investing in and trading Microsoft for over a decade and has made 41 transactions with the stock since 2014. He once again took a new stake in Microsoft in early 2023 and increased his stake for several consecutive quarters. However, Druckenmiller began selling the position in the second quarter of 2024 and exited the position in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicrosoft, a member of the Magnificent Seven, failed to take advantage of the AI trade in 2024, as investors questioned the company's AI strategy and ability to make money off of AI. The company has also had some trouble over the last year hitting its guidance. However, it's not unusual for Duquesne to be in and out of stocks. Druckenmiller likes tech and AI but is also vigilant on valuations and will sell any stock if he thinks it's too expensive.\n\nScooping up other companies of the Mag Seven\n\nDespite selling Microsoft and Broadcom, Druckenmiller scooped up shares in other big tech and AI stocks in the fourth quarter including:\n\n328,400 shares of Amazon AMZN -3.39% )\n\n37,675 shares of Tesla TSLA -4.99% )\n\n76,680 shares of Alphabet GOOGL -2.73% )\n\nNow, the 13F filing shows that Druckenmiller purchased these stocks in the fourth quarter but it doesn't say exactly when. If he purchased them prior to President Donald Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, he's likely done quite well.\n\nI think there is a good chance that Druckenmiller did get the timing right because he said publicly a few weeks before the election that the market had been pricing in a Trump victory. Given where valuations trade and the stock's recent rally, I could see Druckenmiller potentially selling Tesla during this quarter.\n\nAmazon and Google make a lot more sense for Druckenmiller because these stocks that are not solely reliant on AI. Amazon makes a lot of revenue from its software business and retail and subscription sales, while many analysts believe Google has attractive AI assets that the company can unlock value from. Google's stock has also struggled due to the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit against the company, which many believe will eventually blow over.",

The 2025 IEEE Medal of Honour, as well as additional awards, will be presented at a ceremony on 24 April 2025 in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSamueli is also being recognised for his philanthropy and his support for science, technology, engineering and maths education. He is a three-time UCLA alumnus and is also the name-sake of the university\u2019s engineering school.\n\nAs a UCLA electrical engineering professor, he conceived digital signal processing architectures for broadband communications chips, and after founding Broadcom, he built the world\u2019s first digital cable set-top-box modem chipset. This laid the foundation for at-home UltraHD, HDTV and high-quality video streaming.\n\nHe will be the first recipient of the honour\u2019s increased prize money, which previously amounted to $50,000 but now stands at $2m. Previous award winners include the \u2018queen of carbon science\u2019 Mildred S Dresselhaus in 2015, who won for her contributions to research into graphite and carbon-based materials.\n\n\u201cIEEE Medal of Honour Laureate Henry Samueli\u2019s vision and communications technology innovations spurred the development of products used by nearly every person around the world,\u201d said IEEE president and CEO Kathleen Kramer. \u201cFrom the billions of consumer smartphones, set-top boxes and tablets to laptops and IoT devices, Samueli created new and novel ways to power connections and unite humanity.\u201d\n\nThe IEEE\u2019s K J Ray Liu also commented on the news: \u201cThrough broadband, Henry Samueli helped revolutionise how the world is connected, fostered cultural and economic paradigm shifts of countless industries and positively changed how we do everything today.\n\n\u201cIn addition, his prolific philanthropy has deeply impacted many lives for the better, from generous support of STEM education to a pledge to give away the majority of his money during his lifetime.

            "content": "A Broadcom VMware Alternative: Partners See \u2018Massive\u2019 Opportunity For HPE VM Essentials\n\n'I think our customers are going to be really receptive to the (HPE VM Essentials) price-point, the licensing model, and how this can be a bridge and transition strategy that HPE has thought through to enable them to transfer VMs,\u2019 says Milestone Tech founder and CEO Sarah Miles.\n\nSarah Miles, founder and CEO of Milestone Tech, Castle Rock, Colorado, has already trained her entire team as part of an \u201call hands on deck\u201d sales offensive to take advantage of the \u201cmassive\u201d opportunity to provide HPE VM Essentials as a much-needed alternative to the high-priced path Broadcom has taken with its VMware strategy.\n\nGiven that literally every Milestone customer is interested in a VMware alternative, Miles (pictured above) said she wanted to make sure her entire company can have a conversation on the benefits of HPE VM Essentials versus VMware.\n\n\u201cIs every customer wanting to have this conversation? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIs (HPE VM) Essentials going to solve every problem for every customer? Not yet but HPE is tracking in that direction. I think it is going to be significant.\u201d\n\nThe Broadcom-VMware per-core pricing subscription strategy has led to across the board four and five times price increases and in some cases as much as 10 times to renew VMware licenses, said Miles. Customers are \u201cconsidering any option to jump ship ASAP to get away from this,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any customers that are happy with VMware,\u201d said Miles. \u201cSome are begrudgingly doing what they have to do in tandem, but everybody is sort of hungry for plan B\u2026I think our customers are going to be really receptive to the (HPE VM Essentials) price-point, the licensing model, and how this can be a bridge and transition strategy that HPE has thought through to enable them to transfer VMs. I think it\u2019s pretty compelling so we are excited to start the journey with some of our clients.\u201d\n\nMilestone Tech is one of a number of HPE partners stepping into the maelstrom created by Broadcom\u2019s acquisition of VMware by offering HPE VM Essentials as an alternative.\n\nHPE this week announced VM Essentials as a standalone global offering with a no-holds barred \u201cchannel only\u201d go to market model backed up by a 10.5 percent rebate.\n\nThe channel-only HPE sales model is, indeed, in sharp contrast to the channel strategy taken by Broadcom in the wake of its acquisition of longtime virtualization market leader VMware in November 2023.\n\nAfter the deal was closed, VMware took the top 2,000 accounts direct, terminated partner agreements and invited select partners to rejoin the channel program, reduced the product portfolio and initiated a new per-core processor pricing model that resulted in sharp prices increases for many customers.\n\nVMware declined to comment on the HPE VM Essentials launch and the differences between HPE VM Essentials and VMware.\n\nMiles, for her part, said she is not surprised by HPE\u2019s commitment to partners with the HPE VM Essentials channel only sales strategy. \u201cHPE has continually put their money where their mouth is with us,\u201d she said.\n\nHPE Leadership That \u2018Lead And Bleed\u2019 With Partners\n\nMiles credited HPE North America Managing Director Paul Hunter and HPE North America Head of Channel Sales Phil Soper for the \u201cauthentic leadership\u201d that has made a difference to partners in the sales trenches. \u201cThey both lead and bleed with the channel and it has made a difference in our business and our ability to get deals done,\u201d she said.\n\nPat O\u2019Dell, managing partner at Clinton, N.J.-based CPP Associates, one of HPE\u2019s top enterprise partners, said he also sees VM Essentials as a \u201cmassive\u201d opportunity given the \u201cuncertainty\u201d that has resulted from Broadcom\u2019s acquisition of VMware.\n\n\u201cBroadcom now is a very large organization ($51.7 billion in annual sales) and VMware is just a piece of the portfolio instead of the main part of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cCustomers are questioning whether Broadcom is going to put the same time, focus and energy into improving the product as VMware did on its own or are they going to look at VMware as a cash cow.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Dell compared Broadcom to an investment property owner with 15 houses to look after rather than a homeowner focused on a single home. \u201cWhen I own 15 houses, which house am I focusing on?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhich one do I decide to use as an Airbnb? Which one do I rent out? Which one do I sell?\u201d\n\nAmong the questions customers have raised with CPP is whether there could be additional changes coming in the future with regard to support, pricing and product development, said O\u2019Dell. \u201cThere is uncertainty with what Broadcom will do with VMware and how they will act moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is as important or even more important to our clients than the price increases. Customers are questioning whether VMware is losing the focus and the predictability they had in the past.\u201d\n\nAs for the VMware price increases, O\u2019Dell said it has been a big issue for commercial and low-end enterprise customers that CPP serves and has not been as big an issue for enterprise customers using VMware Cloud Foundation. \u201cSome of our clients really got hammered and are paying three and four times more than they were a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are good clients of ours and they are asking for alternatives. I am grateful that HPE has a great alternative that is only going to get better.\u201d\n\nWith the per-core pricing model put in place by Broadcom, a typical CPP customer with 16 core dual socket servers now is being charged as much as $4,800 per system for VMware Enterprise Plus licensing \u2013 a whopping 400 percent price increase versus approximately $1,200 per server for the same server for HPE VM Essentials, said O\u2019Dell. \u201cWhen the price discrepancy becomes so large you have to pay attention,\u201d he said.\n\nA Big Plus For HPE: Morpheus Technology\n\nA big plus for HPE is that the VM functionality it is providing is based on the \u201cproven\u201d technology from HPE\u2019s acquisition in August 2024 of multicloud software management superstar Morpheus, said O\u2019Dell. \u201cIt is Morpheus proven, nine year, eight different iterations backed by HPE which is an 86 year-old organization with tremendous customer support,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why people are coming to us and asking to discuss this.\u201d\n\nEven though as many as 90 percent of CPP\u2019s VMware customers are not ready to make the move off VMware, the other side of the coin is that most of those 90 percent are interested in looking at an alternative like HPE VM Essentials, O\u2019Dell told CRN. That is in sharp contrast to before Broadcom acquired VMware in 2023 when 90 percent of CPP\u2019s customers would not even consider a VMware alternative, said O\u2019Dell.\n\nCPP is advising customers to not make a fast \u201cdecision\u201d based on price alone but rather conduct an assessment with CPP of their VMware workloads with a look at potential alternatives like HPE VM Essentials. \u201cOur plan is to help our clients to optimize their current VMware environment in a low to no cost manner,\u201d promised O\u2019Dell.\n\nO\u2019Dell said that the companies and teams he has led over the last 25 years have probably sold upwards of $100 million in VMware-based solutions so it pains him to see what he called the \u201cuncertainty\u201d that is driving his customers to look at alternatives.\n\n\u201cI have seen a couple of times over the past 38 years when a company that seemed invincible lost focus and then lost dramatic market share,\u201d he said. \u201cVMware is far from being at that point today, but having clients actively want to look at alternatives for the first time ever is undoubtedly a significant red flag.\u201d\n\nAn Appetite For HPE VM Essentials As A VMware Alternative\n\nErik Krucker, chief technology officer for Comport Consulting Corp., Ramsey, New Jersey, No. 275 on the CRN SP500, said \u201c100 percent\u201d of his customers are looking for VMware alternatives in the wake of price increases as high as three to ten times in the wake of the Broadcom acquisition. \u201cThere is an appetite for (HPE) VM Essentials,\u201d he said.\n\nTo HPE\u2019s credit, the company has put together a strong offering with the Morpheus technology with a robust management and orchestration plane, said Krucker \u201cIt\u2019s a complete solution from that perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cVM Essentials is heading down the right road.\u201d\n\nThat said, Krucker said, VMware has built a robust offering that took a decade to pull together into a blue chip, bullet-proof virtualization product.\n\nAs for the channel-only model, Krucker said that is \u201cpositive\u201d for Comport and other channel partners. \u201cIt definitely matters that there is no direct go to market and they are relying on partners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are starting to see HPE flip direct customers to the channel.\u201d\n\nC.R. Howdyshell, CEO of Advizex, No. 115 on the CRN SP500, a Fulcrum IT Partners company, said he \u201cwelcomes\u201d HPE VM Essentials as an alternative to VMware.\n\n\u201cIf HPE can execute with this channel-only model it is going to be extremely well-received by customers and partners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way HPE is bringing this to market could give them a real competitive advantage. Customers are looking for options and we need to give them more options.\u201d\n\nHowdyshell said has not met with a single customer that \u201cfeels good\u201d with the path taken by Broadcom since it acquired VMware. \u201cCustomers feel there is not much flexibility with VMware,\u201d he said.\n\nDan Molina, co-president and chief technology officer of Nth Generation, San Diego, No. 298 on the CRN SP500, said HPE VM Essentials comes to market with the \u201clarge majority\u201d of customers looking for a VMware alternative in the wake of price increases of 200 to 300 percent. \u201cCustomers that use bare-bones virtualization are the ones in the most pain because they are being forced to pay for stuff that they don\u2019t use,\u201d he said.\n\nMolina credited HPE with bringing an \u201camazing\u201d virtualization alternative to market so quickly. \u201cThere will be a lot of workloads that are going to be ideal candidates for VM Essentials,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will also be other workloads that customers decide to keep on VMware for now. But now customers have a path to transition so they don\u2019t have all their eggs in one basket where they are at the mercy of that one basket where prices have increased 200 to 300 percent.\u201d\n\nMolina said in 30 years in the IT business he has never seen the kind of price increases that customers have been hit with in the wake of the Broadcom acquisition of VMware. \u201cTo my best recollection, I have not seen anything even close to this,\u201d he said.\n\nMolina said HPE VM Essentials is just one more example of HPE making \u201ccustomer choice\u2019 a top priority. \u201cHPE is giving customers an option to manage both their existing VMware and perhaps new workloads in a new strong alternative which is VM Essentials,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the HPE go-to-market path, which is not rip and replace. It is all about getting a new management platform that will help you manage your existing VMs and then start adding new workloads. The more you shift the more you will save over time. This allows the customer to do that at their own pace. That is real customer choice!\u201d",

In his recent piece in CIO Dive, \u201cIs private cloud having a moment?,\u201d reporter Matt Ashare cited a few: mounting hyperscaler bills, proliferating data, and generative AI\u2019s voracious appetite for compute resources.\n\nWhile the race to adopt private cloud is on, implementing a private cloud can be a significant challenge. Many organizations run in very complex, siloed, multi-domain environments that require deep technical expertise. While the right path to go from that environment to a unified private cloud platform will vary by organization, it can be difficult to identify and follow.\n\nTechnical investments in our partners are key to customer success\n\nAt Broadcom, we take a different approach to prioritizing post-sales adoption. Most vendors are looking to sell a new piece of software every 90 days, which results in a lot of shelfware. Broadcom is one of the few companies interested in getting rid of shelfware. We invest and innovate in our technology because we believe in the transformative value it can bring to our customers. But that value will only be realized if customers actually use the technology.\n\nWe accelerate an organization's \u201ctime-to-value\u201d from our technology solutions. Services delivery via our channel partners with the right delivery experience is a great option for doing that.\n\nHistorically, Broadcom's professional services business, including our VMware portfolio, was predominantly handled with internal resources. For example, VMware drove around 70% of the professional services business, leaving only 30% for partners. Today, in line with our new focus on accelerating customer time-to-value, our aim is to invert this ratio. We want our professional services to be partner-led. It's a move that demonstrates our faith in the technical expertise of our partner ecosystem. More importantly, this is about customer results rather than handing off work. We're also heavily investing in our partners to ensure they have the necessary skills and resources to succeed. The more we invest, the more our partners will invest, and the more our customers will benefit.\n\nWe are also providing resources to help our customers identify the right partners to help them. Often, customers tend to settle for the partners that sold them their software, though they may not be the most qualified experts to tackle their unique business challenges. We needed to take a more active role in matching customers to partners. Enter our Expert Advantage Partner Program.\n\nPartner-led services benefit everyone\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Expert Advantage Partner Program is designed to provide our partners with the training, access, and support they need to become true extensions of our own technical team. Using our Partner INSIGHTS platform, our partners can showcase their services and the integrations that they developed for customer-specific applications. We\u2019ve also created next- level training for the most talented people in the industry. These partner evangelists are called Broadcom Knights.\n\nBroadcom Knights get the same level of access to information and product knowledge as if they were a system engineer at Broadcom. Through this program, our partners can access a wealth of product knowledge, training, and customer insights that allow them to develop deep expertise in Broadcom's solutions. Broadcom Knights are our most skilled and dedicated partner evangelists.\n\nUltimately, this shift in strategy to partner-led services is not just about benefiting our partners. It's about driving better outcomes and value for our customers. As I look to the future, I'm excited to see how this new approach unfolds. We're putting a lot of faith in our partners, andI'm confident that it's the right move for them, for our business, and, most importantly, for our customers.\n\nCTA: Watch Regan McGrath\u2019s Executive Interview with CRN",

            "content": "Intel (INTC) stock fell 6% Wednesday, ending a massive upswing in which shares notched their biggest five-day gain in Intel's history as a publicly traded company. The decline came as analysts expressed skepticism over recent reports of potential deals with TSMC (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) to break up the storied US chipmaker.\n\nShares of Intel had surged 16% Tuesday following a Wall Street Journal report over the weekend that its rival, Taiwan's contract chip manufacturer TSMC, has looked at controlling some or all of Intel's semiconductor factories, potentially as part of an investor consortium. The Journal, citing people familiar with the discussions, also reported that Broadcom (AVGO) is considering making a bid for Intel's product business, which designs semiconductors for computers and servers.\n\nA news report the prior week indicated that the US was floating proposals to TSMC to support Intel\u2019s turnaround. One of the proposals would reportedly establish a joint venture between TSMC and Intel, in which TSMC would send engineers to Intel to ensure its manufacturing business is viable.\n\nInvestors cheered the reports, with Intel gaining 38.5% over the five days ended Tuesday.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts have voiced concerns over a potential breakup of Intel.\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely noted that TSMC and Intel use separate manufacturing processes. Because Intel\u2019s chips are specifically designed using its own manufacturing processes, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for TSMC to take control of its manufacturing facilities, he said.\n\n\u201cJust because two companies are making the same type of chip, they have completely separate software tools, processes, methodologies, all kinds of stuff,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThese guys that have worked at Intel for 10, 20, 30 years would have to learn completely new processes. It would just be a fiasco.\u201d\n\nA TSMC-Intel deal could also face scrutiny from regulators at home and abroad. That's because global regulators, including Chinese authorities would need to approve the deal, and they may have antitrust concerns, Wall Street analysts said.\n\nAnd the Trump administration \"could be wary of a foreign entity completely taking over an iconic US-firm,\" Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors Tuesday.\n\nIntel headquarters in Santa Clara.

The foundry has failed to take on external customers, analysts say, and its product business has lost market share to rivals. Those struggles have made Intel an acquisition target in recent months.",

Intel\u2019s manufacturing division already has a degree of autonomy and reports its finances separately.\n\nIntel, which once dominated the CPU market, has been overtaken by TSMC in semiconductor manufacturing.

            "content": "Nvidia has been the undisputed winner of the artificial intelligence trade, as the leader in creating chips and network infrastructure that power AI solutions. However, there are plenty of competitors trying to get in on the action. After all, the potential market for AI is expected to be so big that just a small connection to the market can send a stock soaring.\n\nTwo stocks that have been clumped in with the AI trade and that make chips and other AI infrastructure are Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Broadcom has performed well, with its stock up nearly 86% over the last year. Meanwhile, AMD has struggled, with its stock down nearly 36%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWall Street analysts currently expect one of these companies to grow earnings faster in 2025, but the other to outperform in stock price appreciation over the next 12 to 18 months. Let's take a look.\n\nBroadcom: 223% earnings growth\n\nWhile Nvidia has made its name by dominating the broad chip market, Broadcom has focused on creating custom chips for some of the large tech players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nAfter the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese company that claims to have developed an AI chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors', many think custom chips will be the path forward, which bodes well for Broadcom. Others also suspect Broadcom has locked up new customers like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company has now topped a $1 trillion market capitalization\n\nFor its fiscal year ended in November, Broadcom only reported $1.27 of earnings per share, but most of this was due to the amortization of intangibles related to the company's acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. On an operating basis, diluted earnings came in at $4.86. Wall Street analysts on average expect the company to grow diluted earnings to $4.01 in fiscal 2025 and generate operating diluted earnings of $6.35, according to data provided by Visible Alpha.\n\nOn the company's last earnings call, management expressed bullishness on the custom chip market and thinks the company will play a role as hyper-scalers roll out their own custom AI accelerators or chips. Broadcom cited its three hyperscaler customers and said that together, their journeys represent an AI serviceable addressable market (SAM) for custom chips and network in the $60 billion to $90 billion range in fiscal 2027.\n\nBroadcom's stock has performed well, and analysts think it is fairly valued at this point. While no analysts are saying to sell, 27 have issued research reports on the company over the last three months, according to TipRanks. The average price target implies very minimal upside. Analysts don't seem bearish on the company at all, so it may be more of a valuation call to let the stock catch its breath. Broadcom currently trades at close to 37 times forward earnings.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: 147% earnings growth\n\nBeing in the AI game is a big deal, which is why investors are often discussing Advanced Micro Devices. However, AMD's main problem is that it has to compete against Nvidia, a company generating gross profit margins in the mid-70s percentile and demonstrating extreme pricing power. According to experts, AMD manufactures cheaper chips than Nvidia, but they're only about 80% as powerful.\n\nStill, Wall Street analysts currently expect earnings to grow nicely this year -- from $1.00 in 2024 to $2.47 in 2025, according to Visible Alpha. On an operating basis, analysts expect earnings to grow from $3.31 to $4.62. However, we'll see how long these last after AMD's recent earnings disappointed the market. The company beat on estimates and even delivered revenue guidance ahead of consensus.\n\nBut revenue in the company's data center segment came in lighter than expected, which disappointed investors given how much the market is growing. After earnings, some analysts expressed concern about the outlook for growth in AMD's AI business.\n\nDespite weaker data center numbers, analysts are still largely bullish on the stock. A total of 36 analysts have issued research reports on the company over the past three months, according to TipRanks. Of these, 24 analysts rate the stock a buy, 11 say to hold, and only one says to sell. The average price target suggests nearly 33% upside from current levels (as of Feb. 11).\n\nThe discrepancy between AMD and Broadcom looks to be based on valuation. While Broadcom trades at 37 times forward earnings, AMD trades at around 23 times. In the near term, AMD may have more room to run on any change in sentiment. However, Broadcom seems to be better positioned to take advantage of current trends in the AI market.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Intel (INTC) stock jumped 16% Tuesday following a report that its rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and TSMC (TSM) are exploring potential deals with the chipmaker that would split it into two.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late Saturday that Broadcom (AVGO) is considering making a bid for Intel's product business, which designs semiconductors for computers and servers. The Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter, said TSMC has looked at controlling some or all of Intel's factories, potentially as part of an investor consortium. The companies have not submitted deals to Intel, and the talks are preliminary and informal, the Journal wrote.\n\nBroadcom shares fell nearly 2% Tuesday, while US-listed TSMC shares were down less than 1%.\n\nIntel's 16% gain Tuesday was its biggest single-day jump since March 2020. The surge puts Intel shares up 38.5% over the past five days, the largest gain in the company's history as a public company.\n\nIntel stock has been on a tear over the past week. The stock notched its biggest weekly gain since 2000 last Friday as the US signaled support for domestic chipmaking and reports surfaced that the US government was allegedly in talks with TSMC to support Intel's turnaround efforts.\n\nIntel's manufacturing business primarily makes chips for itself (Intel's product business) but opened up a foundry \u2014 in other words, began taking on external customers \u2014 in 2022 under the leadership of then-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger had pushed to launch a foundry business competitive with Taiwan's TSMC in an attempt to right Intel's struggling manufacturing division, which had suffered from setbacks since the mid-2010s.\n\nThe turnaround effort has not been successful to date, given that Intel's manufacturing business has struggled to take on outside customers and continues to bleed cash. Intel's earnings disappointed investors throughout 2024, and the stock fell around 60% last year. Gelsinger was ousted by Intel's board in December. The company has become an acquisition target, and the interest from Broadcom and TSMC follows reports of potential takeovers by Qualcomm (QCOM), Arm (ARM), and Apollo last year.\n\nWall Street analysts have favored Intel splitting its business into two. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday: \"In our view, splitting Intel Product and Foundry is the key to unlocking value.\"\n\nThe symbol for Intel appears on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, on Oct. 1, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nIntel announced plans last year to establish an independent subsidiary for its foundry business, separating its finances and operations from its products division. Analysts viewed the move as the company paving the way for a potential split.",

It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel\u2019s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM-3.37% ) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel\u2019s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroadcom (AVGO-1.49% ) has also been examining Intel\u2019s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel\u2019s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM-0.93% ) has also been interested in buying some of Intel\u2019s chip design units.

The stock has rallied to start the year.\n\nThe potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.53% ) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia.\n\nDespite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S.",

Michels\u2019 report, titled \u2018Sovereign Cloud for Europe\u2019 and produced with support from Broadcom, unpacks growing opportunities for European Cloud Service Providers.\n\nWith the new government in the European Union seeing sovereign cloud as a strategic move to keep innovation local \u2013 relying on European cloud service providers to boost its economy and keep the region competitive in the global tech race \u2013 the need for collaboration is highlighted as being greater than ever before.\n\nThe report examines the debate around the complexities of defining sovereign cloud, revealing how varying interpretations have led to diverse market offerings. The report also investigates how governments can access or restrict access to customer data, unpacking when external bodies might access or share data without the data owner\u2019s knowledge.\n\nYet, regardless of definition, the research reveals that the demand for sovereign cloud solutions continues to grow. This is because organisations across Europe are increasingly looking for reasons to protect their data from foreign government access, particularly those that process data deemed sensitive from a geo-political or national security perspective \u2013 such as state intelligence agencies or the defence sector.\n\nBased on research and qualitative interviews, the report highlights how European cloud providers now see sovereignty as an opportunity to differentiate their services and promote their sovereign cloud credentials, advocating for greater transparency on how customer data is being stored and accessed.\n\nJohan David Michels, Researcher, Cloud Legal Project, Queen Mary University of London, believes that urgent work needs to be done to define sovereignty for organisations, \"The cloud industry faces a critical challenge: both US and European providers claim sovereignty, but legal uncertainty persists, especially in highly regulated sectors. To move forward confidently, organisations need complete confidence in how their cloud data is protected and accessed. It\u2019s time for the industry and regulatory bodies to come together to establish clear standards for both cloud providers and customers, ensuring data sovereignty while supporting innovation.\"\n\n\u201cThe push for sovereign cloud provides the perfect storm for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) in Europe to thrive\u201d, says Martin Hosken, Field CTO, Cloud Partners at Broadcom. \u201cThey need to position themselves as trusted partners to those organisations on their sovereign cloud journey \u2013 helping them navigate the challenges of this move. This involves helping them assess and classify their data based on sensitivity and compliance needs, particularly for personal data under GDPR. CSPs can also help customers navigate through the complex mix of cloud services, enable a single operating model and maximize interoperability between providers to avoid isolated workloads.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearch methodology: Broadcom commissioned Johan David Michels of Queen Mary University of London to conduct a series of qualitative interviews with 10 experts on the topic of sovereign cloud. Interviews took place between September and November 2024. Interviewees included both independent experts and representatives of European and US providers. Interviewees were informed of the research aims and industry funding and given a list of topics beforehand.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2025 well underway, Jim Cramer hasn\u2019t been short of comments on artificial intelligence. AI stocks, which entered 2025 with optimism and tailwinds were dealt a shock during January\u2019s DeepSeek selloff. The selloff was centered around stocks of firms that investors believe stand to benefit from billions of dollars in AI GPU spending.\n\nThe firm that led the DeepSeek selloff was the AI GPU stock that has been Wall Street\u2019s favorite. Its shares dropped by 17% during the day and are flat year to date after having gained 17% since the selloff. Cramer has also been one of the firm\u2019s biggest fans. For instance, consider his remarks made in January before the selloff. Cramer started out by bemoaning a lack of knowledge about the firm and shared:\n\n\u201cOkay, some of the analysts are good, but some of the analysts are just talking about the quarter! And these are people, who are, they are bound by the four walls of idiocy. This is one of the greatest companies in the world, these people want to buy sell, buy sell, they don\u2019t recognize that [the firm] is doing things that are just running circles around.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cramer went as far as to suggest that the firm was ushering in an industrial revolution. According to him:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d \u201cI find over and over again that when you have the industrial revolutions no one really believes in them. And here\u2019s Jensen Huang. The other day someone said to me, I see you\u2019re like Jensen Huang, you guys both were dishwashers. And I said, I was a busboy. I mean the kinds of things I\u2019m seeing with people at [the firm]. How\u2019s your dog doing? My dog died three years ago, should I sell the stock? Heaven forbid they listen to Colette Kress, who is not going to give you the numbers that you want.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV show host had to naturally adjust his expectations after investors re-calibrated their AI GPU spending. Appearing on Squawk on the Street the day after the selloff, he shared two factors that would be key in determining the future of AI stock performance. According to Cramer, these factors are energy spending and GPU orders. Investors have focused on energy stocks, particularly those that deal with nuclear energy \u2013 a fact that has sent some stocks to gain as much as 140% over the past year. As for GPU orders, the Q4 2024 earnings season has seen big tech firms persist in their multi-billion dollar AI capital expenditure commitments.\n\nIn another morning appearance, Cramer also commented on an outfit he had discovered that was better than DeepSeek. He shared:\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s an outfit that I\u2019ve been dealing with called you dot com. . . .I really like you dot com. It\u2019s one of those companies that is really ahead of DeepSeek, it\u2019s way ahead.\u201d\n\nHe added that after digging deeper, he found that the AI GPU firm mentioned above was actually this outfit\u2019s largest investor. The investment signaled to Cramer that there are alternatives better than DeepSeek as he commented that \u201cthe long knives came out\u201d for it at the slightest hint of trouble.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: September 6th, 2024\n\nPerformance Since Then: 70%\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor designer that sells networking and other chips. Its ability to design chips has paid off well in the AI era due to the products\u2019 ability to supplement pricey and short-in-supply GPUs made by NVIDIA. Since Cramer\u2019s remarks, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s stock has gained 70% in an impressive set of gains that have seen their ups and downs. The shares soared by 38% in December 2024 when management shared that it could target a $90 billion AI chip revenue opportunity in 2027. However, the shares sank by 15% during the DeepSeek selloff. Since then, they\u2019ve added 15% on catalysts such as Meta increasing its chip deployments. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in September:\n\n\u201cBroadcom gave us results that showed a tad bit of weakness in artificial intelligence orders, and the pin action took down the whole darn cohort. I don\u2019t believe AI is a bubble, but these stocks are still up a great deal, especially in August. And September tends to bring out sellers when you get just in-line numbers. That\u2019s what we got from Broadcom. It was in line, it wasn\u2019t a shortfall.\u201d \u201cBen Reitzes, who I quote a lot because he\u2019s really smart, said Broadcom was hurt by some choppiness in Google orders. That wasn\u2019t clear from the conference call, but it makes a lot of sense. That business will bounce back.\u201d \u201cThe issue here isn\u2019t Broadcom\u2019s reaction, which took down most of the tech. No, it\u2019s the overreaction to Broadcom that seemed to cascade into finance and then anything cyclical. The pain was palpable. To me, this is all about the zeitgeist, not the facts, because so many companies are doing well despite the slowing economy. However, you can\u2019t waste time arguing with the sellers who suddenly want nothing whatsoever to do with this market. Nothing\u2019s going to stop them from taking profits out of fear.\u201d\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nThe past few days have been chock-full of rumors and tidbits regarding Intel's path forward, and the role, if any, that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO) might play in salvaging the semiconductor industry's quintessential white elephant. Now, Wall Street analysts are out in droves with their insights on this very fluid situation.\n\nLast week, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra cited \"discussions from the Asia supply chain\" in an investment note to suggest that Intel might be pivoting towards a closer collaboration with TSMC to get its struggling fabrication units off the ground.\n\nSpecifically, Gerra pointed to a JV-like arrangement between Intel and TSMC:\n\n\"The fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC.\"\n\nSeparately, we know that Broadcom has also been eyeing Intel's fabs to complement its ASIC design business. Of course, those fabs require a significant induction of capital and talent to attain viability, especially when it comes to sub-2nm nodes.\n\nOver the weekend, we reported that TSMC might acquire a 20 percent stake in Intel's foundry business, either via a cash injection or enabling technology transfer. Other reports suggest that Broadcom and Qualcomm might assist a possible deal by placing sizable orders with Intel's fabs.\n\nThis brings us to the crux of the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse has now hiked the target for Intel shares from $22 to $29, while maintaining an overall neutral rating. The analyst notes:\n\n\"The situation at Intel is extraordinarily complex, but where there is smoke, there is typically fire, so we do believe the news reports that suggest a split of DesignCo/IFS is a done deal.\"\n\nMuse believes that the Trump administration is pushing all concerned parties towards a deal to avoid a \"GM like situation,\" with TSMC likely to emerge as the \"most logical manager\" for Intel's fabs.\n\n\"We believe the current Administration is worried about lack of leadership and current net leverage at Intel (have not found new CEO; negative FCF) and does not want a GM like situation to emerge for the US\u2019 Crown Semiconductor Jewel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy A. Rasgon wants Broadcom \"to stay from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products.\"\n\nWhile explaining his rationale, Rasgon argues that Intel's x86 businesses (CCG, DCAI, and NEX) are not necessarily \"bad businesses on their own,\" managing to haul in \"~$49B in 2024 sales & mid-20\u2019s operating margin.\"\n\nRasgon thinks that even if Intel's products are \"potentially ex-growth, x86 CPUs would be complementary to AVGO\u2019s current portfolio, and one would think overall execution should be far better than Intel\u2019s.\"\n\nThe analyst then lays out how a possible deal between Intel and Broadcom should be structured:\n\n\"We would recommend an all-stock deal if possible. At a ~75% premium (~$40 take-out price, or a mid-high teens multiple) our rough math suggests 20%+ accretion even in a 100% stock scenario, and with very manageable leverage (well under 3x) across a wide range of capitalization structures.\"\n\nOf course, not everyone is upbeat on the prospects of Intel managing to spin off its fabs. For one, Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya thinks that splitting up Intel \"could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC\u2019s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC\u2019s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC\u2019s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO\u2019s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC\u2019s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield.\"\n\nAlso, Lynx Equity has asked \"why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel\u2019s IFS\" given the fact that global fab capacity \"at leading and lagging nodes\" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers \"questionable performance at advanced nodes\" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the \"IFS\u2019s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?\"\n\nLynx Equity argues that \"coercion, via threat of tariffs on semis imports, could be a reason for TSM to come to the table,\" but that the \"gaggle of media reports\" in recent days could simply be a \"trial balloon.\"",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Broadcom Inc's (NASDAQ:AVGO) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-18, Broadcom Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $151.72. It's currently trading at a price of $233.04. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -53.6%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Broadcom Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $4.86 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 22.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 87.33 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 93.29 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 151.72\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $127.97. This valuation indicates that the Broadcom Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -82.11%.

AVGO in the fourth quarter. This move comes on the heels of his total exit from Nvidia NVDA, a competing chipmaker, a few months prior.\n\nIn the closing months of 2024, Druckenmiller significantly reduced his tech stock portfolio, selling his entire stakes in Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Autodesk Inc. ADSK. He also completely sold his stake in Starbucks Corp. SBUX and his shares in insurance company Chubb Ltd. CB.\n\nDespite these divestments, Druckenmiller increased his investments in several big tech companies in the same quarter, acquiring new positions in Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, and Elon Musk\u2018s electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Inc. TSLA.\n\nDruckenmiller\u2019s Duquesne also initiated new investments in United Airlines UAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, Warner Bros. WBD, Skechers SKX, and Eli Lilly LLY.\n\nThe most significant holding in his Duquesne Family Office remains Natera NTRA, the clinical genetic-testing company in which they held a stake since 2022. Natera holdings account for just over 15% of the portfolio. Meanwhile, the firm increased its stake in Teva Pharmaceuticals TEVA by nearly 6.3 times.\n\nSEE ALSO: Warner Bros Announces Shanghai Harry Potter Studio Tour\u2014Set To Be Four Times Larger Than London\u2019s\n\nWhy It Matters: Druckenmiller, who formerly managed hedge funds for George Soros, now manages his own wealth through the Duquesne Family Office, which has investments worth nearly $3.72 billion.\n\nThe billionaire investor\u2019s latest moves follow his earlier divestments in AI stocks. During the third quarter of 2024, Druckenmiller sold all of its Nvidia shares and significantly reduced its Palantir holdings by 95%. This occurred despite Nvidia and Palantir experiencing significant stock surges that year, with Nvidia\u2019s stock increasing nearly 190% and Palantir\u2019s shares gaining over 386%.\n\nThe current quarter\u2019s exit from Broadcom despite the stock surging more than 100% over the past year appears as a profit booking move. Meanwhile, other additions in big tech stocks show his growing confidence in the sector.\n\nDruckenmiller added Tesla to its portfolio which surged over 83% in the past year. However, the stock plunged more than 16% over the last month, amid declining global sales, regulatory roadblocks in China, earnings disappointment, and Musk\u2019s increasing political involvement.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

Nothing has been inked, but Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) both are in the early stages of proposing potential deals, according to The Wall Street Journal. Broadcom could potentially seek a deal for Intel\u2019s chip design assets, while TSMC eyes its manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIntel interim executive chairman allegedly met with buyers, government\n\nBroadcom and TSMC are not officially working together, and any plans either company has for deals with Intel are in preliminary stages, The Wall Street Journal said. However, Intel\u2019s Interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary has allegedly met with potential buyers and Trump administration officials.\n\nTSMC\u2019s involvement in particular would need to take into account Intel\u2019s U.S. national security relationships. Intel was the largest recipient of the U.S. Chips Act of 2022, which gave up to $7.9 billion in grants to U.S.-based factory projects. Reception of that money makes Intel subject to regulations that say the company must own a majority share of its factories if they are sold off or spun out.\n\nYeary is allegedly focused on getting the maximum value for shareholders.\n\nThe two corporations could potentially buy and split Intel; in that case, one division could focus on manufacturing and one on design. Intel\u2019s factories already operate somewhat independently; since 2022, they have taken orders from outside customers and inside the house at equal priority. Intel reports finances from the manufacturing division separately and is prepared to assign a manufacturing subsidiary its own board of directors, The Wall Street Journal said.\n\nIntel\u2019s board of directors has been searching for a new CEO since Pete Gelsinger stepped down from that role in December 2024.\n\nSEE: Arm may shift from only licensing designs to having brand-name chips manufactured by TSMC.\n\nIntel\u2019s financial performance didn\u2019t please the board in the last few years\n\nGelsinger left Intel without completing his turnaround plan, which board directors found was not benefitting the company.\n\nIntel used to be a giant in the CPU industry, but the AI boom and a failure to strategize in a way that benefits from current trends have led to it struggling. Intel is unusual among its rivals in that it has not focused solely on either manufacturing or designing chips; as such, it has seen its chip-making endeavors eclipsed by TSMC.\n\nIntel also had some struggles with quality in 2024. Three years ago, Intel\u2019s value was twice what it was in September 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIt dropped from first to second on Gartner\u2019s list of top global semiconductor vendors by revenue growth. As its place in the rankings indicated, Intel is still a major player, however. Microsoft chose Intel chips for its current-gen Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11.",

After the company posted a $1.6 billion net loss for Q2 2024, then-CEO Pet Gelsinger was asked to present the company\u2019s board of directors with a plan to offload company assets and cut costs. According to reports from the time, ideas included the potential sale of the company\u2019s programmable chip unit, Altera, and a halt or abandonment of the planned $32 billion chip fab in Germany.\n\nIntel ultimately did halt construction on its facilities in Germany and Poland, in addition to cutting 15,000 jobs from its global workforce, reducing R&D and marketing spend by billions between now and 2026, cutting capex by 20 percent, and reducing non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.\n\nIntel also decoupled its Foundry Services business from the company, with Gelsinger telling staff in a September 2024 memo that Intel Foundry would now operate as \u201can independent subsidiary inside of Intel\u201d in order to provide \u201cexternal foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel.\u201d\n\nGelsinger \u2018retired\u2019 from Intel in December 2024 and in January 2025, the company posted its third consecutive quarterly loss, with fourth-quarter revenue down seven percent year-on-year (YoY) to $14.3 billion, whilst full-year revenue declined by two percent YoY to $53.1 billion.\n\nIn late September 2024, Intel reportedly rejected an offer from Arm to acquire the company\u2019s product division after the British chip company made a \u201chigh-level inquiry\u201d but was ultimately told the unit wasn\u2019t for sale.\n\nThat same month, asset manager Apollo reportedly offered to invest up to $5 billion in Intel as reports surfaced that rival chipmaker Qualcomm was also eyeing a takeover of the struggling semiconductor giant.",

(\ud83d\udcf7: Intel)\n\nFounded in 1968 by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, both former co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel \u2014 briefly NM Electronics before adopting its current name from the words \"integrated\" and \"electronics\" \u2014 started as a manufacturer of random access memory (RAM) components before branching out to develop the world's first commercially-available microprocessor: the Intel 4004. While created as a cost-reducing component for a calculator, the general-purpose part put the company on a path to create the x86 architecture and become one of the largest chip design and manufacturing concerns in the world.\n\nRecently, though, the company has struggled to keep up with the demands of Moore's Law \u2014 an observation by Moore that the number of transistors on a leading-edge component tends towards a doubling roughly every 18 months, since adopted as an informal performance-doubling target by the industry as a whole. As feature sizes drop to single-digit nanometers, physical limitations raise their head making it hard to continue the shrinkage necessary to keep cramming more components on each chip. Increased competition from long-term rivals AMD and Arm, the rise of the free and open-source RISC-V architecture, and struggles to compete with NVIDIA in the artificial intelligence (AI) market have all led to a series of financial losses and the ouster of former chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger \u2014 leaving investors concerned about the company's future, particularly following its exit from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in favor of NVIDIA in November last year.\n\nBroadcom, maker of chips including the Raspberry Pi family SoCs, is reportedly looking to pick up Intel's design and marketing arms. (\ud83d\udcf7: Gareth Halfacree)\n\nIt's against this backdrop that Broadcom and TSMC have shown early interest. Broadcom, for its part, has enjoyed considerable success with a broad range of products including the Arm-based system-on-chip families powering the popular Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) and computer-on-module (COM) devices. Acquiring Intel's chip design and marketing business would make it the largest chipmaker in the world, and give it a license to build 32- and 64-bit x86 chips alongside its existing Arm parts.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is rumored to be looking at Intel's chip fabrication facilities and foundry business to run alongside its own with particular interest in its US-based facilities, which are eligible for government funding under the CHIPS Act \u2014 an eligibility that may, however, be cancelled should the facilities fall under foreign ownership. TSMC's move to single-digital nanometer process nodes has, in comparison to Intel's, gone relatively smoothly \u2014 and the company was the first to produce commercial parts patterned using ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithographic process in high volume.\n\nTSMC is rumored to be looking at Intel's fabrication facilities and foundry business \u2014 the part Broadcom reportedly doesn't want. (\ud83d\udcf7: TSMC)\n\nShould either or both acquisitions go ahead, Intel would effectively be split in two \u2014 following in the footsteps of rival AMD, which spun off its manufacturing business in 2008 to create what is now known as GlobalFoundries. Like Intel, AMD's decision was largely driven by financial considerations at at time when it was struggling to compete; the move turned AMD into a fabless design house reliant on outside manufacturing and gave its former fabrication division the ability to take on business from rival companies.\n\nNeither Broadcom, TSMC, nor Intel have publicly commented on the rumors; if any such acquisition should take place, it would be subject to international scrutiny by competition authorities concerned about the size of the resulting merged companies.",

            "content": "Intel\u2019s long-standing presence in Israel, home to one of its most critical manufacturing plants and research hubs, is now facing a period of deep uncertainty. With reports emerging that Intel may be carved up and sold to different buyers, the fate of its Israeli operations hangs in the balance. While the country has become a global leader in chip design and production, the potential sale of Intel\u2019s manufacturing division to TSMC and its chip development arm to Broadcom raises pressing questions about layoffs, restructuring, and the long-term impact on Israel\u2019s economy.\n\n1 View gallery Intel Haifa offices. ( Photo: Eran Yoffi Cohen )\n\nA Pillar of Israel\u2019s Tech Industry\n\nIntel has been one of the largest private-sector employers in Israel for decades. Its massive chip fabrication facility in Kiryat Gat has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s global supply chain, producing some of Intel\u2019s most advanced processors. Beyond manufacturing, Intel\u2019s Israeli R&D centers have played a pivotal role in developing groundbreaking chip technologies, contributing to products used worldwide.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to Israel has been underscored by billions of dollars in investments, including the expansion of its Kiryat Gat plant. However, the potential breakup of Intel could shake the foundations of this relationship. If Intel\u2019s manufacturing arm is acquired by TSMC, the Taiwanese company would face a strategic choice: integrate the Israeli plant into its existing production ecosystem or shut it down if it finds the operations redundant. Given TSMC\u2019s dominance in chip production, it is unlikely to discard a well-established facility outright, but consolidation within its global network could put the plant\u2019s future at risk.\n\nThe Fate of Israeli R&D\n\nWhile manufacturing in Israel faces uncertainty, Intel\u2019s research and development activities may have a more stable outlook. Broadcom, which is eyeing Intel\u2019s chip design unit, already has a strong presence in Israel and has historically maintained the local operations of companies it acquires. Given Israel\u2019s status as a global hub for semiconductor innovation\u2014with Apple, Nvidia, and other tech giants also running R&D centers there\u2014it is unlikely that Broadcom would dismantle Intel\u2019s development teams. Instead, it may seek to integrate them into its broader chip design strategy.\n\nNevertheless, major restructuring could still lead to job losses, shifts in priorities, and changes in leadership. If Broadcom proceeds with the acquisition, Intel\u2019s Israeli engineers might find themselves working under a very different corporate culture, potentially altering the dynamic of their research efforts.\n\nBroader Implications for Israel\u2019s Tech Sector\n\nIntel\u2019s potential disintegration is not just a corporate restructuring\u2014it signals a shift in the global semiconductor industry. If Israel\u2019s role within the new order is diminished, it could have ripple effects on local suppliers, academic collaborations, and workforce development. At the same time, it presents opportunities for new entrants to step in and fill the void, whether through homegrown Israeli startups or investments from other global chipmakers looking to leverage the country\u2019s talent pool.",

            "content": "Broadcom is reportedly contemplating a play for Intel.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Broadcom has closely examined Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing businesses with a view to a possible acquisition, conditional upon someone else taking on Intel\u2019s foundry business.\n\nBroadcom already has a very substantial chip design business but outsources manufacturing. It\u2019s hard to imagine the company would change that strategy.\n\nThe Hock Tan-led company also has a history of acquiring outfits whose products are so deeply embedded in enterprise IT stacks that users are unlikely to replace them.\n\nIntel, like past Broadcom acquisitions VMware and CA Technologies, meets that description as its Xeon processors dominate many datacenters. Plenty of enterprises have built their tech stacks on the x86 architecture and the Xeon ecosystem. Few will be able to adopt a replacement in a hurry.\n\nIntel also offers Broadcom another thing it covets: Subscription revenue.\n\nReaders may recall that in 2022 Chipzilla introduced \u201csoftware-defined silicon\u201d in the form of a scheme called \u201cIntel on Demand\u201d that made it possible to activate features of Xeon processors such as software guard extensions or RAID capabilities upon payment of one-off additional fees. Intel On Demand also allows consumption-based pricing, an idea HPE has adopted in its GreenLake IT-as-a-service offering.\n\nThe Register fancies Broadcom would make Intel on Demand a more prominent feature of its processors under its business model that Netflix, in an unflattering assessment of the company filed in a lawsuit, described as \u201cBuy. Chop up. Sell off. Raise prices. Rinse. Repeat.\u201d\n\nThe \u201craise prices\u201d part of that model would not be sensible for Intel\u2019s desktop chips, which are already struggling to compete on features and price with product from AMD and Qualcomm. But the \u201cChop up. Sell off.\u201d tactics could come into play if Broadcom decides it would rather not contest the drooping PC market.\n\nIntel\u2019s current market capitalization is just over $100 billion, and Broadcom would pay less for its chip design arm alone \u2013 perhaps a smaller sum than the $61 billion it paid for VMware.\n\nThat deal saw Broadcom cut costs, improve margins and boost profits to a greater extent than it initially thought possible, perhaps giving the company confidence its acquisition methodologies are sufficiently efficient it could swallow Intel. Increasing acquisition costs for VMware software and associated services was a big contributor to that achievement.\n\nOther speculation about the semiconductor giant\u2019s fate includes the possibility its fabrication business could be sold to a consortium that includes Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. Any sale of Intel\u2019s chip factories would need regulatory approval in many jurisdictions. A deal could prove especially contentious in Washington, where the Trump administration has signalled its displeasure with the CHIPS Act that funnelled billions to Intel and other chipmakers to fund their build of semiconductor fabs in the USA.\n\nNvidia disarms, a bit\n\nIn other semiconductor ownership news, a Valentines Day filing from Nvidia reveals the AI hardware giant sold 44 percent of its shares in chip designer Arm.\n\nNvidia packs its Grace superchips full of Arm CPUs and is rumoured to be creating an Arm-based PC processor, so selling some shares is not necessarily an indication of displeasure with the UK-based chip design firm. It\u2019s more likely just Nvidia rebalancing its asset portfolio, evidence of which can be seen in the fact the same filing records it sold all its shares in three other companies, and picked up its first stakes in datacenter operator Applied Digital and an outfit called Recursion Pharmaceuticals. \u00ae",

Bloomberg reported on Friday that TSMC\u2019s focus may be on Intel\u2019s fabrication plants, or fabs for short, in the United States.\n\nIntel, Broadcom and TSMC did not respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported that this deal could be accomplished through a consortium model. This could involve other chip designers gaining a stake in Intel\u2019s manufacturing business, according to Bloomberg. The New York Times said a consortium deal could also include private equity firms.\n\nAll three news publications reported that TSMC\u2014which is Intel Foundry\u2019s top competitor as a contract chipmaker with advanced capabilities\u2014has sought the potential deal at the encouragement of the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, a White House official told The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that President Trump would likely not support a foreign company owning Intel\u2019s factories.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday that Intel\u2019s interim executive chairman, Frank Yeary, has spoken with the Trump administration and TSMC leaders about the deal, which would separate Intel\u2019s chip manufacturing business from its chip design business.\n\nWhile The New York Times said the deal would be limited to Intel\u2019s U.S. fabs, it could also include the semiconductor giant\u2019s factories in other countries, like Ireland and Israel.\n\nIntel has been the source of acquisition rumors for several months in light of growing financial challenges that prompted the semiconductor giant last August to announce a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that resulted in the company slashing more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s mounting challenges, combined with the rumored acquisition interest, have raised questions about whether Intel would consider breaking up its chip manufacturing and chip design businesses into separate companies.\n\nAt an investor conference in December, interim Intel co-CEO David Zinsner, who is also the company\u2019s CFO, said the idea is a possibility: \u201cDoes it ever fully separate? I think that's an open question for another day.\u201d\n\nEven before acquisition rumors began to pop up, Intel had taken steps to internally separate its chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry, from its chip design business, which is now known as Intel Products and led by Intel\u2019s other interim co-CEO, Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\n\nAt the same investor conference two months ago, Zinsner referenced Intel\u2019s move to turn Intel Foundry into an independent subsidiary, saying that the business was getting its own operational board and enterprise resource planning system.\n\n\u201cThat's already in flight. That's going to happen, and it\u2019s just a matter of time at this point that we lock in the milestones associated with creating that separation,\u201d he said.",

Apparently TSMC is exploring a deal at the encouragement of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, although a White House official said the administration was unlikely to support an arrangement that put a foreign entity in control of Intel\u2019s factories.\n\nIntel\u2019s struggling business seems to have made it an acquisition target for chip-making rivals. The Journal reported in September that Qualcomm had approached Intel about a takeover.",

            "content": "Nvidia has been the undisputed winner of the artificial intelligence trade, as the leader in creating chips and network infrastructure that power AI solutions. However, there are plenty of competitors trying to get in on the action. After all, the potential market for AI is expected to be so big that just a small connection to the market can send a stock soaring.\n\nTwo stocks that have been clumped in with the AI trade and that make chips and other AI infrastructure are Broadcom (AVGO -1.97%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -3.27%). Broadcom has performed well, with its stock up nearly 86% over the last year. Meanwhile, AMD has struggled, with its stock down nearly 36%.\n\nWall Street analysts currently expect one of these companies to grow earnings faster in 2025, but the other to outperform in stock price appreciation over the next 12 to 18 months. Let's take a look.\n\nBroadcom: 223% earnings growth\n\nWhile Nvidia has made its name by dominating the broad chip market, Broadcom has focused on creating custom chips for some of the large tech players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nAfter the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese company that claims to have developed an AI chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors', many think custom chips will be the path forward, which bodes well for Broadcom. Others also suspect Broadcom has locked up new customers like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company has now topped a $1 trillion market capitalization\n\nFor its fiscal year ended in November, Broadcom only reported $1.27 of earnings per share, but most of this was due to the amortization of intangibles related to the company's acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. On an operating basis, diluted earnings came in at $4.86. Wall Street analysts on average expect the company to grow diluted earnings to $4.01 in fiscal 2025 and generate operating diluted earnings of $6.35, according to data provided by Visible Alpha.\n\nOn the company's last earnings call, management expressed bullishness on the custom chip market and thinks the company will play a role as hyper-scalers roll out their own custom AI accelerators or chips. Broadcom cited its three hyperscaler customers and said that together, their journeys represent an AI serviceable addressable market (SAM) for custom chips and network in the $60 billion to $90 billion range in fiscal 2027.\n\nBroadcom's stock has performed well, and analysts think it is fairly valued at this point. While no analysts are saying to sell, 27 have issued research reports on the company over the last three months, according to TipRanks. The average price target implies very minimal upside. Analysts don't seem bearish on the company at all, so it may be more of a valuation call to let the stock catch its breath. Broadcom currently trades at close to 37 times forward earnings.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: 147% earnings growth\n\nBeing in the AI game is a big deal, which is why investors are often discussing Advanced Micro Devices. However, AMD's main problem is that it has to compete against Nvidia, a company generating gross profit margins in the mid-70s percentile and demonstrating extreme pricing power. According to experts, AMD manufactures cheaper chips than Nvidia, but they're only about 80% as powerful.\n\nStill, Wall Street analysts currently expect earnings to grow nicely this year -- from $1.00 in 2024 to $2.47 in 2025, according to Visible Alpha. On an operating basis, analysts expect earnings to grow from $3.31 to $4.62. However, we'll see how long these last after AMD's recent earnings disappointed the market. The company beat on estimates and even delivered revenue guidance ahead of consensus.\n\nBut revenue in the company's data center segment came in lighter than expected, which disappointed investors given how much the market is growing. After earnings, some analysts expressed concern about the outlook for growth in AMD's AI business.\n\nDespite weaker data center numbers, analysts are still largely bullish on the stock. A total of 36 analysts have issued research reports on the company over the past three months, according to TipRanks. Of these, 24 analysts rate the stock a buy, 11 say to hold, and only one says to sell. The average price target suggests nearly 33% upside from current levels (as of Feb. 11).\n\nThe discrepancy between AMD and Broadcom looks to be based on valuation. While Broadcom trades at 37 times forward earnings, AMD trades at around 23 times. In the near term, AMD may have more room to run on any change in sentiment. However, Broadcom seems to be better positioned to take advantage of current trends in the AI market.",

            "content": "Intel is facing potential acquisition bids from TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and Broadcom, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal. The two major tech companies are exploring deals that could effectively split Intel's operations, with Broadcom reportedly eyeing Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing divisions, while TSMC is assessing the possibility of taking over its chip manufacturing plants.\n\nBroadcom has engaged in informal discussions with advisors about a potential bid, though it is likely to proceed only if it secures a partner to handle Intel\u2019s manufacturing segment. This approach aligns with Broadcom\u2019s ongoing strategy of expanding its business through targeted acquisitions. Meanwhile, TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, is reportedly considering forming an investor consortium to acquire Intel\u2019s fabrication plants, which would further strengthen its position in the global semiconductor market. All discussions remain preliminary, and no formal offers have been made.\n\nIntel has been struggling to regain its foothold in chip manufacturing amid increasing competition from TSMC and others. Pat Gelsinger, the company\u2019s previous CEO, was ousted in December after a series of setbacks including delays in manufacturing plans, a decline in AI chip market share, and a reliance on government subsidies to fund factory expansions. Intel\u2019s financial struggles, including $7 billion in losses from its chipmaking segment in 2023 and a 60% decline in share price, have made it an acquisition target.\n\nAny potential deal faces a major roadblock, however: U.S. government opposition. The Trump administration has voiced strong concerns over the possibility of a foreign company operating Intel\u2019s U.S.-based chip fabs. A White House official recently stated that while foreign investment is generally encouraged, Intel\u2019s domestic manufacturing capabilities are seen as strategically important, making it unlikely that a takeover by TSMC would receive government approval.\n\nThis stance complicates any potential deal, especially as the U.S. government has been actively subsidizing domestic semiconductor production to reduce reliance on foreign chip makers. If Broadcom and TSMC move forward with their plans, they may need to navigate regulatory hurdles and find domestic partners to satisfy national security concerns.\n\nA breakup of Intel would mark a shift toward specialization, with companies focusing on either chip design or manufacturing. Whether these acquisition talks gain momentum or stall due to political and economic factors remains to be seen.",

            "content": "For decades, Intel stood as the towering force in semiconductor technology, defining the modern microprocessor industry and setting the pace for innovation. But now, the company is on the verge of an unprecedented transformation\u2014one that could see its core operations carved up between Broadcom and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. What was once an integrated giant, designing and manufacturing its own chips, may soon become a fragmented relic of its former self.\n\n1 View gallery Intel offices. ( Photo: Nir Keidar )\n\nA Stock Rally Fueled by Uncertainty\n\nIntel\u2019s stock soared 22% last week, but the rally says more about its precarious starting point than genuine investor confidence. The surge was sparked by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who, speaking at an AI summit in Paris, vowed that the Trump administration would ensure that the most powerful AI systems are \u201cbuilt in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips.\u201d That pledge, coupled with reports that the administration is trying to broker a partnership between Intel and TSMC, injected a dose of optimism into the struggling company.\n\nBut enthusiasm is running ahead of reality. Intel\u2019s stock is rebounding from near decade-lows after losing 60% of its value last year. Its market capitalization now stands at roughly one-eighth that of TSMC\u2014a stunning collapse from 2019 when the two firms were valued at parity. The market isn\u2019t betting on Intel\u2019s resurgence; it\u2019s grasping at the possibility of a White House-backed rescue plan.\n\nCan TSMC Save Intel\u2019s Foundry Business?\n\nIntel\u2019s biggest crisis lies in its manufacturing division, which has hemorrhaged over $13 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue. The unit, Intel Foundry Services, was meant to compete with TSMC by offering cutting-edge fabrication for third-party chip designers. But despite billions in government subsidies and aggressive expansion efforts\u2014including a $25 billion investment in Israel\u2019s Kiryat Gat plant\u2014Intel has failed to attract enough major customers.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC generated $41.1 billion in operating profit on $90 billion in revenue last year, making it clear who holds the upper hand in any potential deal. Analysts believe Intel\u2019s only viable path forward may be a complex partnership with TSMC, in which the Taiwanese giant takes partial ownership of Intel\u2019s fabs and helps steer customers toward them.\n\nBut such a partnership would be fraught with challenges. Unlike TSMC, which operates as a pure-play foundry serving the world\u2019s largest tech firms\u2014Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm\u2014Intel has spent most of its history designing chips for its own use.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Role in the Breakup\n\nWhile TSMC weighs a potential manufacturing takeover, Broadcom has expressed interest in acquiring Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing divisions. If this materializes, it would complete the dismemberment of Intel as a fully integrated semiconductor company.\n\nBroadcom, known for its aggressive acquisition strategy, has been in informal discussions about making a bid, but it would only proceed if a partner could be found for Intel\u2019s manufacturing business. In other words, the fate of Intel\u2019s design arm is tied directly to whether the TSMC deal moves forward.\n\nA White House Blessing, But Not a Solution\n\nDespite Intel\u2019s financial distress, it remains the only U.S.-based company with leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. That makes it a critical player in the Trump administration\u2019s goal of securing domestic chip production.\n\nThe White House has sent mixed signals about Intel\u2019s future. On one hand, the administration is encouraging talks between Intel and TSMC, reportedly seeing a partnership as a way to keep Intel\u2019s fabs running and strategically aligned with U.S. interests. On the other hand, a White House official recently indicated that the administration is \u201cunlikely\u201d to support a foreign company operating Intel\u2019s factories\u2014potentially complicating any deal that hands TSMC too much control.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel\u2019s financial woes remain severe. The company has burned through nearly $40 billion in cash over the last three years in a desperate attempt to catch up to TSMC\u2019s advanced manufacturing processes. Analysts expect negative free cash flow to continue through at least 2025.\n\nA Forced Breakup or a Managed Transition?\n\nIntel is no longer in control of its own fate. The company that once dictated the trajectory of computing now finds itself at the mercy of foreign rivals, Washington policymakers, and Wall Street skepticism.\n\nThe next few months will determine whether Intel\u2019s breakup is a strategic realignment or a fire sale. If Broadcom and TSMC step in, Intel could reemerge as a more focused player\u2014though stripped of the vertical integration that once defined its dominance. If no deal materializes, Intel may be forced to continue burning cash in a losing battle to reclaim its former status.",

United was the biggest of the three positions at $101.4 million. Duquesne also reported having call options on all three travel stocks, giving the fund another way to benefit if the stocks rise. Outside of airlines, Duquesne bought stakes in tech giant Amazon and entertainment stock Warner Brothers Discovery . Those positions were worth $72 million and $49.2 million, respectively, at the end of December. Duquesne also added a position worth $72.3 million in Skechers . The biggest holding for Duquesne remains Natera , a genetic testing company, according to securities filings and VerityData. Duquesne also hiked its position in Teva Pharmaceutical , which is now its fourth-largest position. One notable sale for Druckenmiller was Broadcom . Duquesne closed out a position in the chip stock that was worth more than $41 million at the end of the third quarter. The quarterly filing gives a snapshot of the Duquesne holdings as of Dec. 31. It does not show trades during the quarter or reflect any changes made since the end of the period. Druckenmiller told CNBC in January that there was renewed optimism among business executives and investors after the election of President Donald Trump. \"We do a lot of talking to CEOs and companies on the ground. And I'd say CEOs are somewhere between relieved and giddy. So we're a believer in animal spirits ,\" the billionaire said. Druckenmiller rose to prominence as the manager of George Soros' Quantum Fund in the 1990s, helping on a famous bet against the British pound, and had a long track record of success on his own with Duquesne Capital Management before closing the firm in 2010.",

            "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nBroadcom Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy, representing 88.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AVGO\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Broadcom Inc. here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Broadcom Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AVGO a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Broadcom Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $6.31.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Broadcom Inc. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Broadcom Inc. may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

Broadcom closed on the deal in early 2024, and it said in its recent financial results that the acquisition will exceed its initial earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) expectations.\n\n\"We are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal,\" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on last month's earnings call.\n\nAdditionally, investors were no doubt pleased that Broadcom's AI revenue spiked 220% in 2024 to $12.2 billion. Just a few months ago, Broadcom raised its AI revenue estimate from its initial projection of $11 billion.\n\nWith Broadcom exceeding its initial estimate, it's clear that demand for the company's ASICs is in full swing. With the jump in AI revenue, the company's artificial intelligence technology now accounts for 41% of its total semiconductor sales.\n\nIt's only the beginning\n\nBroadcom is tapping into a fast-growing AI infrastructure market that's just getting started. Fellow AI chip competitor Nvidia believes AI data center spending could reach $2 trillion over the next five years. As companies ramp up spending to compete in the AI wars, Broadcom's processors are already well positioned to benefit, and the company knows it.\n\n\"We see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive,\" Tan said on the call.\n\nWith Broadcom's shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6, its stock isn't exactly cheap. But AI's huge potential to transform the tech industry makes Broadcom's share price premium a little easier to accept.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other momentum stocks.\n\nIn the fast-paced world of investing, momentum is a force that can propel portfolios to new heights\u2014or leave them vulnerable to abrupt reversals. Momentum investing, a strategy centered on capitalizing on upward-trending stocks, has gained renewed attention as markets navigate economic uncertainty, technological disruption, and shifting consumer behaviors. For investors seeking to harness this strategy, the choices of hedge funds\u2014often regarded as the \u201csmart money\u201d on Wall Street\u2014offer a compelling roadmap. These institutions deploy vast resources, cutting-edge analytics, and seasoned expertise to identify stocks with the potential to sustain momentum.\n\nThe Allure of Momentum Investing:\n\nMomentum investing is based on the idea that stocks with strong recent performance are likely to keep rising. This momentum is driven by factors such as positive earnings surprises, favorable sector trends, or shifts in the economy. Unlike value investing, which focuses on undervalued stocks, momentum investing capitalizes on market psychology, riding waves of optimism and institutional buying.\n\nWhy Hedge Funds Matter:\n\nHedge funds manage billions in assets and employ teams of analysts, quantitative models, and proprietary data to stay ahead of trends. Their stock picks often reflect deep conviction in a company\u2019s fundamentals, competitive edge, or alignment with transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), renewable energy, or healthcare innovation. When multiple hedge funds converge on a stock, it signals collective confidence in its momentum potential. Moreover, their filings\u2014such as quarterly 13F disclosures\u2014provide a window into their strategies, offering retail investors actionable insights. While past performance is no guarantee, tracking these moves may help identify high-conviction opportunities poised for sustained growth.\n\nGrowth of Momentum Stocks:\n\nMomentum stocks have experienced significant growth recently, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, healthcare, and digital transformation. In 2024, momentum investing emerged as one of the top-performing strategies, with high-momentum stocks outperforming low-momentum ones by 28% year-over-year as of December 11, 2024, as reported by Morgan Stanley.\n\nHedge funds have been instrumental in this trend, significantly increasing their investments in momentum-driven sectors. For instance, hedge funds boosted their exposure to financial firms by 50%, totaling $340 billion, contributing to a 33% surge in the NASDAQ Bank Index, which outpaced both the broader market and the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe power of momentum investing is particularly evident in sectors like technology, with companies leading the charge in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. For instance, during the first three quarters of 2024, AI-related startups raised $6 billion, accounting for 14.6% of total climate tech investment, according to a report by PwC. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best momentum stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we analyzed the holdings of the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM), which targets U.S. stocks exhibiting strong momentum based on factors like price and earnings growth. We then cross-referenced these holdings with Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 hedge fund database to identify which companies in the ETF had the highest number of hedge fund investors. By ranking these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding positions, we compiled a list of momentum stocks that show strong performance trends and are favored by most hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology company that designs, develops, and supplies a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company reported a 51% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching almost $14.1 billion. This growth was driven by a 12% rise in semiconductor solutions and a 196% surge in infrastructure software revenue. The company also announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share for fiscal year 2025.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s strategic purchase of VMware has bolstered its market position, with VMware\u2019s operating margin reaching an impressive 70%. The company is positioning itself for significant growth in the AI industry, with projections suggesting a serviceable addressable market of $60 to $90 billion by fiscal 2027. This growth is primarily fueled by key partnerships with significant hyperscalers, including Google, Meta Platforms, and ByteDance.\n\nCurrently, 128 hedge funds within the Insider Monkey Q3 2024 database held a position in the stock.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the best momentum stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

( AVGO ) is a leading global provider of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, specializing in complex digital and mixed-signal CMOS devices and analog III-V products. Based in Palo Alto, California, the company serves diverse industries, including enterprise networking, telecommunications, data centers, and industrial automation.\n\nShares of the technology giant have significantly outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. AVGO stock has surged 85.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 20.3% . However, shares of AVGO are up 1.3% on a YTD basis, lagging behind SPX's 2.7% gain.\n\nIn addition, AVGO has outpaced the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLK ) 13.8% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nBroadcom shares soared 24.4% after its strong Q4 earnings on Dec. 12, with revenue surging 51.2% year-over-year to $14.1 billion, driven by AI semiconductor and VMware demand. AI revenues skyrocketed 150%, fueled by custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking solutions. Strong Q1 2025 guidance, including $14.6 billion in projected revenue and 65% AI growth, reinforced investor confidence.\n\nMoreover, the stock rallied 4.3% on Feb. 5 after Alphabet projected $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, signaling continued strong demand for AI infrastructure, including Broadcom\u2019s custom AI ASIC accelerators. This alleviated market fears sparked by DeepSeek\u2019s low-budget AI model, which had raised concerns that AI development might require less computing power than previously expected.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in October 2025, analysts expect AVGO's EPS to grow 45% year-over-year to $5.38. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 33 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 30 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings and three \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2024, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated its \u201cBuy\" rating on Broadcom and set a $265 price target .\n\nAs of writing, AVGO is trading below the mean price target of $247.76. The Street-high price target of $300 implies a potential upside of 28.6% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Large Cap Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other large cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nInvestors continue to favor large-cap stocks, as these companies often serve as the foundation of popular index funds and are well-known among both seasoned professionals and casual traders. Moreover, large-cap firms have demonstrated their ability to withstand economic uncertainty, thanks to their strong market presence and substantial cash reserves, which help them weather financial downturns with relative ease. For the second consecutive year in 2024, US large-cap stocks outpaced cash, bonds, and international equities, securing the top spot in market performance.\n\nAlso read: 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA Morningstar report revealed that over the 10-year period ending June 30, 2024, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks by an average of more than 6 percentage points annually. This disparity stems from differences in sector exposure\u2014small-cap benchmarks have a lower concentration of technology stocks and a greater presence in traditional industries like consumer cyclicals, financials, real estate, and industrials. Although economic growth has been robust, these sectors have struggled to match the pace set by technology-related stocks.\n\nIn addition, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management, large-cap stocks play a key role in driving long-term capital appreciation for investors. Over the 10-year period from 2013 to March 2023, large-cap stocks delivered a total return of 162%, outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which posted returns of 139% and 108%, respectively.\n\nLarge-cap stocks demonstrate their resilience through their ability to increase dividends even in times of market distress. Several leading companies have maintained decades-long streaks of dividend growth, weathering major economic crises such as the 2008 recession and the 2020 pandemic. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that large-cap firms with a track record of consistent dividend increases have shown relative strength during downturns, suffering smaller losses than the broader market. In addition, these companies have often outperformed during periods of market stagnation and have participated in a substantial share of gains during bull markets.\n\nDividend growth is a key factor when evaluating dividend stocks, as companies that consistently raise their payouts have historically outperformed those that do not. A report by RMB Capital found that between 1972 and 2018, companies that initiated or grew their dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.62%, significantly surpassing the 2.40% return of non-dividend-paying firms. Even the broader market, with a 7.30% return, lagged behind dividend growers. The report also emphasized that companies with a strong history of dividend increases have not only sustained but expanded their payouts, even during economic downturns. From a portfolio perspective, dividend growth stocks provide solid diversification, as they are spread across multiple industries. This offers an advantage over high-yield portfolios, which tend to be concentrated in mature sectors like utilities and, prior to 2007, financials.\n\nAnalysts recommend incorporating dividend stocks into income portfolios, especially as several major tech companies have adopted dividend policies this year. With robust cash flows, these firms are well-positioned to maintain and expand their dividend payouts over time. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best large-cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to identify large-cap dividend stocks with market capitalization above $10 billion. From that list, we shortlisted stocks that have 5-year average dividend growth rates of above 10%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend growth rates.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.14%\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $14.05 billion, a remarkable 51% increase from the previous year. Semiconductor revenue hit a record $30.1 billion, with AI revenue soaring 220% year-over-year to $12.2 billion. This strong growth was driven by the company\u2019s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. For the full fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA rose 37% year-over-year, reaching a record $31.9 billion.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is drawing considerable investor attention due to its essential role in powering products across multiple industries, such as data centers and smartphones. Its technology manages over 99% of internet traffic, underscoring its dominance in networking. In addition, the company\u2019s acquisition of VMware, a cloud virtualization firm, a year ago has bolstered its market position. VMware\u2019s operating margin has increased to 70%, and the company is on track to surpass its goal of generating over $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), one of the best dividend stocks, currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.00%, as of February 12. The company has increased its payouts for 14 straight years. This impressive dividend growth is driven by the company\u2019s strong cash position. In the most recent quarter, Broadcom generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and $5.48 billion in free cash flow, accounting for 39% of its total revenue.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of the best large cap dividend growth stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

What is interesting is that the Broadcom issue is bigger than this due to and since the VMware acquisition.\u201d\n\nSince the Broadcom acquisition, he said, \u201cVMware has changed the product bundling, licensing, pricing, and go-to-market strategy for its entire portfolio. This has been a major source of concern for our clients at Forrester for many months now, and Broadcom\u2019s competition posture in Europe only adds to the frustration we see in the market. So, in this case we have concerns coming not only from competitors but also from end-users.

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.27%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.51%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.03%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had gained 4.6% over the past month.

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on March 6, 2025. On that day, Broadcom Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.50 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 36.36%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $14.62 billion, indicating a 22.23% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.31 per share and revenue of $61 billion, which would represent changes of +29.57% and +18.28%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Broadcom Inc. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher. Broadcom Inc. presently features a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note Broadcom Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 37.27. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 26.77.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AVGO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.1. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. Electronics - Semiconductors stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.99 based on yesterday's closing prices.",

NASDAQ: AVGO have been a joy for investors to hold, delivering a massive 130% gain in 2024 that included an all-time high in December. It would have been a shock for them when the rally came to an abrupt halt last month after a DeepSeek-driven selloff saw the stock shed 20% in just a matter of sessions. But instead of rolling over, Broadcom has come roaring back, gaining 20% in the past two weeks alone and looking poised to keep climbing.\n\nMomentum is clearly on its side. The semiconductor sector remains one of the most sought-after areas of the market, and Broadcom continues to position itself as a leader in AI, cloud computing, and networking technology. Add in a strong earnings report, rising dividends, and fresh bullish calls from analysts, and it\u2019s hard to ignore the potential upside oozing from this stock. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nGet Broadcom alerts: Sign Up\n\nBroadcom's Earnings Strength and Market Confidence\n\nFor starters, Broadcom\u2019s December earnings report reinforced just how strong the company\u2019s growth trajectory remains. EPS topped expectations, revenue climbed more than 50% year over year, and management raised forward guidance - all bullish signals that Wall Street loves to see.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s decision to increase its dividend was even more telling, which signals confidence in long-term cash flow and earnings stability. Investors tend to take these actions as clear signs of strong financial health, and they help explain why last month\u2019s dip has been so quickly bought up.\n\nAnalyst Endorsements Signal More Upside for Broadcom\n\nIn addition to this, the Wall Street analysts remain firmly in Broadcom\u2019s corner. In the aftermath of last month\u2019s sell-off, the team at Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating. This was followed up by the Jefferies team, which reiterated their Buy rating on the stock last week.\n\nBroadcom MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 96th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 20.3% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -1.45 News Sentiment 1.03 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 18.59% See Full Analysis\n\nBoth of these echoed the updates from Barclays and Mizuho earlier in the year. The respective teams of analysts there reaffirmed their Overweight and Outperform ratings, each setting a $260 price target. The common themes across these bullish stances reflect expectations that Broadcom\u2019s growth trajectory remains intact, with its AI and cloud computing businesses set to fuel further gains in 2025.\n\nAnd the best news for those of us on the sidelines? Even with 20% worth of gains logged in the past two weeks, those price targets point to further upside in the region of 10% and would have the stock back trading at all-time highs.\n\nRisks to Watch\n\nDespite maintaining its bullish rating, Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent note did include a slight downward revision to its price target. While this doesn\u2019t signal a lack of confidence, it does suggest that Broadcom\u2019s valuation could be a concern for some investors, especially with some new competition to contend with. With the stock already up 130% in the past year, strong earnings through the coming year will be needed to continue to justify its share price and the price-to-earnings ratio of 180.\n\nAnother key risk comes from DeepSeek and the broader AI competition. As China\u2019s AI capabilities continue to expand, there is growing concern that US-based AI firms, including Broadcom, could face increased pressure in the coming years.\n\nWhy This Might Be the Perfect Entry Point\n\nHowever, not only can the company point to strong analyst support and impressive fundamentals, but Broadcom\u2019s technical setup also remains highly favorable despite these concerns. After its sharp pullback last month, the stock has quickly regained momentum, but its relative strength index (RSI) is still only at 56, indicating that there is still plenty of room for further upside before the stock enters overbought territory.\n\nWith shares rebounding sharply and major institutions remaining bullish, the current price range could be an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on Broadcom\u2019s long-term growth. If the semiconductor sector continues its strong performance and earnings growth remains robust, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Broadcom challenge its December highs again soon.\n\nBefore you consider Broadcom, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Broadcom wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Broadcom currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

AVGO is a leading global provider of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, specializing in complex digital and mixed-signal CMOS devices and analog III-V products. Based in Palo Alto, California, the company serves diverse industries, including enterprise networking, telecommunications, data centers, and industrial automation.\n\nShares of the technology giant have significantly outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. AVGO stock has surged 85.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied 20.3%. However, shares of AVGO are up 1.3% on a YTD basis, lagging behind SPX's 2.7% gain.\n\nIn addition, AVGO has outpaced the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLK 13.8% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nBroadcom shares soared 24.4% after its strong Q4 earnings on Dec. 12, with revenue surging 51.2% year-over-year to $14.1 billion, driven by AI semiconductor and VMware demand. AI revenues skyrocketed 150%, fueled by custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking solutions. Strong Q1 2025 guidance, including $14.6 billion in projected revenue and 65% AI growth, reinforced investor confidence.\n\nMoreover, the stock rallied 4.3% on Feb. 5 after Alphabet projected $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, signaling continued strong demand for AI infrastructure, including Broadcom\u2019s custom AI ASIC accelerators. This alleviated market fears sparked by DeepSeek\u2019s low-budget AI model, which had raised concerns that AI development might require less computing power than previously expected.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in October 2025, analysts expect AVGO's EPS to grow 45% year-over-year to $5.38. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 33 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 30 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings and three \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2024, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated its \u201cBuy\" rating on Broadcom and set a $265 price target.\n\nAs of writing, AVGO is trading below the mean price target of $247.76. The Street-high price target of $300 implies a potential upside of 28.6% from the current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sohini Mondal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other large-cap stocks. We previously covered 10 Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Buying Recently.\n\nWhy should investors track insider moves? Is it a bad sign for the company when insiders sell their shares? Not necessarily; just like insider buying activity doesn\u2019t always mean the stock is heading for growth. Both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, it's important to consider these moves within the broader context of the company\u2019s fundamentals, industry trends, and overall market conditions.\n\nHowever, insiders or people in high positions within a company\u2014such as executives and directors, often have precious insights into the company\u2019s strategy, plans, next moves and initiatives. Sometimes, for example, when a CEO or CFO invests their own money to acquire company shares, it can signal strong confidence in the company\u2019s potential.\n\nSimilarly, when insiders are selling their shares, it can sometimes mean that the management is losing confidence. On the other hand, it also happens that large shareholders just want to trim their holdings to more appropriate position sizes based on the risk/reward. Insiders can also decide to sell their shares due to personal financial reasons that have nothing to do with the company.\n\nThis means that both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, and therefore, any insider trading activity should be carefully analyzed only with other factors. That\u2019s why due diligence before any investment is of the utmost importance. However, insider trading activity in combination with other relevant determinants can offer valuable insights into a company\u2019s capabilities, helping investors make more informed investment decisions.\n\nTo identify the 10 large-cap stocks insiders are selling recently, we considered only stocks with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. We first used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener and looked for stocks with at least two insiders selling over the last two months.",

December\u2019s monthly job gains also showed an upward revision, highlighting that the US labor market ended 2024 in a better position than previously reported. Economists are thus of the opinion that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in the near future. Consequently, this increases pressure on inflation data to cool down before the central bank considers slashing borrowing costs.\n\nOn January 30, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d to discuss the stock market and the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged. Sticking to the opinion he gave in December, Gundlach was of the view that 2025 would bring a maximum of two rate cuts by the Fed. He reiterated that he was not predicting two cuts but that two would be the maximum number attained in 2025, keeping one rate cut as the base case for the year. The unemployment rate went up for several consecutive months before ticking down, which Gundlach thinks is a matter of deep solace for the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Outlook for the Stock Market Look Like?\n\nOn February 10, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth\u2019s chief investment strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss the 2025 outlook for the stock market. She showed bullish sentiment towards the market, particularly due to strong earnings growth. Comparing the current environment to previous periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and the 1990s, Bartels highlighted the role of robotics, AI, and Web3 in driving long-term growth in the present.\n\nShe noted that companies today fund investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage, unlike the 1990s. Her estimates showed that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the decade\u2019s end, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 growth stocks. We checked their 5-year revenue growth (at least above 15%) and then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of fiscal Q3 2024.

And while that was something typically done only by large, more complex customers\u2014it\u2019s something that we are seeing customers in nearly every segment move towards,\u201d said Chris Woodin, senior vice president of solutions and alliances for Softchoice, a $2.5 billion Broadcom-VMware global partner\n\nWith VCF\u2019s price point of $350 per core alongside new technical capabilities inside VFC 9\u2014including around operations automation, cyber threat prevention, memory tiering, new integrations and SecOps\u2014Softchoice is bullish that VCF 9 will simplify the deployment and operations of private clouds for customers across the globe.\n\n[Related: Broadcom Exec On VMware Prices-TCO Besting Competitors And \u2018Big\u2019 VFC Partner Opportunities In 2025]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s creating a new opportunity for VMware with customers who might have previously only used VMware, in a lot of cases, just as a virtualization layer,\u201d Woodin said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re only going to continue to use VMware as a virtualization layer, as a hypervisor, then they\u2019re not going to get great value from licensing VMware through VCF. But if they are serious about building a private cloud, what they\u2019re finding is that VCF is actually very, very high in value,\u201d said Woodin (pictured above). \u201cI definitely feel that VCF 9 is meeting the moment.\u201d\n\nVCF 9 is slated to become available sometime during the \u201cfirst part of 2025,\u201d Broadcom said.\n\nVCF 9 \u2018Takes The Pain Away\u2019 From Private Cloud\n\nIn an interview with CRN, Broadcom\u2019s vice president of VCF and chief marketing officer, Prashanth Shenoy, said VCF 9 \u201ctakes the pain away from building, deploying and operating\u201d a private cloud.\n\n\u201cThe promise of VCF 9 is your day-to-day job of setting up a private cloud platform, operating it, doing lifecycle management, fleet management, upgrades, patching maintenance\u2014is now built into the product,\u201d said Shenoy. \u201cSo you can operate your private cloud at ease and at scale.\u201d\n\nVCF 9 features a new self-service cloud portal for provisioning services and reduces the total number of management consoles from more than a dozen to just a single console each for operations and automation. New integrated workflows aim to simplify the transition between operations and automation tasks, and enhanced insights and analytics enables more proactive management.\n\n\u201cWe made it so that it\u2019s self-service, so it takes the friction out of developers. For developers, the infrastructure becomes a black box,\u201d said Shenoy. \u201cWe have made it extremely platform, engineer, DevOps and developer friendly, so you get that public cloud experience in private cloud using VCF 9.\u201d\n\nVFC 9 also includes the ability to import VMware NSX, VMware vDefend, VMware Avi Load Balancer and complex storage topologies into existing VCF environments, and leverage and integrate older versions of existing infrastructure. Broadcom also unveiled a new intuitive user interface (UI) to further simplify management and deployment.\n\n\u201cEnabling customers to take their existing environment and easily upgrade that to VCF is a huge focus for us,\u201d Shenoy said. \u201cSo we made it drastically simple for them to upgrade from wherever they are with [Broadcom-VMware] to a VCF way of managing. That\u2019s a big area that our partners should be really excited about because we\u2019ve taken all the pain away from the mundane operations and this painful thing that took them months and months to get there.\u201d\n\nVFC 9 also includes advanced memory tiering with NVMe aimed to enhance data-intensive applications such as AI that reduces latency and accelerates data throughput.\n\nCustomers \u2018Need To Evolve Their Understanding Of What VMware Is Today\u2019\n\nToronto-based Softchoice generated $629 billion in gross sales during the third quarter of 2024, representing a revenue increase of 20 percent year over year.\n\nIn 2023, Softchoice was named Broadcom\u2019s Geo Partner of the Year for North America.\n\nSince Broadcom merged with VMware, the combined company purged VMware\u2019s offerings from hundreds of point products into several bundle offerings including VCF, VMware vSphere Foundation, vSphere Standard and Enterprise Plus.\n\nSoftchoice\u2019s Woodin said all Broadcom-VMware customers need to evolve their understanding of what VMware is in 2025.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, VMware was a portfolio of tools across a very broad array in the environment. A lot of the changes that Broadcom has made to the VMware portfolio over the last couple of years is to really concentrate on specific tools that build the private cloud, which is really everything in VCF,\u201d he said. \u201cSo customers shouldn\u2019t look at VMware as a portfolio of point products that they might put together, but rather as the complete solution that\u2019s required to build a private cloud.\u201d\n\nWith the VCF 9 enhancements, Broadcom is making it even more effective in achieving specific outcomes that customers expect from automation.\n\n\u201cFor example: modernizing the IT process, enabling them to securely adopt AI and some huge benefits in cyber resiliency by creating a much more lateral layer of protection for the environment,\u201d Woodin said. \u201cAs we enter 2025, there\u2019s a very high desire for our customers to build private cloud automation through orchestration.\u201d\n\nVCF 9 New Security Features And Easier Integrations\n\nOn the cybersecurity front, VCF 9 enables fleet-level operations and centralized security and compliance management to deliver uninterrupted operations and more proactive risk mitigation. This is done via new native capabilities for security operations (SecOps) inside VCF including a centralized information hub as well as configuration drift detection technology.\n\nAdditionally, VFC 9 includes native vSAN to vSAN data protection thanks to remote snapshot replication technology aimed at strengthening data resilience with immutable snapshots and reduce downtime with disaster recovery orchestration.\n\nVFC 9 will also add the ability to deploy advanced cyber threat prevention via new vDefend capabilities such as distributed firewall impact analysis; distributed intrusion detection and prevention enhancements to support large and multi-instance VCF environments; rapid threat assessment to help harden security posture by enabling threat profiling of VCF environments; and on-premises malware prevention for regulated organizations that require air-gapped deployment of VCF. VMware vDefend is an advanced service for VCF that is sold separately by partners.\n\nOn the integrations front, VMware Cloud Foundation 9 includes multi-tenant capabilities previously provided separately by VMware Cloud Director into the VCF platform.\n\nVFC 9 also provides the next evolution of virtual private clouds (VPCs) as a native networking-as-a-service experience inside VCF to increase developer productivity, reduce operational burden on IT, and enable faster provisioning of workloads and applications. Native VPC capabilities aim to simplify networking by letting users access self-service isolated connectivity without VLAN complexities and enable non-disruptive integration with existing networks.\n\nSoftchoice Bullish On VFC 9 Partner Services\n\nOne significant move Broadcom is making to help partners drive VCF 9 sales and customer opportunities is shifting professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services such as consulting and implementation services.\n\nAdditionally, Broadcom recently introduced VCF Advanced Services that includes a catalog of ready-to-deploy channel partner private cloud services and solutions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of dialogue in the market about the disruption that\u2019s been caused in the Broadcom channel. I think that\u2019s true, because the ideal VMware partner profile has become much more concentrated,\u201d said Woodin.\n\nHowever, these changes are benefiting partners like Softchoice.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a partner that relies solely on resell\u2014you\u2019re not fitting in the ideal profile. If you\u2019re a partner that was concentrating on tools outside of the VCF suite\u2014that\u2019s a hard profile fit. But if you\u2019re a partner like Softchoice, who is entirely services-led, building private cloud solutions on VCF, and has the experience of helping customers do that in private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid infrastructure environments\u2014you have a huge advantage with VMware going forward. Even more so than you probably did in the past,\u201d said Woodin.\n\nOverall, Broadcom\u2019s upcoming launch of VFC 9 is a home run from Softchoice\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that as customers are consolidating onto the VCF platform for private cloud, it\u2019s enabling them to shed cost from other third-party tools that might have been necessary in the past,\u201d Woodin said. \u201cDespite the disruption over the past year, we\u2019re feeling as bullish about the value we can create for Broadcom customers as we ever have been in the past.\u201d",

            "content": "Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AVGO) \u2013 AI-Centric Custom Chips Powering the Future of Tech\n\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.14%\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The company is attracting significant investor interest due to its crucial role in powering products across various industries, including data centers and smartphones. The company's technology handles over 99% of internet traffic, highlighting its dominance in networking. In addition, Broadcom's acquisition of VMware, a cloud virtualization company, a year ago has strengthened its market standing. VMware\u2019s operating margin has risen to 70%, and the company is on track to exceed its target of generating more than $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported revenue of $14.05 billion, marking a remarkable 51% year-over-year growth. Semiconductor revenue reached a record high of $30.1 billion, with AI revenue surging 220% from the previous year, totaling $12.2 billion. This impressive growth was fueled by the company\u2019s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. For the full fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA grew 37% year-over-year, reaching a record $31.9 billion.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC made the following comment about AVGO in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the fourth quarter as the company\u2019s third quarter results demonstrated continuing strength for its AI networking and custom accelerator semiconductor business. The company also gave long-term guidance for the service addressable market (SAM) opportunity for its AI-related business, indicating a market opportunity of $60 billion to $90 billion, which only includes contributions from its current three customers. This long-term outlook for AI semiconductor content exceeded investor expectations. Broadcom\u2019s quarterly results also showed the company is ahead on its VMware integration timeline to achieve $8.5 billion in EBITDA, which will support long-term gross and operating margin expansion for the company.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been raising its payouts for 14 consecutive years. The company achieved this remarkable dividend growth because of its cash position. In the latest quarter, the company generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and $5.48 billion in free cash flow, which represented 39% of its total revenue. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.05%, as of February 8.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "OpenAI expects to finalize its first custom AI processor design in the coming months and send it to TSMC for production, aiming for large-scale manufacturing by 2026, reports Reuters. OpenAI follows its rivals from Google, Meta, and Microsoft, so to remain competitive in terms of costs, it needs its own custom processors earlier rather than later.\n\nThe custom silicon OpenAI will create for AI processors is expected to feature a so-called systolic array design, a grid of identical processing elements (PEs that perform matrix or vector computations) that are arranged in rows and columns and connected in such a way that data 'pulses' through the array in a pipeline-like fashion. The processor is said to use HBM memory, though it is unclear whether OpenAI plans to use HBM3E or HBM4. As for process technology, OpenAI reportedly aims at TSMC's proven N3-series (3nm-class) fabrication process.\n\nOpenAI is reportedly working with Broadcom on its custom processor for AI workloads project. Typically, companies that work with Broadcom on custom processors develop key differentiating intellectual property (IP) in-house (or at least define it with Broadcom), and then Broadcom adds the remaining parts such as general-purpose CPU cores, memory, and I/O controllers and physical interfaces, as well as assembling the final design.\n\nOn the OpenAI side, the effort is led by Richard Ho, who previously worked on Google's TPUs. Ho's team reportedly doubled to 40 engineers recently, but it is still considerably smaller than those at Amazon Web Services or Google. Expanding the initiative to match the scale of Google or Amazon would require hiring hundreds more engineers. That said, it is reasonable to expect OpenAI's in-house contribution to the design to be relatively small.\n\nInternally, OpenAI sees its custom processor as a way to improve its bargaining power with existing suppliers, mainly Nvidia. However, if successful, the company intends to refine and upgrade its custom silicon over time, expanding functionality with each iteration. The first version is expected to be produced in small quantities, primarily for running inference workloads on AI models rather than training them.\n\nDeveloping a high-performance AI processor is an expensive undertaking. Industry estimates suggest a single model could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and supporting infrastructure, including necessary hardware and software, could double that amount. However, when more than one processor is developed per platform, those costs per processor typically drop.\n\nHistorically, even companies like AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have struggled to create competitive in-house processors that could beat Nvidia's GPUs in terms of performance. However, they have managed to build much cheaper processors with higher energy efficiency tailored for their workloads, which enables them to more than offset development costs. Also, these custom processors make running AI models cheaper for their cloud customers, which is good for the market.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Meta has allocated $60 billion for AI infrastructure this year, while Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion in 2025. OpenAI has not formally announced its 2025 spending plan \u2014 which is not surprising as it is not a public company \u2014 but, likely, it will also spend tens of billions of dollars on hardware, software, and infrastructure this year.\n\nIf OpenAI manages to tape out its first custom processor in the coming months, then it will be able to mass produce it sometime a year after that, in mid-2026. If it is lucky, it will begin deployment in the second half of 2026.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCNBC recently spoke to companies worldwide on how DeepSeek\u2019s new AI models will likely impact their operations and financials. Roadzen, a technology company using artificial intelligence to disrupt the auto insurance sector, was asked how things are now different with DeepSeek releasing its R1 model.\n\nAccording to its chief executive Rohan Malhotra, his company helps its insurance underwriting clients speed up claim processing, cutting the time to resolve 80% of minor accident claims from six weeks to two minutes. Since the nature of processing such claims is sensitive, the company has been using sophisticated AI models that produce accurate results, such as those from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. However, things may be different now that DeepSeek is in the picture.\n\n\u201cOur clients cannot afford a model which has 60%-70% accuracy, that\u2019s like a major economic issue. We need to deploy models that have 95%-99% accuracy.\u201d\n\nRough calculations reveal that the company may be able to incur costs 50% lower using DeepSeek than the costs incurred with OpenAI\u2019s models.\n\n\u201cWhat we really care about is the cost of inference. We care about the accuracy of the outputs. And we care about whether this model is performing to the certain benchmarks that we\u2019ve set, in a good way\".\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nBesides cost efficiencies, other companies have lauded the decision to keep the technology open source, stating that it makes it more attractive compared to existing open-source models like Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama. Another company excited with the advent of DeepSeek is a North Carolina-based eldercare platform CareYaya. Neal K. Shah, CEO, told CNBC that their company has started using AI to help customers fight health insurance claims denials.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek just lowered our costs by 90% so we can help more people,\u201d he said in a message. \u201cThe average cost to appeal a U.S. health insurance claims denial is $43.84. We had used OpenAI and Anthropic to get the cost down to 12 cents \u2014 now we\u2019re doing it with DeepSeek on the back end, the cost per appeal is 2 cents.\"\n\nThe above findings suggest how DeepSeek may democratize artificial intelligence. However, its models are also raising concerns regarding data privacy, security, and potential for misuse. That said, while the impact DeepSeek's models have made is undeniable, it is a wait-and-watch moment to see whether it reshapes the AI world for the better or for worse.",

Market moves: Stocks were higher to start the new week, with the Dow , the S & P 500 , and the Nasdaq shrugging off the trade and tariff headlines that caused weakness on Wall Street last week. Energy was the top-performing sector Monday, thanks to gains in oil and natural gas prices. Our lone oil and nat gas name, Coterra Energy , was jumping roughly 3.8%. Tech, however, was the main driver of the overall market gains due to the strength in the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Club owns six of them: Apple , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , and Nvidia . The seventh Mag 7 stock is Tesla . The only two sectors sitting out Monday's rally were health care and financials. Both sectors are among the top gainers so far this year but have come under pressure in February. All three of our financial positions \u2014 Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs , and BlackRock \u2014 are presenting at conferences on Tuesday. So, we'll hear the latest from each of them. Broadcom: One of Broadcom 's new custom AI chip partnerships is coming into focus. Reuters reported Monday that ChatGPT creator OpenAI is finalizing the design for its first in-house chip. The story suggests the chip is in the later stages and could begin to be mass-produced later this year. Taiwan Semiconductor is the fab that will manufacture this new custom chip, but the story says the chip was designed by OpenAI's in-house team in collaboration with Broadcom. The Hock Tan-led Broadcom currently has three custom AI chip customers, and those clients are widely believed to be Alphabet and Meta \u2014 and most recently, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok. When Broadcom last reported earnings in December, one of the reasons why the stock soared almost 25% was Tan's reveal that the company was in advanced AI chip development with two additional hyperscalers. Based on previous media reports, OpenAI and Apple are believed to be those two customers. Microsoft is a financial backer and partner of OpenAI. On Broadcom's December earnings call, Tan estimated the company's service addressable market (SAM) for its AI business, which includes sales of both custom and networking chips, was $60 billion to $90 billion. That bullish target did not include custom silicon sales from these two new customers. If all the reporting is true, having a fourth AI chip customer in production is great news for Broadcom's ability to capture this large SAM. Broadcom shares jumped 4.5% on Monday. But they were still below their Jan. 24 close before Chinese startup DeepSeek went viral with claims of a cheaper AI model that slammed chip stocks. Up next: It's a quieter week of earnings. Some companies reporting after the closing bell Monday are Vertex Pharmaceutical , Lattice Semiconductor , and Astera Labs . Before the opening bell on Tuesday, Coca-Cola , Marriott , Humana , and Club name DuPont report quarterly resuts. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Strategies of Fisher:\n\nCompared with many other firms, Fisher Investments\u2019 most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm\u2019s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market.\n\nFisher\u2019s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity.\n\nDiversified Portfolio and Sector Emphasis:\n\nThe firm\u2019s holdings express Fisher\u2019s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher\u2019s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%).\n\nIn 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion. The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher\u2019s long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher\u2019s portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo analyze Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 High Growth Stock Picks, we began by reviewing the largest positions in Fisher Asset Management\u2019s portfolio as of Q3 2024. We focused on identifying stocks with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of at least 20% compared to 2023, as this growth metric highlights companies demonstrating robust expansion. We then picked the first ten stocks that met the growth criteria, providing a clear overview of high-growth opportunities in the portfolio.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNet revenue growth in the past 12 months: 43.99%\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading multinational technology company specializing in semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The company has projected significant growth in its AI-related revenue, estimating a serviceable addressable market of $60\u201390 billion by fiscal 2027, up from $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024. This growth is driven by partnerships with major hyperscalers like Google, Meta Platforms, and ByteDance.\n\nIn Q4 of fiscal 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported a 51% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $14.05 billion, alongside a 28% rise in adjusted earnings per share to $1.42. The company expects this momentum to continue, projecting revenues of $14.6 billion in Q1 of fiscal 2025.\n\nThe successful integration of VMware, acquired in November 2023, has bolstered Broadcom\u2019s infrastructure software segment, diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its market position.\n\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri recently raised his price target for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270 from $220, citing confidence in the company\u2019s AI-driven growth potential. Revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 have also been increased to reflect the strong outlook.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Ken Fisher\u2019s top high growth stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

But it certainly did upend certain corners of the cloud computing market, not least by apparently driving more ex-VMware customers toward open source alternatives.\n\nThat, at least, is a high-level overview of the Broadcom acquisition's impact. For a more detailed look, read on as we examine four key takeaways about the deal's impact.\n\n1. VMware Costs Increased \u2014 Sometimes Very Steeply\n\nPredictions that Broadcom would substantially increase pricing for popular VMware products proved to be on the money.\n\nQuantifying exactly how much pricing for VMware products climbed following the acquisition is difficult because Broadcom hasn't released data about what clients were paying before and after the deal. However, media reports suggest that many customers saw increases in the range of 150-300%. More strikingly, certain clients have experienced tenfold price hikes, according to anonymous social media posts.\n\nRelated:How to Leverage Your VMware Migration to Redesign Your Infrastructure Architecture\n\nIn some cases, higher virtualization and cloud computing product costs may reflect Broadcom's effort to make pricing more consistent across its customer base by raising charges for clients who had enjoyed sweetheart deals from VMware. That said, it seems quite likely that customers who were already generating a lot of revenue for VMware are now paying even more and that Broadcom did indeed view the VMware acquisition as an opportunity to squeeze more cash out of VMware's well-established client base.\n\n2. Broadcom's Shifting Strategy\n\nAt first, Broadcom made no apologies for the higher pricing and gave no reason to think it was worried about customers jumping ship in response. But that stance appeared to change by late 2024, when the company announced it would give VMware channel partners \u2014 meaning third-party providers who resell or support VMware solutions \u2014 the opportunity to work with many of its largest clients.\n\nRelated:Broadcom Advances Private Cloud Vision at VMware Explore 2024 Barcelona\n\nBroadcom said little about exactly why it made this decision. But given that the company had previously moved to kill the VMware channel partner program entirely, the obvious conclusion is that Broadcom decided that it could retain more clients if it allowed them to work with third-party providers, who in some cases can deliver lower pricing or better services than Broadcom itself.\n\nIn other words, Broadcom's shifting approach to channel partners appears to be a sign that it has rethought at least part of its initial strategy and no longer sees a starkly unilateral approach to the VMware channel as viable.\n\n3. Limited Broadcom Layoffs\n\nGiven Broadcom's apparent interest in leveraging its VMware purchase to grow revenues and, presumably, increase profits, the acquisition spawned widespread predictions of layoffs for VMware employees.\n\nSome of those predictions were true. When the acquisition closed, Broadcom announced that more than 2,100 people were losing their jobs.\n\nBut warnings about further significant layoffs appear not to have been borne out. Despite some grumblings about \"silent\" layoffs \u2014 meaning steps taken by the company to encourage employees to resign as a means of reducing headcount \u2014 Broadcom has yet to announce any additional large-scale layoffs following the VMware acquisition.\n\nRelated:AI Boom Fuels Cloud Growth, but Capacity Constraints Loom for Big 3 Providers\n\n4. Open Source Emerges as the Biggest Winner Post-acquisition\n\nFor companies seeking to migrate off of VMware following the Broadcom acquisition, there were two basic options. One was to move workloads to an alternative commercial platform, like those provided by Microsoft or Nutanix or a public cloud. The other was to pivot toward a virtualization strategy oriented around open source.\n\nThe limited data compiled to date about the migration paths of ex-VMware customers suggests that a majority opted for the second approach. According to a community survey, the open source hypervisors KVM and Xen were the \"preferred\" solutions of 70% of respondents interested in migrating from VMware. Commercial VMware alternatives were less popular.\n\nData like this should be taken lightly because it's self-reported and doesn't necessarily reflect migrations that former VMware customers have actually completed. Still, it's a sign that the Broadcom acquisition appears to have spurred increased interest in open source virtualization and cloud computing solutions rather than leading to market share gains for VMware's commercial competitors.",

What are the best AI stocks for sustainable growth?\n\nInvestors should consider stocks in established companies with a solid track record and emerging firms that are innovating responsibly, such as those focusing on ethical AI development.\n\n2. How can investors assess the financial health of AI companies?\n\nMetrics such as earnings growth, market capitalization, and investment in R&D are essential. Additionally, analysis of recent market forecasts and expert opinions can provide deeper insights.\n\n3.

            "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nWhat Is Broadcom's Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of November 2024 Broadcom had US$67.5b of debt, an increase on US$39.2b, over one year. However, it also had US$9.35b in cash, and so its net debt is US$58.2b.\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History February 7th 2025\n\nHow Strong Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Broadcom had liabilities of US$16.7b due within a year, and liabilities of US$81.3b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.35b in cash and US$6.33b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$82.3b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\n\nSince publicly traded Broadcom shares are worth a very impressive total of US$1.09t, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nBroadcom has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 4.4 times the interest expense. While these numbers do not alarm us, it's worth noting that the cost of the company's debt is having a real impact. Sadly, Broadcom's EBIT actually dropped 5.5% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Broadcom can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.",

Dominant tech companies, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, use Broadcom's chips for some of their AI needs, and a projected rise in spending could boost demand further.\n\nFor example, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says tech leaders will spend an estimated $2 trillion over the next few years to build AI data center infrastructure. This opportunity is more than just a potential growth area for Broadcom -- the company is already seeing significant financial benefits from it.\n\nBroadcom's 2024 AI revenue soared 220% to $12.2 billion and represented nearly 24% of the company's total sales last year. With companies continuing to ramp up spending to compete for AI dominance, Broadcom could see further gains from its semiconductor business.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan highlighted this opportunity on the company's recent earnings call, saying, \"[W]e see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.\" He added that companies have begun to see their need for custom AI accelerators, saying, \"For each of them, this represents a multiyear, not a quarter-to-quarter journey.\"\n\n2. Broadcom is profitable\n\nMany high-flying tech stocks are benefiting from AI, but not all of them have the same solid financial foundation as Broadcom. The company is consistently profitable and reported impressive non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share of $4.87 in 2024. Broadcom also had an impressive $19.4 billion in free cash flow at the end of the year.\n\nBroadcom benefits from its high-margin semiconductor and infrastructure software business, and at the end of the fourth quarter, its gross margins were nearly 77%. That's great news for current Broadcom shareholders and potential investors because it shows the company is turning rising AI chip and software sales into profits -- not all AI companies are having the same success.\n\nWith AI spending ramping up, Broadcom's bottom line will likely continue benefiting. While there's no guarantee of its success, Broadcom's unique position in ASICs gives it a long-term opportunity to tap into artificial intelligence infrastructure spending over the next few years.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind before buying Broadcom\n\nBroadcom's shares have soared 274% over the past three years (as of this writing). That's pushed up the valuation of Broadcom's stock, giving it a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 34.6. While it's not wildly expensive, Broadcom's stock is more pricey than peers like Nvidia, which has a forward P/E of 27.2.\n\nThat doesn't mean Broadcom isn't a good buy -- it's just a reminder that with any AI stock right now, it's worth considering how much of a premium you're willing to spend in this space. I still think Broadcom has room to run as it taps further into a broadening AI market, but more conservative investors may want to add a small position to their portfolio, adding more shares if Broadcom's stock takes a dip.",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc.'s NASDAQ: AVGO stock price has surged by almost 90% in the past year and over 60% in the last six months, making it a stock that Wall Street analysts are closely watching. This steady upward trajectory has many investors contemplating whether they should take the leap and invest in the technology sector veteran before it's too late. However, the critical question remains: Is now the opportune time to buy into Broadcom's impressive growth story?\n\nGet Broadcom alerts: Sign Up\n\nWhat's Powering Broadcom's Bull Run?\n\nBroadcom Today AVGO Broadcom $190.26 -3.97 (-2.05%) 52-Week Range $119.76 \u25bc $251.88 Dividend Yield 1.24% P/E Ratio 155.26 Price Target $231.48 Add to Watchlist\n\nCurrently trading around $230 as of February 6, 2025, Broadcom's stock performance is undeniably noteworthy. A near 90% increase over the past year and a climb of over 60% in the last six months clearly defines Broadcom's bull run. Broadcom\u2019s earnings report for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (Q4 FY2024) revealed record fiscal year 2024 revenue of $51.6 billion, a 44% year-over-year increase, and record adjusted EBITDA of $31.9 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Broadcom's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant driver, with AI revenue reaching $12.2 billion in FY2024, fueling record semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion. This highlights the company's successful capitalization in the growing AI market.\n\nFurthermore, the strategic acquisition of VMware has substantially boosted infrastructure software revenue to $21.5 billion, contributing to overall revenue and profitability expansion. The integration of VMware is proving to be a transformative move, expanding Broadcom's software footprint and market reach. Broadcom boasts strong profitability with an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 62% for FY2024 and generates substantial free cash flow, reaching $19.4 billion for the fiscal year. This cash generation underpins the company's financial strength and ability to invest in future growth and shareholder returns. The combination of AI leadership, strategic acquisitions, and strong financial execution are key engines propelling Broadcom's bull run.\n\nDividend Perks: Returns Beyond Price Appreciation\n\nBroadcom Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 1.23% Annual Dividend $2.36 Dividend Increase Track Record 15 Years Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth 13.35% Dividend Payout Ratio 113.46% Next Dividend Payment Mar. 31 AVGO Dividend History\n\nBroadcom\u2019s dividend yield is currently 1.02%, translating into an annual payout of $2.36 per share. While the yield itself may not be exceptionally high compared to some dividend-focused stocks, Broadcom distinguishes itself through consistent dividend growth.\n\nThe company recently increased its quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.59 per share for Fiscal Year 2025, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nBroadcom has a commendable 13-year history of consecutive dividend increases, with a strong three-year annualized dividend growth rate of 13.35%. This consistent and healthy dividend growth makes Broadcom increasingly attractive to income-seeking investors, particularly those with a dividend growth strategy. Beyond potential stock appreciation, the steadily increasing dividend payouts offer a tangible and growing return for shareholders.\n\nWhat the Experts Are Saying\n\nBroadcom\u2019s analysts community largely endorse a bullish outlook, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating and an impressive 24 out of 26 analysts recommending a Buy for Broadcom. This strong consensus reflects a widespread belief in the company's continued growth and market leadership.\n\nBroadcom MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 96th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 20.3% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -1.45 News Sentiment 1.03 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 18.59% See Full Analysis\n\nWhile the average price target of approximately $225.04 suggests a slight potential downside from current levels, the range of forecasts is wide, from $170 to $260. This range indicates that while some analysts see limited immediate upside based on average targets, a significant number believe the stock still has room to grow, potentially towards the higher end of the price spectrum.\n\nRecent actions from major firms and top analysts reveal a trend of price target increases, often in the 240 - 260 range, signaling a potential upside. These upgrades and revised price targets further add to the positive sentiment surrounding Broadcom's stock. Investors often look to analyst ratings as a guide, and the largely positive sentiment here is a noteworthy factor supporting a bullish perspective on Broadcom.\n\nThe Other Side of the Coin\n\nWhile Broadcom's bullish narrative is compelling, a balanced perspective requires acknowledging potential risks. Broadcom's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio appears high, at over 187. Still, the forward P/E ratio of around 43, alongside a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 2.31, suggests the valuation is tied to strong anticipated earnings growth. Investors should assess whether they believe this projected growth justifies the current valuation.\n\nThe current market price is slightly above the analyst consensus price target, suggesting limited immediate upside potential. However, individual analyst price targets vary, and some are projecting further upside. This indicates differing expert opinions on short-term price movement.\n\nThe trailing dividend payout ratio is high, but it is expected to become more sustainable as earnings grow. Based on earnings and cash flow, the forward payout ratios are estimated to be around 37%. Dividend sustainability is crucial, so investors should monitor Broadcom's ability to maintain and improve its payout ratio.\n\nFinally, investors should be mindful of the risks inherent in the fast-paced semiconductor industry, including technological shifts, market fluctuations, and intense competition.\n\nMaking the Decision to Jump In\n\nBroadcom presents a compelling investment case for growth. The company has a strong foothold in key sectors like AI and infrastructure software, strong analyst support, and growing shareholder returns through dividends. However, investors must also acknowledge valuation considerations and inherent industry risks.\n\nBroadcom warrants serious consideration for investors seeking growth and dividend income within the technology sector. The company's strong market position, financial performance, and positive outlook, particularly in AI, create a potentially rewarding opportunity. However, as with any investment, thorough due diligence and a clear understanding of the potential rewards and risks are essential before taking the leap and jumping into Broadcom's ongoing bull run.\n\nBefore you consider Broadcom, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Broadcom wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Broadcom currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI processors for data center applications (servers and accelerator cards) were the key drivers for the chip sector in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: Arm\u2019s Rising Royalties and v9 Adoption Strengthen Market Position, Analysts Say\n\nGartner expects the revenue to reach $705 billion in 2025, backed by demand for AI and generative AI (GenAI) workloads, which led data centers to become the second-largest semiconductor market in 2024, behind smartphones.\n\nBroadcom was ranked sixth amongst global semiconductor vendors based on its 2024 revenue. Samsung Electronics SSNLF reclaimed the top spot from Intel Corp INTC thanks to a strong rebound in memory device prices. Intel\u2019s AI PCs and the Core Ultra chipset failed to offset the limited success of its AI accelerator offering and the modest growth in its x86 business. Nvidia moved from the fifth position to the third position. Apple Inc AAPL moved from eighth to ninth position.\n\nHowever, Broadcom\u2019s enterprise value is over $1 trillion, compared to Samsung\u2019s $183 billion and Intel\u2019s $113 billion. Nvidia\u2019s is over $3 trillion, and Apple\u2019s is over $3.5 trillion.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, Broadcom\u2019s revenue was $51.6 billion (up by 44%), with semiconductor revenue accounting for $30.1 billion and infrastructure software revenue accounting for $21.5 billion. Out of total semiconductor revenue, AI revenue was $12.2 billion (up by 220%, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio).\n\nBroadcom\u2019s infrastructure software revenue was $21.5 billion, courtesy of the integration of VMware. The company doubled the AI XPU shipments to hyperscale customers.\n\nChina accounted for 20.3% of Broadcom\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2024, down from 32.2% in fiscal 2023 and 35.0% in fiscal 2022, as per regulatory filing. It marks the repercussions of the U.S. semiconductor embargo against China, citing national security interests.\n\nAlso, China released the DeepSeek AI model that said it could outdo the likes of OpenAI at a fraction of the cost, leading to a selloff in the U.S. tech sector.\n\nThe U.S. tech sector is already grappling with investor concerns over the sustainability of the huge AI investments by the U.S. Big Techs.\n\nLast December, Broadcom chief Hock Tan told investors that Broadcom could generate tens of billions of dollars in additional annual revenue from AI chips by 2027. This was backed by the AI frenzy from U.S. Big Tech giant OpenAI and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which he expected to continue for at least the next decade.\n\nTan expects customers to build clusters of up to 1 million AI chips by 2027. He flagged that even 1 million chips may not suffice the AI ambitions of OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts expect Broadcom to gain from the DeepSeek selloff as AI shifts toward cost-effective, high-performance silicon solutions.\n\nLast December, reports indicated Apple was working with Broadcom to develop a server chip designed for AI tasks.\n\nAlso, in 2024, Broadcom bagged multi-generational AI ASIC programs with OpenAI and a fifth major customer, positioning itself for an over $150 billion AI semiconductor opportunity over the next five years, as per JPMorgan\u2019s Harlan Sur.\n\nThe analyst Sur flagged Broadcom is on track to ramp Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google\u2019s next-gen 3nm TPU AI processor with expected revenues of over $8 billion in 2025 and $10 billion in 2026.\n\nSur expects Meta Platforms Inc META to become Broadcom\u2019s next multi-billion dollar customer. Broadcom expects VMware\u2019s Annualized Billing Value (ABV) to top $3 billion in the first quarter, up from $2.7 billion sequentially.\n\nAccording to its regulatory filing, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactured ~95% of Broadcom\u2019s wafers during fiscal year 2024. Still, Broadcom reported over 64% gross margin in fiscal 2024, which indicates its pricing power.\n\nBofA Securities\u2019 Vivek Arya expressed continued optimism over Broadcom\u2019s prospects, which are backed by an AI compute/networking demand frenzy. However, he does not expect Nvidia GPUs to lose their 80%+ share. Arya flagged ASICs taking over a 10%-15% share of the overall accelerator market.\n\nBroadcom has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 47.9x versus Nvidia\u2019s 41.7x and Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s 13.8x, signifying the premium valuation the former two enjoy backed by their AI moat.\n\nBroadcom has ~599.2 million shares in the U.S. ETF market.

Digital technology has spread across the supply chain and throughout the enterprise\u2014with generally positive effects on business-process speed, accuracy and efficiency. Mobility, analytics-driven customization and generative AI promise to keep digital transformation a top priority for years to come.\n\nYet, most of these new digital tools are isolated, both from one another and from meaningful metrics of customer value. This fragmentation impairs the visibility, alignment and efficiency needed to unlock the full potential of digital transformation.\n\nValue stream management (VSM) is a solution and philosophy that overcomes fragmentation by integrating people, data and processes from innovation all the way through delivery of customer value. My company, Broadcom, monitors the progress of VSM closely through customer conversations, at conferences, and most recently in a survey of more than 500 managers and executives on the digital front lines worldwide.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned encourages us\u2014to a point. On the plus side, a full 96% of surveyed businesses report receiving benefits from VSM, usually in the form of digital transformation progress. But only 2% report achieving the end-to-end transparency and flow that marks the highest level of VSM maturity. Most are clustered at mid-maturity: aware of value-stream issues and beginning to collaborate, but unable to break through to an integrated, data-driven process. What\u2019s holding them back?\n\nFragmented Tools And Ineffective Remedies\n\nTool and data fragmentation is the most visible barrier to effective value stream management. One media company, after years of development teams adopting their own tools and multiple mergers and acquisitions, used 13 different tool chains in just a single line of business.\n\nAnd every one of those tool chains introduces data visibility and alignment challenges: One financial institution carried hundreds of IT resources in its HR system that weren\u2019t assigned to any project or investment in their portfolio management system (PMS). But manager costs were allocated only across projects identified in the PMS\u2014unfairly burdening some projects while effectively \u201cdisappearing\u201d others.\n\nFragmentation can\u2019t be solved until all the data is clearly reconciled and available in every tool, or until a single system contains all the data.\n\nCompanies try to address tool fragmentation by aggregating data from multiple systems into Excel spreadsheets or Smartsheets. It\u2019s a first, tentative step toward VSM visibility, but it\u2019s phenomenally inefficient. One energy company told me they used more than 220,000 Smartsheets\u2014backed by thousands of reports on PowerPoint slides and hundreds of monthly manager-hours\u2014in their homegrown attempt at VSM.\n\nAnother approach is to build a data lake to consolidate the data, with reports to visualize it. One of our financial clients deployed 30 engineers for two years attempting to do this, only to realize it\u2019s impossible.\n\nData consolidation can\u2019t paper over the fact that the underlying tools use different metrics, collect data at different cadences, and operate asynchronously with one another. Data needs to be synchronized and reconciled in real time.\n\nAgile Doesn\u2019t Close The Loop\n\nAgile software development practices are sometimes used to overcome integration challenges, in part by emphasizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools. In fact, many organizations try to use Agile development as though it were value stream management. But Agile processes and practices are isolated from the reality of financial budgets, competing business objectives and the value chain required to ultimately realize business value.\n\nOur survey reflects this divide: Most organizations have just three teams involved in their value stream management initiatives, typically product management, software development and devops. Only rarely do they include customer-facing teams in marketing, customer support or sales.\n\nThe end result is isolation of development from business processes.\n\nIT: From Provider To Partner\n\nA second, more subtle, barrier to achieving full transparency and flow of information is the role of IT in the value chain. Most companies treat IT as a service provider to the business side, as though it were an outside contractor. This turns out to be a real impediment to deliver customer value at speed. Integrating IT as a collaborator in the value chain to deliver customer value is a new way of working that puts business outcomes at the center of how all functions measure themselves.\n\nValue stream management integrates IT into value delivery by mapping the \u201cpeople steps\u201d from idea to customer delivery\u2014and identifying the dependencies among them. One key measure is the lead time between the funding and approval of a process to getting it staffed and underway\u2014and this is where a lot of customers get stuck. Overcoming the challenge requires the hard work of redefining the budgeting process and reinventing resource and capacity planning.\n\nThe collaborative model also requires trust\u2014too often in short supply where IT is concerned! For example, when an investment hasn\u2019t been productive, can the company identify the roadblock and innovate around it without the usual finger-pointing? Full \u201cwarts and all\u201d transparency requires a degree of organizational maturity as a starting point.\n\nAm I The Problem?\n\nSpeaking of organizational maturity, a third barrier to effective value stream management is vanity. It takes two forms.\n\nThe first is the use of \u201cvanity metrics\u201d to measure customer value. Everybody collects sales data and does NPS surveys, but does that really tie investments to customer value? For example, will a new product capability help attract new customers, retain current customers or support a price increase? And when? VSM requires real customer value metrics, including predictive measures of customer interest, for example, from social media.\n\nThe second form of vanity is one that plagues every commercial software provider\u2014customers\u2019 belief that their business is utterly unique, so that no commercial solution can properly embrace its subtlety and diversity. This belief can be overcome only by careful, patient demonstration of a solution that connects data from initiatives to investments, from milestones to user experience\u2014that is, a fully-integrated, \u201creal\u201d value stream management solution.To learn how Broadcom can help you overcome fragmentation by integrating people, data and processes from innovation all the way through delivery of customer value, visit the ValueOps by Broadcom YouTube channel.\n\nThis content originally posted here.",

There\u2019s a lot more profitable business to be done, not only selling VMware solutions, but providing value-added services on top of VMware solutions,' says Broadcom\u2019s Prashanth Shenoy.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) solution has the best price performance and total cost of ownership in the cloud world in 2025 along with a huge services opportunity for Broadcom-VMware partners, says Broadcom\u2019s vice president of VCF. \u201cIf customers truly had better choices, they would have been off of VMware a long time back or even as part of Broadcom. You\u2019ve seen our Q4 results and you\u2019ll see our upcoming Q1 results\u2014that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case,\u201d said Prashanth Shenoy, Broadcom\u2019s chief marketing officer and VP of its VMware Cloud Foundation Division. VMware revenue under the first full year of Broadcom ownership was up 3 percent to $13.8 billion as of fourth quarter 2024. In its final year of independent ownership, VMware generated $13.35 billion in revenue. Compared to competitors like Nutanix and Red Hat, Shenoy said the total cost of ownership of a full-stack private cloud architecture via VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) bests all market competition. \u201cAll this discussion about these price increases, when we sat with our customers to truly say, \u2018The price that you paid was generally on a perpetual license for support. And now, if you have more than one component of the VCF stack\u2014for example: vSphere with VSAN,or vSphere with NSX\u2014the VCF pays for itself because that\u2019s how we priced it.\u2019 We priced it at $350 per core per year, which is equal to two components of the previous VCF stack that was there,\u201d Shenoy said. [Related: VMware-Broadcom Partners Weigh In On New Channel Chief\u2019s Vision And Strategy] \u201cThere is flexibility and choice for the customers, but in every phase, we can guarantee that we will come out on top when it comes to operational efficiency, performance, innovation, as well as total cost of ownership,\u201d he said. Shenoy was previously VMware\u2019s vice president of cloud platform, infrastructure and solutions marketing before the company merged with Broadcom in 2023. Shenoy spent 22 years at Cisco in top marketing executive roles before joining VMware in 2022. From recently revamping VCF partner certifications to Broadcom shifting professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services, 2025 is a \u201chuge year\u201d for Broadcom-VMware channel partners. \u201cPartners now, after a year of transformation that they\u2019ve gone through jointly with us, have realized there\u2019s more staying power for them to partner with Broadcom than not. There\u2019s a lot more profitable business to be done, not only selling VMware solutions, but providing value added services on top of VMware solutions,\u201d he said. In an interview with CRN, Shenoy talks about VCF\u2019s TCO versus competitor offerings, revamping VCF certifications ahead of launching VCF version 9 later this year, and the three biggest opportunities for Broadcom-VMware channel partners in 2025. VMware has increased prices since switching from siloed product offerings to a few pre-packed, full-stack bundles. Does VCF have a better price performance compared to your competitors like Nutanix, Red Hat and Scale Computing when you\u2019re talking about an end-to-end solution? Yes, 100 percent. It\u2019s been very important for us to sit with our customers and our partners to truly help understand what VCF is. Because a lot of our customers and our partners didn\u2019t really realize the full value of VCF. I personally have made sure when I discuss with customers and partners, I actively encourage them to look at alternatives out there. Because if there\u2019s one thing that Broadcom does is to truly focus on R&D. We invest 15 percent of our revenue directly in R&D. So we are very focused on building high quality products that are highly, highly cost effective for our customers. We stand by that. So we are actively encouraging customers to do a fair TCO comparison of Nutanix, compare Red Hat, compare even the native public cloud and hyperscalers saying what does it take to run my modern and my traditional VM-based workloads, and have all of the compute, network, storage and operations capability, and look at the price per core, and compare that to an equal service that they can provide. And look at the TCO of managing, operating, maintaining that, and we will come out on top. How often does VCF \u2018come out on top\u2019 regarding TCO pricing? Our own studies have shown we are 40 percent better than native public cloud or three-tiered, hardware-defined data center architectures. Things may vary. We\u2019ve seen our customers get up to 560 percent ROI and nine-month payback for the investment. So we are very, very focused on making sure this is highly cost effective from a TCO perspective for our customers. But more importantly, we will work with the customers to have a very staggered pricing approach. Because a lot of our customers do annual budgeting. We want to make sure that if they\u2019re getting a three-year subscription, let\u2019s work out the price so that\u2014as you deploy different components and the value that you get\u2014we can price you accordingly. So we\u2019ve done some very, very flexible annual payment plans to make sure it\u2019s easier for our customers to get a staggered way of realizing and paying for that. Click through to read the rest of CRN\u2019s interview with Broadcom\u2019s Shenoy about VCF prices, competition and the biggest Broadcom-VMware partner opportunities in 2025.\n\nAnything else to say regarding VCF price performance versus the competition? If customers truly had better choices, they would have been off of VMware a long time back or even as part of Broadcom. You\u2019ve seen our Q4 results, and you\u2019ll see our upcoming Q1 results\u2014that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. We\u2019re seeing very strong momentum in our growth of VCF as the platform, as well as in the space where VCF is not necessarily the right solution. We do have alternates: we have VMware vSphere Foundation; we have vSphere Standard; and we have Enterprise Plus also that we unveiled in the market last year based on customer feedback. So customers still have flexibility and choice. If they are trying to deploy a private cloud, then VCF is the answer. If they just want an enterprise grade HCI platform, then VMware vSphere Foundation is the answer. If they just want compute virtualization, we have Enterprise Plus for that. So there is flexibility and choice for the customers, but in every phase, we can guarantee that we will come out of top when it comes to operational efficiency, performance, innovation, as well as total cost of ownership.\n\nHow is Broadcom making VMware Cloud Foundation compelling for your customers and partners? We have done a lot to make this very, very compelling for our customers as well as for our partners. Number one, all this discussion about this price increases, when we sat with our customers to truly say: The price that you paid was generally on a perpetual license for support, and now, if you have more than one component of the VCF stack\u2014vSphere with VSAN or vSphere with NSX\u2014the VCF pays for itself because that\u2019s how we priced it. We priced it at $350 per core per year, which is equal to two components of the previous VCF stack that was there. It\u2019s very, very price competitive, but we completely understand that you don\u2019t want to deploy all of this at once. So let us help you find, \u2018What are the use case that you are trying to achieve?\u2019 And slowly help you get to full stack adoption. In each of the phase, let us show you the TCO benefits and the ROI benefits that you\u2019re going to get. So we have built this private cloud modernization program jointly working with our partners that: Number one: helps assess where our customers are in the journey of private cloud. Number two: look at their maturity compared to where they want to be. Number three: decide what are the use cases that they want to deploy so they can get that private cloud. Number four: give them a very prescriptive adoption plan that our partners can help deliver. As you do this, clearly show what is the TCO benefit that you\u2019re going to get as you deploy the services and get to full stack.\n\nTalk more about this new private cloud modernization program for partners and customers? The private cloud modernization program has this tool that we call our Private Cloud Modernization & Optimization, which is now available for partners. This is highly customized on an account-by-account basis. So partners can sit with the customers, see what their current environment is with VMware and Broadcom, and then help customers get the full stack and value, and see what services they can provide. We\u2019ve also made sure that our customers have this service entitlement for VCF, so that 15 percent of their total contract value they can leverage for VCF services working with our partners. That\u2019s a huge benefit for them. It shows our commitment as Broadcom to say, \u2018We just don\u2019t want you to buy the product. We want you to use the product that you\u2019re buying and realize the full value.\u2019 And we want our partners to help in that journey. All of that 15 percent is for the partners. Partners can leverage that to build services.\n\nWhere else is Broadcom investing in and helping your channel partners? It\u2019s also around certification, learning and training programs. Both our customers and our partners are, generally, not full private cloud experts. They have been compute experts or networking experts or storage experts. We want to change their mindset to think, \u2018What does a platform operating model look like? If you need to break all these silos in your enterprise IT organization, what would building a private cloud need to look like?\u2019 Let us help you train, educate, enable you on how to build, operate, manage, consume and protect a private cloud environment.\u2019 So we have completely revamped our VCF certification. When we unveil the general availability of our VCF (version) 9, we will have all of these certifications ready to go and training for our partners and our customers, so they\u2019re not only getting the product, but they also know how to build, deploy, operate and consume the product. So it\u2019s not just about the product, but it\u2019s also about the learning and certification that we have put in place for partners. Also, we are now training our education partners, that we call EDP (Education Delivery Partners), so they can go build the learning and certification practices and train our customers to be a private cloud expert and how to deploy a VCF. So the revenue goes to them. We are just helping them to be successful in training and certification. It shows that we are here as a business to build a private cloud platform. Our partners are truly our strategic partners who can help build, deploy, operate that with our customers, and also help them do learning and certification.",

That would be up nearly 50% from the $52.5 billion Alphabet spent in 2024.\n\nThe forecast for the huge jump in spending came in spite of Alphabet missing estimates for cloud growth last quarter, which came in at 30% and just below expectations. However, management noted that Google Cloud was supply constrained, saying, \"We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\"\n\nThus, the spending appears to be serving a real demand, and the forecast appeared to quell recent worries over DeepSeek, the Chinese AI model that was supposedly trained with an extremely low budget. The fear for AI chip stocks in the wake of DeepSeek was that AI models may not need as much computing power as previously thought.\n\nBroadcom itself got caught up in that sell-off last month, as it makes Google's custom AI ASIC accelerators for its data centers. But since Alphabet is clearly not slowing down its deployment of AI infrastructure, the revenue Broadcom derives from making Alphabet's custom chips seems set to continue, along the lines of its previously stated outlook.\n\nBroadcom expects massive growth from AI\n\nBack in December, Broadcom forecast a stunning $60 billion to $90 billion in AI chip revenue by 2027, up from just $12.2 billion last year.\n\nWhile the DeepSeek revelation seemed to call that massive growth into question last month, Alphabet's bold spending forecast appears to have alleviated those fears today.",

Several top analysts are fine with the chipmaker's underlying acquisitions, raising their price targets as they're becoming bullish on Broadcom's ability to cash in on its advanced ASICs and win market share in the swiftly evolving artificial intelligence sector. These refreshed expectations serve to highlight the fact that the company is positioning itself to generate revenue from an addressable AI market, which estimates the opportunity to be in excess of $60 billion and up to $90 billion by 2027.\n\nThe stock has also remained institutionally bought, a collective fresh look at Broadcom's growth prospects as tech sector volatility mounts. The semiconductor giant's strength in its robust chip portfolio and innovative product offerings enlarges its chance of benefiting from the rising demand for data centers, enterprise applications, and automotive systems. Yet, analysts warn that maintaining technological leadership and avoiding supply chain disruptions remain key challenges. These encouraging signals will be created to digest for the investors, and still, the premarket surge expects Broadcom to ascend on its flight if it maintains its competitive edge in the rapidly changing AI platform.

That's a major leap from the $52 billion the Google parent spent on capex last year and higher than Wall Street was expecting. It's also a promising sign that the AI race that's been the driver of the sector's bull thesis is still going strong.\n\nThe expectation of heavy spending this year dismayed Alphabet investors\u2014the stock was down more than 7% before midday\u2014but it's a win for chip stocks, which will benefit from that spending.\n\nThe tech giant's outlook for spending should soothe investors after last week's steep tech sell-off on fears that China's DeepSeek AI model might cause firms to rethink their plans for investment in sophisticated chips needed to train AI models.\n\nNvidia, which lost a record $589 million in market cap as tech plunged last Monday, was up almost 5% on Wednesday, trading at $124.08 around midday.

            "content": "Shares of semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rallied 5.9% on Wednesday as of 12:10 p.m. ET.\n\nBroadcom didnt reportany news itself last night or today; however, a bullish forecast by its largest customer for artificial intelligence (AI) application specific integrated chips (ASICs) last night quelled recent fears around slowing AI spend.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nAlphabet will be a big spender in 2025\n\nOn itsearnings calllast night, Alphabet's management forecast a whopping $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 to supply its artificial intelligence build-out. That would be up nearly 50% from the $52.5 billion Alphabet spent in 2024.\n\nThe forecast for the huge jump in spending came in spite of Alphabet missing estimates for cloud growth last quarter, which came in at 30% and just below expectations. However, management noted that Google Cloud was supply constrained, saying, \"We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\"\n\nThus, the spending appears to be serving a real demand, and the forecast appeared to quell recent worries over DeepSeek, the Chinese AI model that was supposedly trained with an extremely low budget. The fear for AI chip stocks in the wake of DeepSeek was that AI models may not need as much computing power as previously thought.\n\nBroadcom itself got caught up in that sell-off last month, as it makes Google's custom AI ASIC accelerators for its data centers. But since Alphabet is clearly not slowing down its deployment of AI infrastructure, the revenue Broadcom derives from making Alphabet's custom chips seems set to continue, along the lines of its previously stated outlook.\n\nBroadcom expects massive growth from AI\n\nBack in December, Broadcom forecast a stunning $60 billion to $90 billion in AI chip revenue by 2027, up from just $12.2 billion last year.\n\nWhile the DeepSeek revelation seemed to call that massive growth into question last month, Alphabet's bold spending forecast appears to have alleviated those fears today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $307,661 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $44,088 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $536,525!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nLearn more \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But, before we get into the nuts and bolts, I would encourage you to read part one of this article series.\n\nIn that article, we explored private AI as a strategic approach for enterprises to harness Artificial Intelligence's (AI) potential while maintaining robust security, data sovereignty, and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe global market for AI grew to 184 billion U.S. dollars in 2024, a considerable jump of nearly 50 billion compared to 2023 \u2013 and the growth trajectory is only set to get steeper in 2025. As discussed in my first piece, Private AI offers organisations a platform to intelligently and securely manage AI models, control data interactions, and future-proof their technological infrastructure. By encouraging local data storage and so, supporting economic growth, and providing flexibility for evolving regulatory landscapes, Private AI empowers businesses to adopt cutting-edge AI technologies without compromising on privacy, choice, or control. On an organisational level, this could drive productivity gains, while also positioning the UK as a critical player in the AI ecosystem.\n\nSo now, how can organisations take the plunge and make the rapidly evolving landscape ofPrivate AI work for them? Here are a few things to consider.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to do a major tech overhaul\n\nCustomers consistently express uncertainty about AI adoption, primarily due to widespread misconceptions about the technological and financial barriers to entry. The prevailing narrative that AI implementation demands significant public cloud infrastructure has created unnecessary intimidation and hesitation among businesses looking to leverage advanced technologies. Many have asked me: why should we make significant time and monetary investment in AI technologies hosted in the public cloud just to be told by a regulator or a cloud provider outside my country or region that I suddenly need to change tactics?\n\nThe simple answer: You don\u2019t have to, and this is where Private AI comes into play. Private AI models are inherently adaptable, integrating global regulatory considerations directly into their core architecture. By maintaining granular data traceability, these models enable organisations to proactively comply with emerging data sovereignty requirements. Unlike the hasty public cloud migrations of the past, where companies adopted technologies without strategic foresight, Private AI represents a more considered, cost-effective, mission-adaptable approach to technological infrastructure.\n\nThe AI landscape is dynamic and rapidly expanding, with new technology vendors constantly emerging. Private AI offers enterprises a flexible, modular infrastructure that prevents vendor lock-in and ensures ongoing compatibility with evolving technologies. Organisations can now build AI platforms designed to integrate smoothly with open source tools and APIs.\n\nAdditionally, product capabilities such as advanced resource scheduling and memory management allow for the dynamic allocation of GPU and hardware resources between production and research tasks, ensuring optimal performance while keeping costs in check. This flexibility allows businesses to expand their AI capabilities without having to invest in a lot of extra hardware.\n\nUnderstand the use cases first\n\nTo understand how to use private AI tools for your organisation, look at the use cases around you first. Private AI is already transforming how organisations tackle data privacy and compliance challenges across multiple sectors. In financial services for instance, banks are leveraging this technology to process sensitive information securely, enabling advanced fraud detection and customer analysis while adhering to strict regulatory standards. By keeping data out of public cloud environments, these institutions are able to get maximum value out of their data, while maintaining robust protection and operational efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, law enforcement agencies are using private AI to revolutionise investigative processes. Advanced language models help analyse vast volumes of case data, uncovering critical connections and accelerating case resolutions with unprecedented precision, all while ensuring strict control over sensitive information.\n\nCustomer contact centres represent another compelling use case, where private AI enhances backend operations to support human agents. Rather than replacing customer interactions, these AI systems enable faster, more accurate responses, improving ticket resolution rates and overall productivity while allowing for complete data privacy and compliance.\n\nThese practical applications demonstrate private AI's transformative potential: delivering tangible business benefits like increased productivity, value, and cost efficiency, without sacrificing the fundamental need for data security and regulatory compliance.\n\nPrivate AI represents more than a technological trend\u2014it's a fundamental reimagining of how businesses can better offer intelligent solutions. By seamlessly integrating robust regulatory compliance with dynamic innovation, this approach has become essential for enterprises navigating today's complex digital landscape.\n\nIn an era where data privacy and technological adaptability are paramount, private AI is emerging as a transformative force, redefining the boundaries of innovation and progress. The opportunity is clear: embrace this approach, and witness firsthand how intelligent, secure AI can drive your organisation's strategic capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how Broadcom's innovation supports private AI.",

Meanwhile, Rheinmetall is seemingly the prime beneficiary of Germany\u2019s decision to pursue a massive defense spending package, which may be passed this week.\n\nIt\u2019s very poetic that Rheinmetall\u2019s ascension over Volkswagen is coming at the precise time that it is also considering taking over some of Volkswagen\u2019s operations.

In other words, the demand for AVGO\u2019s products is going nowhere.\n\n\u201cI fail to see how the achievement of lower compute costs will curtail demand for semiconductors, servers, storage systems or wireless technology,\u201d sums up the investor.\n\nWhile year-over-year growth is slowing, notes On the Pulse, the company is still slated to increase sales by 12% to over $61 billion in the current year. The investor also expects the company\u2019s gross margins to remain in the high 70s in 2025 as well, further supporting the bullish thesis.\n\nOf course, the slump has pushed share prices down, and AVGO is now trading at 27x leading profits, points out On the Pulse, adding that this is slightly cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s 28x.\n\n\u201cThe DeepSeek-inspired crash on Monday created a whole bunch of new investment opportunities, in my view, and Broadcom is one hardware company that I would specifically recommend investors to buy on the dip,\u201d concludes On the Pulse, who is rating AVGO a Buy. (To watch On the Pulse\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThat seems to be the consensus on Wall Street as well. With 23 Buy and 3 Hold ratings, AVGO enjoys a Strong Buy consensus rating. Its 12-month average price target of $236.29 would yield gains of ~8.5% in the coming year.

They include the Partner Advisory Boards for Solution Providers and Professional Services partners, the VMware Knights event, and the VCF Business Unit knowledge transfer sessions. These gatherings provide valuable opportunities to meet with our partners, align on strategy and strengthen our partnerships.\n\nAs head of Broadcom\u2019s Global Commercial Sales and Partner organization, I look forward to meet more partners at these events, to discuss how we can drive mutual growth and achieve our shared goals.\n\nAs I outlined in my recent blog, \u201cPartnering for Success in 2025,\u201d our key focus this year is to drive growth, deliver value, and strengthen alignment by prioritizing a select group of value-based solution providers who are truly investing in the VMware and Broadcom software businesses. Being a value-based provider goes beyond driving bookings. It requires significant investment in skills, capabilities, and customer success. Rather than just fulfilling product transactions, we need solution partners who can architect, sell, and provide services to adopt and deploy \u2013 a complete technology platform. To successfully meet this opportunity and serve our mutual customers\u2019 needs, our partners need to level up their skills and offerings.\n\nWhile many partners have already made these investments, we need more to take the leap. To support this, Broadcom has modified the Advantage Partner Program by introducing a new points-based model to reward and recognize partners based on key value-based attributes, such as bookings, enablement, and services capabilities. This program offers a way for partners, regardless of size, to acquire the expertise and certifications they need to succeed. By leveling the playing field, it enables small- and medium-sized partners to compete more effectively.\n\nPartner Enablement and Certification\n\nTo support partners, Broadcom will provide free enablement activities, a new VMware certification framework, and additional resources. Even if partners don\u2019t plan to offer services, enhancing their technical and sales acumen is critical to support customers.\n\nBroadcom Knights: Elevating Technical Expertise\n\nTechnical expertise is vital across pre- and post-sales engagements. The Broadcom Knights program recognizes elite partner technical experts who undergo the same rigorous training as our internal engineers. Knights hold the highest certifications and are valued by Broadcom and across the partner ecosystem. They play a critical role: They drive technical excellence, contribute to industry events, train peers, and enhance solution delivery.\n\nProfessional Services and Post-Sales Success\n\nPartners are essential in the post-sales phase to ensure customers unlock the full potential of their VMware and Broadcom investments. Our Expert Advantage Partners Program offers a comprehensive range of professional services opportunities to help customers achieve their desired outcomes. Whether partners choose to invest in pre-sales, post-sales professional services or focus solely on sales, there\u2019s a role for everyone within our ecosystem.\n\nNext Steps\n\nFollowing the launch of our points-based program this month, we encourage partners to work with their Broadcom representatives to build a business plan focused on training, certifications, and growth opportunities. If you\u2019re not yet a Pinnacle, Premier or Select partner but want to elevate your status, contact your Broadcom Partner Business Manager or email us at: partnerprogram.office@broadcom.com\n\nBroadcom is committed to innovation and solving complex challenges. By prioritizing value-based solution providers, we can ensure customer success through highly knowledgeable partners.\n\nI\u2019ve witnessed first-hand the benefits of a consultative, comprehensive approach to customer engagement, both as a vendor sales account director and a partner sales leader. As we continue to invest in partner enablement and growth, I look forward to meeting more partners at our events in Europe in mid-March and the Asia Pacific region in late spring.\n\nUntil then, I\u2019m asking my team and our partners to: Enable, Engage, and Excel \u2013 Let\u2019s GROW!",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best FAANG+ stocks to invest in right now.\n\nThe group of stocks formerly known as FAANG were synonymous with technological prowess, market dominance, and high growth. These companies provided exponential returns and offered the chance to be part of the technological revolution. Their rise to dominance was fueled by innovation, digital transformation, the increasing use of the internet, and their insatiable hunger for growth. In the process, they reshaped industries, altered consumer behavior, and redefined customer engagement. However, over the past couple of years, the acronym has lost some of its relevance as some names have changed and new companies have encroached on the territories of these mega-caps. As a result, the market has started using the term \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d to better represent the most valuable tech stocks. In this list, we include the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 plus five interesting stocks that focus on the transformational technology growth trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, EV technology, and streaming.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by understanding the sheer magnitude of these stocks. We created an equal-weighted portfolio (equal investment in each stock) of all 12 mega-cap technology stocks in this list and compared their combined performance with the S&P 500 Index over the past 5 years. Astonishingly, the mega-caps portfolio has returned over 385% compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s return of around 86%. Additionally, these 12 stocks now have a combined market cap of over $20.0 trillion, with around $14 trillion added in the past 5 years. In comparison, the total market cap of all US-listed stocks is approximately $60.5 trillion (as of December 2024; source: Wilshire 5000 Index), making these mega-caps account for nearly one-third of the total US market value. Although it\u2019s not entirely fair to compare market caps to GDP, if we could, and if these 12 mega-caps formed a country, they would rival China as the second or third largest country by nominal GDP.\n\nDespite recent intense competition, challenging market dynamics, and a difficult regulatory environment, these tech leaders still stand tall with their legacy of innovation and digital transformation. We believe their substantial investments in technology infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, international expansion, and continuous innovation have helped them maintain their dominance. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened new avenues for growth among these tech giants. With that, let\u2019s explore these 12 stocks.\n\nHand touching brain of AI, Symbolic, Machine learning, artificial intelligence of futuristic technology. AI network of brain on business analysis, innovative and business growth development.\n\nOut Methodology\n\nTo identify the 10 best FAANG+ stocks, we compiled a list of U.S.-listed technology companies with largest market capitalization, along with the stocks from the FAANG acronym. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order based on their market capitalization, with the stock having the highest market capitalization ranked at the top.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on January 31.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of hedge funds: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology company that designs, develops, and supplies a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company\u2019s products play a crucial role in enterprise and data center networking, broadband access, storage systems, smartphones, and wireless communications. Broadcom\u2019s extensive portfolio includes solutions for data center networking, storage, and security, making it a key player in the data center ecosystem. It also provides infrastructure software solutions such as Private Cloud, Tanzu, and VeloCloud to help enterprises develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure their applications. Its market cap currently stands at $1.0 trillion, up from $144 billion five years ago.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) boasts one of the industry\u2019s broadest IP portfolios, with around 21,000 patents. The company has been focusing on expanding its data center solutions, particularly in networking and storage. Broadcom is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for high-speed connectivity and data processing capabilities driven by the rise of cloud computing and AI applications. Recent advancements in 5G technology and strategic acquisitions, such as VMWare in 2023 and Symantec in 2019, have further strengthened Broadcom\u2019s market position, enabling it to capture a larger share of the data center infrastructure market.\n\nIn December 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported strong earnings, with full-year 2024 revenue growing 44% year-over-year (YoY) to $51.6 billion. The \u2018Infrastructure Software\u2019 segment revenue grew to $21.5 billion, driven by the successful integration of VMware, while the \u2018Semiconductor\u2019 segment revenue rose 7% YoY to $30.1 billion, fueled by AI revenue, which surged 220% YoY. On the impressive AI revenue growth, the company\u2019s CEO noted:\n\n\u201cWe see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive. We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU road map to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy one million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market, or SAM, for XPUs and network in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion.\u201d\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best FAANG+ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Krause even carried out a town hall with VMware employees alongside Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, while also writing several blogs regarding the benefits of the merger.\n\nThe initial plan for VMware, post-acquisition, was for the company to become part of Broadcom\u2019s Software Group under Krause\u2019s leadership. Instead, it was decided to rebrand Broadcom Software Group as VMware.\n\n\u201cVMware is an iconic software company with a vibrant ecosystem, including hyperscalers, system integrators and channel partners,\u201d Krause said in 2022. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to change any of that, and in fact, we want to embrace those relationships. We have tremendous respect for what VMware has built, supported by a skilled team of engineering talent. It is for all these reasons and more that we\u2019ve committed to rebrand Broadcom Software Group as VMware.\u201d\n\nBroadcom completed its acquisition of VMWare in late 2023.\n\nMusk On Treasury Officials\n\nDOGE was created by the Trump administration to slash government staff and spending. DOGE, for its part, said its mission is to modernize \"federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\"\n\n\u201cCareer Treasury officials are breaking the law every hour of every day by approving payments that are fraudulent or do not match the funding laws passed by Congress,\u201d Musk recently wrote on his social media company X. \u201cThis needs to stop NOW!\u201d\n\nHe said his DOGE team discovered \u201cthat payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump this weekend commended Musk\u2019s recent work on DOGE.\n\n\u201cElon is doing a good job. He\u2019s a big cost-cutter,\u201d said Trump in an interview with reporters this weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s very much into cutting the budget of our federal government.\u201d\n\nKrause\u2019s Technology Career\n\nKrause was vice president of corporate development at Avago Technologies in 2016.\n\nWhen Avago Technologies and Broadcom merged, he soon became CFO of the newly formed Broadcom Inc. As CFO of Broadcom, he was responsible for all financial functions, mergers and acquisitions, human resources and investor relations.\n\nIn 2020, he was promoted to lead Broadcom\u2019s six software divisions as president of Broadcom\u2019s Software Group, which he helped form. Krause was responsible for all of Broadcom\u2019s software divisions as well as software sales, customer support and software operations. He worked with a team of more than 6,000 employees and managed over $5 billion in revenue.\n\nPrior to Avago and Broadcom, Krause ran his own financial advisory firm\u2014Krause Consulting Group\u2014for two years where he represented several public and private technology companies.\n\nHis IT career also includes a six-year stint at Techwell as vice president of business development; two years at venture capital firm Technology Crossover Ventures; and two years working as an investment banking analyst at wealth management firm Robert Stephens.",

In fact, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumped 3%. And Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), which is one of the largest investors in AI, gained 2%.\n\nHere's a look at how markets are reacting to DeepSeek's impact on AI and why Meta Platforms stands out as a top AI stock to buy now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAI efficiency improvements\n\nReports indicate that DeepSeek was able to build its model at a far lower cost than OpenAI's solution, which led to fears of slowing demand for AI infrastructure like Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) or Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits. The news marks a potential step change in the way AI investments are viewed.\n\nThe Donald Trump-backed $500 billion Stargate AI project is tasked with building out data centers to support AI workflows. Microsoft is on track to spend around $80 billion on AI in fiscal 2025. If highly sophisticated AI tools can be built fairly inexpensively, more scrutiny may be warranted on AI spending. And investors won't applaud a company just because it is throwing money at AI.\n\nHowever, a subsequent 9% rebound in Nvidia the following day on Jan. 28 came as some investors and analysts viewed efficiency improvements as a net positive, arguing that overall compute demand could increase if AI became more affordable for smaller companies.\n\nA similar comparison would be the price of an iPhone over time. When the iPhone first came out in 2007, it cost $499 for the 4 GB version and $599 for the 8 GB model. Inflation-adjusted, that cost is closer to $780 for the 4 GB and $930 for the 8 GB. But the new iPhone 16 starts at just $799, so the cost of an iPhone has stayed about the same since its release despite product innovation and exponential storage increases. Rather, Apple has grown by several folds since then, both in terms of earnings and the stock price, because the iPhone became a consumer staple and Apple expanded its ecosystem across accessories and services. The same could occur with Nvidia. If the market for its products grows, Nvidia won't need to rely so much on pricing power, which could benefit the company long-term.",

Scale Computing said in its most recent quarterly earnings announcement that sales have taken off and its new customers have doubled over the past year, thanks in part to Broadcom\u2019s changes to VMware sales operations.\n\nCustomer concerns loom as VMware Explore event approaches\n\nAug. 19, 2024: This year\u2019s VMware Explore marks the first time for the flagship customer event since Broadcom finalized its acquisition of VMware last November. Enterprise customers have questions about VMware\u2019s future direction, licensing changes, and product roadmap following Broadcom\u2019s takeover. Customers want to continue to see innovation across the VMware portfolio, says one analyst. They also want to see Broadcom focus on integration, interface design, and an easier adoption path.\n\nNutanix hunts disgruntled VMware customers\n\nJuly 01, 2024: Nutanix began aggressively courting VMware customers who might be open to jumping ship in the wake of VMware\u2019s purchase by Broadcom and some of the unpopular moves that followed.

            "content": "Buying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) share price has soared 602% over five years. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's also good to see the share price up 31% over the last quarter. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nAlthough Broadcom has shed US$110b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 48% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 168.15.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth February 2nd 2025\n\nThis free interactive report on Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Broadcom's TSR for the last 5 years was 709%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 83% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 52% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Broadcom .",

Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump\u2019s trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows:\n\n\u201cEverything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets\u201d\n\nRecently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s, Google\u2019s, or Meta\u2019s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build.\n\nThe event raised a lot of concerns over America\u2019s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China\u2019s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple\u2019s App Store demonstrates the country\u2019s rapid gains in the sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The firm\u2019s category-leading product portfolio caters to markets such as cloud, broadband, data center, storage, industrial, networking, wireless, and enterprise software. Broadcom is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.\n\nThe global infrastructure technology leader, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), is built on over 60 years of innovation, engineering excellence, and collaboration. Many of the largest companies including most of the Fortune 500 as well as government agencies rely on the firm\u2019s software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, AI data centers, and private cloud infrastructure. Simultaneously, Broadcom differentiates itself through its high-performance design and integration capabilities and develops semiconductor products for target markets where it can earn attractive margins.\n\nFinancials remain robust for Broadcom as its fiscal year 2024 revenue climbed 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. While Semiconductor revenue was at a record $30.1 billion supported by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, infrastructure software revenue grew to $21.5 billion as a result of the integration of VMware. Based on its technology leadership, leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, and an extensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated products, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is in an attractive spot for the future.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 8th on our list of best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.\n\nSemiconductor stocks were once again at the forefront of media and investor attention this week during the stock market selloff triggered by investor apprehensions about lower AI development costs courtesy of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI models. Because AI has dominated headlines for more than a year now, most of Cramer\u2019s attention during his morning appearances focused on the technology whether it was before or after the selloff.\n\nBefore the selloff, on Friday, the CNBC TV show host started out by discussing the applications of AI. While most of the public\u2019s attention is focused on chatbots, AI\u2019s business use cases are quite diverse. One such use case is in the healthcare industry and another comes through the financial services sector. Cramer commented on both of these:\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re not thinking about, like when I went to Jensen Huang\u2019s panel on healthcare. It\u2019s so much bigger than anything involving AI PC. I mean they\u2019re really just talking about having the data to really attack every single disease and changing it from fatal to maintenance. You have tremendous number of people involved in trying to do that. Then you have Stripe there working with [the GPU company] to be able to do something revolutionary in finance. And then you have the banks working doing some revolutionary things trying to get people who\u2019re doing S1s. . . .\u201d\n\nThe DeepSeek AI selloff was notable particularly because of the impact on the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU company. The firm, which was the world\u2019s most valuable company ahead of the selloff, bled close to $600 billion in market value and lost its top spot to the company behind the iPhone. For Cramer, while the lower AI development costs were commendable, the use cases for the AI GPU firm\u2019s products were beyond large language models:\n\n\u201cWell, look, there\u2019s no doubt about the cost is great for this. But if you\u2019re gonna go forward and you\u2019re gonna do what Jensen was talking about, which is anything physical, anything physical with Blackwell. It\u2019s going to be better than what we do. I\u2019m just saying that Jensen\u2019s on a plane of his own. And that, if you have low commodity, Jensen\u2019s got the three thousand dollar chip that can handle that. Was I shocked by this? No it was nice that they came up with such a low price.\u201d\n\nFor semiconductor stocks, one AI-generate catalyst that did not materialize is the AI PC. These PCs use a special chip called a neural processing unit (NPU) along with CPUs and GPUs to run AI tasks. In an appearance before the DeepSeek selloff, Cramer mentioned a Morgan Stanley report that shared that 60% of people surveyed had accidentally bought an AI PC and more than 60% were uncomfortable paying extra for AI products. The report, which added that just 15% of the respondents had bought a new product because of AI was \u201cperhaps the most damming piece\u201d that Cramer had read.\n\nHe shared that \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever,\u201d and cycled back to enterprise AI use cases by stating \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say.\u201d\n\nCramer added that not only was he wrong about the AI PC cycle as the PC he \u201cthought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d but those who he knew had bought such a PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street after September 2024. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 10-10-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 21.86%\n\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company whose chips are used in enterprise and personal computing applications. It\u2019s been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI wave with the stock rising by 38% in December after management shared that it was eyeing a $60 billion to $90 billion custom AI chip opportunity in 2027. However, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s shares sank by 7.4% during the DeepSeek selloff. However, the stock did gain 5.2% on Friday after Meta announced it would increase MTIA chip deployment. Here\u2019s what Cramer had said about the firm in October:\n\n\u201cBroadcom makes data center plumbing, but also has a broadband infrastructure business, including cell phones. Now, we had CEO Hock Tan on when he went to San Francisco. He told an incredible story. I was so excited, I was jazzed about it, but nobody listened. Well, now they\u2019ll listen. Stock just hit an all the time high today. It\u2019s not done. I\u2019d hold onto it, especially since its VMware division helps data centers cut harbor costs and operate much more efficiently. And it has really turned the corner. I like that stock very much.\u201d\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

After a run-up like that, many investors might wonder how much upside potential is left -- if any.\n\nBroadcom is in a great position in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. It helps design custom AI accelerators, and also sells connectivity switches used in AI data centers. But after the emergence of DeepSeek's R1 as a less computationally demanding model, is Broadcom still a solid stock pick right now?\n\nBroadcom's investment thesis centers around increased use of its AI hardware\n\nBroadcom isn't just a business devoted to serving the AI market. Its products include mainframe software, virtual desktops (mainframe-based software that allows users to access their personal desktop environments and software from any device), and an AI product line. However, most of the excitement around the stock lately has been driven by its virtual desktop and AI products.\n\nIn late 2023, it completed the acquisition of VMware, which provides virtual desktop software. This has added lots of growth to the company, but Broadcom's management has angered VMware's established customers with some of its actions.\n\nBroadcom hit VMware clients with jaw-dropping price hikes (AT&T, for example, said its VMware bills rose by 1,050%), prompting a lawsuit. Many customers have begun to look elsewhere for virtual desktop software.\n\nOn the AI side, Broadcom was generating massive amounts of revenue growth from sales of hardware for the giant AI data centers now being built. Sales of custom AI accelerators and networking components grew by 220% to $12.2 billion in Broadcom's fiscal 2024, which ended Nov. 3. That represented around 24% of its total revenue.\n\nHowever, the stock plunged by more than 17% on Monday after the announcement of DeepSeek's R1 AI model, which was supposedly trained for just $5.6 million. However, the market's reaction may have been a bit rash.\n\nThere's a lot of skepticism over that $5.6 million figure because DeepSeek didn't dive into details about how it was derived. However, R1 has clear efficiencies over many of the domestically developed generative AI models, so this issue shouldn't be ignored.\n\nRegardless, the market's current attitude is: \"Big tech won't need to keep spending all of this money to build out AI infrastructure if tech companies can train and run AI software more efficiently.\" As a result, any company whose business is tied to providing hardware for these servers saw its stock sell off this week.\n\nStill, AI hardware investments aren't likely to stop just because one competitor has debuted a more advanced model.\n\nWith that in mind, is Broadcom stock a buy?\n\nThe stock still isn't cheap even after the sell-off\n\nPrior to the sell-off, I would not have been a buyer of Broadcom stock; it was just too expensive. After its recent haircut, it trades for a more reasonable 32 times forward earnings.\n\nHowever, there are still questions about how the VMware business will fare if Broadcom continues to impose such egregious price hikes on clients. The recent consensus among Wall Street analysts was that the company would deliver 19% revenue growth in its fiscal 2025. That could prove to be an overly optimistic estimate if AI investments collapse due to DeepSeek.\n\nBroadcom's valuation is still expensive compared to its big tech peers, and with so many questions surrounding the outlooks for AI and VMware, I think investors would be well advised to avoid the stock for now.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nAlso read:\n\n8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nSince then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.",

The idea is that this is a high-performance offload solution that is quantum resistant.\n\nBy encrypting data in flight between endpoints, one is no longer trusting that a firewall in front of the data center is keeping threats out.\n\nThis is not just an IPSec VPN between endpoints. Instead, it is a full offload of encrypted sessions that ties back to the adapters.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s suggestion is that simply using the Emulex FC HBAs allows for OS and applicaiton independent encryption and as such, it can be more efficient.\n\nA big part of the justification for this today is in ransomware detection and prevention.\n\nAlso driving this are a number of new standards and regulations requiring updated security. In many markets, these regulations drive update cycles.\n\nThis is one of those technologies that we expect to be more commonplace over time as these regulations come into effect.\n\nFinal Words\n\nFiber channel is one of those really interesting technologies because it has a massive installed base.

Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump\u2019s trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows:\n\n\u201cEverything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets\u201d\n\nRecently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s, Google\u2019s, or Meta\u2019s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build.\n\nThe event raised a lot of concerns over America\u2019s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China\u2019s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple\u2019s App Store demonstrates the country\u2019s rapid gains in the sector.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs.

            "content": "Meta's artificial intelligence plans will break new ground in 2025.\n\nBig tech companies are spending heavily to stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Budgets for building AI data centers filled with GPUs and network switches jumped higher in 2024. And a recent update from Meta Platforms (META -4.70%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg says 2025 could see an even bigger jump in spending.\n\nZuckerberg said in a Facebook post that Meta will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. That's up from $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024, a 60% jump at the midpoint of each forecast. Despite previous comments from Zuckerberg hinting at a big increase in spending for 2025, analysts had expected Meta's capital investments to come in around $51 billion this year.\n\nZuckerberg's comments suggest big tech isn't even close to being done with spending on AI development as the arms race continues into 2025. That's great news for a few important Meta suppliers: Nvidia (NVDA -0.65%), Broadcom (AVGO -1.98%), and Arista Networks (ANET -1.16%).\n\nThe building blocks of a data center\n\nAt the core of data centers focused on large language model training and inference are GPUs. In Zuckerberg's post, he said Meta will have 1.3 million GPUs by the end of the year. That's an increase from the 600,000 estimate Meta gave for the end of 2024.\n\nNvidia is the largest supplier of GPUs to Meta, and it's likely to stay that way in 2025. Nvidia's latest chips based on its Blackwell architecture promise 30 times the performance of its previous generation, with 25 times less cost and energy consumption. No competitor currently comes close to that level of performance out of the box like Nvidia's chips. And in a market where big tech companies are racing to stay ahead of one another, paying up for Nvidia's chips is the fastest path to stay ahead.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only company Meta relies on for AI chips. Meta designs its own silicon, working closely with Broadcom, to handle specific tasks related to Meta's AI development and deployment. For example, the ranking and recommendation models that power Facebook and Instagram's feeds, Stories, Reels, video, and more are built on Meta's own AI accelerator chips. These custom-built chips are faster and more power-efficient than general-purpose GPUs.\n\nMeta is working to expand the scope of its own chips to include generative AI, and it'll likely continue taking steps toward that goal in 2025. That's great news for Broadcom, which is a key technology provider for Meta in that endeavor.\n\nAll those GPUs and AI accelerators need an efficient way to communicate with one another and make sure data gets from one place to another quickly. That requires Ethernet switches. Ethernet switches are like traffic controllers for data centers. They route data from one server to another and make sure there's no congestion on the network slowing everything down.\n\nMeta partners with Arista Networks to create hardware and software solutions for its data centers. With plans to open a massive data center full of GPUs in 2025, Arista will see a strong step-up in orders from Meta as well.\n\nInside those Arista Ethernet switches are more Broadcom chips. Broadcom makes the logic chips that allow the hardware to route data efficiently. So, the company plays both a supporting role for Nvidia's chips while offering a competing product to some degree.\n\nAre these stocks a buy?\n\nZuckerberg's announcement is certainly great news for the continued demand for AI infrastructure, such as that provided by Nvidia, Broadcom, and Arista Networks. All three should see strong revenue growth in 2025, which should translate into a nice bump in earnings for investors.\n\nBut just because a company is poised to grow in 2025 doesn't make its stock an automatic buy. Valuation still matters. All three of these stocks saw their prices climb significantly higher as excitement around the increased demand for their products permeated the market. As a result, their stocks became priced for perfection.\n\nWe saw the impact of that pricing recently following the realization of what High-Flyer's LLM DeepSeek has been working on and the potential long-term implications. While Nvidia, Broadcom, and Arista Networks could still show great financial results in 2025, DeepSeek's innovations call into question how long big tech will sustain its spending on hardware before focusing on making its software more efficient.\n\nAll three stocks come with considerable risks and uncertainty. Nvidia stock looks attractive based on forward earnings estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending next January), but the potential for declining market share and pressure on pricing power are long-term challenges.\n\nBroadcom has a lot of upside as a designer of custom AI accelerators for Meta and other big tech companies, as well as creating essential chips for network switches. Its business is more diversified than Nvidia's, with some slower-growing segments outside AI-related chips. Still, it trades for a higher forward earnings multiple than Nvidia, based on Wall Street estimates.\n\nArista Networks is seeing great revenue growth, but its stock now trades for over 40 times forward earnings as of this writing. And that's after the impact of the DeepSeek news. Despite the strong demand for its hardware, the company isn't growing nearly fast enough to justify its current stock price.\n\nWhile the comments from Zuckerberg may have provided some confidence in 2025 results for all three companies, the long-term questions and stock valuations make all three stocks risky to own. It may be worth it for some to add exposure to AI data center spending through these stocks, as long as investors remain mindful of the risks each poses and the constant changes happening in AI development.",

The cost of ransomware attacks continues to rise with attacks in 2024 costing USD $5.37 million on average per attack. Upcoming generative AI and quantum computers magnify the risk if data is not encrypted at all points in the data center including the network.\n\nTo address these cybersecurity issues, governments have responded with mandates, including the United States\u2019 Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0, the European Union\u2019s Network and Information Security (NIS) 2, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and more that require enterprises to modernize their IT infrastructures with post-quantum cryptographic encryption algorithms and zero trust architecture.\n\nToday, data centers have the option of deploying application encryption or network encryption to protect their data. Network encryption offers several important advantages versus application-based encryption including preserving storage array services such as dedupe and compression, which is destroyed when using application-based encryption. Network encryption also enables real-time ransomware detection while application-based encryption hides ransomware attacks. Additional highlights of this solution include no encryption performance penalty and simple, session-based key management.\n\nEmulex Secure HBAs feature security built on zero trust and post-quantum cryptography, supporting encryption algorithms that comply with CNSA 2.0, DORA, and NIS2 mandates. They secure data in-flight between host servers and storage arrays while integrating a zero trust platform with Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM), cryptographic authentication of endpoints, and silicon root-of-trust authentication.\n\nAdditionally, the HBAs comply with the NIST 800-193 framework, offering secure boot, digitally signed drivers, T10-DIF, and more. They provide cost-effective encryption by maintaining dedupe/compression storage services and ensuring data protection across all applications rather than application-specific solutions. The solution runs on existing Fibre Channel infrastructure without performance degradation, thanks to cryptographic offloading to hardware.\n\nWith simple session-based key management and on-demand key generation, Emulex Secure HBAs offer easy deployment, operating transparently with existing operating systems, applications, and SAN management tools.\n\nEmulex 32G and 64G Secure HBAs are available in 1, 2, and 4 port configurations and are shipping now.\n\nJeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager, Emulex Connectivity Division, Broadcom Customers are seeking ways to protect themselves against crippling and expensive ransomware attacks as well as complying with new government regulations mandating all data be encrypted. The Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter meets these needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that once installed, encrypts all data across all applications.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks were moving higher today as earnings season kicked into full swing and as investors continue to digest the impact of DeepSeek on the AI sector. The Nasdaq Composite and broader benchmark S&P 500 index were modestly higher as of 1:40 p.m. ET today.\n\nShares of AI giants Broadcom (AVGO -2.02%) had moved roughly 4.5% as of 2 p.m. ET, while shares of Alphabet (GOOGL -2.58%) (GOOG -2.54%) had risen about 2.5%. Meanwhile, shares of Marvell Technologies (MRVL -2.82%) were up nearly 3%.\n\nA big assist from Meta\n\nMeta Platforms reported its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closed yesterday, soundly beating analyst estimates. Earnings per share of $8.02 crushed the Street's consensus estimate of $6.76, while revenue came in $1.4 billion higher than expected.\n\nHowever, Meta's results also came with a nice surprise for Broadcom. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call with analysts that the company would spend hundreds of billions on artificial intelligence. Additionally, Meta CFO Susan Li also said, \"We're pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) silicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads.\" Meta built its MTIA chips with Broadcom, so investors see this announcement as very bullish for the company.\n\nIn potentially other good news for Broadcom, The Wall Street Journal reported late last night that SoftBank is contemplating a $15 billion to $25 billion investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Broadcom in December said it had recently won deals to develop next-generation semiconductor chips for two new companies and analysts think one is OpenAI, so the WSJ report looks like more good news.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting today after two analysts raised their price targets on the company this morning. Analysts at Bernstein increased their price target on the stock from $185 to $210 and maintained a market perform rating on the stock. The analysts believe that Google Search and YouTube will continue to grow nicely, while Alphabet's cloud services group can potentially turn the company into a winner in the AI space.\n\nAlphabet also caught a price target bump from Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who increased his target by $10 to $215 and maintained an outperform rating on the shares. Helfstein said that Meta's results pave a favorable path for when Alphabet reports earnings next week. He thinks more investors might buy the stock as the company's AI picture becomes more clear and if investors start to question Meta's revenue outlook.\n\nWhile there was no specific news from Marvell, it appears to be moving for the same reasons as Broadcom. Meta's announcement supports the thesis that tech giants could look to create more tailored chips to meet their AI infrastructure needs. Marvell already does this for some of the biggest tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nEarnings reports keep investors interested in AI\n\nAfter a big sell-off earlier this week due to the emergence of DeepSeek, earnings reports are keeping investors interested in the AI trade. I think the emergence of DeepSeek has only created more questions about whether AI companies can sustain their elevated valuations, so I am still concerned that these stocks face a high threshold to keep the momentum going.\n\nOf these three stocks -- Broadcom, Alphabet, and Marvell -- I am most interested in Alphabet, one of the cheaper names in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Alphabet has struggled more than peers due to a lawsuit from the Department of Justice that could ultimately force the company to sell its Chrome browser. But I think this outcome is unlikely, and I like the fact that analysts believe the market has yet to fully price in the value of Alphabet's AI businesses.",

What gives?\n\nWell, you can pinpoint the moment when Nvidia erased its after-hours gains on Wednesday evening. During Microsoft\u2019s conference call, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said:\n\n\u201c In FY \u201926, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against, across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY \u201925, and the next spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth. \u201d\n\n(Note: Microsoft\u2019s FY26 begins in July 2025.)\n\nNow, \u201cgrowth rate will be lower\u201d still = \u201ccapex line go up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a similar dynamic to what we\u2019ve seen in discussions about inflation and prices: inflation can slow, but so long as it\u2019s not negative, prices will continue to rise. Just replace \u201cinflation\u201d with \u201cinvestment growth\u201d and \u201cprices\u201d with \u201ccapex,\u201d and that\u2019s what Microsoft is telegraphing here.\n\nSo, Microsoft\u2019s tree of AI-linked capex may yet still grow to the sky, but not in a parabolic fashion.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, kicked off the call that followed earnings with remarks that included a resounding resolve to just keep spending:\n\n\u201c These are all big investments, especially the hundreds of billions of dollars that we will invest in AI infrastructure over the long-term\u2026 We \u2019 re planning to fund all of this by, at the same time, investing aggressively in initiatives that use these AI advances to increase revenue growth, and we \u2019 ve put together a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years. That \u2019 s what a lot of our new headcount growth is going towards. \u201d\n\nLater, he added in response to a question about whether the emergence of DeepSeek changed the outlook for capex:\n\n\u201c And I continue to think that investing very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time. It \u2019 s possible that we \u2019 ll learn otherwise at some point, but I just think it \u2019 s way too early to call that. And at this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to. \u201d\n\nMeta partnered with Broadcom to make custom chips for its AI infrastructure, so Zuckerberg\u2019s undaunted pursuit of AI dominance through greater and greater levels of compute appears to be a boon for this company in particular.\n\nThis, again, is where we go back to Nvidia\u2019s 2026 estimates, which are very high relative to the rest of the industry and every megacap stock. Analysts see earnings growth north of 100% for Nvidia this year, with that expanding by a further 50% next year. Meanwhile, Broadcom\u2019s bottom line is projected to be up over 100% this year but a little more than 20% in 2026.\n\nBut the message we got on Wednesday evening is that the multiyear commitment to AI-linked investments was much stronger for a critical Broadcom customer.\n\nSo while Broadcom appears more expensive than Nvidia when you compare the forward price-to-earnings ratio of each stock, I would argue the more relevant story here is that Broadcom\u2019s estimates are too low (or Nvidia\u2019s too high) once we start to expand the time horizon under consideration.",

With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market\u2019s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDuring major crises such as the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced sharp declines but eventually rebounded to new highs. For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience. One of the key factors contributing to the reliability of the US stock market is its breadth and diversity. The market includes a wide array of industries, from technology and health care to consumer goods and energy, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios to reduce risk. Additionally, US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are among the most liquid in the world, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares efficiently. This liquidity and diversification provide a level of stability that is unmatched in many other markets, offering investors confidence in the market\u2019s ability to withstand shocks and recover from volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

Called the Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapter, or Emulex Secure Fibre Channel HBA, the technology encrypts mission-critical data as it travels from server to storage, the company said Wednesday.\n\nPreventing Ransomware Attacks in Data Centers\n\nRansomware is one of the biggest cyberthreats that organizations around the world face. An attacker may infiltrate a victim\u2019s device and hold their data hostage until a ransom is paid.\n\nAccording to a study by the Ponemon Institute, a ransomware attack costs $5.37 million on average in 2024. Experts warn that, with the advent of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, unencrypted data is more at risk from malicious attackers.\n\nThe Emulex Secure Fibre Channel HBA attempts to offer a solution by encrypting the network.\n\nUnlike application encryption, which is another method of cybersecurity, network encryption supports real-time ransomware detection. Network encryption also preserves instead of destroys storage array services such as dedupe and compression.\n\nThe adapter complies with the National Institute of Standards and Technology 800-193 framework and supports the Commercial National Security Algorithm 2 in the United States and the European Union\u2019s Network and Information Security 2 and Digital Operational Resilience Act mandates.\n\n\u201cCustomers are seeking ways to protect themselves against crippling and expensive ransomware attacks as well as complying with new government regulations mandating all data be encrypted,\u201d commented Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager of the Emulex connectivity division at Broadcom. \u201cThe Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter meets these needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that once installed, encrypts all data across all applications.\u201d\n\nThe Emulex 32G and 64G Secure adapters are available in 1, 2 and 4 port configurations.",

Broadcom's security advisory doesn't note any in-the-wild exploits, yet.\n\nWe note that exploitation requires authorized access to vulnerable deployments, so if these are successfully abused in the wild, it'll most likely be through compromised or rogue accounts.\n\nThe CVEs affect Aria Operations, used for managing IT operations across different environments, and Aria Operations for Logs, which is a tool for storing and analyzing log data. Both are pieces of VMware Cloud Foundation, meaning the bugs also affect versions 4.x and 5.x of the hybrid cloud platform.\n\nSpecifically: Four of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-22218, CVE-2025-22219, CVE-2025-22220, and CVE-2025-22221) affect VMware Aria Operations for Logs versions 8 and newer, and one (CVE-2025-22222) affects the same versions of VMware Aria Operations. Updating both products to v8.18.3 will fix the issue. VMware Cloud Foundation users can follow KB92148 to apply the necessary fixes.\n\nThe most severe of the bunch is CVE-2025-22218, an 8.5-rated information disclosure vulnerability in VMware Aria Operations for Logs.\n\n\"A malicious actor with View Only Admin permissions may be able to read the credentials of a VMware product integrated with VMware Aria Operations for Logs,\" according to the security alert.\n\nThe single bug affecting VMware Aria Operations, CVE-2025-22222, is also an information disclosure vulnerability and it received a 7.7 CVSS severity rating.\n\nSomeone with non-admin privileges can exploit this bug and steal credentials for an outbound plugin so long as they have \u2014 or have stolen \u2014 a valid service credential ID.\n\nThe flaws fixed today in VMware Aria Operations for Logs also include two stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: CVE-2025-22219 and CVE-2025-22221, which received a 6.8 and 5.2 CVSS rating, respectively.\n\nBoth can be abused to inject malicious scripts into the application, which is then executed in the victim's browser. CVE-2025-22219 doesn't require administrative privileges to exploit and may lead to arbitrary operations as an admin-level user.\n\nAn attacker does, however, need admin privileges to abuse CVE-2025-22221. But if they do, they can inject a malicious script to be executed in a victim's browser when performing a delete action in the agent configuration.\n\nAnd finally, there's a 4.3-rated privilege-escalation vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-22220. This one allows a user with network access to Aria Operations for Logs API to perform certain operations that would otherwise require administrative privileges.\n\nBroadcom credited Maxime Escourbiac from Michelin CERT, and Yassine Bengana and Quentin Ebel from Abicom for spotting and disclosing the five vulnerabilities.\n\nBoth nation-state snoops and financially motivated criminals alike love exploiting VMware bugs because of the virtualization software's ubiquitous use across major enterprises and governments. Given this history as a prime target, it's perhaps a good idea to put these patches on the near-term todo list even if they are fairly heavily caveated. \u00ae",

Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction.

The changes implemented by Broadcom have left many organizations at a crossroads, facing difficult decisions about their IT infrastructure.\n\nArs Technica spoke with an IT vendor manager from a global food manufacturing company with approximately 5,500 employees. The manager, who requested anonymity due to privacy concerns, has been using VMware's vSphere since the early 2000s. \"We love it,\" the manager told Ars Technica. \"It's hard for us to figure out how we can live without it, but we're going to.\"\n\nThe food manufacturer relies heavily on VMware, with about 300 virtual machines and every company application running on top of VMware. However, their five-year enterprise agreement expired in December, leaving them ineligible for VMware support unless they purchase a subscription. The IT manager revealed that costs associated with running vSphere are set to increase fourfold, largely due to Broadcom bundling unwanted VMware products together. \"They wouldn't sell us what we need,\" the manager explained.\n\nThe issue of support and pricing is not unique to this company. Martin Biggs, VP and managing director of strategic initiatives and EMEA at Spinnaker, a company now offering software maintenance support for VMware, told Ars Technica that organizations are reporting price increases of three to six times on average. The largest price hike Spinnaker has encountered is a reported twentyfold increase.\n\nWhile Broadcom has started offering some discounts \u2013 reducing price increases from seven- or eightfold to three- or fourfold in some cases \u2013 concerns persist. Michael Warrilow, a Gartner VP analyst, told The Register that Broadcom may raise VMware prices even further in the future. He also highlighted Broadcom's preference for two- or three-year subscriptions, which could leave customers facing even steeper costs sooner than anticipated.\n\nRecent reports and discussions on Reddit suggest that customers are being pressured into three-year VMware subscriptions.\n\nSupport has become a critical issue for many customers. The food manufacturer's IT manager reported that after Broadcom's acquisition, they were no longer able to contact VMware directly for support. Instead, they were directed to IT distributor Ingram Micro, with response times stretching to a week or longer. This change came after Broadcom informed the company it wasn't large enough to receive direct support.\n\nMigrating away from VMware is not the easy option as it has many challenges. A January Gartner research note estimated that large-scale migrations, involving 2,000 or more VMs, could take 18 to 48 months. Even for midsize enterprises, untangling dependencies on VMware's server virtualization platform could take at least two years.\n\nFor the food manufacturer, the biggest hurdle in moving away from VMware is internal rather than technical. \"We just don't have enough internal resources and timing,\" the manager told Ars Technica. \"That's what I'm worried about. This is going to take a lot of time internally to go through this whole process, and we're shorthanded as it is. It's such a big, heavy lift for us, and we're also very risk averse, so swapping out that piece of technology in our infrastructure is risky.\"\n\nThe executive added: \"We loved VMware. And then when Broadcom bought 'em, we hated 'em.\"\n\nIn response to these complaints, Broadcom directed inquiries to a blog post by CEO Hock Tan outlining the company's VMware strategy. In the post, Tan claimed that Broadcom is \"flexible and open\" regarding subscriptions, stating, \"Customers have choice when deciding the length of their subscriptions, whether they purchase directly from us at Broadcom or through channel partners. Either way, we will structure contract durations in alignment with our customers' journeys.\"\n\nHowever, despite Broadcom's assurances, a VMware customer contacted by Ars Technica confirmed the claims made in recent Reddit posts about being pressured into three-year commitments.",

Still, the implications for the semiconductor space are clear. While \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s contributions are noteworthy,\u201d they don\u2019t represent a drastic change in course for the industry.\n\nHowever, they do accelerate AI capex investments, especially in \u201cAI compute TAM toward $500bn+\u201d over the next several years.\n\nFor Nvidia, Broadcom and Marvell, the timing couldn't be better.\n\nThese companies are already in a prime position, supplying essential hardware for AI infrastructure. Arya maintains a Buy rating on all three, emphasizing that the \u201crising tide should benefit all\u201d as the AI compute market expands significantly.\n\nRead Also: EXCLUSIVE: Nvidia Hardest Hit Among Mag 7 Stocks By DeepSeek, Poll Shows \u2014 And This Stock Ranked Second\n\nThe Role of Hyperscalers, AI Hardware\n\nOne of the core insights Arya highlights is that the U.S. hyperscalers (tech giants like Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Alphabet Inc\u2018s GOOGL GOOG Google, and Microsoft Corp MSFT will continue to drive much of the AI spending in the coming years. These companies will push toward \u201cartificial general intelligence (AGI)\u201d and broader enterprise use cases. The key to their success will be investing not only in \u201csoftware\u201d but also in \u201cadvanced hardware.\u201d\n\nThis is where Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell come in, offering both the hardware capabilities and adaptability to meet the ever-evolving needs of AI workloads.\n\nArya forecasts the total AI compute market to \u201cdouble towards $500bn+\u201d by 2028, a growth driven by the need for large-scale model training, AI inference, and cloud infrastructure upgrades. As the race for AI dominance continues, \u201cU.S. hyperscalers\u201d will remain at the forefront, driving the bulk of this spending.\n\n\u2018Rising Tide Should Benefit All\u2019\n\nNvidia, Broadcom and Marvell are all expected to benefit from this surge in demand. With DeepSeek\u2019s AI software optimization now part of the broader landscape, it's clear that the hardware side of the equation \u2014 \u201cASIC versus general purpose GPU\u201d \u2014 will continue to evolve.\n\nCustom ASICs (like those from Broadcom and Marvell) offer cost efficiencies, but \u201cmerchant GPU (NVDA) could prove more adaptable to rapidly changing compute and model mix.\u201d\n\nFor investors, the message is clear: These companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing AI infrastructure market. With AI compute TAM expected to rise to \u201c$500bn+\u201d, BofA sees the current downturn in the sector as an \u201cenhanced Buy opportunity.\u201d\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) today announced an industry-first \u2014 the new, innovative Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBA) \u2014 a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage.\n\nEncrypting mission-critical data is no longer a nice-to-have, but a must-have. The cost of ransomware attacks continues to rise with attacks in 2024 costing USD $5.37 million1 on average per attack. Upcoming generative AI and quantum computers magnify the risk if data is not encrypted at all points in the data center including the network.\n\nTo address these cybersecurity issues, governments have responded with mandates, including the United States\u2019 Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0, the European Union\u2019s Network and Information Security (NIS) 2, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and more that require enterprises to modernize their IT infrastructures with post-quantum cryptographic encryption algorithms and zero trust architecture.\n\nToday, data centers have the option of deploying application encryption or network encryption to protect their data. Network encryption offers several important advantages versus application-based encryption including preserving storage array services such as dedupe and compression, which is destroyed when using application-based encryption. Network encryption also enables real-time ransomware detection while application-based encryption hides ransomware attacks. Additional highlights of this solution include no encryption performance penalty and simple, session-based key management.\n\n\u201cCustomers are seeking ways to protect themselves against crippling and expensive ransomware attacks as well as complying with new government regulations mandating all data be encrypted,\u201d said Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager, Emulex Connectivity Division, Broadcom. \u201cThe Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter meets these needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that once installed, encrypts all data across all applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs enterprises face an ever-growing wave of cybersecurity threats, the Emulex Secure HBA stands out as a simple drop-in solution that enhances SAN security without compromising performance,\u201d said Brian Beeler, president, StorageReview.com. \u201cIn our testing, we found these HBAs excelled at securing in-flight SAN data encryption while seamlessly complementing existing security technologies. We\u2019re excited to see these adapters become a standard layer of improved SAN security in 2025, providing enterprises with an essential tool to safeguard their critical data.\u201d\n\nEmulex Secure HBAs Feature:\n\nSecurity Built on Zero Trust, Post-Quantum Cryptography Encryption algorithms support CNSA 2.0, DORA and NIS2 mandates. Secures data in-flight between host servers and storage arrays. Zero Trust platform with Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM). cryptographic authentication of endpoints, and silicon root-of-trust authentication. Compliance with the NIST 800-193 framework \u2014 secure boot, digitally signed drivers, T10-DIF, and more.\n\nCost effective encryption: Dedupe/compression storage services remain intact; protects all data across all applications versus application-specific solutions.\n\nRuns on existing Fibre Channel infrastructure.\n\nMaximum application performance: Cryptography offloaded to hardware, providing encryption with no performance impact.\n\nEasy to manage and deploy: Simple session-based key management with on-demand key generation; transparent runs with existing operating systems, applications and SAN management tools.\n\n\n\nEmulex 32G and 64G Secure HBAs are available in 1, 2, and 4 port configurations and are shipping now.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC discussed the reasons behind the recent market declines after the ISM Services Index data. Cramer said many are still expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve soon but they are wrong.\n\n\u201cThis survey showed surprising strength, so much strength that it makes you think that the FED might not give us more rate cuts anytime soon. Right now, a ton of investors believe that the FED needs to push through a bunch of rate cuts in order to revive the economy. Lots of those bulls are counting on those cuts. That seems wrong today. They were rocked to the core because not only have they been wrong, but they\u2019re starting to question the FED\u2019s credibility. They know nothing,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nCramer said he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the Fed\u2019s rate cuts amid strong economic data.\n\n\u201cThese traders are wondering why the heck the FED cut short rates by 50 basis points September then give another 25 in November another 25 in December what the heck did they see that made them so aggressive judging by the data. Nothing. The credibility issue, if you claim you\u2019re data dependent, and the data is strong then why the heck are you cutting so aggressively.\u201d\n\nCramer at the time said the latest nonfarm payrolls report would be one of the most important indicators of the economy and it would set the \u201cdialog\u201d in the coming days. Sure it will. The latest jobs data showed unemployment fell and job additions crushed Wall Street expectations. Many now believe the Fed is set to put brakes on rate cuts.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer recently talked about.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) today announced an industry-first \u2014 the new, innovative Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBA) \u2014 a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage.\n\nEncrypting mission-critical data is no longer a nice-to-have, but a must-have. The cost of ransomware attacks continues to rise with attacks in 2024 costing USD $5.37 million 1 on average per attack. Upcoming generative AI and quantum computers magnify the risk if data is not encrypted at all points in the data center including the network.\n\nTo address these cybersecurity issues, governments have responded with mandates, including the United States\u2019 Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0, the European Union\u2019s Network and Information Security (NIS) 2, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and more that require enterprises to modernize their IT infrastructures with post-quantum cryptographic encryption algorithms and zero trust architecture.\n\nToday, data centers have the option of deploying application encryption or network encryption to protect their data. Network encryption offers several important advantages versus application-based encryption including preserving storage array services such as dedupe and compression, which is destroyed when using application-based encryption. Network encryption also enables real-time ransomware detection while application-based encryption hides ransomware attacks. Additional highlights of this solution include no encryption performance penalty and simple, session-based key management.\n\n\u201cCustomers are seeking ways to protect themselves against crippling and expensive ransomware attacks as well as complying with new government regulations mandating all data be encrypted,\u201d said Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager, Emulex Connectivity Division, Broadcom. \u201cThe Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter meets these needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that once installed, encrypts all data across all applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs enterprises face an ever-growing wave of cybersecurity threats, the Emulex Secure HBA stands out as a simple drop-in solution that enhances SAN security without compromising performance,\u201d said Brian Beeler, president, StorageReview.com. \u201cIn our testing, we found these HBAs excelled at securing in-flight SAN data encryption while seamlessly complementing existing security technologies. We\u2019re excited to see these adapters become a standard layer of improved SAN security in 2025, providing enterprises with an essential tool to safeguard their critical data.\u201d\n\nEmulex Secure HBAs Feature:\n\nSecurity Built on Zero Trust, Post-Quantum Cryptography Encryption algorithms support CNSA 2.0, DORA and NIS2 mandates. Secures data in-flight between host servers and storage arrays. Zero Trust platform with Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM). cryptographic authentication of endpoints, and silicon root-of-trust authentication. Compliance with the NIST 800-193 framework \u2014 secure boot, digitally signed drivers, T10-DIF, and more.\n\nCost effective encryption: Dedupe/compression storage services remain intact; protects all data across all applications versus application-specific solutions.\n\nRuns on existing Fibre Channel infrastructure.\n\nMaximum application performance: Cryptography offloaded to hardware, providing encryption with no performance impact.\n\nEasy to manage and deploy: Simple session-based key management with on-demand key generation; transparent runs with existing operating systems, applications and SAN management tools.\n\n\n\nEmulex 32G and 64G Secure HBAs are available in 1, 2, and 4 port configurations and are shipping now.

            "content": "Opinion With Broadcom putting the bite on VMware customers with more abandon than Dracula in a blood bank, one has to wonder. Why hang around? Why better bled than fled?\n\nPlenty of other enterprise-class VM options are available. Is it Stockholm syndrome? Has Broadcom given the head of marketing job to the Hypnotoad? Is it that clause in the contract which says \"Open your wallet and repeat after me: help yourself?\" Not a bit of it, says tech analyst Gartner, in a report on VMware's institutional stickiness, sending one of its VP analysts to explain it further.\n\nVMware users gripe over 3-year commitment to renew licenses READ MORE\n\nEveryone is asking what everyone else is doing, he says, which is the Gartner motto, vision statement, and core line of business \u2013 all in eight words. It follows this up with the insight that new owner Broadcom isn't really selling virtualization with VMware. Rather, it is a network, storage and management tool vendor, with VMs at the bottom of the value stack.\n\nThe result? You can't think of migrating until you spend a lot of person-months scoping out what you're actually using, because you just don't know now your network, storage and management tools are set up otherwise. This may come as a bit of a surprise to those who have to regularly renegotiate licensing with Broadcom, a process normally involving knowing what you're paying for and why. That thing called Return On Investment. Efficient infrastructure support for your business, avoiding nasty software audit surprises, little things like these.\n\nHear the man out, though. Once you've worked out what you've been paying for all these years and why, you'll have to do a technical evaluation of your potential alternative. This can take longer if things are more complex \u2013 the sort of insight money can't buy, although Gartner will be happy to sell you some anyway. To be fair to the analyst, the world is still full of botched migrations so there's still a need to keep repeating the starkly obvious. Even with order-of-ten error bars like \"Each VM will cost between $300 and $3,000 to migrate,\" that has to be worth something.\n\nThe serious takeaways of the Gartner report have little to do with the mechanics of escaping an iniquitous new overlord. Sleepwalking into a lock-in because of vendor insinuation is on you, and if you don't already know how much of your corporate soul is in hock to Broadcom, then your problem isn't being unable to plan an escape. It's that your picture of your infrastructure is too fuzzy to plan or test security, disaster recovery, or indeed any unexpected change that vendors, employees or customers suddenly need.\n\nLikewise, the time to start technical evaluation of alternatives is sometime before you think they may be needed. If you're the sort of enterprise Gartner's aiming this report at, with a hundred plus servers running a multiplicity of services and a complex heterogeneous fabric, you need to have someone on look-out duties. Evaluating future options can be part of a job description, or identify the team member with the home lab server cluster and shamelessly flatter them. Better yet, give them a small toys budget. RoI will be off the scale.\n\nIn short, if you don't have a high awareness of how things are working and how the industry's moving, you will be blindsided again and again. Get it right, and you'll need Gartner reports like a statue needs toilet paper.\n\nThis doesn't fix the corporate timidity implicit in \"everyone's asking what everyone else is doing, so nobody does anything.\" Seen as risk analysis, where a working system is worth extra expenditure because the risk of it going wrong is much less than with a migration to a novel solution. Doing nothing is always easier than giving yourself work that could backfire, and good luck spotting where that motivation influences the risk equation.\n\nThis is why Microsoft is Microsoft, and why Broadcom's strategy is to join the club of too expensive to escape, too big to care. The fix isn't for individual organizations to be extra brave, but for lots of orgs to recognize their common issues and work together, along more enlightened vendors, in creating a common framework for enterprise virtualization aimed exactly at defanging the Broadcom vampire bat. Sharing risk is hugely powerful, it's how insurance supports the mercantile and financial world machines, and it can be extraordinarily robust.\n\nA hundred companies cooperating on tech evaluations of a Broadcom competitor would cost none of them any more than if they all did it behind closed doors. The risk of something important going unspotted, though, is massively reduced, and the motivation to fix or enhance components to solve problems massively increased. Instead of asking everyone else what they're doing, ask everyone else what they need to do.\n\nYeah, sharing projects across organizations and being open about it could never work, it'd be like some sort of cancer. Right? Wrong.\n\nIf it did work, though, the idea of using an essentially vendor-neutral technology like virtualization to suck the blood out of the entire stack, well, that would be gone. Everyone would benefit \u2013 well, almost. There may be some bats going hungry. Perhaps Gartner could write a report on that. \u00ae",

The devices feature:\n\nEncryption algorithms support CNSA 2.0, DORA, and NIS2 mandates.\n\nZero trust platform with Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM), cryptographic authentication of endpoints, and silicon root-of-trust authentication.\n\nCompliance with the NIST 800-193 framework \u2013 secure boot, digitally signed drivers, T10-DIF, and more.\n\nDedupe/compression storage services remain intact.\n\nRuns on existing Fiber Channel infrastructure.\n\nCryptography offloaded to hardware, providing encryption with no performance impact.\n\nSimple session-based key management with on-demand key generation; transparent and compatible with existing operating systems, applications, and SAN management tools.\n\nHBA manufacturers apart from Broadcom include ATTO, Cisco, and Marvell. Cisco supplies encrypting MDS 9000 series SAN switches, which apply the Fiber Channel Security Protocol (FC-SP) between switches, but not between the HBA and the switch.\n\nBroadcom Emulex diagram\n\nThe FC-SP is not inherently resistant to post-quantum attacks.\n\nMarvell QLogic 2780 series 32 Gbps HBAs feature StorCryption to encrypt data in flight between initiator and target endpoints across a Fiber Channel SAN.

            "content": "Broadcom-VMware Partner Winners And Losers In 2025: Comdivision CEO VMware channel expert and comdivision CEO Yves Sandfort discusses Broadcom\u2019s 2025 channel strategy and what type of partners will come out on top while others might be left by the wayside.\n\nYves Sandfort has been driving VMware solutions for over two decades, owning a wealth of knowledge about Broadcom-VMware\u2019s current and future channel vision as Broadcom unleashes its 2025 partner strategy. \u201cI\u2019m not sure by the end of this year, the amount of [Broadcom-VMware] partners are going to be the same. That\u2019s the only part where I would expect it's going to likely dramatically shrink,\u201d said Sandfort, CEO and founder of comdivision, in an interview with CRN. \u201cPartners need to prove to Broadcom that it makes sense to work with them. That's my personal advice to every partner I speak with is, \u2018You need to prove that there is a reason why Broadcom needs to continue to work with you, not the other way,\u2019\u201d he said. Comdivision is one of Broadcom-VMware\u2019s top partners in Europe with a vast history inside VMware\u2019s partner ecosystem for over 20 years. The Germany-based solution provider was the first partner in the world to be awarded all of VMware\u2019s Master Services competencies. San Jose, Calif.-based Broadcom has seen its stock surge 77 percent over the past year, with a market cap now of more than $1 trillion. [Related: Broadcom Names New Channel Chief, Sales Leader: 5 Big Things To Know] Sandfort said partners need to adapt to Broadcom\u2019s 2025 channel charge which revolves around driving professional services targeting global customers, incentives for partners providing value-add services, and becoming stickier with Broadcom-VMware bundles. \u201cBroadcom wants to hand off level one and level two support to the partners. Broadcom does not want to have a massive PS [professional services] organization. This means you need to have a very, very strong partner-base which can focus on these additional services so they can actually bring the professional services and do the support,\u201d he said. However, Broadcom-VMware partners who are focused on reselling or have an SMB customer base might be in some trouble ahead. \u201cPartners who are more in the mid-range scenario, not necessarily focused on VCF and everything else\u2014they might potentially get into more difficult times because that\u2019s clearly not Broadcom\u2019s focus anymore,\u201d comdivision\u2019s CEO said. \u201cThey are looking into partners who can actually traverse small vSphere customers into VCF [VMware Cloud Foundation] customers or, to be realistic, get rid of them.\u201d In an interview with CRN, Sandfort talks about his company\u2019s biggest bets in 2025, Broadcom-VMware\u2019s channel strategy and the hiring of Broadcom\u2019s new global channel chief Brian Moats. \u201cBrian\u2019s strategy is a total win for us,\u201d Sandfort said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a total win for other partners who also have the same skill sets we have.\u201d\n\nHow do you feel about Broadcom\u2019s new global channel chief Brian Moats (pictured)? What does his hiring say to Broadcom-VMware\u2019s channel? Hiring someone internally within Broadcom is nothing new. They look at their own people before they take someone else from another company. \u2026. I'm expecting that he has a very good chance to actually make an impact, but my feeling is also he has a lot of pressure. It basically fits to the model [Broadcom CEO] Hock [Tan] has said during conferences, but also in direct meetings, which is: he\u2019s looking for partners who really bring more valued solutions to the market. Hock has been far more clear with this than many other vendors. I\u2019ve heard Broadcom very clearly saying multiple times, \u2018Worst case, we will give up any volume reseller over someone who\u2019s going to provide value.\u2019 I even asked, \u2018Does this mean you are going to basically cut off someone who is actually making $1 billion in revenue with you?\u2019 The feedback was very clearly, \u2018Yes, because if someone is just a volume reseller, it's not providing the value we need in the Broadcom model.\u2019\n\nHow do you think Broadcom\u2019s 2025 channel strategy with Moats at the helm affects the broader Broadcom-VMware partner community? Seeing that Moats comes from Broadcom\u2019s global system integrator (GSIs) side, the big question is going to be: how many partners does he really envision (Broadcom-VMware) having? So the question is, besides the GSIs, how many more partners are they really going to have and how many more are they going to work with? It\u2019s perfect for us because we\u2019re global. I\u2019m not sure by the end of this year, the amount of partners is going to be the same. That\u2019s the only part where I would expect it's going to likely dramatically shrink. Partners need to prove to Broadcom that it makes sense to work with them. That's my personal advice to every partner I speak with is: you need to prove that there is a reason why Broadcom needs to continue to work with you, not the other way. Because there is a huge market out there and in a few years\u2019 time, that market is going to be spread across a much smaller amount of partners. This means, as a partner, make good money with them.\n\nWhat is Broadcom-VMware\u2019s future for the channel? What do they want partners doing in 2025? Broadcom wants to hand off level one and level two support to the partners. Broadcom does not want to have a massive PS [professional services] organization. This means you need to have a very, very strong partner base, which can actually focus on these additional services so they can actually bring the professional services and do the support. In reality, no partner wants another partner to do the support and integration for them. They accept the fact that sometimes the vendor does PS, but when you look at Broadcom\u2019s statement that they don't want to do that much PS by themselves anymore, then [Moats strategy] is just a logical consequence. For us, his message is perfect because we are one of the rare partners in the Broadcom ecosystem who is already global. We are already set up in three continents and have a strong partnership in Asia-PAC, so we could actually balance it out to four continents. So for us, this actually makes sense because more customers are global. As global customers still need local services, you need to have partners which can deliver these services in different locations around the globe. If I\u2019m working with a U.S. government agency, I don\u2019t have to do the sale, which can be done by Broadcom\u2019s strategic sales team because they are perfect at that. I can later on just come in and deliver the services. And to be realistic, I\u2019m not even necessarily keen on these very large yields to even deliver the licenses because we are talking about 1 percent margins in the first place. That is not very attractive. So giving the PS back to the partners makes sense.\n\nWhat type of partners might be in trouble in 2025? Partners who are more in the mid-range scenario, not necessarily focused on VCF and everything else\u2014they might potentially get into more difficult times because that\u2019s clearly not Broadcom\u2019s focus anymore. They are still happy to sell these products, but it\u2019s not their focus. They are looking into partners who can actually traverse small vSphere customers into VCF [VMware Cloud Foundation] customers or, to be realistic, get rid of them. Nothing in the current program says, like, \u2018Let\u2019s foster these very small customers.\u2019 Everything says, \u2018Either upsell from that or make sure that we don\u2019t have that problem anymore. This is potentially fine because a hypervisor by itself is just commodity. Hock\u2019s very clear statement to the market is, \u2018You are going to lead with the full package.\u2019 Now you have someone saying, \u2018Here's the full package. You're going to pay for it, no matter whether you use it or not. And I'm going to play more or less, let's say, the Microsoft game in constantly reminding you that you already have the full package from me. You don't need the other vendors anymore.\u2019 I totally understand why this is a lot easier for the services partners, because for us, we don't have that many different vendors we have to worry about. We can actually strongly focus on one specific solution. But on the other side, I also see why it's more difficult for more resell-focused partners. Because the margins if you just resell Broadcom, the margins by itself, you can only make them attractive if you sell the services and everything else around. The whole discussion is like, \u2018As a partner for the long term, you will not be able to just be resell. You need to provide the services. You need to build solutions around this.\u2019 Again, none of this is new.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect.\n\nMarkets were in turmoil after Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced a low-cost AI model over the weekend. DeepSeek is set to disrupt the AI industry, having developed the technology using a fraction of the resources used by competitors in the US. It is a direct challenge to rivals like OpenAI, Google and Meta, whose valuations now come under scrutiny. DeepSeek also reduces the usage of chips and energy. Investors are now keen on understanding what a justified valuation of chip manufacturers would be after accounting for a more efficient technology that is expected to curb demand for huge data centers that run on extremely expensive chips. DeepSeek has already gained popularity since its launch, occupying a top position in the Apple Store.\n\nThe NASDAQ is down almost 3%, with cumulative losses for the top 10 losers reaching $965 billion. Chipmakers lost the most value followed by big tech companies. Even firms supplying electricity have been reeling after this announcement. Big players like Meta and Microsoft are monitoring the development closely and are expected to bring changes to their software after DeepSeek\u2019s foray into AI.\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article we have picked a list of 10 stocks that have witnessed the highest erosion in value due to the DeepSeek effect. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Feeling the Heat from The DeepSeek AI Effect?\n\nA technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leading chip manufacturer witnessed the second-largest loss in value after the share price dropped by 17%. Investors lost around $200 billion in this stock as chip stocks faced one of the highest impacts from the latest development.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "Broadcom's ownership of VMware has discouraged many of its customers, as companies are displeased with how the trillion-dollar firm has run the virtualization business since buying it in November 2023. Many have discussed reducing or eliminating ties with the company.\n\nNow, over a year after the acquisition, the pressure is on for customers to start committing to a VMware subscription, forego VMware support, or move on from VMware technologies. The decision is complex, with long-term implications no matter which way a customer goes.\n\nArs Technica spoke with an IT vendor manager who has been using VMware's vSphere since the early 2000s. The employee, who works for a global food manufacturing firm with about 5,500 employees, asked to keep their name and company anonymous due to privacy concerns for the business.\n\n\"We love it. ... It's hard for us to figure out how we can live without it, but we're going to,\" the IT manager said.\n\nThe food manufacturer has about 300 VMware virtual machines (VMs), and every company application runs on top of VMware. Its five-year enterprise agreement with VMware expired in December, making the manufacturer ineligible for VMware support unless it buys a VMware subscription. The company started exploring virtualization alternatives this summer because costs associated with running vSphere are set to rise fourfold, according to the IT manager. As with other VMware customers, the price increases are largely due to Broadcom bundling unwanted VMware products together.\n\n\"They wouldn't sell us what we need,\" the IT manager said.\n\nWhile it looks for a new platform, the manufacturer is relying on support from Spinnaker, which started offering software maintenance support for VMware following Broadcom\u2019s acquisition. In an example of how widespread VMware support concerns are, Spinnaker\u2019s VMware support business has had more leads than any of Spinnaker's other support businesses, including for Oracle or SAP, said Martin Biggs, Spinnaker\u2019s VP and managing director of strategic initiatives and EMEA.",

            "content": "Unexpected results from an AI upstart have sent these stocks reeling.\n\nOne of the biggest market drivers of technology stocks over the past couple of years has been rapid advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). These next-generation algorithms took a giant leap forward from their predecessors, promising to streamline processes and improve productivity. Many big tech companies have been spending heavily to get a jump on the technology.\n\nBut a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek may have just upended conventional thinking about how best to train AI models. As a result, a slew of AI stocks tumbled on Monday. AI-centric chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -0.46%) crashed 17.3%, semiconductor specialist Broadcom (AVGO -1.93%) crumbled 16.4%, cloud and software giant Microsoft (MSFT -1.18%) slumped 3.8%, and cloud computing and search titan Alphabet (GOOGL -2.58%) (GOOG -2.55%) fell 2.8%, as of 11:43 a.m. ET.\n\nEnter DeepSeek\n\nOne-year-old Chinese start-up DeepSeek introduced its latest AI model, dubbed R1, and its abilities caught many in the tech world off guard. The performance of the system, which is similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, quickly ascended the ranks to become one of the top 10 in the world. What made these results even more striking was that they were achieved with older-generation processors at a much lower cost, according to the company.\n\nDeepSeek achieved these remarkable results by taking a new approach to training its AI models. The process, known as reinforcement learning -- or reward-driven optimization -- appears to be more adept at refining its strategy for problem-solving or attempting different approaches to achieve the desired results.\n\nThus far, one of the biggest challenges with AI is not knowing how the algorithms arrived at a particular conclusion, making them a \"black box.\" DeepSeek's R1 model shows its work, thus eliminating the uncertainty.\n\nVenture capitalist and well-known tech aficionado Marc Andreessen fueled the fire this weekend when he posted on X (formerly Twitter) that \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen -- and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"\n\nTo be clear, experts say that DeepSeek's R1 still trails the performance capability of models produced by OpenAI and Alphabet, but the fact that it was able to do so with a smaller number of inferior chips threatened to upend the existing paradigm.\n\nThe potential implications\n\nAI stocks and the broader tech sector plunged on the news, reeling from the potential implications for the industry:\n\nNvidia is the gold standard and leading provider of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run AI systems. The company is believed to control as much as 98% of the data center GPU market, according to semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights. If AI models can be trained on lower-cost, inferior chips, Nvidia has a lot to lose.\n\nBroadcom supplies many of the networking products that work side-by-side with chips in the data center. The company's Ethernet switching and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) help facilitate the movement of data. If demand for these high-end chips falters, sales of ancillary products -- like those in Broadcom's arsenal -- could suffer as well.\n\nMicrosoft helped kick-start the AI revolution with its hefty $13 billion investment in OpenAI and by integrating its AI capabilities across its suite of products and services. The company recently announced plans to spend $80 billion on data centers over the coming year. If there's a more cost-effective approach, customers might not be as willing to fork over top dollar for Microsoft's solutions.\n\nAlphabet was another company that was quick off the mark, spending heavily to develop next-generation AI models for its Google Cloud customers. Like Microsoft, if there are less costly alternatives, Alphabet's results could suffer.\n\nThat said, veteran Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives called today's sell-off a \"golden buying opportunity,\" noting that many of the claims by the start-up have yet to be verified. He goes on to suggest that \"no U.S. Global 2000 [company] is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure,\" saying it doesn't rise to the level of \"competitive threat.\"\n\nFurther fueling the decline of some of these stocks is their higher valuations, at least when measured using the most commonly employed metrics. Heading into today's trading, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Microsoft were selling for 200 times, 56 times, and 37 times earnings, respectively. Alphabet was the outlier, selling for a discount at 27 times earnings.\n\nIt's important to note that while the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is among the most widely used valuation metric, it tends to fall short when assessing high-growth stocks. After today's decline, Nvidia, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Alphabet are selling for 41 times, 33 times, 33 times, and 22 times forward earnings -- so they're not nearly as expensive as they might appear at first glance.\n\nFinally, it's still early days in the development of generative AI. Today is a prime example of a knee-jerk reaction from some investors when a more measured approach is called for. Each of our quartet of stocks has an impressive track record going back decades, and while it may be tempting to follow the crowd and give in to the market panic, astute investors will know to wait for all the evidence to come in before leaping to what could be a costly conclusion.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.\n\nMarket Outlook 2025\n\nOn December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year\u2019s outcome for the country and globally.\n\nThe report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues.\n\nLakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\n10-Year Revenue Growth: 28.30%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a major global technology company that specializes in creating and providing a wide variety of semiconductors and software solutions. The company focuses on creating custom silicon chips that are essential for hyperscale data centers, thereby making it a significant player in the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nThe stock railed by more than 97% last year on the back of tailwinds from artificial intelligence. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) generated $14.05 billion in revenue up 51% year-over-year. Growth was driven by increased demand for its AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking solutions as AI revenue for the same quarter went up by 220% year-over-year. Moreover, the acquisition of VMware has been pivotal for Broadcom, enhancing its capabilities in virtualization and cloud management. Management noted that its infrastructure software revenue grew to $21.5 billion during fiscal 2024, driven by the acquisition.\n\nOn January 23, Vijay Rakesh analyst at Mizuho raised his price target on the stock from $245 to $260, while keeping a Buy rating on AVGO. The analyst noted Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to be one of his top picks for 2025 as he believes the company will continue to gain strength from its demand for AI custom silicon chips.\n\nMunro Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed 94bps to Fund performance for the quarter. Broadcom is a fabless semiconductor company that designs semiconductors for a range of different industries and applications, based in Palo Alto, California. The company plays an important role in providing semiconductors for AI, specifically, they provide hyperscale data centre companies custom silicon chips. Over time, as companies such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft build out their AI offering, the critical semiconductor content will come from both custom silicon chips, designed by companies such as Broadcom, and merchant silicon chips, designed by Nvidia. Depending on the use case, or workload, the hyperscaler will use either a custom silicon semiconductor or a merchant silicon semiconductor. Therefore, over time we expect AI processes to be driven by both Nvidia designed chips and custom designed chips from Broadcom and its peers. On their recent earnings call, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan confirmed that the company\u2019s customers are rapidly pursuing the development of a 1 million XPU cluster of chips. To translate what this means for Broadcom, Hock laid out the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) opportunity for the company\u2019s AI revenues over the next 3 years to 2027. In 2024, Hock noted that Broadcom\u2019s SAM was $15-20bn USD, of which the company commanded an approximate 70% share. In 2027, that SAM is expected to grow to $60-90bn USD, and assuming Broadcom captures an approximate 60% share, this gives rise to $50bn USD of AI revenue opportunity for the company over the next 3 years. For the company overall, this means that revenue has the potential to double over the next 3 years. We believe the technology road map outlined by Broadcom and the resulting revenue opportunity gives rise to a multi-year runway of earnings growth backed by a large structural change.\u201d\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 6th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"",

            "content": "Analyzing Broadcom\u2019s Financial Health Amidst Rising Stock Prices\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has experienced a notable surge in its stock value, climbing a remarkable 41% within just three months. To understand this phenomenon, it is essential to delve into the company\u2019s financial fundamentals, particularly its Return on Equity (ROE).\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE) serves as a vital indicator of how well a company utilizes shareholder investments to generate profits. Calculating Broadcom\u2019s ROE reveals a figure of 9.1%, derived from its $6.2 billion net profit relative to $68 billion in shareholders\u2019 equity. This suggests that for every dollar invested, Broadcom generates approximately $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhile this ROE seems underwhelming compared to the industry average of 11%, Broadcom boasts a impressive 26% growth in net income over the past five years, surpassing the 20% average growth of its industry peers. This growth may stem from strategic management decisions or a conservative payout ratio, as the company retains only 30% of its profits for reinvestment.\n\nMoreover, analysts predict a decrease in the payout ratio to 37% in the next three years, which could potentially elevate the company\u2019s future ROE to an impressive 43%. Despite the current low retention rate, Broadcom\u2019s strong earnings growth and anticipated improvements in profitability indicate a positive trajectory ahead for the company and its investors.\n\nImplications of Broadcom\u2019s Financial Performance on the Global Landscape\n\nThe recent surge in Broadcom\u2019s stock value not only reflects the company\u2019s robust financial fundamentals but also highlights broader trends impacting the global economy.

While this connectivity fosters global collaboration, it also raises questions about data privacy and the digital divide, as not all populations benefit equally from technological advances.\n\nIn terms of environmental implications, the semiconductor industry faces scrutiny regarding its sustainability practices. The production processes are resource-intensive, raising concerns about energy consumption and e-waste. Broadcom\u2019s commitment to increasing its profit retention could enable greater investment in sustainable practices, potentially positioning it as a leader in environmentally responsible manufacturing.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts project that the momentum in the semiconductor industry will continue, with anticipated year-over-year growth expected to outpace other sectors. This trend underscores the long-term significance of companies like Broadcom in shaping not only technology\u2019s evolution but also the economic landscape, where they will play a pivotal role in addressing both opportunities and challenges that arise in our increasingly interconnected world.\n\nUnpacking Broadcom\u2019s Financial Future: Insights Beyond Stock Trends\n\nAnalyzing Broadcom\u2019s Financial Health Amidst Rising Stock Prices\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a leading American designer and manufacturer of a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, has seen its stock price skyrocket by 41% over the past three months. This notable increase invites a closer examination of the company\u2019s financial health and operational strategies, specifically through metrics like Return on Equity (ROE) and net income growth.\n\nUnderstanding Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nThe Return on Equity (ROE) is a critical financial metric used to evaluate how effectively a company uses shareholder equity to generate profits. Broadcom\u2019s current ROE sits at 9.1%, calculated from a net profit of $6.2 billion against $68 billion in shareholder equity. While this figure is below the industry average of 11%, Broadcom has demonstrated significant resilience with a 26% increase in net income over the past five years, outpacing the average industry growth of 20%.\n\nFuture Growth Projections\n\nLooking forward, analysts forecast a rise in Broadcom\u2019s payout ratio from 30% to 37% within the next three years. This change may further enhance ROE, potentially reaching as high as 43%. Such an increase would indicate that Broadcom is not only managing its finances well but is also positioned for substantial future growth, making it an attractive prospect for investors.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Broadcom\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong Recent Growth: Broadcom has recorded impressive earnings growth of 26% over five years.\n\n\u2013 Potential for Increased ROE: Analysts predict a future ROE increase, indicating enhanced profitability.\n\n\u2013 Diversified Portfolio: Broadcom\u2019s extensive product range serves various sectors, reducing dependence on a single market.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Lower Current ROE: The current ROE is below the industry average, which may concern some investors.\n\n\u2013 Rising Payout Ratio: A shift in payout ratios could have mixed implications for reinvestment and long-term growth.\n\nMarket Analysis and Pricing Trends\n\nBroadcom\u2019s stock price reflects a confident market sentiment, fueled by strategic management decisions and solid performance metrics. Investors have responded enthusiastically, suggesting that the semiconductor industry\u2019s ongoing demand is likely to sustain this momentum.\n\nSecurity and Sustainability Aspects\n\nFrom a security standpoint, Broadcom has been proactive in enhancing its cybersecurity measures amid rising threats to digital infrastructure. The company\u2019s commitment to sustainable practices also plays a pivotal role in its operational ethos, with initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency across its manufacturing processes.\n\nConclusion: A Positive Outlook\n\nBroadcom\u2019s financial and operational strategies indicate a promising future, characterized by robust growth and the potential for elevated returns on equity.

            "content": "Broadcom is still one of the market's best long-term plays on the booming AI market.\n\nMany growth stocks stumbled in 2022 and 2023 as rising interest rates compressed their valuations and drove investors toward more conservative investments. But in 2024, many of those stocks soared as interest rates declined again.\n\nYet that buying frenzy also drove the major indexes to their all-time highs and inflated the valuations of many of the market's top stocks. In this kind of market, many investors might be getting reluctant to add more growth stocks to their portfolios.\n\nThat caution is warranted, but there are still plenty of high-flying tech stocks trading at reasonable valuations. One of those winners is Broadcom (AVGO -1.88%), which still has a bright future after nearly doubling in value over the past 12 months. Here's why Broadcom is still a great place to park a modest $1,000 investment.\n\nUnderstanding Broadcom's business\n\nBack in 2016, the Singapore-based chipmaker Avago acquired the original Broadcom. It inherited its brand, relocated its headquarters to the U.S., and expanded into the infrastructure software market by acquiring CA Technologies in 2018, Symantec's enterprise security unit in 2019, and the cloud software giant VMware in 2023.\n\nThat rapid expansion turned Broadcom into a broadly diversified semiconductor and software maker. Its semiconductor business produces a wide range of chips for the mobile device, data center, networking, wireless, storage, and industrial chip markets.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (which ended in November 2024), Broadcom generated 58% of its revenue from its semiconductor business and the remaining 42% from its infrastructure software business. Its semiconductor business suffered a slowdown in fiscal 2022 and 2023 as the macroeconomic headwinds drove many companies to rein in their IT spending, but it recovered over the past year as it sold more artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented chips for data centers. Its infrastructure software revenue also surged over the past year, but most of that growth was driven by its acquisition of VMware instead of its existing businesses.\n\nRevenue Growth (YOY) Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Semiconductor Solutions segment 3% 4% 6% 5% 12% Infrastructure Software segment 7% 153% 175% 200% 196% Overall 4% 34% 43% 47% 51%\n\nIn fiscal 2024, its revenue jumped 44%, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 37%, and its free cash flow (FCF) grew 10% to $19.4 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 15%.\n\nIts near-term growth will be driven by the AI market\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a compound annual rate of 16% and 20%, respectively. A lot of that growth will likely be fueled by its booming AI business.\n\nBroadcom doesn't sell any powerful AI GPUs like Nvidia, but it sells networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips for data centers. More companies are upgrading their data center infrastructure with its chips to support the latest AI applications. That's why its sales of AI-oriented chips surged 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024 -- which equals 41% of its semiconductor revenue and 24% of its total revenue. The robust growth of its AI business easily offset its slower sales of non-AI chips and infrastructure software.\n\nDuring Broadcom's latest conference call in December, CEO Hock Tan said he sees the company's \"opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive\" as its hyperscale customers embark on \"multiyear\" journeys to upgrade their AI infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, the growth of its other non-AI businesses should stabilize as the macro environment warms up again. It will also likely continue to expand by acquiring more chipmakers and infrastructure companies. That diversified expansion could make it a much more balanced growth play than many other chip and software companies.\n\nBroadcom still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth\n\nBroadcom currently has an enterprise value of $1.15 trillion, which makes it one of the world's most valuable tech companies. But it still trades at just 19 times its estimated adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 and pays a forward dividend yield of 1.2%.\n\nThat makes Broadcom an undervalued play on the booming AI market, even if it's already generated massive gains for its patient investors. So if you have $1,000 to spare, it's a great place to park your cash for the next few years.",

I\u2019m bullish on the company despite the upward re-rating, based on its history of generating exceptional long-term returns, the massive growth potential of the AI chip market, and its compelling track record as a strong dividend growth stock, all of which make it an appealing opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nAVGO is Not a One Year Wonder\n\nThe primary reason why it\u2019s not too late to invest in Broadcom after its big year is because its recent metrics are nothing new for the stock \u2014 Broadcom is a long-term performer, not a flash in the pan.\n\nIn fact, over the past decade, Broadcom has generated a stellar total return of 2,850% for investors, far exceeding broader benchmarks. While it has been a good decade for equity investors, the S&P 500 (SPX), as represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), has generated a total return of 256% over the same period, meaning that Broadcom generated ~10x the return of the broader market. An investor who put $10,000 into Broadcom 10 years ago would have an investment worth $280,500 today, while an investor who put $10,000 into VOO would have an investment worth $25,584 today.\n\nEven when looking at the more tech-centric Nasdaq 100 (NDAQ), Broadcom has outperformed. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) has generated a strong 456% total return over the past decade, but this strong performance still pales in comparison to Broadcom\u2019s stellar return.\n\nWinners tend to win for a reason, and they tend to keep winning over time, which gives me confidence that it\u2019s not too late for investors to add Broadcom to their long-term portfolio. While the law of large numbers means Broadcom\u2019s returns are unlikely to match those of the previous decade in the years ahead, the stock is well-positioned to deliver strong results (and returns) for its shareholders.",

            "content": "Analyzing Broadcom\u2019s Placement in the Market\n\nIn a recent CNBC segment, renowned investor Jim Cramer offered insights into a selection of stocks, with a notable focus on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During his discussion on \u201cSquawk on the Street,\u201d he highlighted the evolving landscape of the stock market and the influence of technology.\n\nCramer pointed out the shift in corporate power dynamics, particularly emphasizing Elon Musk\u2019s role and questioning his influence within governmental defense sectors. He expressed concerns about the absence of a significant presence from tech leaders in critical positions, suggesting that this might hinder their potential impact moving forward.\n\nThe financial expert also drew attention to sectors poised for growth, specifically emphasizing the healthcare industry\u2019s future intersection with AI technologies. Cramer stressed the importance of healthcare advancements, advocating for the need to prioritize meaningful innovations over superficial improvements, such as better call centers.\n\nWhile discussing stock performance, Cramer noted the considerable stagnation in smaller company stocks, asserting that their potential often remains unfulfilled. He expressed a preference for stronger, lesser-known tech firms, particularly calling out Broadcom for its impressive stock performance\u2014a remarkable 96% increase over the past year.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s significant partnership with Apple, providing essential components for devices, has greatly accelerated its growth prospects. He ranked Broadcom as a top contender among stocks mentioned, though he hinted there may be even more promising AI-related investments available to keen-eyed investors.\n\nBroader Implications of Broadcom\u2019s Market Position\n\nBroadcom Inc. stands at a pivotal intersection of technology and economic growth, reflecting broader trends in the global landscape.

            "content": "Global spending on artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to remain solid in 2025, with market research firm IDC estimating that organizations are likely to pour $337 billion into this technology as they integrate AI tools into their business operations.\n\nNotably, IDC estimates that 67% of the projected AI spending this year \"will come from enterprises embedding AI capabilities into their core business operations, surpassing investments in leading cloud and digital service providers.\" At the same time, cloud computing giants are set to continue spending big money on building out their AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of the AI boom with its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that have helped major tech giants train large language models (LLMs). And there is a good chance that the chipmaker will continue to witness impressive growth in its revenue and earnings.\n\nHowever, we will take a look at two other names that are also on track to benefit from the proliferation of AI in different verticals and see why they can turn out to be top AI picks for 2025.\n\nBroadcom: A solid AI chip stock to buy\n\nWhile Nvidia is dominating the market for AI GPUs, Broadcom (AVGO 1.84%) is leading the charge in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips that can be programmed to perform specific tasks, unlike GPUs that can perform multiple tasks and are used for general computing purposes.\n\nThe specific nature of ASICs makes them more energy-efficient and adept at tackling the tasks they are designed to do. This explains why cloud computing giants are using Broadcom's custom AI processors, known as XPUs, to power their data centers.\n\nReports suggest that Broadcom could be manufacturing chips for Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google, TikTok parent ByteDance, and OpenAI. It has now emerged that even Apple could tap Broadcom to manufacture its AI server chip.\n\nBroadcom management pointed out on the company's December 2024 earnings conference call that it is supplying its custom AI chips to three cloud hyperscale customers. The company notes that these customers are on track to deploy one million of its custom AI chip clusters over the next three years. Additionally, Broadcom says it has \"been selected by two additional hyperscalers and [they] are in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs.\"\n\nThis expanding AI customer base could lead to outstanding financial growth for Broadcom over the next three years. That's because the chipmaker sees its addressable market in AI reaching a range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. For comparison, Broadcom's AI revenue stood at $12.2 billion in the recently concluded fiscal 2024, which was a massive increase of 220% from the preceding year.\n\nThe size of the addressable market suggests that AI is likely to supercharge Broadcom's growth in 2025 and beyond, especially considering that it controls an estimated 55% to 60% of the ASIC market, as per JPMorgan. Not surprisingly, analysts have raised their revenue estimates for the current and the next two fiscal years.\n\nAVGO Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nHowever, Broadcom may be able to deliver stronger growth than analysts expect following the potential addition of new customers. In addition, its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) stands at just 0.7 right now based on its estimated earnings growth for the next five years, as per Yahoo! Finance.\n\nA PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued with respect to the earnings growth that it is expected to deliver, suggesting that growth investors can still consider buying Broadcom even after the impressive 108% gains that it has delivered in the past year.\n\nSnowflake: The application of AI to enterprise data is going to be a tailwind for the company\n\nWhile the likes of Broadcom and Nvidia produce chips that allow major cloud computing companies to train LLMs, Snowflake (SNOW -0.47%) gives customers an avenue to consolidate their data into a single platform. Its customers can then use this data to build generative AI apps, gain insights into their data, or solve business-related challenges by applying AI to that data.\n\nSo, Snowflake has a huge addressable market to tap in 2025, considering that IDC is expecting a big chunk of AI spending to go toward embedding AI capabilities in businesses' operations. The good part is that Snowflake's AI-focused solutions are already gaining healthy traction among customers.\n\nThe company's Cortex AI platform, for instance, is \"showing significant adoption,\" as per management. Customers can use Cortex AI to analyze their data and build generative AI apps, find specific information within documents, and get access to popular LLMs such as Llama and Anthropic Claude. As it turns out, over 3,200 of Snowflake's customers are already using its AI and machine learning (ML) features.\n\nThat's impressive, considering that Snowflake started rolling out its AI offerings in mid-2023, and it has continued to add more services so it can give users access to a wider range of tools.\n\nThe company has also made a move into the fast-growing market for AI agents as well with the Snowflake Intelligence platform, which was announced in November last year. This platform will enable enterprises to create AI agents, which can analyze and summarize data in a secure environment and then take action using those insights.\n\nWith the agentic AI market expected to clock an estimated revenue of $45 billion in 2025, Snowflake's AI-focused addressable opportunity should ideally expand. As a result, there is a solid chance that the company will be able to clock better-than-expected growth going forward.\n\nAfter all, Snowflake's remaining performance obligations (RPO) shot up an impressive 55% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Oct. 31, 2024) to $5.7 billion. That was significantly higher than the 29% year-over-year increase in its quarterly revenue to $900.3 million. RPO refers to the unfulfilled contracts of a company that will be recognized as revenue in the future when those contracts are executed. So, faster growth in this metric, as compared to Snowflake's top line, points toward a potential acceleration in growth.\n\nExisting customers spent more on its platform, as evidenced by a net revenue retention rate of 127% during the quarter. The metric compares the spending by Snowflake's customers in a quarter to the spending by those same customers in the prior-year period, so a reading of more than 100% indicates that the adoption of its services by existing customers grew.\n\nThis is a trend that's likely to continue as more Snowflake customers start using its AI offerings. Snowflake had just over 10,600 customers at the end of the previous quarter, and 30% of them are using its AI/ML solutions. So, as the company upsells its AI products to more customers, it could witness a nice improvement in both revenue and earnings.\n\nAll this explains why Snowflake is expected to deliver 40%-plus earnings growth for the next couple of fiscal years.\n\nSNOW EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nAs such, Snowflake looks like a top AI stock to buy, considering that its addressable market is likely to expand nicely in 2025 thanks to the addition of AI-centric tools in its data cloud platform, which should set the stage for outstanding earnings growth going forward.",

The other top stocks show buy points as well. None have earnings in the way, but watch out for reports from rivals, customers and more as earnings season ramps up.\n\nHubSpot stock is on IBD Leaderboard and the Big Cap 20. Other top IBD lists for the best stock ideas include the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, as well as Long Term Leaders and SwingTrader.\n\nThe relative strength lines for all five top stocks are trending higher or improving. A rising RS line, the blue line in the charts shown, shows a stock's outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line for Sea stock is making a new high, shown by the blue dot on the weekly chart.\n\nThe stock market rallied to record highs last week amid the presidential inauguration. Several leading names report earnings in the week ahead. Among the notable names: Meta, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Apple and Tesla\n\n'Perfect' AI Stock: Broadcom\n\nShares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker popped 3.1% to 244.70 last week. That move put Broadcom stock within 3% of a 251.88 buy point from a 6-week flat base, according to the MarketSurge chart. AVGO stock forged the flat base after a powerful earnings breakaway gap in December.\n\nBut Broadcom stock sank 17.4% on Monday to undercut the 50-day moving average. China's DeepSeek AI shook the markets and weighed on AI-related stocks in particular.\n\nThe RS line for this AI stock has risen steadily over the past 10 years. That is a sign of long-term outperformance.\n\nAVGO stock earns a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99. It shows a superior EPS Rating of 96 and an RS Rating of 95, also out of a best-possible 99. A 95 RS Rating means that Broadcom stock has outpaced 95% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.\n\nIn December, the fabless chipmaker revealed it grew earnings 28% in its fiscal fourth quarter as revenue jumped 51%. The top line accelerated for the fourth straight quarter and showed the biggest gain since Q1 2017, thanks in part to the VMware acquisition.\n\nBoth Broadcom earnings and outlook roughly matched analyst estimates. Analyst now expect an almost 31% earnings jump this fiscal year, ending in October, speeding up from 15% last year, FactSet shows.\n\nBroadcom and Nvidia are among the best chipmaking beneficiaries of the AI momentum. So far in 2025, Broadcom stock is now down about 8% after a big rally in the past year.\n\nBroadcom earnings likely aren't due until late February, but results from Meta, Microsoft, Apple and others will provide a key gauge on AI capital spending and end-user adoption.\n\nMarket Rally Strong; 3 Titans Near Buy Points With Huge Earnings Due\n\nCrowdStrike: Cybersecurity AI Stock\n\nShares of the artificial intelligence cybersecurity leader jumped more than 6% to 379.10 last week. CrowdStrike stock shows a 389 flat-base buy point, now 3% below the entry. Investors could view the flat base as an alternate handle on a larger base going back to July, before the global cybersecurity outage.\n\nShares are actionable from an early entry from the clearing the bulk of the flat base last Wednesday.\n\nCrowdStrike holds a Composite Rating of 98, EPS Rating of 97 and RS Rating of 88.\n\nEarnings growth averaged 39% over the last three quarters, a robust level, though below the three-year average of 96%, the Stock Checkup tool shows. Sales ranged between 29% and 33% the last three quarters, also below the three-year rate of 42%.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm sprang into public consciousness last July after a botched rollout of an update to its software. That event briefly brought corporate America to its knees. However the firm won high marks from analysts for its handling of the crisis, with CRWD stock rallying with aplomb as a result.\n\nCrowdStrike says AI has become an essential tool in cybersecurity. Its new Charlotte AI, a generative AI assistant, aims to stop breaches faster.\n\nThus far in 2025, CrowdStrike stock has advanced 9%.\n\nSea Stock\n\nAmerican depositary shares of the Singapore-based online retailer gained 2.4% to 117.81 last week after jumping 6.3% in the prior week.\n\nSea shares shed 3% on Monday, testing the 50-day line. Sea stock now trades 4% below a 119.47 buy point from a shallow cup or flat base.\n\nOffsetting a Composite Rating of 97 and an RS Rating of 96, Sea stock owns shows a poor EPS Rating of 39 out of 99. It's a young company making a shift to consistent profits.\n\nEarnings last year show Sea is growing more profitable while also accelerating its sales growth.

            "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 41% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Broadcom's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n\n9.1% = US$6.2b \u00f7 US$68b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nBroadcom's Earnings Growth And 9.1% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Broadcom's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 11%, we may spare it some thought. Particularly, the exceptional 26% net income growth seen by Broadcom over the past five years is pretty remarkable. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Broadcom's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 20%.\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Past Earnings Growth January 25th 2025\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Broadcom is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET and Oracle Corp. ORCL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nS&P Tracking for New Highs on AI Optimism: 4 Stocks to Buy\n\nThe Wall Street rally appears to have returned after Donald Trump took over as the President to begin a new term. Major indexes have resumed their northbound journey since the beginning of the week after a shaky start to 2025. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 hit an intraday record before closing just shy of its all-time closing high.\n\nThe rally is once again being driven by optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Tech stocks have been largely responsible for the broader rally seen over the past couple of years and their stellar performance is likely to continue, making them a lucrative buy.\n\nGiven the upbeat sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in tech stocks from the S&P 500 index, such as Broadcom Inc., NVIDIA Corp., Amazon.com, Inc. and Arista Networks, Inc. Each of these stocks has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days and carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nS&P 500 Rebounds on AI Optimism, Trump\u2019s New Term\n\nThe S&P 500 hit an intraday record of 6,100.81, surpassing the last milestone attained in December before closing slightly below its all-time closing high. The index finally closed at 6,086.37.\n\nThe rebound in the rally comes after a brief pause when stocks pulled back in the final weeks of December. However, a fresh wave of optimism surrounding AI and Trump\u2019s new term as the President helped resume the rally this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced a $500 investment in AI infrastructure. The venture, named Stargate, will be created in collaboration with Oracle Corp. , SoftBank and OpenAI. Tech stocks rallied following the announcement.\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding AI has already been driving the broader market rally since 2024. The S&P 500 gained 23.3% in 2024 after climbing 24.2% in 2023. The index jumped 53% in the last two years, recording its best performance since the 66% gain in 1997-98.\n\nAI Optimism to Stay\n\nExperts believe that AI has vast untapped potential. NVIDIA's impressive achievements over the past year have inspired many tech companies to explore AI's capabilities for gaining long-term business benefits.\n\nThe advancement of smart devices is essential in this area, as they rely on strong computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analysis.

            "content": "VMware users continue to be unhappy with licensing changes since the virtualization giant was acquired by Broadcom, and are now complaining that they are being forced into three-year commitments when renewing vSphere licenses.\n\nFollowing the takeover of Virtzilla at the end of 2023, Broadcom has shaken things up with a switch to \"simplified\" licensing and a preferred focus on larger enterprise customers.\n\nHowever \"simplified\" meant ditching standalone support services and perpetual licenses, with customers instead being offered per-core subscriptions to bundles of software and support. Many protested that this led to a massive hike in the license fees they owed to Broadcom. The licensing changes have subsequently lost VMware some big name clients including insurance giant Geico and agriculture juggernaut John Deere over the past year.\n\nNow, customers are claiming that if they want to renew existing vSphere licenses, they are required to stump up in advance for a three-year period rather than just renew for a single year.\n\nOne poster, \"bschmidt25\", on a Reddit VMware thread complained recently that Broadcom \"only wants customers that are committed to them,\" and for that reason the company is only offering VMware users three-year commitments when it comes to renewals.\n\n\"They will only do annual payments if you go all VCF. If you want Enterprise Plus or Standard licenses, you need to pay three years up front,\" the poster \"bschmidt25\" states.\n\nVCF here means VMware Cloud Foundation, which combines compute, storage and network virtualization with management and automation tools into one package that can (in theory) be deployed on either a customer's on-prem infrastructure or into a public cloud. The suite became VMware's flagship product following its assimilation by Broadcom, and the \"simplification\" of its product portfolio.\n\nYet many customers are users of the vSphere server virtualization platform, and had renewed their licence annually, which some had hoped to continue doing as they mulled a migration away from VMware to some alternative technology.\n\n\"We do annual renewals because of how our budget process works. We plan for 10 percent increases on software renewals every year. If it's more than that, the money needs to come from somewhere else,\" bschmidt25 says. \"We already got hammered last year when our renewal went up 70 percent even after reducing our licensing. The numbers we got for VCF are nearly three times what we paid last year.\"\n\nA second poster, \"michaelnz29\" believes this is a deliberate ploy by Broadcom, which knows many customers are planning to ditch VMware, and so is denying short-term licenses that would allow businesses to cover the migration period.\n\n\"They are aware that many of you are looking at alternatives, but it is going to take 6-12 months to migrate off, therefore only offering a three year deal means a couple of things, one you need support so you will most likely renew anyway,\" the poster writes. \"The other, we have short memories; in 2 years' time (when you are revisiting the options) because you signed up for three years, you have forgotten the pain (they hope) and the new 'improved' pricing structure is part of your budget and you just pull the trigger and renew.\"\n\nAnother poster claims to have something of an explanation:\n\n\"I work for a [Value Added Reseller], a lot of what you get for quotes depends on the Broadcom rep assigned to your account. Any half decent VAR will work with you and make the case of what's right for you. They do have what they call \"expected annual revenue\" assigned to your account and the Broadcom rep is often very reluctant to reduce this number,\" said user \"Darkcurse12.\"\n\n\"They have gone through several policies in the last year but one of the more recent ones was to require a three year annualized contract with cancellation terms. Meaning you sign a three year contract, pay year, but can cancel during that term with some caveats,\" the poster explained.\n\nWe asked Broadcom for a response to the complaint, but a company spokesperson simply directed us to a blog posted by CEO Hock Tan last year outlining its VMware strategy.\n\nIn it, the chips 'n' software giant claimed to be \"flexible and open\" on subscriptions, \"with customers having choice when deciding the length of their subscriptions, whether they purchase directly from us at Broadcom or through channel partners. Either way, we will structure contract durations in alignment with our customers' journeys,\" Tan said.\n\nDespite what Broadcom asserts, a VMware customer we contacted confirmed what the Reddit post claims.\n\n\"Yes, Broadcom scrapped the one year contracts and now only permit annual upfront payment on a three year term,\" the customer, who asked not be identified, told us.\n\nCustomers may face challenges if they do decide to ditch VMware for some alternative platform, analyst firm Gartner warned this week. This is because it is more than just a supplier of virtualization tech, but also management and orchestration tools plus software-defined network and storage platforms that customers may have also deployed. Migrations are likely to be a long, costly and risky project, especially for larger companies, it said.\n\nSmall wonder that VMware has turned out to be a money-making machine for Broadcom, as The Register reported at the end of last year. \u00ae",

While it\u2019s clear that much has evolved and changed over those years, some things remain unchanged, including our relentless drive to push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nThat commitment has seen us pioneer solutions for customers no matter where they are on their cloud journey. Whether it was to the public cloud in the early 2000s or to cross, hybrid or multi-cloud through today, we\u2019ve been with our customers every step of the way as they evolved and modernized their IT environments. In fact, some of the largest banks and government agencies in this region have relied on us to be their trusted partners for decades, a distinction few organizations can claim and one for which I am incredibly proud of and grateful.\n\nTaking Back Control by Modernizing and Going Private\n\nOne recurring conversation that I have with customers is their desire to deploy a cloud operating model that combines the scale and agility of public clouds with the security and performance of a private cloud. The end result: Customers are modernizing and choosing to take back control of their IT environments by working with us to become their own private cloud providers.\n\nIndeed, a recent survey found that eight out of 10 CIOs are moving workloads back to their on-premises environments.[1] As Broadcom President and CEO Hock Tan discussed at last year\u2019s VMware Explore and in this blog, we believe the future of the enterprise is private.\n\nThis demand has been driven by several factors that gained force last year, and which I believe will become even more significant drivers of change this year. On the technology side, those factors include the rapid growth of AI, changing cybersecurity threats, an intense focus on costs, and a greater interest in sustainable leadership as energy demands rise. On the market and regulatory side, we anticipate new governments with new policies and regulations related to supply chains, IT infrastructure, data, and AI. In the midst of these trends is significant uncertainty in the world\u2019s geopolitical environment.\n\nEnterprises that have started to repatriate workloads from the public cloud to their own private or hybrid environments, as well as those who have opted not to migrate new workloads to a public cloud, have found it to be a powerful and cost-effective approach to manage and modernize their IT environments. The rebalancing is facilitated by the availability of new solutions, such as the upcoming release of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9, which offers a pathway to simplify the deployment, consumption, and operation of a secure and cost-effective private cloud.\n\nWe also understand that our customers want freedom of choice at every stage in their cloud journey. That\u2019s why we recently introduced enhanced VCF license portability so your data and workloads can go anywhere across a range of compatible environments - from your own data center to cloud service providers. This model provides operational continuity and significant cost efficiencies by leveraging existing investments to reduce redundant expenditures.\n\nIncreasing Capability and Agility with AI\n\nAnother key move we\u2019re seeing: organizations bringing new generative AI applications out of the laboratory and into production. This promises to unleash productivity gains, allow enterprises to introduce entirely new business processes, and improve their ability to respond to changes in their marketplaces in real time.\n\nYet while many teams are excited about GenAI, it does present complex challenges. We are delivering solutions that allow customers to reap its benefits and still maintain privacy, security, control and compliance. That\u2019s where VMware\u2019s Private AI platform shines. Highly regulated industries are embracing Private AI to help them keep their data private so they remain compliant with regulations. We have seen strong demand for our VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA platform in industry verticals, such as the public sector and financial services.\n\nA Journey Towards Sovereign Cloud\n\nIn Japan and other markets, customers are also leveraging our technology to grow their sovereign cloud capabilities. They are working with our regional teams and partners to ensure they maintain a high level of expertise in the systems on which their organizations depend. Across Asia Pacific and Japan, Broadcom has several VMware Cloud Service Providers that offer sovereign-cloud services based on VCF, bringing together the best of public and private cloud. These partners help customers meet their local data sovereignty and security compliance obligations, while reducing the \u2018digital deficits\u2019 from nations importing more digital products and services than they can produce.\n\nMaintaining the Excitement and Learning in 2025\n\nWhat struck me most at last year\u2019s VMware Explore events was the level of excitement and enthusiasm. Our customers and partners are eager to embrace change, and the tools now available empower them to push innovation boundaries with confidence. This energy is also reflected in our thriving VMUG user group communities. It\u2019s a testament to the incredible potential for transformation within our industry.\n\n2024 was the year of record highs for the tech sector, particularly in AI. It has certainly been an inflection point for VMware\u2019s solutions, as we simplified our portfolio to allow customers to gain more value from their investments. In this new year, I encourage you to build on that excitement and channel it into ambitious goals matched by unified organizational strategies. Given how much we don\u2019t know about the year ahead, those strategies should focus on initiatives to optimize value, simplify your technology environment, and become more resilient, secure, and capable by opening the door for GenAI and new innovations that will surely emerge.\n\nWe are determined and committed to meet you where you are on your cloud transformation journey and help you carry it forward. Thank you for choosing to work with us; we\u2019re grateful to all our customers, partners, VMUG community members and everyone else who joined us as we evolved in 2024. We look forward to supporting your plans and growth in the coming year. As I travel around the region, I\u2019m excited to learn more about how we can continue to push the boundaries of innovation together.\n\n[1] Barclays CIO Survey 2024",

            "content": "Shares of many artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductor names were moving higher on Wednesday, including Broadcom (AVGO -1.86%), Lam Research (LRCX -2.28%), and Monolithic Power (MPWR -3.36%), which were up 2.6%, 4.1%, and 8.5%, respectively, as of 1:12 p.m. ET.\n\nThese weren't the only three AI-related chip stocks rising today, but this group does showcase a rather broad spectrum of products, from Broadcom's AI networking chips, to Lam's etch and deposition equipment for advanced chipmaking, to Monolithic's AI power modules.\n\nThe news lifting all boats in the sector likely had to do with yesterday's announcement of the Stargate data center project by President Donald Trump and a host of other AI technology companies.\n\nStargate: Reality or science fiction?\n\nYesterday, a group of technology companies, including Oracle, Softbank and OpenAI, gathered at the White House to announce Stargate. Stargate is an AI-related joint venture, bringing these companies and other investors together to build out next-generation AI infrastructure in the U.S.\n\nThe announcement may have spurred a rally in AI-related chip stocks due to the financial figures the group touted. The companies announced an initial $100 billion investment, but also threw out a $500 billion figure as the potential for future new Stargate expansions over the next four years.\n\nGiven that none of these companies make their own chips -- at least not yet -- that stunning figure likely means lots of Nvidia GPUs. Yet even if Stargate primarily uses Nvidia GPUs and not custom ASICs, which Broadcom makes, Stargate will still likely use Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho network switching and routing chips. Moreover, all leading-edge semiconductors and memory today require intense etch and deposition steps, which would benefit semiconductor equipment generally and Lam Research specifically, which leads in these crucial chip manufacturing categories.\n\nMeanwhile, these massive data centers will require huge amounts of power, and Monolithic Power provides the 48 volt power management systems used by many AI chip modules. While there has been some debate as to whether Monolithic Power may have lost its dominant share within Nvidia chip modules -- a concern that caused Monolithic stock to plunge late last year -- it should still retain a key share of these AI power module systems. In fact, sell-side analysts at Oppenheimer just named Monolithic as one of the firm's top AI stocks for 2025.\n\nBut investors may want to cool their jets on Stargate\n\nWhile these stocks should climb on continued AI investment news, the Stargate announcement by itself shouldn't be this much of a game changer. After all, the initial $100 billion includes money already spent on a Texas data center in progress that began last year under the Biden administration. So, Stargate doesn't appear to be an entirely new AI cluster, but rather a mere augmentation of one already underway.\n\nMoreover, it's unclear where all this money will come from. As noted in The Wall Street Journal, Oracle only has $11 billion in cash, Softbank has $30 billion, and OpenAI is currently losing money. So, that $100 billion seems like a stretch at the moment, let alone $500 billion.\n\nStill, this high-profile event has followed some other bullish AI investment indicators of late, including the strong earnings report and guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing last week, along with Microsoft's early 2025 announcement that it would be spending $80 billion on its own AI infrastructure this year.\n\nThus, it's no surprise to see these AI infrastructure stocks moving higher today on the cumulative good news. And with Lam Research and Monolithic having had subpar years last year, it's no surprise to see their stocks rallying even more in a \"catch-up\" trade.\n\nStill, while today's announcement was a positive, it would be wise not to over-hype vague announcements in the early days of the new administration. Continued moves higher will require sustained AI investment, as well as evidence that customers are seeing productivity gains and returns on all of this massive spending.",

As a fund targeting the generative AI, this ETF\u2019s holdings in companies like Microsoft and Meta.\n\nStargate's Ambitious Vision\n\nStargate plans to invest an initial $100 billion, with a long-term vision of funneling up to $500 billion into building data centers and other critical infrastructure to support AI development. The project, already under construction in Texas, aims to create 100,000 jobs and establish the U.S. as a leader in AI technology.\n\nEllison noted that the group's first 1 million-square-foot data center is already underway, emphasizing the need for robust infrastructure to power next-generation AI applications. Altman agreed, calling the project \"the most important of this era.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk voiced concerns over Project Stargate's funding, suggesting that SoftBank has secured far less than the ambitious $500 billion investment target.\n\nETFs focused on AI and technology offer a wise entry point for those looking to jump on the bandwagon. With $175 billion reportedly awaiting deployment into AI projects, the U.S. should attract significant global capital.\n\nSee Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

The company engages in designing and developing a wide range of advanced technology solutions, which are used in digital cellular and wireless 3G, 4G and IEEE 802-related products and networks. Estimates for IDCC\u2019s earnings for this year have risen by a couple of cents over the past 30 days.\n\nHere are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:\n\nJust these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.\n\nAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.\n\nAdditionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.\n\nStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.\n\nThough the strategy does not offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk. In fact, picking stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks \u2014 InterDigital, Inc. , Fox Corp. , Broadcom Inc ., Greenbrier Companies Inc . and Acuity Brands Inc \u2014 that could be solid choices amid market volatility.\n\nWall Street has been exhibiting volatility at the start of 2025 on rising inflation fears, uncertainty surrounding future Fed rate cuts and ambiguity over Trump\u2019s tariff policies. Against such a backdrop, investors are increasingly exploring strategies that will help them to protect their portfolios from downside risk. Nothing seems better than the dividend investing strategy.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 21, 2025 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are \u2014 InterDigital, Inc. IDCC, Fox Corp.

            "content": "If the changes Broadcom brought to VMware have you thinking of a move to an alternative virtualization platform, expect a long, costly, and risky project \u2013 and perhaps a longer, costlier, and riskier one if you put off pondering the move.\n\nThat\u2019s the thrust of a new assessment titled \u201cEstimating a Large-Scale VMware Migration\u201d from by analyst firm Gartner, and the opinion of one of its authors \u2013 VP Analyst Michael Warrilow.\n\nThe assessment modelled the cost of migrating off VMware for an org that runs 2,000 or more VMs and at least 100 servers to host them and found projects will take 18 to 48 months. Each virtual machine will cost between $300 and $3,000 to migrate, if you engage external service providers.\n\nInitial scoping alone will require seven to ten full time staff for a month. Technical evaluation of potential VMware replacements needs another six people for up to nine months. Planning and testing before a migration will vary depending on the complexity of your apps and infrastructure.\n\nWarrilow said migrations will be complex because VMware users often mistakenly consider the Broadcom business unit first and foremost a supplier of virtualization products. He told The Register that orgs where multiple components of the VMware stack are present need to consider it a networking vendor first, a storage supplier second, a management tools provider third \u2013 and only then consider its role as a source of virtualization tech. That approach is necessary, he said, because migrating networks (and entangled security setups), storage (and associated disaster recovery rigs), and management tools is harder than shifting hypervisors.\n\n\u201cMigrating from VMware\u2019s server virtualization platform would require untangling many aspects of these investments,\u201d the Gartner document points out.\n\nWarrilow told The Register that VMware customers he speaks too are often yet to commence migration plans. \u201cEverybody's asking what everybody else is doing, and everybody else is asking what everybody else is doing, so nobody's really doing anything,\u201d he said.\n\nThat approach means he fears VMware users are going to waste 2025 waiting to watch their peers, and vendors who offer alternative virtualization stacks won\u2019t get the orders they hoped to win.\n\nRed Hat enters the chat Red Hat last week introduced a new option for VMware users considering alternative virtualization platforms in the form of the \u201cOpenShift Virtualization Engine\u201d. The product is pitched at orgs that just need vanilla virtualization and aren\u2019t interested in moving to containers. It\u2019s licensed on terms that allow users to run unlimited VMs on a single-or-dual-socket server with up to 128 processor cores. It can run on your own hardware, or on bare-metal servers in the AWS cloud. Red Hat plans to support other public clouds. Warrilow said Red Hat\u2019s product is welcome, and cheaper than Broadcom \u2013 but that Oracle\u2019s prices may be even better for its server virtualization offering.\n\nThe analyst counselled starting work on migration plans sooner rather than later, because the time required to make the move means most users will need to renegotiate licenses with Broadcom at least once before their project is completed as the chips-and-code company prefers two-or-three-year subscriptions. He fears Broadcom will hike prices even further in future, meaning delays that push users into a second round of license negotiations could face more expense.\n\nWarrilow joked that VMware is \u201cthe new mainframe\u201d, status that denotes its likely persistence in many orgs as infrastructure dedicated to applications that are too hard, or too risky, to re-platform.\n\nBroadcom argues its flagship VMware Cloud Foundation suite is much more than that and offers adopters the chance to build private clouds that are more efficient and cost-effective than using public clouds. \u00ae",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nIvan Tsarynny, Feroot Security CEO, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 to discuss his Congressional testimony about TikTok. According to Tsarynny, China is collecting information on Americans through applications such as TikTok to train AI. This training is being done in hopes of helping them win the AI race. He said that TikTok is present in a lot of websites and places where it can obtain information on Americans who don\u2019t even use the app. He also said that it is required under Chinese law to disclose data when requested and that companies that are required to share the information may also need to keep it confidential so we may not even know that the data was shared with the CCP.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar\n\nThis is probably why the Supreme Court said that the application needs to be divested considering that it may be collecting information on Americans and diverting it to China. When asked whether Tiktok is the only application that is suspected of doing so, he said that Tiktok is probably the biggest application, but not the only one. Tsarynny also said that the kind of information being collected includes everything you do on the app and anything it might be able to access on the phone. Another area is data collection on websites where tracking pixels collect your details. While not easy or commonly done, users can use privacy browser extensions or tools to block pixel trackers and other tracking tools.\n\nBanned for a short period over data security concerns, TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app\u2019s access in the U.S. after he returns to power, which is today, January 20th. In response, TikTok thanked Trump for \u201cproviding the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive\u201d. This gratitude comes at a tense moment in US-China relations.\n\nAmidst all these events, U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI also submitted a bid on Saturday, January 18, to TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance. The bid suggested Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., creating a new entity by combining the merged company with New Capital Partners. The company believes that its bid may be successful since the proposal is a merger rather than a sale.",

            "content": "Is Broadcom Samsung's beacon of hope amid Nvidia's challenges?\n\nAt CES 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that Samsung Electronics (Samsung) must develop a \"new design\" to pass Nvidia's qualification, sparking discussions about whether Samsung can make a comeback with HBM3E in 2025. However, according to Chosun Biz, many industry insiders pointed out that if Samsung collaborates with Nvidia's competitor Broadcom, a different outcome may emerge.\n\nSamsung was initially expected to begin supplying HBM3E before the end of 2024, but this plan has been delayed and remains unfulfilled. Whether Huang's statement indicates insufficient technical capability on Samsung's part or overly stringent specifications set by Nvidia has led to considerable debate.\n\nInsiders stated that SK Hynix supplies Nvidia with HBM3E that significantly exceeds the standards set by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), as Nvidia's demands for power efficiency, data processing speed, and capacity continue to escalate.\n\nMajor tech companies like Google, Meta, and ByteDance recently commissioned Broadcom to develop AI chips, positioning Broadcom as a formidable competitor to Nvidia.\n\nWhat are the odds of a collaboration between Samsung and Broadcom?\n\nConsidering its chip design process and business model, Broadcom would be more likely to choose a memory supplier capable of providing high cost-performance ratios and large-scale supply compared to Nvidia. This perspective increases the likelihood of Samsung signing a contract with Broadcom.\n\nOn the other hand, the initial defects encountered with Blackwell could serve as a growth catalyst for Broadcom's customized AI chips. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain regarding whether Broadcom can achieve the procurement scale comparable to Nvidia.\n\nNvidia accounts for approximately 90% of global HBM demand, their new product Blackwell also features a significant amount of high-performance HBM. After meeting Nvidia's requirements, SK Hynix's ability to supply additional major customers is limited, creating potential market opportunities for Samsung to mount a comeback.\n\nHowever, there are also \"contradictions\" between Samsung and Broadcom. In July 2024, Yonhap News Agency reported that following an unequal contract signed with Samsung in 2023, Broadcom faced penalties from the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Subsequently, Samsung filed a lawsuit against Broadcom in the US for violating antitrust laws.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Samsung submitted a complaint citing the \"unequal contract\" related to Galaxy smartphone chips with Broadcom. In late December 2024, reports emerged indicating that SK Hynix had secured HBM orders from Broadcom.\n\nAt CES 2025, Samsung showcased its sixth-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM4) to global customers. Although still in the development phase, Samsung's proactive promotion of HBM4 suggests that the company views this product as a key tool for revitalizing its market position.\n\nSamsung reportedly presented the HBM3E and HBM4 simultaneously to customers. HBM3E was officially announced as completed in February 2024, while HBM4 is planned for mass production in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe South Korean industry generally believes that the success or failure of Samsung's HBM business may hinge on the performance of HBM4.",

It is now one of only eight U.S.-based public tech companies to currently hold that mark.\n\nBroadcom, founded by Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas in 1991 in Irvine, was sold to Avago Technologies in 2016 for $37 billion in cash and stock, with the buyer keeping the OC firm\u2019s name and local operations.\n\nThe overall OC headcount for the 18 chipmakers surveyed by the Business Journal was 4,078, inching up about 0.2% from a year ago.\n\nIsrael-based Tower Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TSEM) was second, as its Newport Beach headcount was steady at 860, despite a series of temporary furloughs last year.\n\nIrvine-based Skyworks Solution Inc. was No. 3 on this year\u2019s Business Journal list, as its local employee number edged up 7.4% to 563 (Nasdaq: SWKS).\n\nData Center Gains Outpace Rest: Marvell\n\nComing in at No. 4 was Marvell Technology Inc., which has its headquarters in Santa Clara and has 320 local employees (Nasdaq: MRVL).\n\n\u201cSales of chips for data centers (processors, optical devices switches) rose while sales to telecommunications carriers, automotive customers and enterprises declined with an overall industry decline in those three markets,\u201d a Marvell spokesperson told the Business Journal.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cData center gains, however, outpaced them. Data centers now account for around 70% of revenue. A good portion of our data center revenue is for chips for AI systems.\u201d He noted that \u201crevenue is rising.\u201d\n\nApple Inc., which is Skyworks\u2019 largest customer, was at No. 5. The company for years reportedly has been seeking to build a separate chip-making presence in Irvine, though details have been difficult to obtain (Nasdaq: AAPL).\n\nAliso Viejo-based Indie Semiconductor Inc., which develops chips for automobiles, was steady at 100 employees (Nasdaq: INDI), staying at the ninth spot.\n\nSyntiant, Movandi, Faraday\n\nIrvine-based Faraday Semi Inc. surged 50% from 10 employees to 15 as of January.\n\n\u201cThe forecast for semiconductor in 2025 indicates a blend of new opportunities and slowdown in several mature segments,\u201d a Faraday spokesperson told the Business Journal.\n\n\u201cAI and associated chipsets are key driving factors shaping the semiconductor industry\u2019s future. This may lead to short impact on different companies in various regions, depending on their area of focus, thus OC\u2019s chipmakers may see a reduction of numbers of employees,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nOthers on the Business Journal list include the following Irvine-based firms:\n\nSyntiant, the chip and AI company, has 42 local employees while the companywide headcount jumped to nearly 1,700 with a key acquisition.\n\nThe headcount at Menlo Microsystems dipped from 44 a year ago to 38 at the start of January.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nThe order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will \u201caccelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy\u201d.\n\nAccording to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an \u201cappropriate share\u201d of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States\u201d. -White House technology adviser Tarun Chhabra.\n\nSeveral known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector.\n\n\u201cSo what you get with the Biden administration today is \u2014 at least from a signaling perspective \u2014 on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward\u201d. -Chris Lehane\n\nAccording to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses \u2014 national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy.\n\nAI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the \u201cEconomic Blueprint\u201d, it said that \u201cChips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI\u201d and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage.\n\nOpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects \u2014strengthening the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s global influence\u201d. -OpenAI said in the document.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On January 13, Jefferies named Broadcom as a top pick, saying that the semis company is a top idea in 2025. The firm raised its price target on the stock to $300 from $225 based on its strong and growing customer base. Broadcom has a rapidly growing AI chip market, driven by demand for custom-designed chips, or ASICs. Its advanced chips are anticipated to rival Nvidia\u2019s in compute density as new technologies like 3.5D packaging and silicon photonics gain traction. The firm further revealed that Broadcom\u2019s AI chip sales could generate over $60 billion in revenue by 2027. This could drive earnings per share to $12 or more. Its AI business has also gained momentum, specifically in training-focused chips, which need higher prices as designs become more complex. As these chips become larger and incorporate more advanced technologies, it will drive the average selling prices higher.\n\n\u201cAVGO Top Pick but Plenty of Growth to Go Around.\u201d\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 1st on our list of the top AI stocks on analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose by about 28.6% in 2024.\n\nGrowth stocks' performances have been more mixed in the first few weeks of 2025. However, there are still a few that could surge further. Here's why these growth stocks look to be setting up for solid rallies this year.\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom (AVGO -1.86%) demonstrated exceptional strength in its fiscal 2024 (which ended Nov. 3), with revenue growing 44% to $51.6 billion. Excluding the impact of its VMware purchase, the company's top line rose 9% in fiscal 2024 -- highlighting the company's potential to grow both organically and via acquisitions.\n\nBroadcom has emerged as a major AI player thanks to its exceptional strength in custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking solutions. The company's AI revenue soared by 220% to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024, and that growth is all set to continue.\n\nThe company has estimated its AI serviceable addressable market will rocket to between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal 2027, based just on the plans of its three major hyperscaler clients to each deploy 1 million XPU clusters by 2027. There is even more upside potential to that projection since Broadcom is already in the advanced stages of developing next-generation AI XPUs for two additional hyperscaler clients.\n\nWith the rising deployment of AI chips in large-scale XPU clusters, demand is also rising for Broadcom's networking solutions. In this sort of AI infrastructure, the level of resources that must be dedicated to networking rises. Specifically, management expects that as cluster sizes expand from 500,000 XPUs to 1 million XPUs, the share of AI hardware resources allocated to networking hardware will surge from a range of 5% to 10% now to a range of 15% to 20%.\n\nFinally, Broadcom has completed the integration of VMware ahead of schedule while also boosting cost efficiency and profitability. The VMware unit's operating margin was 70% at the end of fiscal 2024, a significant improvement from less than 30% in pre-acquisition times. Broadcom has also succeeded in reducing VMware's quarterly spending from $2.4 billion to $1.2 billion.\n\nConsidering these many tailwinds, Broadcom seems well-poised for an impressive bull rally in 2025.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nLooking at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.57%), there is a lot to be excited about these days. The leading third-party foundry (with a market share of nearly 65% as of the end of September) successfully expanded its scale and also improved its profitability in fiscal 2024.\n\nWhile its revenue rose 30% to $90 billion, its operating margin also expanded by 3.1 percentage points to 45.7%. These are impressive numbers, especially since the company spent almost $29.8 billion in capital expenditures that year. Furthermore, TSMC expects capex of between $38 billion and $42 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nTSMC is also the undisputed leader in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Its 3-nanometer (nm) process technology contributed 18% to its wafer revenue in fiscal 2024, up from 6% in 2023. Its advanced technologies segment, which includes all the chips it makes using process nodes of 7nm and smaller, accounted for 69% of the company's total wafer revenue in fiscal 2024, up from 58% in 2023. (The smaller the process node, the more component-dense and powerful the chip.)\n\nThe company is gearing up for volume production of chips using its new 2nm process technology in the second half of 2025. It has introduced N2P, an extension to its 2nm node to further boost power benefits and performance in high-performance computing and smartphone applications. TSMC is also working to introduce what it has dubbed the A16 node, which will offer further speed and power improvements over N2P technology.\n\nIncreasing demand for AI processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerators (XPUs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) controllers continues to be a major growth catalyst for TSMC.\n\nIn 2024, AI processors accounted for a mid-teens percentage of the company's total revenue. Management now expects revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025, driven by demand for chips to support data center applications as well as AI applications in smartphones. Subsequently, TSMC's AI accelerator revenue is expected to grow at a compound average percentage rate in the mid-40s from 2024 to 2029.\n\nDespite the many tailwinds for its business, TSMC trades at a reasonable price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10.9. Hence, TSMC is a smart pick despite the significant capital expenditures it has lined up for 2025.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nLatin American e-commerce and fintech giant MercadoLibre's (MELI -0.77%) revenue soared by 35% year over year to $5.3 billion in the third quarter, driven mainly by strength in Brazil and Mexico.\n\nMercadoLibre's e-commerce platform added new customers at a record-breaking pace of almost 7 million in the quarter. This can be attributed to several innovations introduced by the company, including new features in the automotive and beauty verticals, a new high-frequency category that is personalized based on each user's profile, revamping of its Meli Mas loyalty program, and an improved shipping experience. The company is focusing on expanding its fulfillment network in Brazil.\n\nIts fintech platform, Mercado Pago, is also seeing strong momentum. What started as a simple payment processor has evolved into a comprehensive financial services platform in the still underpenetrated Latin American market. The platform reached 56.2 million monthly active users in the third quarter, up 35% on a year-over-year basis, and ended the period with assets under management of $8 billion, up 93% year over year.\n\nMercado Pago's credit card business is also growing at a healthy pace, with a 166% year-over-year jump in total payment volume in the third quarter. The company issued 1.5 million new credit cards in the quarter. The credit card business now accounts for 39% of its credit portfolio, up from 25% a year ago. MercadoLibre has also reduced its credit risk by moving upmarket to offer loans to low-risk clients.\n\nHence, MercadoLibre seems well positioned to grow rapidly in both e-commerce and fintech markets.",

Barclays raised Marvell's price target to $150, betting big on its proprietary serializer/deserializer tech and a projected $4 billion ASIC market by 2026. Broadcom got a boost, too\u2014its target jumped to $260, as analysts expect $21 billion to flow into its custom chip division by FY26. Lumentum Holdings (LITE, Financial) is another dark horse, scoring a double upgrade to Overweight thanks to explosive hyperscaler adoption beyond Google (GOOG, Financial). Barclays is drawing battle lines: the AI chip market is splitting into \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d, and traditional semis, analog, and PC chips are getting left in the dust.\n\nThe big picture?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"",

            "content": "Nvidia (NVDA), traditionally known for its dominance in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) technology, especially for powering AI applications like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, is now pivoting towards a new frontier in the semiconductor industry: Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This strategic shift is signaled by Nvidia\u2019s plan to hire 1,000 engineers in Taiwan to develop ASIC technology, a move that comes amid a noticeable market trend towards specialized silicon chips.\n\nASICs are designed for specific tasks, delivering efficiency and speed that surpass the general-purpose capabilities of GPUs. This specialization makes ASICs especially well-suited for AI inference tasks\u2014the phase where an AI model applies its trained parameters to make predictions or decisions based on new data. As demand grows for chips optimized for real-world AI applications, such as large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, ASICs are becoming increasingly appealing for their ability to meet these specialized needs. According to Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen, opting for AI inference chips could be financially more viable than \u2018buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others.\u2019\n\nThe demand for ASICs is backed by market forecasts predicting a significant growth in the inference AI chip market, expected to balloon from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $90.6 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 37.8% during the forecasted seven year period. This growth trajectory suggests that companies adept at producing these specialized chips could hold a competitive edge in the AI sector.\n\nNvidia\u2019s move into ASICs is not without context. The company faces challenges with its traditional GPU market, including recent reports of overheating issues causing order delays from major clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon\u2019s (AMZN)cloud unit. Additionally, regulatory challenges, such as President Joe Biden\u2019s AI framework restricting tech exports, add complexity to Nvidia\u2019s current business environment.\n\nThis has led to a scenario where diversifying into custom silicon could mitigate risks associated with GPU reliance. Nvidia is not alone in this race; competitors like Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are also intensifying their focus on custom chips. Broadcom\u2019s recent earnings highlighted a surge in demand for custom silicon, while Marvell is developing multi-chip systems tailored for AI. Google, with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) used for training advanced AI models like Gemini AI 2.0, has been a long-term player in this space, setting a benchmark for others to follow. In fact, the latest generation, Trillium TPUs, boasts impressive improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and scalability. Again, these advancements are crucial for handling the computational demands of cutting-edge AI models.\n\nNvidia\u2019s strategic expansion into ASIC development in Taiwan is a clear indication of recognizing where future growth in AI hardware might lie. With its deep expertise in silicon design and production, coupled with Taiwan\u2019s robust semiconductor ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to challenge rivals on this new front. This move could not only diversify Nvidia\u2019s product portfolio but also address current market and operational challenges by tapping into the burgeoning demand for specialized AI chips.\n\nHowever, success in this arena will depend on Nvidia\u2019s ability to quickly scale up its ASIC capabilities, navigate the competitive landscape, and meet the nuanced needs of AI application developers who demand both performance and cost-efficiency. The coming years will be crucial in determining whether Nvidia can leverage its GPU heritage to become a leader in the custom AI chip market or if it will face stiff competition from established and emerging players.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other semiconductor stocks.\n\nIn an updated forecast, The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) revised its 2024 projections upward, expecting a strong 19.0% YoY growth in the broader semiconductor market. The global market value for 2024 is now pegged at $627 billion, demonstrating improvement in performance in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, mainly in the computing sector. Growth in 2024 is expected to be aided by 2 Integrated Circuit segments- Memory, which can increase by 81.0%, and Logic, which is expected to grow by 16.9%.\n\nRegion-wise, the Americas and Asia Pacific are well-placed to lead the recovery, with expected growth rates of 38.9% and 17.5%, respectively.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for The Semiconductor Market?\n\nWSTS expects broad-based improvement for the semiconductor market in 2025, with an 11.2% growth, resulting in an estimated $697 billion in global market valuation. This growth is expected off the back of the Logic and Memory sectors, which together are expected to surpass $400 billion in value. This consists of a YoY growth of more than 17% for Logic and 13% for Memory. Notably, other semiconductor categories are projected to grow at more modest, single-digit rates, demonstrating a steady expansion for the broader industry.\n\nWSTS believes that, in 2025, all the regions will be well-placed for continued expansion. The Americas and Asia Pacific regions will maintain their double-digit growth year over year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends Likely to Aid Semiconductor Market in 2025\n\nIDC predicted some critical trends in the semiconductor market. While AI-driven rapid growth continues to be on top of the list, the Asia-Pacific IC (Integrated Circuits) design market will continue to heat up. The memory segment is expected to be aided by the increased penetration of high-end products including HBM3 and HBM3e, which are needed for AI Accelerator, and the new generation of HBM4, which is expected to be rolled out in H2 2025. The non-memory segment is expected to be supported by healthy demand for advanced node ICs for AI servers, high-end mobile phone ICs, and WiFi7.\n\nAs per IDC, Asia-Pacific IC design product lines remain rich and diversified. Since inventory levels have been stabilizing, demand for personal devices is picking up, and AI computing continues to extend to a wide range of applications, the overall demand for IC design is expected to increase. Mature nodes (22nm-500nm) continue to have a wide range of applications spanning consumer electronics, industrial control, automotive, and other industry segments. Looking ahead, the demand is anticipated to improve after the correction and oversupply. This is expected to be aided by consumer electronics and periodical inventory replenishment across automotive and industrial control sectors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings. After getting an initial list of 12-15 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global semiconductor company, which is engaged in designing, developing, and supplying a range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. In FY24, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s semiconductor revenue came at a record $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue, which increased 220% YoY, was fueled by its leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. The fundamentals of the company\u2019s cyclical semiconductor businesses are now stabilizing, with most sectors well-placed for recovery in fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe infrastructure software business continues to see positive momentum, with healthy conversions and upsells to its VCF full-stack solution. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has maintained a stable revenue growth trajectory despite fluctuating revenues due to delayed deals. Furthermore, the analysts are optimistic about the company\u2019s expanding Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM). Morgan Stanley upped its price target on the company\u2019s shares from $233.00 to $265.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 20 December.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3 hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at different rates during the upcoming 3 years. As per the company\u2019s CEO, in 2027, the company believes each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters throughout a single fabric. Therefore, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) anticipates this to represent an AI revenue SAM (serviceable addressable market) for XPUs and networking of between $60 billion \u2013 $90 billion in fiscal 2027.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of the best semiconductor stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In addition to AVGO and GS, the list includes two AI-fueled enterprise software plays in ServiceNowand ExlService Holdings, as well as pipeline operator Energy Transfer.\n\nWith the fourth-quarter earnings period in full swing and the Trump rally finding its footing in the past week, thanks to soothing inflation readings, Goldman Sachs and Energy Transfer have staged breakouts, while Broadcom stock, ServiceNow and EXLS are flashing early entry opportunities.\n\nBroadcom and ExlService stock are part of the flagship IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. SwingTrader has opened positions in ServiceNow stock, Goldman Sachs, Broadcom and the Global X MLP & Energy Infrastructure ETF that lists ET among its top holdings.\n\nBe sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column after each trading day to get the latest on the prevailing stock market trend and what it means for your trading decisions.\n\nBroadcom Stock\n\nBroadcom, Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day, has etched out a five-week flat base since vaulting on its Dec. 12 fiscal Q4 earnings report. The upside was modest, but the reaction to Broadcom's outlook was explosive, with $60 billion to $90 billion in AI-driven revenue from its top 3 custom-chip customers seen for 2027.\n\nBroadcom has multiple quarters of accelerating earnings and revenue growth, contributing to its superlative 99 IBD Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating factors in both fundamental and technical data.\n\nSwingTrader opened a position in AVGO on Thursday as it reclaimed its 21-day exponential average and broke a short-term downtrend, offering an early entry. Broadcom, which rallied 5.85% on the week to 237.44, has an official buy point of 251.88.\n\nGoldman stock\n\nGoldman Sachs gapped past its 50-day moving average and an early entry point on Wednesday, as it posted Q4 earnings of $11.95 a share, up 118% from a year ago and $3.74 ahead of estimates.\n\nMorgan Stanley hiked its GS price target to 782 from 736, citing \"high conviction that we are at the early stages of a multiyear capital markets cycle.\" Morgan Stanley sees Goldman Sachs as being the best positioned among covered stocks to benefit and expects \"more blowout quarters throughout 2025.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs stock rallied 11.8% to 625.94 for the week. Shares cleared a 612.73 buy point. The buy zone runs through 643.37.\n\nDecisive Bullish Move With Trump Inauguration Due; What To Do Now\n\nServiceNow Stock\n\nServiceNow was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day . The Santa Clara, Calif., company's cloud-based software platform automates IT processes, integrates with other enterprise-software platforms and churns out analytics for informed decision-making.\n\nIn a Dec. 12 note, Truist analyst Joel Fishbein wrote that ServiceNow had expanded its addressable market by $54 billion, moving into adjacent markets as legacy providers struggled to deal with increasingly complex IT environments. On Dec. 10, Cowen analyst Derrick Wood hiked his NOW price target to 1,300 from 1,025, saying the company is in the early innings of a powerful AI product cycle, with two more data-focused products set for release early this year.\n\nNOW rose 4.6% to 1,071.48 for the week, closing the week just above its 10-week and 50-day moving averages. NOW is actionable on the break of the downtrend from its Dec. 11 high, but look for a more convincing move past its 10-week line.\n\nServiceNow is set to next report earnings on Jan. 29.\n\nIn a recent interview with IBD, Chief Executive Bill McDermott talked about ServiceNow's artificial intelligence strategy.\n\nExlService Stock\n\nExlService was featured as IBD Stock Of The Day on Dec. 18, before its recent move higher. The company, which provides data management solutions for the insurance industry, health care, banking and more, is now capitalizing on its industry-specific knowledge to deliver tailored solutions that empower clients with AI-driven analytics.\n\nOne example is ExlService's insurance LLM, or large language model. CEO Rohit Kapoor said on the Oct. 30 Q3 earnings call that it is \"specifically designed to handle the nuances of auto bodily injury, workers' compensation and general liability claims.\" He added that the model was \"live\" with a large U.S.-based casualty and life insurer and a regional casualty insurer.\n\nAfter the Q3 report, William Blair analyst Jesse Wilson noted that deals over $25 million had grown by more than 25% from a year ago, adding that AI-related deals should increase gross margins.\n\nEXLS stock powered up 2.5% to 46.25 on Monday, breaking above its 50-day line and flashing an early entry. Shares closed the week up 4.5% at 47.15. Shares finished just below a 47.37 buy point from a six-week flat base after topping that level intraday Friday.\n\nEarnings are expected around Feb. 27, according to FactSet.\n\nEnergy Transfer Stock\n\nEnergy Transfer operates more than 130,000 miles of pipeline and related energy infrastructure in 44 states, transporting crude oil, natural gas and handling fractionation of natural gas liquids into distinct products.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Energy Transfer said it would begin construction of an intrastate natural gas pipeline connecting the Permian Basin to premier markets and trading hubs to serve growing demand. On Dec. 19, the company entered into a 20-year agreement to supply Chevron with 2 million tons of liquified natural gas, or LNG, per year.\n\nBank of America raised its price target for Energy Transfer to 23 from 20 on Jan. 10, keeping a buy rating. The firm listed ET as a favorite midstream name for 2025, highlighting three factors propelling the group: an increase in Permian natural gas and liquids growth; belief that the reliability and speed to market of natural gas makes it a logical choice for data-center expansion; and an LNG rally in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nET rose 4.5% to 20.29 last week, clearing a 20.02 buy point from a six-week flat base.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund\u2019s assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness\u2019 investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR\u2019s flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC\u2019s Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn\u2019t harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn\u2019t short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness\u2019 criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment\u2019s Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management\u2019s stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nAQR Capital Management\u2019s stake as of Q3: $558.8 million\n\nOne of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company\u2019s core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications.\n\nBack on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company\u2019s serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings.\n\nFor its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company\u2019s semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn\u2019t fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Stock splits were a major market theme in 2024, with some of the world's biggest names joining the list. Companies across sectors, from Walmart to Chipotle Mexican Grill, launched such operations last year. And Nvidia and Broadcom led the wave in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, each completing a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nWhy do investors love stock splits? Even though they don't change anything fundamental about a company, they do lower the per-share price, making the stock more accessible to a wider range of investors. And the move also could be seen as a sign of confidence from management, with the idea that the stock has what it takes to rise from its new lower price.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nSo, it's logical that investors are always on the lookout for stock splits, especially when a very successful company's share price has soared to high levels. And one particular AI company right now is looking ripe for a split. The stock climbed 65% last year and today trades for more than $600. My prediction is this well-known company will be the next AI player to announce a split.\n\nThe only \"Magnificent Seven\" player that hasn't split its stock\n\nBefore I give away the name of this company, I'll offer you one more clue about its identity. This tech giant is the only member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" --the stocks that drove last year's market gains -- that never has launched a stock split. I'm talking about Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), owner of social media platforms Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\nThanks to its social media dominance -- more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of its apps daily -- Meta has seen its revenue and profit climb into the billions of dollars. And its shares have followed the upward path, today trading near a record high.\n\nMeta generates most of its revenue through advertising as advertisers seek to reach us where they know they'll find us -- using one of the company's apps. But Meta has aggressively expanded into AI, making it the company's biggest area of investment last year -- and Meta has suggested it will increase AI investments this year too.\n\nA goal of AIs for all users\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he's interested in developing AIs that all Meta users may rely on for whatever is important to them -- from business to leisure activities. To get there, the company developed its own large language model (LLM) and is now training the latest version, Llama 4. In the most recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said Meta's seeing fast adoption of the recently released Meta AI -- the company's first AI assistant -- and Llama is \"quickly becoming a standard across the industry.\"\n\nMeta can win in AI a few different ways. First, the more time we spend on Meta's apps -- thanks to potential AI tools and features -- the more advertisers will want to invest in reaching us there. That equals more revenue for Meta.\n\nSecond, Meta's AI investments could lead to other AI products and services. Finally, Meta's work in LLMs and making them available to the developer community could position the company to stand out as an AI leader. So Meta could be heading toward an exciting new era of growth.\n\nWhy is now the right time for a split?\n\nNow let's consider my prediction. Why is now a good time for Meta to split its stock? At more than $600, Meta may scare off some investors -- even though valuation looks very reasonable at 24x forward earnings estimates. The level of $1,000 per share represents a psychological barrier for some investors, who may consider the stock as pricey regardless of its valuation. So, companies that start approaching this level might think about launching an operation to avoid this problem.\n\nAlso, some investors don't have access to fractional shares -- and they may not have the budget to invest in Meta at today's level. So a stock split, lowering the per-share price by issuing more shares to current holders, could open up the investing opportunity to these potential buyers.\n\nFinally, as mentioned, Meta should see more growth ahead thanks to its investment in the area of AI -- so the stock has what it takes to climb from a new, lower price point.\n\nAll this supports the idea of announcing a stock split, and that's why I predict Meta will be the next AI player to make such a move. And the good news is, even if it doesn't, Meta still represents a solid long-term buy-and-hold candidate for growth investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock\u2019s 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company\u2019s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors. Additionally, the company\u2019s other AI solutions include PCIe Gen 5.0 switches, which serve as the open, standards-based fabric of choice for AI connectivity. They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities.\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "It seems clear that 2024 was the year of artificial intelligence (AI) -- or was it? Although some of the market's biggest winners were AI stocks, they weren't uniformly top performers. If you had invested in an AI-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) at the beginning of last year, the chance that you would have beaten the market wasn't great, and if you did, it may have been a slim win.\n\nConsider the performance of some of the most popular AI-based exchange-traded funds: the Global X Robotics and AI ETF, the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF, the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF, the First Trust Nasdaq AI and Robotics ETF, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF versus the S&P 500:\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nSo what should you do this year? Choose AI stocks carefully and balance them with a mix of other stock types. If you invest in ETFs, make sure they're broad, or purchase a few in different categories to offset risk while maximizing your potential for gains.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), PalantirTechnologies(NASDAQ: PLTR), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) are all top choices for excellent AI stock picks in 2025.\n\n1. Nvidia: More than generative AI\n\nNvidia is unquestionably the stock most associated with AI. That's because it practically has a monopoly on the graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary to handle the workload that makes generative AI possible. Some analysts believe it has as much as 95% of the market for these GPUs although competition is heating up.\n\nNvidia isn't worried, though. Not only is its lead quite stable, at least in the near term, but it's also expanding its repertoire with new technology to tackle new solutions for other kinds of technology.\n\nBefore generative AI became the best innovation since sliced bread about two years ago, it was already a highly successful company, if less familiar, for its chips that powered the gaming industry. So it's much more than a one-trick pony, even though it still has a powerful business in generative AI.\n\n2. Palantir: AI for large organizations\n\nPalantir was the dark horse candidate for AI superpower, but since launching its AI Platform, or AIP, in 2023, its business and stock have exploded.\n\nThe company helps large organizations, including governments, capture and organize vast amounts of data, creating patterns and deciphering information. Its sales hinge on large contracts, and it closed 104 deals in the 2024 third quarter. Not only are sales rising at a high rate -- 44% in the third quarter -- but it's extremely profitable and generating increasing free cash flow.\n\nPalantir stock soared 340% last year and has become quite expensive. But the opportunity is still underappreciated, and 2025 should be another strong year.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor: The company behind the chips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a foundry (or manufacturer) of all kinds of semiconductors and GPUs. It works with most of the chipmakers you know, like Nvidia, which design chips but don't actually produce them.\n\nAlthough its chips are not at all limited to AI, that's where the opportunity is today. What makes the company such a reliable long-term bet is that even if there are new challengers to Nvidia, and even if AI gets displaced to make room for the next trend in technology, Taiwan Semiconductor will still be there to manufacture the chips to make it all possible.\n\nThat's for way into the future. In 2025, it's in position to demonstrate excellent performance as demand for generative AI continues to accelerate.\n\n4. Amazon: Bringing practical AI to businesses\n\nAmazon is creating generative AI solutions for all different kinds of companies. It has launched a multibillion-dollar business offering a large assortment of services for its cloud computing clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.\n\nIt has its 3-layer system, which provides tools for programmers to develop their own custom large-language models (LLMs); the Bedrock layer, for programmers to use Amazon's LLMs; and the top layer, ready-to-use solutions for small enterprise customers.\n\nManagement thinks this is just the tip of the iceberg, and the generative AI business presents massive opportunities for Amazon in 2025 and beyond.\n\n5. Broadcom: Connecting all the parts of AI\n\nBroadcom is a technology infrastructure company that has pivoted to harness the power of AI, gearing its business to tap into those opportunities. It provides the semiconductors and infrastructure that make connections between software and hardware, and you can already imagine how it's necessary for AI, which needs specialized chips to run data at lightning-fast speeds.\n\nLike the other stocks on this list, what makes Broadcom so attractive as an investment is that it has incredible tailwinds heading into 2025 with untapped opportunities in AI, but it also has a large and varied business that won't fade away when the AI bandwagon slows down.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

The rise comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.54%) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -2.15%) were up 1% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\nNew year, new target\n\nBroadcom received a price target boost Friday from an analyst at Barclays. In a research report on Friday, analyst Thomas O'Malley adjusted his price target for Broadcom from $205 to $260. The new target represents a roughly 10% upside from its current levels. Barclays maintains a buy rating for Broadcom stock.\n\nOther firms agree. The investment bank Oppenheimer recently rated Broadcom as one of the top semiconductor stocks for 2025. Broadcom was joined by other heavy hitters like Nvidia and Marvell Technology.\n\nA key partner delivers\n\nThe upgrade comes the day after Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), Broadcom's fabrication partner, reported stronger-than-expected earnings.\n\nTSMC delivered $26.4 billion in revenue for Q4 when $25.8 was expected. While this 38.8% year-over-year (YOY) jump is impressive, TSMC was able to grow net income by an incredible 57% YOY.\n\nThe earnings show that AI-driven demand for chipmaking is as strong as ever -- good news for other semiconductor stocks up and down the value chain, Broadcom included. However, next year will not be without challenges for the company. Its current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 183 is extremely high. It will have to execute nearly flawlessly if its stock is to continue its climb.",

These stories include vendor news, business stories, how-to content about building and selling your business, news about trends such as artificial intelligence, and more. Here\u2019s this week\u2019s round-up of news from ChannelE2E.\n\nLast week, Broadcom named Brian Moats as the company's new Senior Vice President of Global Commercial Sales and Partners , replacing Cindy Loyd, who will transition to a new role in the organization, Broadcom said.\n\nMoats brings over 20 years of experience in sales leadership, channel development, and business strategy within the technology sector, Broadcom said in a statement shared with ChannelE2E. The company said his expertise will support Broadcom's efforts to strengthen the partner ecosystem and drive continued growth.\n\nIn a blog published today , Moats spoke to partners and outlined his vision for 2025. He said his first step would be listening to feedback and looking for ways to collaborate.\n\n\"As I step into my new role leading Broadcom\u2019s Global Commercial Sales and Partner organization, I look forward to connecting directly with you \u2014 listening to your perspectives and feedback, while further collaborating on how we can drive mutual growth and achieve shared goals,\" Moats said in the blog.\n\nCoro Poised to Capitalize on MSPs\u2019 Demand for SMB Cybersecurity\n\nOver the last 18 months, MSPs have increasingly moved into offering cybersecurity services in addition to their standard IT management services. Coro co-founder Dror Liwer has noticed the trend, and his company is seeing the results as MSPs move into the market.\n\nNot every MSP has the in-house know-how to offer advanced cybersecurity services, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t offer those services to customers, Liwer said. Coro\u2019s platform is designed to enable MSPs with those capabilities without having to expand their workforce with specialized talent, he told ChannelE2E in a conversation late last year. Coro\u2019s platform includes cybersecurity protection for users, endpoints, email, cloud, networks and also provides data governance.\n\n\u201cIt is very easy to deploy, and you don't have to have a cybersecurity team because the product was designed to be managed by IT people, which the MSP has,\u201d Liwer said. \u201cWe view it as enabling them to generate a brand new revenue stream and protect their existing customer base.\u201d\n\nCoro is seeing success with its efforts in the MSP market with its channel-first strategy. The company currently reports that 82% of revenue is generated from partners, and Coro expects that to grow to 90% in the coming year.\n\nPerspectives: Top 3 Things MSPs Should Know About CMMC\n\nThe new CMMC rule has created a lot of confusion and anxiety for managed service providers (MSPs), especially those serving the defense industrial base (DIB). With the final rule now in effect as of December 16, 2024, it's crucial for MSPs to understand their position in this evolving landscape. Here are the three most critical aspects that every MSP serving the DIB needs to understand.",

The movement appears to be supported by positive developments in the semiconductor sector, highlighted by Taiwan Semiconductor's robust earnings report, which has stirred optimism across related stocks.\n\nBroadcom has shown resilience with its strong performance metrics. The company's current stock price is $237.04, and it has posted a year-to-date price change of 1.73%. Broadcom's market capitalization stands at a formidable $1.11 trillion, indicative of its substantial presence in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, the company\u2019s GF Value, which factors in its intrinsic value, considers the stock to be significantly overvalued. Investors can check the latest GF Value metrics for Broadcom by visiting the GF Value page.\n\nOn the valuation front, Broadcom's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is notably high at 193.34, reflecting market expectations of robust growth. However, the stock's dividend yield is close to a ten-year low, which might pose some concerns for income-focused investors. Despite the high valuation, the company's financial strength is underscored by a strong Altman Z-score of 7.19, suggesting that Broadcom is financially stable and less susceptible to bankruptcy risks.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Broadcom's future prospects. Barclays recently increased the price target for AVGO from $205 to $260, indicating a potential upside and maintaining a 'buy' rating. Oppenheimer also singled out Broadcom as a key semiconductor stock to watch in 2025, positioning it alongside industry leaders such as Nvidia and Marvell Technology.\n\nDespite its hefty valuation metrics, Broadcom's expanding operating margin and consistent revenue growth highlight its capability to capitalize on market opportunities. As the company continues to strengthen its foothold in both semiconductor and software markets, Broadcom stands poised to deliver value to its shareholders in the years ahead.",

Those acquisition plans were reportedly complicated by the company's debt pile of $50 billion and potential antitrust concerns.\n\nOf course, we do not yet know whether the entity alluded to within SemiAccurate's email is indeed Broadcom or an entirely different vector.\n\nMeanwhile, Pat Gelsinger - the architect of Intel's foundry strategy - resigned back in December amid escalating tensions within the company's board which reportedly culminated in an ultimatum of sorts: either Gelsinger depart voluntarily or face getting fired. Of course, Intel's middling performance in the AI arena and continuing market share losses to AMD might have also influenced this outcome.\n\nComing back, SemiAccurate believes that Intel's mystery buyer has the resources to acquire the whole of Intel at its current valuation, which stood at ~$90 billion at the time of publication.\n\nInvestors appear to be reacting positively to this tidbit, with Intel shares currently up nearly 10 percent.

            "content": "According to the company, it can create more direct die-to-die interconnects by stacking the silicon dies face-to-face (F2F) before bonding them together directly, reducing the distances between the computing, memory, and I/O chips in the package and removing the TSVs between them. The arrangement creates a high-density interconnect that can sling 10X more signals between silicon dies with minimal noise and stronger mechanical robustness. They consume 10X less power than the PHYs that physically link chiplets on the plane of the silicon interposer.\n\nBroadcom said its special approach to custom chip design and the IP inside its 3.5D packaging technology enables the efficient correct-by-construction of all power, clock, and signal interconnects in the 3D stack.\n\nThe 3D-stacked accelerator is stacked on the silicon interposer with 2.5D packaging technology before being surrounded by the other chiplets, including the HBM that feeds the accelerator as fast as possible with data.\n\nWhile the I/O chips under the AI accelerators are all about communicating internally with the HBM and other chiplets in the package, multi-protocol connectivity chiplets could be added that communicate externally with the other accelerators, processors, and memory chips in the server or spread out around the data center. These I/O chips, located on the north and south sides of the package in Figure 2, can come with building blocks of IP for Ethernet, PCI Express (PCIe), and Compute Express Link (CXL).\n\n\u201cBy stacking chip components vertically, Broadcom's 3.5D platform enables chip designers to pair the right fabrication processes for each component while shrinking the interposer and package size,\u201d said Ostojic. It thus reduces the risk of warping, which is a huge challenge in chiplet-based designs. Heat created by all of the building blocks can cause different materials in the package to expand at different rates, warping them in ways that may impact the processor\u2019s performance or cause it to malfunction.\n\nCan Broadcom Deal with the Complexities of 3D Chip Packaging?\n\nBuilding these big AI chips isn\u2019t a trivial task. Broadcom said it\u2019s incorporating innovations in everything from process technology and advanced packaging to design and testing to deal with the immense complexity of these superchips. Significant defects in any one part of the multi-die system can be catastrophic, and as semiconductor companies cram more and more silicon dies in the package, the risks are on the rise. On top of that, pinpointing the root cause of a problem is much more difficult in 3D configurations of chiplets.\n\nWhile 3D silicon stacking gives engineers more ways to optimize performance, power, area, and other metrics, it opens the door to a wide range of design difficulties. One of the tougher challenges is routing signals rapidly and reliably to all of these building blocks in the package while reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and other types of signal noise. Delivering power smoothly and efficiently to everything is also more difficult due to the increasingly complex arrangements of chiplets and the growing power demands of modern AI chips.\n\nYet another problem relates to thermal management, which means managing the heat caused by cramming all of these chiplets so close together in the package. Though stacking silicon dies keeps everything in close proximity, it becomes trickier to remove the heat between them before it saps the chip\u2019s performance of the processor. What\u2019s more, dissipating heat from any one of the components can negatively impact the thermal situation in the silicon dies stacked on top of or placed underneath it.\n\nWhile leveraging TSMC\u2019s most advanced process and packaging technologies in XDSiP, Broadcom said it\u2019s also bringing a lot of know-how in designing and testing complex 3D-stacked chips to the table. The company is putting it all to the test with the development of the first XPU based on its F2F 3.5D technology. The chip, comprised of four computer tiles stacked on top of one large I/O chiplet surrounded by six HBM modules, implements TSMC's advanced process nodes and CoWoS technology for 2.5D packaging.\n\nThe company is also building the 3.5D packaging technology around industry-standard EDA tools that are getting much better at validating the operation of all components in the package as well as everything in between.\n\nFurther out, Fujitsu is adopting Broadcom\u2019s 3.5D packaging technology to build its latest high-performance server CPU called Monaka. The processor will feature 288 Arm-based CPU cores fabricated on TSMC\u2019s N2 node, which will be one of the most\u2014if not the most\u2014advanced process technologies on the market when it enters mass production in 2026. These are then stacked on top of cache memory chiplets based on 5 nm that, in turn, will be placed on a silicon interposer with CoWoS.\n\nThe SRAM that serves the processor\u2019s cache memory isn\u2019t scaling at the same pace as the logic at the heart of high-performance chips. Broadcom said it makes more sense\u2014both in terms of cost and complexity\u2014to put the memory and computing into separate chiplets, each fabricated on the best process technology for the job, before binding them together in 3D. Fujitsu plans to introduce Monaka in 2027.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Cheap Stock Picks\n\nTech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a problem. I view it as they\u2019ve won. They\u2019ve won the technology side. They\u2019ve won on the business-model side, and they\u2019re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\n\nOverall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The company recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings, posting $14.05 billion in revenue, marking a significant increase of more than 51% from the same quarter the previous year. Semiconductor revenue reached an all-time high of $30.1 billion, with AI revenue contributing $12.2 billion, reflecting a 220% year-over-year surge.

For the fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA climbed by 37% compared to the previous year, setting a new record at $31.9 billion.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is grabbing investors\u2019 attention as the company plays a crucial role in powering products across various sectors, from data centers to smartphones. Impressively, more than 99% of all internet traffic flows through its technology, underscoring its leadership in networking. In addition, the acquisition of cloud virtualization firm VMware, completed a year ago, has bolstered Broadcom\u2019s position. VMware\u2019s operating margin has climbed to 70%, and Broadcom is on course to surpass its goal of achieving an adjusted EBITDA of over $8.5 billion within three years.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.04%, as of January 15. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 14 consecutive years. The company\u2019s cash reserves enabled it to achieve this dividend growth. In the most recent quarter, it generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow amounted to $5.48 billion. This cash flow accounted for 39% of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 indicated that 128 hedge funds, down from 130 in the previous quarter, owned stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). These stakes have a total value of more than $14.5 billion.\n\nOverall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

In fact, it has been documented (see \"Research Cites Nutanix in Market Shift Away from VMware\").\n\nNutanix has been particularly active in wooing disgruntled VMware users (see \"Nutanix Hybrid Cloud Offering on AWS Targets VMware Users\"), even presenting a webcast on the trend (see \"Moving to Nutanix from VMware for a Simpler, More Efficient Future\"). The company as also published a \"Streamline VMware-to-Nutanix Migrations\" whitepaper and the \"VMware to Nutanix Migration Promotion\" along with \"Leave Legacy Behind: Transition from VMware to Nutanix\" guidance.\n\nThe company Veeam has also gotten in on the act, publishing \"Research Report: VMware Customers Weigh Alternatives.\"\n\nAnother company, CloudBolt, also examined the issue (see \"CloudBolt Paper Examines 'VMware Acquisition Aftermath'\").\n\nResearch firm Forrester, meanwhile, published \"Navigating The Disruption Of Broadcom's Acquisition Of VMware,\" which discusses the challenges and opportunities for VMware in the evolving cloud landscape, along with \"Map Out Your VMware Options, Post-Broadcom.\"\n\nGartner has also addressed the issue with \"Broadcom (VMware) vs Nutanix.\"\n\nAlong with moving applications on to Nutanix, Evalueserve runs the Nutanix AHV hypervisors across all of its datacenters worldwide, which further enables them to simplify the management of workloads for customers and employees, the company said.\n\nGetting back to this week's news, Nutanix exec Faiz Shakir weighed in: \"Nutanix has been helping customers explore alternatives and migrate to our platform since Nutanix was founded. In this example, we helped Evalueserve improve application performance, and strengthen its security and governance controls. The migration from its multivendor environment was also done without disruption to Evalueserve's operations, and it simplified the management of its IT.\"\n\nBut Broadcom hasn't been reticent in addressing these developments, (see \"As VMware Competitors Circle, Broadcom Makes New Partners\" and \"After AWS Licensing Tiff, Broadcom Strengthens VMware/Azure Cloud Ties.\") It also has responded on many other fronts.\n\nAnd all the defections don't seem to have affected Broadcom's bottom line much, as the company just last month reported strong financial results, with one of those being revenue of $14,054 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, up 51 percent from the prior year period.\n\nStay tuned for further developments in this ongoing saga.\n\n\n\n",

Unlike Nvidia\u2019s general-purpose GPUs, XPUs are tailored for specific tasks, highlighting the contrasting roles of these chips in large model applications: ASICs excel at inference, while GPUs are better suited for training.\n\nBoth Sutskever\u2019s and Tan\u2019s predictions hinted at the same underlying shift: the demand for AI chips is evolving, and GPUs could be ceding their dominance to ASICs.\n\nThe market responded swiftly. On December 13, Broadcom\u2019s stock surged 24%, catapulting its valuation past USD 1 trillion. Meanwhile, Nvidia faced four consecutive days of stock declines. Even before this spike, Broadcom had already reached a valuation of USD 800 billion. This remarkable rise reflects a pivotal shift in investor sentiment: the belief that the era of intensive pre-training is winding down, opening the door for ASICs to erode Nvidia\u2019s market share and drive Broadcom\u2019s growth.\n\nHowever, the new wave of AI chip competition may not be as intense as anticipated.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s ascent\n\nBroadcom\u2019s latest financial results exceeded market expectations, driven by robust growth across key segments. AI-related revenue for the fiscal year soared by 220%, propelling the semiconductor division\u2019s revenue to a record USD 30.1 billion, a 7% year-on-year increase. Combined with CEO Hock Tan\u2019s optimistic forecast for the 2027 market scale, Broadcom\u2019s ASIC business is now viewed as entering a pivotal growth phase.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s business operates under two primary categories: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure hardware. The infrastructure hardware division, which experienced a 196% year-on-year revenue surge thanks to VMware\u2019s integration, was the main contributor to Broadcom\u2019s overall 44% revenue growth for the year. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s original software business saw only marginal increases.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Broadcom reported a net profit of USD 4.32 billion, bolstered by revenue growth and improved operational efficiencies. Business integration efforts further reduced expense ratios, accelerating profit realization.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s networking segment, part of its semiconductor solutions division, has become a cornerstone of its growth. ASICs now account for 32% of the company\u2019s revenue, making them its largest revenue contributor. This segment also includes Ethernet switch and router chips, PHY chips, and optical transceivers, underscoring the breadth of Broadcom\u2019s networking portfolio.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s foray into the ASIC business began with its 2016 acquisition of storage company LSI, and it has since become a major growth driver. Historically, Broadcom\u2019s Ethernet switch products were the flagship of its data center networking equipment portfolio, where the company held a dominant position.\n\nThe rapid expansion of AI data centers has significantly increased demand for networking equipment. For instance, AI systems powered by Nvidia\u2019s chips typically require around nine 1.6T optical modules per machine. This surge in demand has driven up the stock prices of optical module manufacturers like Marvell, whose valuation has doubled over the past year due to Nvidia\u2019s strong market presence.\n\nBroadcom initially benefited from this trend with its switch products. However, Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox in 2019 disrupted this dynamic, allowing Nvidia to enter the switch market and directly compete with Broadcom.\n\nIn response, Broadcom has leaned heavily into its ASIC business, which has emerged as a crucial cash cow within its networking division.\n\nEnd of Nvidia\u2019s dominance?\n\n\u201cThe deceleration of Nvidia\u2019s growth is inevitable, but being surpassed or replaced is impossible,\u201d one investor said.\n\nWhile Broadcom\u2019s ascent is clear, whether Nvidia can truly be replaced remains an open question. From a technical perspective, GPUs are also capable of performing inference tasks, despite ASICs being commonly associated with them. For instance, Nvidia\u2019s GB200 chip delivers inference performance 30 times greater than its H100 predecessor.\n\nThat said, ASICs excel in scenarios requiring low power consumption and compact designs, making them better suited for edge applications. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s dominance and premium pricing have positioned it as a shared adversary for companies seeking cost-effective alternatives in the AI sector.\n\nBroadcom, as the most viable competitor, has gained industry support from those looking to diversify away from Nvidia. Still, market analysts caution that Broadcom\u2019s gains may be overhyped, while Nvidia\u2019s stock could be undervalued. The slowdown in pre-training does not necessarily signal the decline of general-purpose models. Furthermore, widespread ASIC adoption could disrupt existing large language model frameworks, which remain central to AI\u2019s current landscape.\n\nKrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nOver the past few days, the proverbial waters have become quite murky due to the lack of visibility over TSMC's supposed travails related to its bespoke wafer-level system integration platform, CoWoS. Now, however, analysts at Morgan Stanley have stepped up to offer some much-needed clarity on this topic and its implications, if any, on NVIDIA's product roll out.\n\nAs per a recent report by The Information, NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers purportedly continue to face overheating and glitching issues, apparently prompting the chipmaker's mega customers, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, to pare their respective Blackwell orders. The report went on to note that Blackwell's woes stem from the \"way [those] chips connect,\" alluding to a possible flaw within TSMC's bespoke advanced packaging solution, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), which enables the integration of multiple chips into a single package.\n\nThis report struck a nerve with investors, especially as NVIDIA had declared back in 2024 that it was able to rectify Blackwell's performance-related teething issues by implementing minor changes to the photomask, a specific template that is used to create patterns on chip wafers.\n\nHowever, soon after, DigiTimes calmed perturbed investors by leveraging its internal sources within TSMC to report that, contrary to The Information's report, TSMC has \"maintained\" its existing Blackwell orders, negating the rumored decrease in orders from NVIDIA's mega customers.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s view on TSMC\u2019s CoWoS order fluctuations highlights that some customers, like $AMD and Broadcom, are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand. $NVDA, however, has stepped in and requested $TSM to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.\u2026 https://t.co/jneCfh0goi \u2014 Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 15, 2025\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh note, shedding some much-needed additional light on this topic. According to the Wall Street titan, some TSMC customers, including AMD and Broadcom, \"are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand.\"\n\nThis aligns with a separate note penned by Nomura, which notes that NVIDIA \"could slash CoWoS-S orders from TSMC and UMC by up to 80% in 2025 due to weaker demand for Hopper platform chips.\"\n\nBear in mind that NVIDIA's Hopper chips utilize TSMC's CoWoS-S tech while the newer Blackwell chips leverage the global chip fabrication giant's CoWoS-L packaging tech.\n\nComing back, Morgan Stanley then goes on to note that, in light of CoWoS-S capacity cancelations, NVIDIA \"has stepped in and requested TSMC to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley also declares:\n\n\"Despite these shifts, TSMC\u2019s overall CoWoS demand remains steady, with a slight potential increase in GB300A production later this year.\"\n\nThis means that The Information's report might have been partially correct: there have been order cancelations at TSMC. However, as clarified by Morgan Stanley, the cancelations only affect orders that leverage TSMC\u2019s CoWoS-S packaging technology and that NVIDIA's Blackwell orders likely remain unaffected.",

            "content": "Broadcom\u2019s $61 billion acquisition of VMware in November 2023 and the subsequent changes to venerable virtualization company\u2019s business model and pricing have rankled many long-time enterprise users, a situation that has been highly publicized despite assertions by Broadcom and VMware executives that such reports are little than FUD \u2013 short for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\nA survey of 300 enterprise IT executives last year by cloud financial management company CloudBolt Software revealed a range of concerns VMware users had about the acquisition from uncertainly about Broadcom\u2019s plans and a mandatory shift to subscription (rather than perpetual) licenses to anticipated price increases \u2013 some reports have talked of 150 percent to 200 percent jumps \u2013 and the forced bundling of products. About 95 percent of respondents saw the acquisition as disruptive to their IT strategies.\n\nAT&T is a high-profile example. The telecommunication giant has claimed in court documents that Broadcom quoted it a 1,050 percent increase and last year sued the company for allegedly refusing to honor a renewal for support services.\n\nGiven all that, it\u2019s not surprising that VMware customers are looking for options for their virtualized workloads. Red Hat apparently is on the list. The IBM-owned company had always had conversations with VMware users inquiring about its OpenShift container and OpenStack virtualization platform, with much of the talk focusing on modernization, according to Simon Seagrave, senior principal product marketing manager.\n\n\u201cCustomers came to us because they wanted to bring their virtualized workloads onto a modern platform that would then allow them to modernize these specialized workloads onto containerized cloud native instances using things like serverless, DevOps, sort of GitHub methodologies, and so forth,\u201d Seagrave tells The Next Platform.\n\nHowever, the content of the conversations changed soon after Broadcom bought VMware. Almost immediately Red Hat began getting calls from VMware users that were tinged with more urgency.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found in the last year is that customers obviously, unfortunately, have had a little bit of sticker shock as renewal prices subscription based on their traditional virtualization platform,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were looking for alternatives. \u2026 Customers new and existing were coming to us. \u2018How can you help us? How quickly can you get us onto your platform?\u2019 It was very much a response to the events that happened within the virtualization industry.\u201d\n\nFor many of those enterprises, the goal was less about modernizing what they had by adding containerization capabilities and more about finding safe harbor for their virtualization workloads as their contracts with VMware expired. Red Hat this week is throwing them a lifeline with the launch of OpenShift Virtualization Engine, a new OpenShift edition that essentially removes the container capabilities to give VMware users a virtualization-only OpenShift option.\n\nSimilarly, Red Hat also unveiled Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) for Virtualization that comes with features in the vendor\u2019s ACM for Kubernetes tool but that focuses on tasks central to VM lifecycle management, such as provisioning, monitoring, and compliance.\n\nWith OVE, \u201cwe basically took an edition of OpenShift that was just primarily focused on virtualization only,\u201d Seagrave says. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same code. It\u2019s OpenShift virtualization. That\u2019s no different than the other editions of OpenShift at all. It\u2019s exactly the same, but it\u2019s really more of a consumption model. Basically, we get rid of any of the ability to run containers on the platform, although it can technically still do it. They just won\u2019t be license for it. It just focuses purely on virtualization. So as such, it\u2019s not a new product per se.\u201d\n\nIt includes the KVM hypervisor, can run both on-premises on hardware that supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and supported bare-metal cloud services in the cloud, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nACM for Virtualization is the same tool as ACM for Kubernetes but that only manages virtual workloads. This also is paired with Red Hat\u2019s Ansible automation platform. OVE also gives users access to Red Hat\u2019s Migration Tool for Virtualization (MTV) to ease the moving of workloads to the new OpenShift platform. The company also has a service where its experts assess the amount of work it will take to make the migration happen.\n\n\u201cWe find the pairing of OVE plus ACM for Virtualization and then Ansible for the migration of virtual machines at scale \u2013 but also for automating the data operations \u2013 is a support network of products that\u2019s really resonating with customers as they migrate across and with the prospect of running their VMs going forward,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pairing of Ansible and MTV also is key. Users can point MTV as the workloads they have in other environments \u2013 such as VMware or Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V \u2013 that they want to migrate and it will indicate which workloads will be easy to move and which ones will take more work. Some, such as those involved VMware\u2019s vSAN or NSX, will need more planning than easier ones, Seagrave says. MTV lets enterprises move those that are simplest first.\n\nThat works well for smaller and midsize enterprises, but some \u2013 including many VMware users that have contacted Red Hat since the Broadcom deal \u2013 can have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of VMs.\n\n\u201cThis is where we recommend the use of Ansible \u2026 that will allow them to migrate these at scale,\u201d he says. \u201cMTV still performs the migration across, but Ansible provides the way for all the automation around the migration at scale. It does allow for data operations, so after the fact, when they move their VMs over, they can continue to use Ansible with our pre-created playbooks or they can create their own playbooks that allow them to automate a lot of their data operational tasks.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Red Hat offered various editions of OpenShift that included both virtualization and containerization capabilities. OpenShift Kubernetes Engine (OKE) was for organizations that wanted basic Kubernetes containerized capabilities, while OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) brought in more advanced GitOps kinds of features, like CI/CD pipelines \u2013 for modernizing applications and deploying them at scale \u2013 and serverless capabilities, Seagrave says.\n\nAt the top is OpenShift Platform Plus, that includes everything with OKE and OCP as well as features like Advanced Cluster Security for compliance for virtual and container workloads and ACM. The idea of a virtualization-only version of OpenShift was on the roadmap, but Red Hat accelerated its development after the sharp increase of interest from VMware users after the Broadcom deal, he says.\n\nOVE and ACM for Virtualization are both available now.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Mastercard Incorporated (MA) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Broadcom shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+99.6% vs. +63%), with the stock jumping back following the blockbuster results on December 12th. The company reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter results, with revenues and earnings increasing year over year. The company benefited from strong demand for Broadcom\u2019s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking. Broadcom experienced four times growth in AI connectivity revenues, driven by global shipments of its Tomahawk and Jericho solutions. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. AVGO\u2019s strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, served as a key catalyst. However, non-AI semiconductor revenues declined, reflecting a cyclical downturn that acted as a headwind. High cash interest expenses, a higher tax burden, and ongoing restructuring costs related to the VMware acquisition affected overall profitability. (You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>> ) Shares of Mastercard have gained +14.4% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry\u2019s gain of +19.1%. The company\u2019s numerous acquisitions have helped it grow its addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. Mastercard expects low-teens net revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. The accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. MA's strong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through share repurchases and dividends. However, steep operating expenses might stress its margins in the future. The Zacks analyst expect total operating expenses to increase 10.9% year over year in 2024. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Also, it is overvalued than the industry at current levels. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. (You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>> ) Netflix shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+62.8% vs. +46.2%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention. NFLX added 5.07 million paid subscribers globally in Q3 2024. The planned launch of an in-house ad tech platform in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year in 2025. NFLX has raised its guidance for the full year 2024, projecting revenue growth at the high end of its previous 14-15% range. However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.

Howdyshell breaks down his company\u2019s five biggest bets in 2025 that will drive sales and customer momentum\u2014from Nvidia and HPE-Juniper to AI and XaaS.\n\nAdvizex\u2019s fearless leader, C.R. Howdyshell, has huge plans in store for 2025 with big investment bets on HPE\u2019s merger with Juniper Networks, driving Everything as a Service (XaaS) to new heights, and making AI sales represent a large portion of Advizex\u2019s total revenue thanks to an enhanced focus on Nvidia. \u201cAI could represent as much as one-third of our revenue at some point this year,\u201d said Advizex CEO Howdyshell, adding that AI sales hit $60 million in 2024. \u201cThe reason being is, it\u2019s not just about GPUs. It\u2019s about the software. We\u2019re excited about [Nvidia\u2019s] networking. And we think there\u2019s services that we can bring to the table.\u201d Howdyshell is also hopeful that VMware by Broadcom\u2019s new global channel leader, Brian Moats, can help drive services revenue for Advizex in 2025 with Moats\u2019 revamped partner strategy that includes shifting professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services. [Related: VMware-Broadcom Partners Weigh In On New Channel Chief\u2019s Vision And Strategy] \u201cOur hands are up in the air saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re ready. Tap us on the shoulder. We\u2019re ready to jump in the game when it comes to [VMware-Broadcom] services,\u2019\u201d said Howdyshell. Advizex Expects Over $320 Million In Sales This Year Advizex, a Fulcrum IT Partners company, is one of the top solution providers in North America with more than $280 million in revenue generated last year. The Independence, Ohio-based company expects to increase total sales by 15 percent in 2025 to over $320 million thanks to its bullish bets on market leaders like HPE and Nvidia as well as its own unique services. Advizex won CRN\u2019s prestigious Triple Crown Award in 2024 and ranks No. 115 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500 list. Howdyshell has a vast history in the tech industry spanning over 40 years, including the last six years running IT consulting and services specialist Advizex. In an interview with CRN, Howdyshell explains his company\u2019s biggest bets in 2025 that will drive sales and customer momentum, including the soon-to-be combined HPE and Juniper Networks, Dell Apex as well as Nvidia\u2019s expanding AI portfolio.\n\nNo. 5: Drive Services Margin Our bet is really taking our services to market in a big way this year. What you just heard from Broadcom, that\u2019s going to help. With what Nvidia is talking about, that\u2019s going to help. With what HPE, Aruba and Juniper are talking about, that\u2019s going to help us. Then Everything as a Service will help drive our professional services. Obviously, that\u2019s a very enhanced margin opportunity and we want to continue to grow that piece out. Our Microsoft services are very strong. Our ServiceNow is very strong. We feel like networking services are very strong. We also are seeing a pretty big uptick in colocation when it comes to services. So our big bets for this year are enhancing our services to more than just infrastructure: It\u2019s the whole portfolio. We want to do the whole wrap-around with Everything as a Service to drive more recurring revenues and value for customers to give them a choice.\n\nNo. 4: Broadcom-VMware\u2019s New Channel Strategy And Leader In 2025 We\u2019ve made a substantial investment in professional services around VMware. We\u2019re not seeing a significant uptick, though. It\u2019s pretty steady. It\u2019s good business but not a lot of growth. But with Moats\u2019 [goal of moving professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services] we would expect additional opportunities. IT would be a great opportunity for the channel, assuming there\u2019s some upside. Our hands are up in the air saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re ready. Tap us on the shoulder. We\u2019re ready to jump in the game when it comes to [VMware-Broadcom] services.\u2019 The opportunities are there. Let\u2019s just see how they want to go to market because partners like Advizex are more than capable and ready. I would say that some of the smaller customers are going to probably get left behind by Broadcom with its current business model. We had one of our larger 20-year customers just tell us they\u2019re not going to renew. But I will say that I\u2019ve seen their leadership become much more responsive. Some of their sales leadership, when we\u2019ve had some of these challenges, they seem to be much more responsive than they were six months ago. That shows a sense of urgency.\n\nNo. 3: Everything As A Service We\u2019re going to continue a large focus on Everything as a Service. So consumption, specifically with HPE GreenLake and Dell Apex as a service. We\u2019ve seen a big uptick with Pure Storage as a service as well, and we love the recurring revenues there. We feel like our Everything as a Service has really taken off, and the customer responses have been very supportive. We\u2019re excited about the recurring revenues. We\u2019re going to continue that as one of our core areas and big bets this year.\n\nNo. 2: HPE-Aruba-Juniper Merger The next one for us, in general, is networking. I think it\u2019s going to continue to grow regardless of what happens to the public cloud. Additionally, what OEMs we\u2019re going to bet on there is No. 1: HPE. We like what they\u2019re doing with Aruba. We also think the Juniper acquisition is going to line up really well with our strategic values. HPE with Aruba and Juniper and the services we can wrap all around that is a huge opportunity. We have the technical capabilities to sell the front end of this. The TAM [total addressable market] for networking is significant when you can add in the software and the services that we can do because the margin portfolio is enhanced.",

            "content": "Five Questions our Asia-Pacific Customers Ask\n\nShare \"Democratize GenAI through Private AI\" on Twitter\n\nShare \"Democratize GenAI through Private AI\" on Facebook\n\nShare \"Democratize GenAI through Private AI\" on LinkedIn\n\nIt was only in 2023 when generative AI (GenAI) exploded onto the market, changing the way organisations can monitor environments, create content, and automate operations. Organisations saw great potential, especially in AI applications improving customer support experiences, or creating content for sales, marketing, and other functions. Yet organisations also saw the risk of sharing their trusted data with cloud-based GenAI tools because that data could be used for training other AI models that competitors may access. While the focus has been on large language models (LLMs), most organisations only require AI models that are fine-tuned and customised with their domain-specific data to meet their unique business needs.\n\nOur Asia-Pacific customers want to understand how they can gain the benefits of GenAI without sacrificing privacy or control of their data. Below are answers to the five questions we most frequently hear from our customers:\n\n1. We want to embrace GenAI tools and applications, but training LLMs is expensive and time consuming. What\u2019s the best approach?\n\nOne of the myths of GenAI is that you have to build and then train LLMs from scratch. That can be expensive and time consuming. However, you can start with a good foundation model (open source or commercial) and fine-tune it with your private business data. This is the lowest cost and best approach to take. The key to this is to take an architectural approach that is open and flexible. This allows you to experiment with different AI models and fine-tune them with your domain-specific data. In this case, you bring your AI model adjacent to your data, so your data never leaves your data center. It remains within your control so you maintain privacy and compliance. We call that Private AI.\n\n2. We have specific compliance and security requirements for our data and AI applications. How do I ensure that we maintain security and compliance?\n\nThe best way to ensure security and compliance is to consider a Private AI architecture. There are three core principles to Private AI:\n\nHighly Distributed: compute capacity and trained AI models reside adjacent to where data is created, processed, and/or consumed, whether the data resides in a public cloud, private cloud, data center, or the edge. Organisations keep control of their data and AI models, maximizing security and privacy.\n\nData Privacy and Control: an organisation\u2019s data remains private to the organisation and is not used to train, tune, or augment any public models without the organisation\u2019s consent. The organisation maintains full control of its data without taking on the added risk of data leakage.\n\nAccess Control and Auditability: access controls are in place to govern access and changes to AI models, associated training data, and applications. This allows organisations to showcase that they are implementing GenAI in accordance with policies and regulations around the responsible, ethical, and unbiased use of AI. Because the AI model and associated services run adjacent to your enterprise data, you may also benefit by using existing controls, tools, and processes to manage access and audit.\n\n3. AI technology is moving so fast. What if I invest big in a specific AI technology, and then a new one comes to market that would work better for us?\n\nThe AI landscape is moving very fast and new technologies, models, services, and tools come to market all the time. The best approach is to leverage an AI infrastructure that is open, flexible\u2014not tied to any single AI model or hardware stack\u2014and is supported by an extensive ecosystem of industry-leading AI vendors. With maximum flexibility to work with a wide range of AI technologies, you won\u2019t get locked into one particular solution. You can change models, services, and tools with a simple software update. VMware Private AI is that architectural approach. It delivers a range of GenAI solutions for your environment\u2014NVIDIA, Intel, IBM, Hugging Face, open\u2013source community repositories, and independent software vendors. And it is backed by an extensive open ecosystem: most major server OEMs (Dell, Lenovo, HPE, Supermicro, and more) provide certified server architecture. Industry-leading global system integrators like NTT Data, WWT, HCL, Wipro, Kyndryl, etc. can help customers along their GenAI journey.\n\n4. AI experts are telling us that GenAI is beyond our reach because we need a massive number of GPUs to get started. We don\u2019t have the necessary processing power, technical skills and budget so our only option seems to be that we run all our services with public cloud providers. Is that true?\n\nNo, it is not true. It is one of the top myths about GenAI. We hear from our Asia-Pacific customers that they are told to effectively leverage AI for their organisation that they need deep expertise, tens of millions of dollars, and thousands of GPUs. Not true. Most organizations can benefit from AI by running models fine-tuned with their data. They do not have to take on the cost burden of model training to benefit from AI. You can download a very good foundation model, even an open-source model, and then use that model with a technique such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) connected to your secured data sources. Bringing a model to your data would allow you to control of your data and whether it should be used to benefit another model. You\u2019re maintaining complete control of it, with privacy and compliance. With this approach, you could have a proof of concept (POC) up and running in weeks.\n\n5. I have an existing VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment. How can I make the most of my current investment while leveraging GenAI for our organisation?\n\nIf you already have an existing VCF environment, it is very easy to leverage your current investment to deliver GenAI capabilities to your customers and employees across Asia-Pacific. VCF is the central component in VMware Private AI. While allowing you to bring AI models to the data sources you already have, VMware Private AI maintains privacy, governance, and controls that are already in place\u2014using your existing toolset.\n\nACCELERATE AI ADOPTION SECURELY\n\nWhen it comes to AI, there is no longer any reason to debate trade-offs in choice, privacy, and control. Private AI empowers organisations with all three, enabling them to accelerate AI adoption while futureproofing their AI infrastructure.\n\nLEARN MORE",

The company made this strategic financial move on January 13, 2025, as part of its ongoing efforts to optimize its capital structure and support general corporate purposes.\n\nThe previous credit agreement, which was originally set to mature in 2026, provided Broadcom with a $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility was terminated as the company had no outstanding borrowings under it immediately prior to its termination. The termination was a prerequisite for entering into the new credit agreement.\n\nThe newly established credit agreement, facilitated by Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent, maintains the same $7.5 billion revolving credit capacity. This facility is designed to support Broadcom's general corporate needs, with up to $500 million available for the issuance of multicurrency letters of credit. The issuance of these letters of credit will reduce the total amount available for revolving loans under the facility.\n\nBroadcom's decision to transition to a new credit agreement reflects its proactive approach to managing its financial resources and maintaining flexibility in its capital management strategies. The company had no borrowings outstanding under the new revolving facility as of the closing date.\n\nThis development underscores Broadcom's commitment to maintaining a robust financial framework, ensuring it remains well-positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities and navigate the dynamic market landscape.\n\nShould you invest in Broadcom Inc (AVGO, Financial) right now? Before you do it, it\u2019s important to understand the business profitability and stock valuations, and find out what the warning signs are about.

            "content": "Aside from such customer concerns, there is a wider policy discussion about European cloud sovereignty. For example, the EU aims to promote the use of European cloud providers as part of its industrial strategy to strengthen the EU economy and maintain competitiveness and technological leadership in an increasingly uncertain world. Hyperscalers in the United States have access to enormous amounts of data. The European Commission would prefer that European cloud providers benefit from this \u2018data advantage\u2019 instead. Lastly, EU policymakers also have geopolitical concerns about an overreliance on foreign service providers and the strategic autonomy of European states. Yet such issues are typically more relevant to EU policymaking than to individual customer deployments.\n\nHosken: Why are European organizations turning to European cloud providers rather than hyperscalers in the United States for sovereign cloud solutions?\n\nMichels: For some aspects of sovereignty, the provider\u2019s nationality doesn\u2019t matter. For example, providers in the United States can offer a high degree of transparency and provide data residency options by using local data centers.\n\nYet provider nationality does matter when it comes to foreign government access. This is because American providers are necessarily subject to their country\u2019s jurisdiction. So, any data they process could be subject to United States\u2019 production orders. For example, courts in the United States can issue warrants for law enforcement purposes under the Stored Communications Act, as amended by the CLOUD Act, while the National Security Agency can issue directives for foreign intelligence purposes under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nSuch production orders could compel a cloud provider in the United States to disclose European customer data. For instance, per the CLOUD Act, production orders can target any customer data within a United States\u2019 provider\u2019s \u201cpossession, custody, or control\u201d, regardless of data location. As a result, it is possible that production orders in the United States can target European customer data, even if the data is stored in Europe by an American hyperscaler\u2019s European subsidiary. This is because data processed by the European subsidiary is considered to fall within the American parent company\u2019s \u2018control\u2019, since the parent company can exercise legal control over its subsidiary.\n\nWe therefore need to distinguish data residency (which concerns the location of storage) from cloud sovereignty (which looks at the risk of foreign government access). By contrast, a European provider can offer a service that is more likely to be immune to jurisdiction and production orders in the United States. This immunity would apply especially if the provider does not have customers, assets or employees there.",

The company is steadily resolving the three key hurdles it faces.\n\nTo achieve its goal of initiating mass production of 2nm logic ICs by 2027, Rapidus must overcome three significant challenges: securing customers, raising approximately JPY4 trillion (approx. US$25.3 billion) in capital, and developing the essential mass production technologies, Nikkei reported on January 8.\n\nCustomer acquisition challenges\n\nThe challenge of acquiring customers is intricately tied to the other two issues. In practice, the ability to secure sufficient funding for 2nm chip production, coupled with the concern of whether the produced chips will meet customers' exact requirements, represents a significant risk for potential clients.\n\nRapidus' current investors, including Toyota, Sony, Kioxia, SoftBank, NTT, Denso, and NEC, are also potential customers. However, their investments, each limited to JPY 1 billion, reflect a cautious stance as they meticulously assess the viability of Rapidus' success.\n\nAfter validating the performance of Rapidus's 2nm chips, Broadcom may entrust Rapidus with the production of semiconductors for data centers. This opens the door for Rapidus to take on chip manufacturing for Broadcom's high-profile clients, including major industry giants like Google and Meta.\n\nUnlike TSMC, which focuses on high-volume production, Rapidus is dedicated to producing customized, small-batch, and diversified products tailored to the needs of emerging companies. At present, its early-stage partners seem to be AI chip startups like Tenstorrent, rather than large IT giants, meaning its shipment volumes are likely to remain modest for the time being.\n\nGiven that small-batch, diversified production may not generate sustained profitability, forging partnerships with industry giants like Broadcom will be crucial for achieving meaningful breakthroughs. However, even if Rapidus successfully secures customers, the true test lies in its ability to reliably manufacture the chips, which remains the cornerstone of its long-term success.\n\nTight timeline for trial production, but progress exceeds expectations\n\nInsiders at Rapidus have disclosed that the plan to introduce EUV lithography machines in December 2024 and begin trial production by April 2025 presents a challenging timeline. However, Rapidus president Atsuyoshi Koike emphasized that the trial production progress is advancing more smoothly than expected. The initial yield target for the April trial is set at 50%, with the ultimate goal of achieving a yield of 80-90%.\n\nJapanese government steps in to support Rapidus's ambition\n\nOn the funding front, the Japanese government has already committed as much as JPY920 billion in subsidies to Rapidus and has stated its intention to provide further support in the future.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), now the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), played a key role in driving the prosperity of Japan's semiconductor industry during the 1980s and 1990s. However, in the 2000s, its attempts to revitalize the sector ultimately proved unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Japan's semiconductor and electronics companies sharply curtailed investments in wafer manufacturing, with many transitioning towards IC design or adopting asset-light business models.\n\nJapan's leading logic IC manufacturer, Renesas, has remained at the 40nm technology node, despite having developed 28nm mass production capabilities that were ultimately never commercialized. As a result, Japan's semiconductor manufacturing technology has stagnated for nearly two decades. Now, backed by historic long-term investments, the Japanese government is supporting Rapidus in its efforts to revive and propel the nation's semiconductor industry forward.\n\nThe Japanese government plans to become a shareholder in Rapidus after its investment, but Koike emphasized the need to keep government involvement limited, with the private sector remaining at the helm. Consequently, the scale of future investments from private companies will be crucial in shaping how Rapidus addresses its funding challenges.",

As I step into my new role leading Broadcom\u2019s Global Commercial Sales and Partner organization, I look forward to connecting directly with you \u2014 listening to your perspectives and feedback, while further collaborating on how we can drive mutual growth and achieve shared goals.\n\nIn 2025, my focus will be on driving growth, delivering value, and strengthening alignment by prioritizing the following three core areas:\n\n1. Prioritizing Value-Based Solution Providers\n\nIn 2025, we will strengthen our commitment to a select group of value-based solution providers who are truly investing in the VMware and Broadcom software businesses. These partners are not only aligned with our technology vision, but are also making significant investments in skills, capabilities, dedicated resources, and customer success.\n\nWhy It Matters : Success depends on partners who are not just selling products, but delivering real value for our mutual customers. By prioritizing these partners, we can deliver better value to customers, ensure long-term growth, and strengthen our mutual investments.\n\n: Success depends on partners who are not just selling products, but delivering real value for our mutual customers. By prioritizing these partners, we can deliver better value to customers, ensure long-term growth, and strengthen our mutual investments. What to Expect: Enhanced support, training, and flexible incentives for eligible partners who demonstrate commitment to the Broadcom software portfolio, including VMware solutions. We\u2019re empowering you to decide where to invest your Broadcom dollars while we\u2019re simplifying the process.\n\n2. Shifting Professional Services to Partner-Delivered Models\n\nAnother major focus for 2025 is transitioning professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services. This shift represents a significant opportunity for our partners to lead and deliver critical implementation, consulting, and optimization services to customers.\n\nWhy It Matters : Partners are uniquely positioned to provide localized expertise, scale, and value-added services. By enabling our ecosystem to take on professional services, we empower partners to grow their practices while providing customers with access to more agile, responsive solutions.\n\n: Partners are uniquely positioned to provide localized expertise, scale, and value-added services.

Accelerating a Successful Path to Our Mutual Customers\u2019 VCF Adoption\n\nOur customers\u2019 success is at the heart of Broadcom\u2019s strategy. Customer success depends on fully unlocking the value of the software solutions in which they\u2019ve invested. In 2025, we\u2019ll focus on guiding commercial customers along their VCF adoption journey, helping them modernize, optimize, and future-proof their IT infrastructure.\n\nWhy It Matters : Broadcom has simplified and optimized our VCF offering to make it easier for customers and partners to determine the right solution for their unique business needs.

They are still happy to sell these products, but it\u2019s not their focus,\u201d said Sandfort. \u201cThey are looking into partners who can actually traverse small vSphere customers into VCF [VMware Cloud Foundation] customers or, to be realistic, get rid of them. Nothing in the current program says, like, \u2018Let\u2019s foster these very small customers.\u2019 Everything says, \u2018Either upsell from that or make sure that we don\u2019t have that problem anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nPartners said Moats\u2019 hiring comes at a time when many customers are still on the fence on whether to buy into Broadcom-VMware\u2019s new business model of selling pre-packed bundles.\n\nMoat\u2019s Plan As Broadcom\u2019s Channel Chief\n\nLast week, Moats was appointed Broadcom\u2019s Senior Vice President of Global Commercial Sales and Partners.\n\nMoats said his three major priorities as Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief are: to accelerate a path to boost customer adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF); transition professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services; and prioritize \u201cvalue-based\u201d solution providers who are \u201ctruly investing\u201d in VMware and Broadcom software businesses.\n\nC.R. Howdyshell, CEO of Advizex, a Fulcrum IT Partners company who has been a VMware Premier Partner since 2007, said the biggest partner benefit to Moats\u2019 strategy is shifting professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services such as consulting and implementation services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a substantial investment in professional services around VMware. We\u2019re not seeing a significant uptick, though, right now. It\u2019s pretty steady. It\u2019s a good business, but not a lot of growth. With Moat\u2019s message here, we would expect a great opportunity there,\u201d said Howdyshell.\n\n\u201cOur hands are up in the air saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re ready. Tap us on the shoulder. We\u2019re ready to jump in the game when it comes to services,\u201d he said.\n\nPartners said Broadcom does not have the technical staff and scale in-house to provide professional services on a global level to its customer base.\n\n\u201cBroadcom does not want to have a massive PS [professional services] organization,\u201d said Comdivision\u2019s CEO Sandfort. \u201cIf I\u2019m working with a U.S. government agency, I don\u2019t have to do the sale, which can be done by Broadcom\u2019s strategic sales team because they are perfect at that. I can later on just come in and deliver the services. And to be realistic, I\u2019m not even necessarily keen on these very large yields to even deliver the licenses because we are talking about 1 percent margins in the first place. That is not very attractive. So giving the PS back to the partners makes sense.\u201d\n\nMoat\u2019s History At Broadcom And CA Technologies Is A Win For Partners\n\nPartners were glad to learn about Moats extensive background working with the channel including his latest role as Broadcom\u2019s vice president of sales for global system integrators (GSIs).\n\nFurthermore, partners are hopeful that Moats\u2019 history with CA Technologies, which Broadcom acquired in 2018 for nearly $19 billion, will be beneficial. Moats spent a total of 18 years at CA Technologies before transitioning to his Broadcom GSI role after the acquisition.\n\n\u201cHis background is going to be a big plus. Going through what CA went through, he probably understands the undertaking that is going to be required with being part of Broadcom,\u201d said Advizex\u2019s Howdyshell. \u201cI\u2019m sure he went through something similar at CA.\u201d\n\nHowdyshell said it would be ideal for Moats to spend time with partners to really \u201cget the pulse\u201d of what customers are saying, which in some cases, is not buying into VMware\u2019s large bundle offerings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hearing what customers are saying and, to some degree, at times, they appear to be numb to it,\u201d Howdyshell said. \u201cWe have seen some adjustments at times, but they\u2019re not going to waiver from where they\u2019re going strategically. Kudos to them for that. Broadcom\u2019s stock has doubled, right? So it\u2019s working from that perspective.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Broadcom\u2019s stock was trading at $225 per share, up 102 percent from $111 per share one year ago.\n\nBroadcom Value-Add Partners Are Key Priority in 2025\n\nMoats said a key focus in 2025 will be on prioritizing value-based solution providers who are \u201ctruly investing\u201d in the VMware and Broadcom software businesses.\n\n\u201cThese partners are not only aligned with our technology vision, but are also making significant investments in skills, capabilities, dedicated resources, and customer success,\u201d Moats said.\n\nHe said success depends on partners who are not just selling products but delivering real value for mutual customers. \u201cBy prioritizing these partners, we can deliver better value to customers, ensure long-term growth, and strengthen our mutual investments,\u201d said Moats.\n\nThese strategic types of partners can expect enhanced support, training, and flexible channel incentives in 2025.\n\n\u201cBrian\u2019s strategy is a total win for us. It\u2019s going to be a total win for other partners who also have the same skillsets we have,\u201d said Sandfort, whose company owns a slew of VMware Competencies and has been a partner since 2001.\n\n\u201cIt basically fits to the model [Broadcom CEO] Hock [Tan] has said during conferences, but also in direct meetings, which is, he\u2019s looking for partners who really bring more valued solutions to the market,\u201d said Sandfort. \u201cHock has been far more clear with this than many other vendors. I\u2019ve heard Broadcom very clearly saying multiple times, \u2018Worst case, we will give up any volume reseller over someone who\u2019s going to provide value.\u201d\n\nMoats, for his part, said he looks forward to directly connecting with channel partners to get their perspectives and feedback.\n\n\u201cAs we prioritize value-based partnerships, enable partner-led professional services, and support customers on their VCF journey, we will unlock new opportunities and achieve sustainable growth together,\u201d said Moats.",

            "content": "This technology giant's critical role in the AI movement is becoming clearer every day.\n\nMost investors scouring the technology sector for its top growth prospects probably don't have Broadcom (AVGO -2.03%) on their radar. But perhaps they should. Shares of this unassuming telecom soared 108% last year, shocking plenty of people. That's not a bounceback move from a lousy 2023, either, as the stock nearly doubled then.\n\nWhat gives? Simply put, this company is plugged into the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe planets are aligning for Broadcom's business\n\nNvidia (NVDA -0.37%) has been the poster child of the AI revolution so far, and rightfully so. Its processors are the heart of the vast majority of AI data centers. As time marches on, though, data center operators are looking for other ways of handling even more data, and handling it even faster.\n\nThat's where Broadcom enters the picture. It makes much of the tech that connects hard drives to motherboards, interlinks all the separately operating computers that collectively make up a server stack, and even makes the fiber-optic connection tech needed to turn walls of computer circuity into a true AI data center. That's not all it manufactures, but this business accounts for the bulk of its growth. Last quarter's 44% year-over-year top-line improvement was led by a 220% increase in sales to artificial intelligence customers.\n\nThis is still just the beginning. Just last month, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan suggested the annual AI chip market could swell from its current range of between $15 billion and $20 billion to something in the ballpark of $60 billion to as much as $90 billion per year by 2027. For perspective, the company did $12.2 billion worth of this business for itself in its recently ended fiscal 2024.\n\nThe market's been increasingly connecting these dots since well before December's bold prediction, though, recognizing that the next chapter of artificial intelligence's advent will heavily feature Broadcom's offerings.\n\nBe patient, but not stubborn\n\nBut is this stock a buy now following not one but two fantastic years?\n\nOvervaluation is a legitimate concern here. Although shares are below analysts' current consensus price target of $247.54, that's not a massive amount of perceived upside relative to the stock's current price. Meanwhile, last month's heroic 44% advance alone leaves shares seemingly vulnerable to near-term profit-taking. It wouldn't be wrong to be patient enough to wait for a decent-sized pullback before stepping in.\n\nJust don't wait too long or be too stingy. There's a reason two-thirds of the analyst community still rates this stock a strong buy despite its recent red-hot gains. That is, the underlying growth opportunity is not only massive, but inevitable.",

Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 should be $14.6 billion, and the EBITDA margin should be just about 66%.\n\nAnalysts have responded well to Broadcom's positioning in the AI space and positioning itself as strategically as it has.

Nvidia tumbled about 3% on Monday on a new, broader Biden administration artificial intelligence chip export control announcement, a further step aimed at keeping cutting-edge U.S.-made tech out of China's hands. Citi analysts, meanwhile, say Chinese tech giant ByteDance is likely a 3% to 5% customer of our other Club chip stock, Broadcom . The analysts think the rest of Broadcom's AI business \"will dwarf\" any risk from not being able to ship to China. The stock was flat, which Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, sees as about right. TD Cowen upgraded Club stock Linde to a buy from hold and raised its price target to $515 per share from $480. \"Industrial Gas typically benefits in inflationary environments, and we expect Linde to benefit as much or more than peers,\" the analysts wrote. Marks agreed, saying we like the stock as a \"defensive materials company that can grow earnings no matter the macro.\" The Club last added shares in mid-December at around $430 each. Linde rose more than 1% Monday, to roughly $420 per share. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

            "content": "In the last year, many Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Broadcom\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Hock Tan, for US$26m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$224). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 10% of Hock Tan's holding.\n\nInsiders in Broadcom didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Insider Trading Volume January 12th 2025\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nBroadcom Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Broadcom. In total, insiders sold US$42m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Broadcom\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Broadcom insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$14b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",

            "content": "In the early days of the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure build-out, graphic processing units (GPUs) have been the go-to chips for companies to train AI models and run inference. GPUs are powerful chips that were originally designed to speed up graphics rendering in video games, but later became used for other applications after Nvidia created a software platform to allow developers to program its chips for other purposes.\n\nHowever, a number of large tech companies have also started to use custom AI chips, or ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). ASICs are custom chips designed for very specific purposes. As such, they tend to perform better and be more efficient at these tasks compared to a GPU, but aren't as flexible in how they can be used.\n\nLet's look at two companies that are helping lead the way with custom AI chips.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nWhen it comes to custom AI chips, Broadcom (AVGO -2.03%) has been the leader in the space. Alphabet was its first AI chip customer, with Broadcom helping to design its tensor-processing unit (TPU) called Trillium. This chip was created to specifically work within Google Cloud's TensorFlow (a software library for AI and machine learning).\n\nAlphabet has said these custom chips have several features that make them better than GPUs for AI training and inference. These include having matrix multiply units (MXUs), which are components used to efficiently perform large matrix multiplications, and SparseCores, which are \"data flow processors that accelerate models relying on embeddings found in recommendation models.\"\n\nLast quarter, Alphabet credited using a combination of GPUs and TPUs as a differentiator for its cloud computing segment. It said its TPUs helped lower costs while also reducing inference time.\n\nSince then, Broadcom has added more custom AI customers, which are believed to be Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and most recently, Apple. Braodcom saw strong growth from AI chips in its fiscal 2024 ending early November, with its AI revenue topping $12 billion, well above its expectations of around $7.5 billion going into the year.\n\nThe company excited investors last quarter when it indicated each of its three initial AI customers could deploy up to 1 million AI chips in 2027, which it said would represent a $60 billion to $90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027 alone. It added that if its two new customers were able to get their chips into development by that time, that this opportunity would be even greater.\n\nWhile Broadcom isn't likely to win all this business, with some going toward GPUs, it shows the strong customer AI chip opportunity the company has in front of it. The stock, meanwhile, trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.5 based on 2025 analyst estimates, which is attractive if it can capture a good share of the 2027 opportunity it has talked about.\n\n2. Marvell Technology\n\nBroadcom is not the only company that is helping customers design custom chips. Marvell (MRVL -2.88%) is also in the custom silicon game as well. It's best known for helping Amazon with its Trainium chip that is used to help train large language models (LLMs).\n\nWhile Broadcom is believed to have completely designed chips for Alphabet based on its needs, Marvel is primarily providing some intellectual property around high-speed SerDes (Serializer-Deserializer), with Amazon doing most of the work, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. On its fiscal Q3 earnings call in December, Marvell said that it recently signed a five-year multigenerational deal with Amazon's cloud unit AWS for custom AI products, as well as various other data center switches and components. It said the deal should lead to a significant ramp-up in volumes between the two companies.\n\nAmazon is not Marvell's only AI customer, Marvell said it has a range of design wins for both AI accelerators and compute and that other programs would go into production in 2025. It also said it will have a third large customer soon. At its AI day, the company said it sees custom AI chips as a $40 billion market opportunity, and that it thinks it can take a 20% market share, or $8 billion.\n\nMarvell said it was on track to exceed $1.5 billion in AI revenue this fiscal year, with more growth expected in fiscal 2026. It said much of this will come from its custom silicon program.\n\nOutside of custom AI chips, Marvell is very tied to the data center market. Its data center revenue soared 98% year over year last quarter to $1.1 billion. Data center revenue now accounts for 73% of the company's total revenue, up from it being 39% of its total revenue a year ago. However, overall revenue rose just 7% due to weakness in other end markets.\n\nOverall, with data center spending continuing to ramp up, Marvell should see strong growth in this area. The stock currently trades at 42 time next year's earnings estimates, which is a bit on the high side.",

He purchased 239,980 shares of Broadcom (AVGO -2.06%) during the third quarter, and it now ranks among his top 15 holdings.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management outperformed the S&P 500 by 30 percentage points during the last three years. He bought 211,823 shares of Arista Networks (ANET -0.96%) in the third quarter, and it now ranks among his top 10 holdings.\n\nImportantly, Broadcom and Arista are key suppliers of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and they have seen their share prices more or less quadruple in the last two years. Both companies completed stock splits in 2024 to reset their soaring share prices.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these artificial intelligence stocks.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom is a semiconductor and software company best known for its networking chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It has 80% revenue share in Ethernet switching and routing (networking) chipsets, which move information through data centers. That market could grow as fast as 30% annually as enterprises build out artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom has about 60% market share in high-end ASICs, which are custom chips purpose-built for specialized use cases, especially accelerating artificial intelligence workloads. Broadcom currently designs chips for three hyperscalers, a term that refers to companies with massive data center footprints. While those hyperscalers are unnamed, most analysts suspect they are Google parent Alphabet, TikTok parent ByteDance, and Meta Platforms.\n\nImportantly, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan recently said revenue from those three hyperscalers could land between $60 billion and $90 billion in 2027, up from $12.2 billion in 2024. That implies annual growth between 70% to 95%. But Tan also said Broadcom was working with two new hyperscalers -- reportedly Apple and OpenAI -- that could be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means AI chip sales could increase at a triple-digit pace in the next three years.\n\nWall Street expects Broadcom's adjusted earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 47 times adjusted earnings look reasonable, but it also leaves room for upside if Broadcom tops its guidance concerning custom AI chip sales. That's why patient investors should consider buying a few shares of this stock today.\n\n2. Arista Networks\n\nArista is a networking company best known for providing Ethernet switches to hyperscalers Microsoft and Meta Platforms, though it has other high-profile customers like Alphabet, Oracle, and SpaceX. The company is the revenue leader in high-speed Ethernet switches, meaning 100 gigabits per second and faster. High-speed networking is essential for AI workloads.\n\nImportantly, Cisco Systems is the still the leader in the overall Ethernet switching space, but Arista has three times more market share in the high-speed category. That dominance is due in part to its Extensible Operating System (EOS). All Arista hardware runs a single version of EOS, but Cisco uses multiple operating systems, which can make managing the network more complicated.\n\nLooking ahead, Arista says its total addressable market will increase at 14% annually through 2028. Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly be an important growth driver. Hyperscalers are investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure to ensure they remain competitive. However, Arista should also benefit as smaller enterprises modernize their networks to support an ever-growing number of connected devices.\n\nWall Street expects Arista's adjusted earnings to increase at 17% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look expensive. But I think analysts are underestimating future earnings. Arista beat consensus estimates in the last 15 quarters, and its reported earnings were 14% above expectations on average in the last six quarters. Patient investors should consider buying a small position today.",

Still, some investors may be concerned that the rally is a bit overextended.\n\nEven weak companies can see their stock prices rise when investors are optimistic. However, over time, the best-performing stocks are businesses that deliver on investor expectations and continue to innovate. So, with the S&P 500 around an all-time high, ensuring you are investing in quality companies is imperative.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks is a way to collect passive income no matter what equity prices are doing. Here's why Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), Visa(NYSE: V), Salesforce(NYSE: CRM), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are well positioned as industry-leading companies that can afford to raise their dividends through economic cycles and periods of volatility.\n\nTwo top-tier dividend-paying growth stocks\n\nIn their most recent quarterly earnings results, Broadcom and Visa announced significant increases to their dividends for 2025. Broadcom hiked its payout by 11%, and Visa boosted its dividend by 13%. I would expect both companies to announce hikes of 10% or more again toward the end of this year.\n\nBroadcom and Visa are textbook examples of dividend-paying growth stocks. Both companies have impeccable business models -- Broadcom has network connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) and Visa has a global payment processing network for debit and credit cards.\n\nSince Broadcom and Visa are growing their sales and operating income at impressive rates, they can afford to pass along a portion of profits to investors through dividends. Over the last five years, Broadcom has increased its dividend by 81.5%, and Visa has nearly doubled its payout. However, the dividend payment isn't so large that it soaks up too much excess capital.\n\nLong-term investors would prefer Broadcom rapidly expand its AI product lineup rather than divert precious capital toward a bloated dividend. Visa reinvests in its business, too, but it spends the bulk of its capital return program on buybacks rather than dividends. Visa's relentless buybacks have reduced the company's share count by 11% in the last five years, helping the company grow earnings per share faster than net income to help keep its valuation reasonable.\n\nBroadcom yields just 1.2%, and Visa yields 0.8%. The low yields are due to substantial gains in both stocks, not a lack of commitment to boosting payouts.\n\nNewer dividend-paying growth companies\n\nMeta Platforms, Salesforce, and Alphabet all began paying dividends in 2024.\n\nMeta initiated its dividend on Feb. 1, when it reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results.\n\nSalesforce announced its dividend on Feb. 28, when it reported fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results.\n\nAlphabet announced its first dividend when it reported first-quarter 2024 results on April 25.\n\nI would expect all four companies to make regularly scheduled dividend raises once per year around the same time as their initial announcements (fourth-quarter earnings for Meta and Salesforce and first-quarter earnings for Alphabet).\n\nAll three stocks have yields of 0.5% or less at the time of this writing, but I would expect all three companies to make annual double-digit percentage raises for years to come and transform into dividend-growth stocks like Broadcom and Visa.\n\nAll three companies are highly profitable and generate tons of free cash flow (FCF) despite ramping spending on AI. FCF yield is a useful way of determining a company's theoretical payout if it passed along all of its FCF to investors through dividends.\n\nSimilar to dividend yield, FCF yield is just FCF per share divided by the share price, or total FCF divided by market cap. Like dividend yield, FCF yield goes down as a stock price goes up. Salesforce, Meta, and Alphabet beat the S&P 500 in 2024, which brought down their FCF yields. However, despite the big year and record research and development expenses, all three companies still have solid FCF yields.\n\nEach company can afford to substantially raise its payout and support it with cash without slowing down spending on long-term growth.\n\nFive balanced buys for 2025\n\nBroadcom, Visa, Salesforce, Meta, and Alphabet may not light up an income investor's radar. However, don't be surprised if all five companies grow their payouts at impressive rates for years to come.\n\nFor now, each company's dividend is merely the cherry on top of an already solid underlying investment thesis.\n\nInvestors looking to supplement income in retirement would do better with higher-yielding stocks with multidecade track records of increasing payouts. But investors who are more focused on total returns (capital gains plus dividends) than dividends alone should focus on a company's ability to grow earnings and, in turn, its dividend over time instead of what the yield is today.\n\nBroadcom, Visa, Salesforce, Meta, and Alphabet have runways for future earnings growth, making them dividend-growth stocks worth considering in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Broadcom Names New Channel Chief, Sales Leader: 5 Big Things To Know Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief, Brian Moats, has big plans in store for the Broadcom and VMware channel community including shifting professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services. Here are five big things to know about Moats and his goals in 2025.\n\nBroadcom and VMware partners have a new channel chief in Broadcom\u2019s former global systems integrators and go-to-market leader, Brian Moats. Moats laid out his vision as Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief, which includes transitioning professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services, as well as prioritizing \u201cvalue-based\u201d solution providers. \u201cAs we prioritize value-based partnerships, enable partner-led professional services, and support customers on their VCF journey, we will unlock new opportunities and achieve sustainable growth together,\u201d said Moats, Broadcom\u2019s new senior vice president of global commercial sales and partners, in a final draft of a blog post shared with CRN. [Related: Broadcom\u2019s Cindy Loyd Out As Channel Chief After Year Of VMware Upheaval] \u201cI\u2019m energized by the many opportunities ahead for Broadcom\u2019s partner ecosystem, our mutual customers and the VMware and Broadcom software businesses,\u201d he added. Moats\u2019 appointment as Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief comes at a time of great uncertainty for many VMware-Broadcom partners. After merging with VMware in late 2022, Broadcom changed how customers are charged pricing VMware per core\u2014which caused many customers\u2019 VMware bills to balloon\u2014as well as terminating the VMware Partner Program on short notice. \u201cAs I step into my new role leading Broadcom\u2019s Global Commercial Sales and Partner organization, I look forward to connecting directly with [partners]\u2014listening to your perspectives and feedback, while further collaborating on how we can drive mutual growth and achieve shared goals,\u201d he said. Broadcom declined CRN\u2019s interview request with Moats. With many Broadcom-VMware partners concerned over the company\u2019s channel future, here are five big things to know about Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief and global sales leader Brian Moats\u2014from his vast history at CA Technologies to his three main priorities at Broadcom in 2025.\n\nWith Moats At Helm, Broadcom Will Prioritize \u2018Value-Based\u2019 Solution Providers Moats said in 2025 that his focus will be on driving growth, delivering value, and strengthening alignment by prioritizing three core areas. His first core strategy is prioritizing value-based solution providers who are \u201ctruly investing\u201d in the VMware and Broadcom software businesses. \u201cThese partners are not only aligned with our technology vision, but are also making significant investments in skills, capabilities, dedicated resources, and customer success,\u201d he said. Success depends on partners who are not just selling products, but delivering real value for mutual customers, he said. \u201cBy prioritizing these partners, we can deliver better value to customers, ensure long-term growth, and strengthen our mutual investments,\u201d said Moats. Moats said these types of partners can expect enhanced support, training, and flexible channel incentives. \"We\u2019re empowering you to decide where to invest your Broadcom dollars while we\u2019re simplifying the process,\u201d Moats said. The Takeaway: VMware\u2019s channel ecosystem has weakened since being acquired by Broadcom in late 2022. Moats\u2019 plan to empower partners who are betting big on Broadcom-VMware, along with enhanced support and training, might help stop the bleeding in 2025.\n\nMoats Will Shift Professional Services To Partner-Delivered Models In 2025 Moats\u2019 second major focus in 2025 is transitioning professional services from Broadcom-led engagements to partner-delivered services. \u201cThis shift represents a significant opportunity for our partners to lead and deliver critical implementation, consulting, and optimization services to customers,\u201d said Moats. Broadcom\u2019s new channel chief said partners are uniquely positioned to provide localized expertise, scale, and value-added services. \u201cBy enabling our ecosystem to take on professional services, we empower partners to grow their practices while providing customers with access to more agile, responsive solutions,\u201d he said. In 2025, Moats said partners can expected channel investments in training, certification programs, and tools to help partners deliver professional services for VMware and Broadcom software solutions. The Takeaway: Last year, it was reported that Broadcom had planned to take its top 2,000 accounts direct. Moats is making a concrete effort to help ease the mind of many partners who fear Broadcom\u2019s future is a more direct go-to-market strategy compared to going through the channel.\n\nMoats Plans To Drive VCF Adoption One of Moats\u2019 most bullish goals is to accelerate a path for the creation of customer adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). VCF is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform that delivers software-defined compute, storage, networking, security, and management with self-service automation to deploy VMs, containers and clusters. \u201cIn 2025, we\u2019ll focus on guiding commercial customers along their VCF adoption journey, helping them modernize, optimize, and future-proof their IT infrastructure,\u201d said Moats. This year, Moats said partners can expect closer collaboration between Broadcom and its partners to support VCF implementations, customer enablement programs, and tools to measure customer success. \u201cBroadcom has simplified and optimized our VCF offering to make it easier for customers and partners to determine the right solution for their unique business needs,\u201d he said. \u201cPartners play a critical role in enabling customers to deploy, adopt, and realize value from VCF or their other chosen solutions.\u201d The Takeaway: VCF is one of Broadcom\u2019s flagship software offerings. Moats\u2019 plan to have Broadcom work better together with partners to win VCF deals appears to be a major boost for the channel.\n\nMoats\u2019 CA Technologies History; GSI Leadership Moats brings over 20 years of experience in sales leadership, channel development, and business strategy within the IT industry to his new role as Broadcom\u2019s channel chief. The vast majority of his career was at software management and mainframe standout CA Technologies, with a total of 18 years at the company. At CA Technologies, Moats held top partner sales positions, including global senior director of partner sales and go-to-market for DCX Technology. From 2013 to 2017, he was global senior director of partner sales and go-to-market for HPE Enterprise Services. Broadcom acquired CA Technologies in 2018 for $18.9 billion in cash. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said at the time that the goal is to \u201ccreate one of the world's leading infrastructure\u201d companies. \u201cWith its sizeable installed base of customers, CA is uniquely positioned across the growing and fragmented infrastructure software market, and its mainframe and enterprise software franchises will add to our portfolio of mission critical technology businesses,\u201d Tan said in 2018. By the end of 2018, Moats had joined Broadcom as its new global director of sales and go-to-market for DXC Technology. Moats was quickly promoted in 2019 to vice president of sales for Global System Integrators (GSIs). He was responsible for GSI Partnerships and Go-To-Market across Broadcom\u2019s software portfolio. The Takeaway: Moats has decades of experience working with channel partners both at CA Technologies and Broadcom. He also understands mergers and what many Broadcom GSIs are dealing with today. This all bodes well for Moats\u2019 ability to make a real impact on Broadcom\u2019s channel business and philosophy.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market and also discussed both the leading and lagging stocks within the S&P 500. He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a \"steak knife\" than a \"meat axe,\" meaning less harmful to trade and international relations.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nWhile a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs.\n\n\u201cIf you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.\u201d\n\nCramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint.\n\nAdditionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he\u2019s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until \u201cthey annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks led the market higher last year as investors bet on the potential of this technology to revolutionize many industries -- and our daily lives. The S&P 500 index climbed 23% and the Nasdaq advanced 28%, led by AI players. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which isn't heavily loaded with tech stocks, benefited from excitement about AI -- its newest member, Nvidia (NVDA -0.36%), posted the biggest gain in the benchmark.\n\nAnd the good news for investors is the AI momentum is likely to continue since this technology still is in the early days of its growth story. Data centers are building out infrastructure -- Nvidia chief Jensen Huang says $1 trillion of outdated computers worldwide need to be updated for accelerated computing. Companies also are in the initial stages of applying AI to improve their efficiency.\n\nThis should translate into more growth ahead for key AI players such as Nvidia and another popular AI player: networking giant Broadcom (AVGO -2.06%). So there's still plenty of time to get in on the AI growth story. But if you could only choose one of these AI growth stocks for 2025, which one should you go for? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been the go-to company for AI customers and the go-to stock for AI investors. And for good reason. The tech giant has built an AI empire, not only selling the world's fastest graphics processing units (GPUs) to power key AI tasks, but also offering a full range of AI products and services. This has resulted in double- and triple-digit revenue gains in recent quarters and record earnings. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached a high of more than $35 billion.\n\nThe company is likely to stay in its leadership position for one key reason: Nvidia is greatly focused on constant innovation, promising to update its GPUs annually. This should make it very difficult for a rival to unseat this player.\n\nAnd in the coming months, one particular thing may push Nvidia's shares higher even after last year's huge gain. The company now is launching its much-awaited Blackwell architecture, a customizable platform offering seven different chips, various networking options, and more. Demand has surpassed supply so it's clear this new product is on its way to becoming a success. Nvidia even predicts several billion dollars in revenue during this first quarter of commercialization.\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nBroadcom is the name behind thousands of products used everywhere from data centers to your smartphone. A statistic to show just how big this company is in the networking space: More than 99% of all Internet traffic passes through a Broadcom technology.\n\nThe company has greatly benefited from the AI boom as we can see through recent earnings figures. AI revenue, driven by demand for custom AI accelerators and networking, soared 220% in the latest fiscal year to more than $12 billion. And this, representing 41% of Broadcom's semiconductor revenue, pushed semiconductor revenue to a record of $30 billion.\n\nIn the recent quarter, AI networking revenue accounted for 76% of total networking revenue and climbed 158% thanks to demand for Tomahawk and Jericho Ethernet switches. Now in the current quarter, Broadcom expects this strength to continue thanks to demand from big cloud service providers.\n\nBroadcom also is winning thanks to its integration of cloud virtualization company VMware -- the acquisition closed a year ago. VMware operating margin has reached 70%, and Broadcom says it's on the path to delivering adjusted EBITDA that surpasses its goal of $8.5 billion after three years.\n\nAll of this means AI and the VMware addition are set to drive more growth at Broadcom in 2025.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia or Broadcom?\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have been winning during this AI boom, as reflected in their earnings as I mentioned above, and their share price performances. Nvidia advanced 171% last year, while Broadcom climbed more than 107%. And the great news for investors in these players is they both have what it takes to gain through the next stages of AI development.\n\nSo, choosing between them isn't easy. That said, if you're interested in value, one element may push you in one particular direction. Both players' valuations have increased over the past year, but Broadcom still is the least expensive of the two, trading at 36 times forward earnings estimates versus Nvidia's 47.\n\nIt's true Nvidia is worth the premium considering its dominance in the AI world and likelihood of staying on top. But investors looking for a bargain should scoop up Broadcom because, at this level, it represents a fantastic opportunity to get in on a top AI growth story for 2025.",

But since 2018, seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trillion-dollar club: Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter!

Some of the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL) industry-leading data center infrastructure, and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold, according to management's guidance.\n\nOracle's market cap is $463 billion as of this writing, so if it does join the $1 trillion club in four years, as I predict, investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116%.\n\nOracle's data centers are hot property right now\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers. That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors (GPUs), which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads.\n\nNvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry. And Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65,000 of Nvidia's H200 GPUs, which is the highest number in the industry. To put it simply, access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models, which translates into \"smarter\" AI software.\n\nOCI's random direct memory access (RDMA) technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute, faster processing can equal major cost savings.\n\nDuring its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336% compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up. So far, OCI's infrastructure has attracted top AI start-ups like Cohere, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nOracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 locations over time. The company's OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs, which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet, and potentially drive a new wave of demand.\n\nOCI is Oracle's fastest growing business\n\nOracle generated $14.1 billion in total revenue during the second quarter, but the OCI segment was responsible for just $2.4 billion of that total, so it isn't a massive contributor yet.\n\nIt's still smaller than Oracle's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, which generated $3.5 billion in revenue during the quarter. It offers ready-made cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll.\n\nHowever, OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth. While SaaS revenue grew by 10% year over year during the second quarter, OCI revenue soared by 52%. It was the fastest growth in a year, and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration.\n\nOCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available, but it's still struggling to meet demand even though it's building infrastructure as quickly as possible.\n\nThat demand can be seen in Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPOs), which soared by 50% during the second quarter to $97 billion. RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreed-upon services -- i.e., OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing, including a major one with Meta Platforms recently. Meta developed the world's most popular open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which have been downloaded over 600 million times, and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nOracle has a realistic pathway to the $1 trillion club\n\nOracle stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40.5, which is a slight premium to the average P/E of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet (36.7). They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle:\n\nBut Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings. For example, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo!) suggests the company's earnings per share (EPS) will grow by 14.4% to $7.05 during its fiscal year 2026 (which starts in June of this calendar year). That places its stock at a forward P/E of just 23.5.\n\nMathematically speaking, Oracle stock would have to soar by 72.3% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E of 40.5, which would value the company at almost $800 billion. If it grows its EPS by 14.4% again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same P/E, it will be a $1.04 trillion company.\n\nEven if its P/E settles at 36.7, its valuation would still be around $950 billion.\n\nBut Oracle's earnings actually grew by 22% in the first half of fiscal 2025, and I think that pace is likely to persist (and maybe even accelerate), suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative. Remember: The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold. And its infrastructure is unique because it's fully automated, meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale.\n\nIn fact, during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors, Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line. If Oracle grows its earnings by 22% annually instead of 14% through fiscal 2028, it will be a shoo-in to join the $1 trillion club even if its P/E drops to around 34.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, the focus of boardroom conversations is shifting from data availability to data confidentiality and sovereignty. As AI and other data-intensive technologies become crucial to national security and economic prosperity, data is increasingly recognized as a strategic asset, necessitating a balance between the benefits of free data flows and national sovereignty imperatives.\n\nEnter, Sovereign Cloud\n\nSovereign cloud is a fundamental reimagining of cloud infrastructure and services designed to reshape the landscape of data governance. As organisations balance the need for global connectivity with the desire to protect domestic interests in the digital sphere, sovereign cloud frameworks set a new foundation. The foundation is designed to facilitate digital cooperation and foster innovation, while simultaneously protecting local data and proprietary software, and aligning with local, national, and European-wide jurisdictions.\n\nThis approach, driven by regulatory requirements, is already having a significant impact across the European bloc \u2013 helping it not only leverage its collective data resources to gain economic advantage in the global marketplace, but also enabling nations to assert control over their digital destinies.\n\nCloud Service Providers (CSPs) across the region are pivotal to the success of sovereign cloud \u2013 and have the opportunity to be at the forefront of innovation. But, getting sovereign cloud \u2018right\u2019 can be challenging \u2013 especially when trying to straddle evolving residency and sovereignty requirements, tightening budgets, siloed infrastructures, and skills challenges.\n\nSo how do CSPs set themselves up for success? Ultimately, there are three key considerations to ensure their sovereign clouds live up to their promise:\n\nSet out your parameters for sovereign cloud\n\nData sovereignty ultimately boils down to striking a balance between security, privacy, and interoperability. But as GigaOm\u2019s Jon Collins pointed out at the European Sovereign Cloud Day event in Brussels in September, understanding the key drivers of sovereignty from an organisational point of view \u2013 including societal, regulatory, and architectural factors \u2013 is crucial to set your own vision for sovereign cloud success.\n\nMaking sure you set out what sovereign \u2018success\u2019 looks like to you \u2013 in terms of your data, operations, and infrastructure \u2013 is also imperative; it allows you to guide customers on the fundamental principles of sovereignty, and how they match up with their own needs. The process should involve assessing current practices, identifying areas for improvement, and developing a strategic plan to achieve and maintain data sovereignty. It\u2019s an incredibly important first step, because it ensures organisations can protect their data while leveraging it effectively for business purposes, staying compliant with regulations, and meeting societal expectations.\n\nStandardise and collaborate\n\nBest practices in sovereignty can be a competitive differentiator, demanding the highest possible standards well beyond regulatory compliance. So it\u2019s important to review your own framework against other frameworks to give yourself the best chance of adhering to your cloud principles. I often compare it to road safety. Yes, it\u2019s comparatively easy to do the minimum possible as a driver to comply with the law \u2013 obtain a driving license and follow traffic laws. But that license doesn\u2019t prevent you from ever having an accident! True road safety relies on you sticking to well-maintained roads, operating your vehicle in a safe way, and looking to others to adhere to the same standards. The same principles should apply in a sovereign cloud context, with CSPs working towards common frameworks and standards that allow for a common European data space for innovation.\n\nSimilarly, don\u2019t be afraid to engage with local and regional partners to build truly robust sovereign frameworks for data sharing. Interoperability and portability will be crucial to our shared success, so it\u2019s in all of our interests to work together to test, iterate and elevate our frameworks to new heights. The most successful initiatives are those designed to develop and implement sovereign cloud solutions at national and European levels, for instance, showing the marked difference between what European Union and non-native frameworks can deliver, which are crucial to fostering game-changing innovation.\n\nBe flexible\n\nSetting those foundations for success is vitally important. But, don\u2019t forget, the principles of sovereign clouds are not set in stone. They need to be flexible as regulatory and business environments continue to evolve. So stay informed about evolving regulations and adjust strategies accordingly,\n\nAbove all, don\u2019t miss the opportunity to highlight your strategic differentiation. We\u2019re not here to say we are the bad guys or the good guys \u2013 but rather, to show organisations that sovereign cloud gives them the tools to handle critical, confidential and sensitive data in the way they need to achieve long-term competitiveness and success.\n\nRemember, we\u2019re not talking in transactional language anymore with sovereign cloud. Instead, we\u2019re talking about strategic partnerships and long-term investment that breeds consistent excellence. Ultimately, it\u2019s the same stack and the same software, but your ability to deliver services on top of your own sovereign cloud is what will set you apart.\n\nSeize the opportunity\n\nSovereign cloud undoubtedly represents a pivotal shift in the digital landscape, balancing the need for global connectivity with the imperatives of national and regional data control and security. Success will require a clear vision, a commitment to standardisation and collaboration, and the flexibility to adapt to evolving regulations and market needs.\n\nFor CSPs looking to build long-term, strategic partnerships with their customers, sovereign cloud presents the perfect opportunity to foster competitiveness and success in an increasingly data-driven world. And their journey to it is only just beginning.",

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nReports in the Japanese media suggest that Japan's chip manufacturer Rapidus aims to provide AI chip designer Broadcom with 2-nanometer chip samples as soon as this June. Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are the only firms capable of manufacturing 2-nanometer chips right now, and both of them are yet to start mass production. Sources quoted by The Nikkei report that Rapidus is working with US firm IBM to produce 2-nanometer chips, and the latest information follows an earlier report in November of Rapidus receiving Japan's first EUV machines from the Dutch chip manufacturer ASML.\n\nTSMC, Samsung Face Competition As Japanese Chip Maker Aims To Enter 2-nanometer Chip Manufacturing Market\n\nTSMC is currently slated to start 2-nanometer mass production later this year with the first chips available in products in 2026. When compared to TSMC's 3-nanometer manufacturing process, products manufactured with the 2-nanometer node have smaller feature sizes and a new transistor design.\n\nThe 3-nanometer products feature a FinFET transistor design, while TSMC will use a new nanosheet transistor design in the 2-nanometer chips. Nanosheets increase the contact area between a transistor's gate and source, reducing leakage to improve overall power efficiency and performance.\n\nLike TSMC, Samsung's 2-nanometer products will also use an upgraded transistor design. Samsung will use gate-all-around-FinFET (GAAFET) transistors for its 2-nanometer products. The firm has developed these in partnership with IBM, and its 2-nanometer products are also expected to enter mass production later this year after it installed chip manufacturing machines in Q4 2024.\n\nSamsung Foundry's diagram showing the evolution of a transistor from FinFET to GAAFET and then MBCFET. The 3nm process from the Korean company will utilize GAAFET transistors, which it has developed in partnership with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Image: Samsung Electronics\n\nSince scaling up chip production is a slow process, firms like TSMC gradually scale production and cater to the demands of their strongest customers. Naturally, this creates a gap between the supply and demand for chips manufactured using the latest technologies. Japan's Rapidus appears to be attempting to capitalize on this shortfall as it is aiming to start 2-nanometer sample production in April.\n\nIt also aims to send the first samples to Broadcom in June. Broadcom's shares soared by 38% in December after it surprised investors with its AI chip plans. CEO Hock Tan outlined that his firm aims to ship as many as one million AI chips by 2027 to earn anywhere between $60 billion to $90 in its fiscal year 2027.\n\nRapidus also appears to be targeting this expected boom in the demand for AI chips. While it is planning to ship 2-nanometer samples to Broadcom, the firm aims to start 2-nanometer production in 2027. Mega fabs like TSMC enjoy the advantage of not only significant resources but also expertise, which lets them regularly upgrade their technologies and smoothly churn out the latest chips.\n\nThe Japanese firm, backed by eight Japanese firms, including Toyota and Sony, also aims to expand its inventory of ASML's advanced EUV chip manufacturing machines. These machines are indispensable for manufacturing the latest chips. To facilitate Rapdius, ASML is also expected to open a new service center in Japan.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nOn January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell\u2019 to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\n\nDiscussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth.\n\nLip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range.\n\nLip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we\u2019re here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify the best long-term tech stocks according to media, we sifted through financial media reports and watched Wall Street analysts\u2019 appearances on the news. We compiled a preliminary list of 25 stocks first and then selected 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) provides semiconductor solutions and specializes in the design and development of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It serves a range of markets, including data centers, networking, software, broadband, storage, and wireless. It has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta along with other tech giants aiming for AI hyperscaling.\n\nFor FY2024, revenue for the company reached a record $51.6 billion. AI alone generated $12.2 billion in revenue, a 220% surge year-over-year, representing 41% of semiconductor revenue. This was due to the demand for custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and AI networking solutions. In FQ4 2024, AI revenue reached $3.7 billion, representing 150% growth, driven by a doubling of AI XPU shipments to three hyperscale customers and 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s AI semiconductor revenue is expected to outpace non-AI semiconductor revenue in the coming years. Three hyperscalers are developing their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmaps, with each planning to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric by 2027. This presents a significant Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networking, estimated to be between $60-$90 billion by 2027. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is on track for volume shipments of its next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs to hyperscale customers in H2 FY2025, solidifying its leadership position.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong earnings and strategic positioning in the AI revolution make it a compelling long-term investment according to Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy. It stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSimilar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company\u2019s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.\u201d\n\nOverall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, AudioEye, Inc. AEYE and Five9, Inc. FIVN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Top AI Stocks to Buy Now for Stellar Growth This Year\n\nWall Street had a shaky start to 2025 after markets turned volatile in the final weeks of December. However, tech stocks that were largely responsible for the broader market rally last year have been rebounding over the past few sessions. This saw the Nasdaq posting back-to-back gains on Monday, led by a rally in chip stocks.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been in the spotlight over the past couple of years thanks to the soaring enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, led by NVIDIA Corp.. Experts predict that the AI race will intensify in the near term due to growing demand in a variety of fields.\n\nGiven this situation, it would be prudent to invest in AI stocks that are set to excel in 2025. Four such stocks are Broadcom Inc., NVIDIA, AudioEye, Inc. and Five9, Inc.. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are likely to see good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nTech Companies Focusing More on AI\n\nAn increasing number of tech companies, big and small, are investing more in exploring AI. Companies that have heavily integrated AI into their end products have seen significant growth during this period.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft said it would be spending $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025 to handle AI workload. The tech giant's 2025 fiscal wraps up in June.\n\nMicrosoft isn't the only company spending big on AI. Several tech giants are investing billions in NVIDIA graphics processing units to train and run AI models. This has seen the stock prices of several companies integrating AI into their end products skyrocketing 300-400% over the past couple of years.\n\nAI Enthusiasm Continues to Grow\n\nThe rapid adoption of OpenAI's ChatGPT, launched in 2022, sparked a race among companies to develop their own generative AI solutions. Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, supplies cloud infrastructure to the startup and has integrated its models into products like Windows, Teams, and more.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence projects that spending on generative AI will jump from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. Another report by UBS projects the four U.S. tech giants, part of the \"Magnificent 7,\" to invest around $267 billion in AI applications as capital expenditure in 2025, reflecting a 33.5% year-over-year increase.\n\n4 AI Stocks with Growth Potential\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom Inc. is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products.

            "content": "Which of these chipmakers is the better buy right now?\n\nThe rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market is generating strong tailwinds for many chipmakers. Nvidia, the leading producer of high-end data center GPUs, has probably been the biggest winner. Its stock has soared by about 2,470% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia continues to have potential as a great long-term investment in the future of the AI market, but investors shouldn't overlook two other chipmakers that are expected to profit from this secular trend: Wolfspeed (WOLF -2.96%), a leading manufacturer of silicon carbide chips, and diversified tech giant Broadcom (AVGO -2.02%).\n\nLet's consider which of these two artificial intelligence stocks is the better buy today.\n\nThe differences between Wolfspeed and Broadcom\n\nWolfspeed, which was formerly known as Cree, mainly manufactures wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors made from silicon carbide and gallium nitride. These chips can operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional chips, which are made using silicon and gallium arsenide.\n\nTheir superior robustness makes Wolfspeed's chips ideal for short-length LEDs, lasers, 5G base stations, and military radars. They're also used in electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind turbine systems, and power supply units for AI servers. There is demand for these chips, however, the sluggishness of the EV market has throttled Wolfspeed's growth over the past two years.\n\nBroadcom, which was known as Avago before it acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, is more diversified. Its semiconductor division sells a wide range of chips for the mobile, wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial markets. Its infrastructure software business -- which it expanded through its acquisitions of CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security division, and VMware -- provides a mix of on-premises and cloud-based software.\n\nMost of Broadcom's recent growth has been driven by the AI market, which drove data center operators to purchase more of its networking and optical chips. Management expects that segment's growth will offset slower sales of non-AI chips and infrastructure software.\n\nWhich chipmaker is growing faster?\n\nWolfspeed's revenue rose 42% in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) as it lapped a pandemic-related slowdown and benefited from rising EV sales. But its revenues only rose 24% in fiscal 2023 and 6% in fiscal 2024.\n\nThat deceleration was caused by the cooling EV market, a surge in spending on AI GPUs that came at the expense of silicon carbide chips, and China's export bans on gallium and germanium amid an escalating tech sector conflict. Wolfspeed's adjusted gross margin plunged from 36% in fiscal 2022 to 13% in fiscal 2024, and it remains unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect Wolfspeed's revenue to dip 2% to $790 million, and foresee its net loss widening to $975 million.\n\nYet Wolfspeed continues to expand during this cyclical downcycle. It expanded its New York and North Carolina plants over the past two years, and it expects that increased utilization will reduce its overall die costs by at least 50% over the next few years. That strategy could eventually pay off, but the recent dismissal of CEO Gregg Lowe could disrupt those long-term plans.\n\nBroadcom's revenue rose by 21% in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in October 2022) as pandemic-related headwinds dissipated, then grew 8% in fiscal 2023 and 44% in fiscal 2024. Last year's top-line acceleration was largely driven by its acquisition of the cloud software giant Vmware, which closed in November 2023, and the rising sales of its AI-oriented data center chips -- which more than tripled to $12.2 billion to account for 24% of its top line.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue to rise by 19% and its GAAP EPS to more than triple. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- a metric that filters out the noise from its acquisitions -- is expected to grow by 26%.\n\nWhich stock is the better value?\n\nWith an enterprise value of $6.1 billion, Wolfspeed doesn't look like a bargain at 8 times this year's sales. Broadcom, with an enterprise value of $1.13 trillion, might initially seem pricier at 19 times this year's sales -- but it still looks reasonably valued at 28 times its adjusted EBITDA. Wolfspeed's adjusted EBITDA is still negative.\n\nNeither of these stocks is cheap, but Broadcom is clearly a better buy right now. It's bigger, better diversified, growing faster, consistently profitable, and more heavily exposed to the booming AI market than Wolfspeed. Wolfspeed's business might eventually bounce back, but for that to occur, it will need the EV market to heat up and for its infrastructure upgrades to gradually reduce its costs over the next few years. It will also need to hire a new permanent CEO who can provide a clearer roadmap for its future.",

            "content": "Right now, there are nine public companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 trillion. As of intra-day trading on Jan. 6, the trillion-dollar club in order from highest to lowest is made up of the following stocks:\n\nApple: $3.7 trillion\n\n$3.7 trillion Nvidia: $3.7 trillion\n\n$3.7 trillion Microsoft: $3.2 trillion\n\n$3.2 trillion Alphabet: $2.4 trillion\n\n$2.4 trillion Amazon: $2.4 trillion\n\n$2.4 trillion Meta Platforms : $1.6 trillion\n\n$1.6 trillion Tesla: $1.3 trillion\n\n$1.3 trillion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: $1.1 trillion\n\n$1.1 trillion Broadcom: $1.1 trillion\n\nAmong these companies, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Broadcom completed stock splits in recent years. Besides each of these companies playing a pioneering role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, each had big run-ups in their respective share prices before splitting their stocks.\n\nDuring the past year, shares of Meta Platforms (META -1.95%)have soared by 76% -- nearly double the gain of the Nasdaq Composite and almost triple that of the S&P 500.\n\nHere's why I think Meta will be the next trillion-dollar stock to explore a split.\n\nWhy might Meta split its stock soon?\n\nIn the graph below, I've annotated the stock splits for each of the trillion-dollar stocks as indicated by the circles with the letter \"S\" in the middle. The overarching trend that can be seen below is that each of these stocks witnessed pronounced and prolonged gains before the split.\n\nAMZN data by YCharts\n\nOne thing investors have learned during the past year is that Meta's management is serious about investing in AI infrastructure to bolster both its social media and virtual reality ecosystems. Considering Meta has never split its stock, unlike many of its big tech cohorts, I think now is a good time for the company to consider doing one as its AI ambitions begin to take shape and bear fruit.\n\nHow would a stock split affect investors?\n\nStock splits themselves do not change the overall valuation of a company. The reason for this is because during a split, a company's shares outstanding and stock price move by identical but opposite proportions.\n\nFor example, if a company announced a 5-for-1 split, its outstanding share count would increase fivefold while its stock price would decrease by a factor of five. At the end of the day, the company's market cap remains unchanged.\n\nNevertheless, after a split the company's lower share price is perceived as cheaper, so many stocks tend to rise after a split amid increased buying. These dynamics can also be seen in the chart in the prior section.\n\nWhile share prices alone aren't enough to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued, I wouldn't be surprised if some investors see Meta's price of about $620 as expensive. Moreover, given the company's positive momentum during the past year, retail investors in particular may feel that they've missed the boat and that the shares are too pricey. The lower share price upon completing a split should broaden Meta's investor base, and could potentially inspire more enthusiasm for the company amid intense competition in the AI realm.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRegardless of a split, Meta is a solid buy among AI opportunities\n\nThe chart below shows the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Meta benchmarked against the average forward P/E of the S&P 500. Interestingly, Meta's forward P/E of 24 is little different from that of the S&P 500 -- suggesting investors may see an investment in the company as the same as an investment in the broader markets.\n\nMETA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nTaking this a step further, Meta's valuation could suggest that investors have not yet fully bought into the company's AI aspirations, and so they do not think the company deserves to be trading at a premium.\n\nI don't agree with this assessment. Although Meta has made it clear that its infrastructure investments in chips, hardware, and more will be costly in the near term, I see these as necessary moves for the company to remain competitive.\n\nMeta stock is one to buy hand over fist for investors with a long-term horizon, regardless of a split. Furthermore, I think Meta will continue generating market-beating returns in the long run, and so I would take advantage of its current price action right now.",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +32.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has gained 20.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.30 points to a change of +29.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.45 indicates a change of +18.3% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",

            "content": "Treasury yields continued to surge on sticky inflation data, dragging the market down today. Tech and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, as the Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2%, more than the other major market indexes.\n\nShares of electric vehicle makers Tesla (TSLA -4.91%) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN -4.34%) fell roughly 4% and 5%, respectively. Meanwhile, shares of artificial intelligence semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO -2.02%) fell 3.3%.\n\nHigh yields not going away\n\nWith the first full week of the year underway, economic data is back on the calendar. New data today supports the belief that inflation will remain stickier than expected and perhaps even persistent, making it difficult for the Federal Reserve to continue to lower interest rates.\n\nThe services Purchasing Managers' Index, which shows the health of the services sector in the U.S., came in at 64.4 in December, up over 4 points from the prior month and the highest level seen since January. Meanwhile, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also came in higher than expected.\n\nTraders betting on rate cuts now view a rate cut in January as very unlikely while 60% of traders think the Fed will hold interest rates where they are at the agency's March meeting as well. That number came in at less than 57% just yesterday and only 47% a week ago. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury moved to nearly 4.69%.\n\nIn more company-specific news, analysts at Bank of America downgraded Tesla from a buy rating to hold, despite lifting their price target from $400 to $490. Analyst John Murphy believes that investors have now priced in positive catalysts such as the possibility of autonomous vehicles. The share price more than adequately reflects this business but Tesla still has work to do to make it a reality, Murphy wrote.\n\nOther analysts, however, are more bullish on Tesla. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu upgraded the company to a buy rating and Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated his buy rating, naming Tesla one of his favorite stocks in 2025. Both analysts think Tesla can lower costs, produce more affordable vehicles, stabilize its gross margin, and have further opportunities in the autonomous business.\n\nLook ahead to Friday\n\nMost of the sell-off in tech today appears related to the macro environment, and new data supporting sticky inflation and a strong economy that could keep yields elevated. With the market and most tech stocks trading at sky-high valuations, it's no surprise to see investors pushing the sell button. The silver lining is that the economic data continues to support an economy on sound footing. High yields supported by an expanding economy are not necessarily bad and could lead to stronger earnings, which could continue to support the market.\n\nHowever, many investors also expected rate cuts this year, so stocks may be pressured if those don't materialize. Remember, investor sentiment can change quickly and more economic data is on tap this week. ADP's private sector jobs data comes out tomorrow, but the real show will be on Friday when December's nonfarm payroll jobs data is released. A weak reading of the jobs report could send yields lower, although investors may not react favorably if they grow concerned about a recession.\n\nI'm currently on the sidelines when it comes to highly valued tech and AI stocks like Tesla, Broadcom, and Rivian. The enormous potential of the AI market may lead investors in a different direction, but stocks with higher valuations are more susceptible to sell off on bad news.",

Broadcom's market valuation of $1.11 trillion put an average price of $231.98 on the transaction.\n\nOver the year, the company has returned an impressive 128 percent, with shares trading closer than a 52-week high.\n\nIndirectly, Kawwas still holds almost 700,000 shares through a trust and directly 82,990 shares, including 75,000 restricted stock units. However, analysts said Broadcom remains a top semiconductor company even after the insider sale. Key differentiators include the fact that the company has already achieved 15 years in a row of increasing dividends and has a good outlook for future growth.\n\nBroadcom's stock also has benefited from overall optimism in the semiconductor market.

This development has pushed shares of other semiconductor players, including AMD (AMD, Financial) and Broadcom, higher.\n\nBroadcom is bullish with major investment firms. In the past three months, UBS, Bernstein, and JPMorgan have raised their price targets for the company, citing strong AI revenue growth and its strategic move into the AI networking and custom computing segments. Goldman Sachs was also standing by Broadcom with a Buy rating. It said that the company's revenue trajectory is strong and that it overhauled non-GAAP EPS forecasts for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n\nAs AI and software continue to grow, Broadcom is cementing its place as one of the key semiconductor names of the future.",

            "content": "Shares of the semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO -2.06%) soared last month after the company's fourth-quarter financial results surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Broadcom is a leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used in artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure. That's just the long way of saying its chips are used for AI processing.\n\nBroadcom's shares jumped by 43% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as investors cheered the company's top- and bottom-line results in the quarter.\n\nRising momentum from AI and an acquisition\n\nBroadcom reported sales of $14 billion in the quarter (which ended Nov. 3), an increase of 51% from the year-ago quarter and mostly on par with analysts' consensus estimates. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) diluted earnings increased by 28% to $1.42 per share, sparking investor enthusiasm, considering Wall Street's average estimate was $1.38.\n\nBroadcom's full-year results were also impressive. Revenue grew 44% to a record $51.6 billion, and the company reached $12.2 billion in AI revenue, an increase of 220% from 2023.\n\nBroadcom's management highlighted two growth areas in the fourth quarter and in 2024, noting that its acquisition of VMware and its artificial intelligence pursuits are paying off. VMware is a cloud computing service that allows companies to set up virtual machines for users. Broadcom closed on the deal in early 2024, and it said in its recent financial results that the acquisition will exceed its initial earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) expectations.\n\n\"We are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal,\" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on last month's earnings call.\n\nAdditionally, investors were no doubt pleased that Broadcom's AI revenue spiked 220% in 2024 to $12.2 billion. Just a few months ago, Broadcom raised its AI revenue estimate from its initial projection of $11 billion.\n\nWith Broadcom exceeding its initial estimate, it's clear that demand for the company's ASICs is in full swing. With the jump in AI revenue, the company's artificial intelligence technology now accounts for 41% of its total semiconductor sales.\n\nIt's only the beginning\n\nBroadcom is tapping into a fast-growing AI infrastructure market that's just getting started. Fellow AI chip competitor Nvidia believes AI data center spending could reach $2 trillion over the next five years. As companies ramp up spending to compete in the AI wars, Broadcom's processors are already well positioned to benefit, and the company knows it.\n\n\"We see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive,\" Tan said on the call.\n\nWith Broadcom's shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6, its stock isn't exactly cheap. But AI's huge potential to transform the tech industry makes Broadcom's share price premium a little easier to accept.",

            "content": "Broadcom is set to bring a major release of VMware Cloud Foundation in March, as an SEC filing shows. $2.9 billion in R&D budget has been set aside for this release. A smaller release armed with 750 million in R&D is likely to follow in July.\n\nThe news was first unveiled by The Register. It found in the Form 10-K filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that two releases will follow in March and July, respectively. It is suspected that the former is VMware Cloud Foundation 9. Broadcom\u2019s ambition is to make this release of VCF the \u201cAWS of on-premises,\u201d with an experience virtually indistinguishable from the cloud.\n\nJudgment approaches\n\nThese are big promises from Broadcom, the owner of VMware since November 2023. Since then, many components have been separated from VMware, leaving only VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere Foundation. The question now is what these platforms will offer in the future. The announcement of VCF 9 actually raised more questions, especially since Broadcom remained fairly vague about precisely what a simplified, streamlined VMware would look like. That VMware previously offered too many solutions has long been known. It was far too complex for resellers to tease out 60-plus SKUs, let alone price them custom.\n\nNow that a date finally seems to have been pinned down for VCF 9 (at least, we\u2019re assuming the impending \u201cbig release\u201d is actually version 9), there will soon be a verdict to pass on VMware by Broadcom. It should be noted that the new version was already planned before the acquisition with a corresponding R&D budget. The question is how much influence Broadcom had thereafter.\n\nAlternatives everywhere\n\nThere are plenty of VMware alternatives to flock to should the changes made by Broadcom cause too much of a headache, the main one being Nutanix. Although there are many switchers and this is leading to large revenue increases for competing products, leaving VMware sometimes proves more difficult than it seems. Prices have risen sharply, according to many customers, with staggering percentages regularly cited in the process. But Broadcom maintains that those who previously used at least four VMware components would now be cheaper. This is because everything is now covered by one license, whereas before, it was a sum of \u00e0 la carte options. The problem: Most users don\u2019t need all those extra solutions. It is up to Broadcom to change customers\u2019 minds in that area with VCF 9.",

Readers may recall that in June 2024 VMware announced VCF version 5.2, and released it on July 23rd.\n\nAt the time, VMware told The Register the release represented a \u201cfirst step\u201d towards making VCF easier to deploy and manage, thanks to the inclusion of live patching and more powerful upgrade tools.\n\nBut VMware\u2019s portfolio still lacks a unified SDK and single sign-on, omissions that make it complex to manage.\n\nBroadcom has promised that a forthcoming version 9.0 of VCF will tidy up those loose ends and deliver a powerful private cloud platform. But the company has not said when that upgrade will arrive.\n\nThe Form 10-K, however, mentions planned major releases in March and July. The March release has been allocated $2.9 billion of in-process research and development costs, suggesting it\u2019s a big one. The July release is valued at just $750 million.\n\nThe annual report mentions that both releases were on VMware\u2019s books at the time of its acquisition in November 2023, so perhaps plans have changed, or timeframes have slipped.\n\nBut just knowing that two releases are on a roadmap that Broadcom puts on the record will be welcome news for many VMware users as they contemplate moving from perpetual licenses or other subscriptions to Broadcom\u2019s new bundles of software and services that typically see customers\u2019 bills rise by at least 200 percent \u2013 and sometimes up to 1050 percent as claimed by AT&T.\n\nBroadcom defends those prices on grounds that VCF is a powerful package that quickly pays for itself in productivity increases. But with VCF not yet in the form Broadcom says will deliver maximum efficiency, users are being asked to pay for less potent product before improvements arrive.\n\nBuy. Chop up. Sell off. Raise prices. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nAnother item of Broadcom news that landed in late 2024, on the 23rd to be precise, was a complained from Netflix regarding infringement of patents related to virtualization.\n\nThe complaint [PDF] alleges that Netflix holds five patents that Broadcom (and VMware before it) knowingly violated for years \u2013 because its own patent applications were rejected in part because the vid-streamer had already successfully patented its own tech.\n\nFor the patent pedants among you, the patents Netflix alleges are being infringed are all registered in the USA under numbers 7,779,424, 7,797,707, 8,799,891, 8,185,893 and 8,863,122.\n\nNetflix also argues that pre-acquisition VMware had a culture of copying intellectual property, but doesn\u2019t explain why it\u2019s chosen this moment to litigate the patents.\n\nThe complaint does, however, offer a short history of VMware and Broadcom, observing that the latter\u2019s business model has been described as \u201cBuy. Chop up. Sell off. Raise prices. Rinse. Repeat.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the motivation for this legal action, given Broadcom has told investors it\u2019s massively increased revenue and profit at VMware since its takeover. \u00ae",

            "content": "Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakers like Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) rallied on Monday. At one point, they were up by 4%, 4.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. As of 1:26 p.m. ET, their gains had moderated to 1.2%, 1.7%, and 4.9%, respectively.\n\nAI-related chip stocks sold off a bit during the last couple of weeks of 2024, but they got a lift Friday on signs of strong AI chip demand. Then on Monday, another data point emerged that bodes favorably for the near-term outlook of the AI sector.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nFoxconn's blowout monthly revenue\n\nOn Monday morning, Hon Hai Precision (OTC: HNHPF), also known as Foxconn, released its latest monthly revenue figures. Of note, Foxconn is one of the world's largest electronics assemblers, as it assembles the iPhone. But it also has significant businesses in electric vehicles and, most importantly for this discussion, AI servers.\n\nFoxconn reported massive year-over-year growth of 42.3% in December, its highest figure of any month last year. Furthermore, the company noted its growth was primarily due to high demand for AI servers.\n\nThis is an indicator that AI chip demand will remain robust despite the hypergrowth of the past two years. The news dovetailed nicely with a blog post published by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) on Friday in which it said that it would spend upwards of $80 billion on AI data centers this fiscal year.\n\nFoxconn's December surge may reflect the availability of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) new Blackwell chip. The rollout of that hardware had been delayed, but production was supposed to ramp up in late Q4. Of note, Arm licenses its architecture to Nvidia and other cloud giants for their data center CPUs, which often accompany Nvidia GPUs or custom accelerators in AI servers. So, a steepening ramp-up in production of Nvidia Blackwell systems would benefit Arm. Arm also tends to be among the most volatile AI stocks, so it's perhaps not a surprise to see it having strong gains.\n\nWhile Nvidia and adjacent stocks surged Monday, the Foxconn news was a positive for Broadcom and Marvell as well. These two companies have a nice duopoly as makers of custom accelerator parts that the cloud computing giants incorporate into their own AI accelerator designs. With cloud companies all investing heavily in developing and producing their own chips to cut costs, shares of Broadcom and Marvell have soared.\n\nFoxconn also makes \"white label\" server components for large cloud companies, which often assemble its subsystems and systems into their own proprietary server designs. So the boom in Foxconn orders actually bodes well not only for Nvidia, but also for Broadcom and Marvell.\n\nIn 2024, Broadcom rose by 110%, Marvell gained 84%, and Arm was up 64% -- all stellar results. However, there is a lot of optimism reflected in their valuations. This perhaps helps explain why, in the wake of their Monday morning surges based on Foxconn's bullish AI demand indicator, the stocks fell back to more reasonable gains.\n\nStrong demand, lofty valuations\n\n2025 will be an interesting year for the AI winners of 2023 and 2024. On the one hand, the AI infrastructure buildout doesn't show any signs of letting up. On the other hand, AI winners such as these three are trading at quite full valuations, with Broadcom valued at 37 times this year's earnings estimates, Marvell at 44 times, and Arm at 71 times.\n\nAt those levels, these stocks are a tad risky in the near term. Should there be any hint of an AI growth slowdown at all relative to expectations, their prices could slide. Still, it's hard to see anything but positive news for these three companies over the medium term, as long as the cloud giants continue racing to achieve a better and better AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "I have been hesitant to issue a Buy rating for Nvidia (NVDA), the leading AI chip company, due to an impending revenue decline. However, my analysis shows that the stock\u2019s valuation is likely to remain stable and grow over at least the next 12 months. By contrast, Broadcom (AVGO), a competitor to Nvidia, is excessively overvalued, leaving me neutral on it despite the company\u2019s operational strengths.\n\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nBroadcom Is Challenging Nvidia in AI Chips\n\nI am neutral on Broadcom due to its valuation, even though the company is harnessing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and networking solutions to challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominant position in AI infrastructure with its graphics processing units (GPUs) and CUDA software ecosystem. Custom ASICs are optimized for specific workloads, offering higher efficiency and tailored solutions to hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta (META) and OpenAI.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom is complementing its custom ASICs with advanced networking solutions, including its Jericho3-AI Ethernet fabric. These networking solutions enhance data transfer speeds, reduce latency in AI data centers, and integrate seamlessly with hyperscale infrastructure.\n\nIn Fiscal 2024, Broadcom\u2019s AI-related revenue increased by 220% year-over-year, driven by its custom ASICs and networking solutions. However, unlike Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform, Broadcom does not have a unified software ecosystem, which somewhat limits its long-term market potential.\n\nAdditionally, ASICs require higher upfront investments compared to GPUs, which are cheaper to produce and more versatile, as provided by Nvidia.\n\nIn my opinion, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on future growth in use-case-specific AI chips and networking solutions for data centers, but the market has already priced in this future growth well ahead of time.\n\nBroadcom Is Too Heavily Overvalued to Invest In\n\nFor my analysis, I am considering a period of only two years for Broadcom, as the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical. I view AVGO stock as heavily overvalued at present, which forms the basis of my neutral near-term outlook.\n\nBy January 2027, I estimate that the company will have $72 billion in trailing 12-month revenue. Furthermore, I expect Broadcom to expand its net margin in 2025 and 2026, as temporary headwinds\u2014such as acquisition-related costs and increased interest expenses\u2014diminish. To be conservative, I estimate a net margin of 50% by January 2027, aligning with historical cyclical trends.\n\nWith a net income of $36 billion and outstanding shares of approximately 4.5 billion, the company would likely have a trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS) of $8 by December 2026. Historically, during profitability peaks, the stock has traded at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio ranging from 40 to 20. I will use the midpoint of 30 for my terminal multiple.\n\nBased on this model, my fair price target for Broadcom in January 2027 is $240. Since the current stock price is $231.50, the market appears to have already priced in the next two years of the company\u2019s growth.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for Broadcom Stock?\n\nOn Wall Street, Broadcom has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 23 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells. However, the average AVGO price target of $234.38 implies just a 0.8% upside potential over the next 12 months. This consensus price target reaffirms my Hold rating on Broadcom stock at its current valuation.\n\nSee more AVGO analyst ratings\n\nNvidia Remains a Shrewd AI Investment for Now\n\nIn contrast to Broadcom\u2014which is attempting to capture niche portions of the AI market\u2014Nvidia is the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure compute. At present, Nvidia controls up to 95% of the AI chip market, and this dominance is expected to remain above 80% for at least the next 18 months. For further context, Broadcom\u2019s data center revenue could reach $17 billion in 2025, compared to a possible $200 billion for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s robust growth\u2014fueled by intense demand for its GPUs to build out AI data centers\u2014will not last indefinitely. My forecast suggests that the stock will continue to rise over the next two years, though volatility is likely to follow as the company faces a potential revenue decline when demand for AI infrastructure begins to taper.\n\nAt the moment, I believe Nvidia stock appears reasonably valued. I recently purchased a moderate stake, aiming to benefit from ongoing AI momentum over the next 18 months or so. I have set my take-profit price at $200 and believe the stock could reach this level within 12 months. Since the current price is $136.30, this indicates a potential 48.2% upside in one year.\n\nNvidia Is Reasonably Valued despite Recent Exuberance\n\nMy current valuation model for Nvidia forecasts $235 billion in trailing 12-month revenue by January 2027, with a net income margin of 57.5% and approximately 24.5 billion outstanding shares. These figures yield a net income of $135.125 billion and an EPS of $5.50.\n\nI anticipate that the company\u2019s P/E ratio will contract over the next two years as its growth slows. Given the midpoint of Nvidia\u2019s trailing 12-month and forward P/E ratios is about 50, I am using that as my terminal multiple. The result is a January 2027 price target of $275. With the current price at $136.30, this suggests a compound annual growth rate of approximately 41.9% over the next two years.\n\nNonetheless, because a revenue decline may be on the horizon near January 2027, market sentiment could shift earlier. That is why I have set a more defensive one-year price target of $200.\n\nWhat Is the Nvidia Price Prediction for 2025?\n\nOn Wall Street, Nvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells. The average NVDA price target of $177.08 implies a potential 22.6% upside over the next 12 months. The high estimate is around $20 above my own one-year target of $200, which aligns with my bullish stance on the stock.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Nvidia Is a Better Investment than Broadcom\n\nBased on my analysis, Nvidia is currently a far better investment than Broadcom. While Broadcom is operationally strong, its stock appears excessively priced, suggesting little room for alpha over the next two years. Nvidia, on the other hand, is reasonably valued and positioned for strong annual returns over the next 12 months or more.\n\nDisclosure\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Broadcom Inc (AVGO, Financial) experienced a modest rise in its stock price, closing at $232.55, reflecting a 0.25% increase. This movement follows the company's impressive financial results that have surpassed Wall Street's expectations.\n\nThe semiconductor giant, Broadcom, is making significant strides in the AI sector, particularly in ASICs for AI data centers. In the latest quarter ending on November 3, Broadcom reported sales of $14 billion, marking a 51% rise from the previous year, perfectly aligning with analysts' expectations. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also saw a rise of 28% to $1.42, exceeding the average estimate of $1.38.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Broadcom recorded a 44% increase in revenue, reaching $51.6 billion. The company's AI revenue reached $12.2 billion, marking a staggering 220% rise from the previous year. The strategic acquisition of VMware has played a crucial role in these outstanding results.\n\nBroadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, emphasized the positive impact of the VMware acquisition, which is expected to exceed the anticipated $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. The AI revenue, now revised from $11 billion to $12.2 billion, represents 41% of Broadcom's total semiconductor sales, highlighting the company's focused approach towards AI.\n\nDespite Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) having a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.98, the expanding AI infrastructure market offers substantial growth potential, supporting the stock's current valuation. However, according to GuruFocus, Broadcom is considered \"Significantly Overvalued\" with a GF Value of $112.02. This suggests a conservative stance may be warranted when evaluating investment opportunities in Broadcom, given its current price levels.\n\nAs the company continues to capitalize on the AI market's growth, its strategic initiatives and acquisitions are likely to position Broadcom as a key player in the technology sector. Investors should stay tuned to further developments and assess potential opportunities aligned with their investment strategies.",

            "content": "Big tech companies such as Google, Meta and Bytedance are apparently increasingly trying to make their supply chains for AI hardware independent of chip supplier giant Nvidia. What many experts now suspect is based on the business of the semiconductor company Broadcom \u2013 and its talks with a major Nvidia supplier.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAs Broadcom CEO Hock Tan reported in the conference on the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024, three hyperscalers among Broadcom's customers are each planning to deploy one million XPU clusters in their data centers by 2027. Talks are also underway with two other hyperscalers that have their own AI XPUs in development. Specific names were not mentioned at the conference \u2013, but there is speculation that these are Google, Meta, Bytedance, OpenAI and Apple.\n\nAI chips: Broadcom sales skyrocket\n\nAt least that would be one explanation for Broadcom's massive increase in sales of semiconductor products in the AI sector. The portal The Next Platform has looked at the development over the past three years: In the 2022 financial year, sales here amounted to 1.94 billion, including network chips and compute engine chips that Broadcom's customers developed themselves and then had manufactured by a contract manufacturer. Broadcom in turn works together with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer.\n\nIn 2023, Broadcom already generated almost twice as much turnover in the same area: 3.8 billion dollars. And the figure Tan quoted in the most recent results conference made many people sit up and take notice: Broadcom earned 12.2 billion dollars, more than three times as much, in the AI chip segment in 2024.\n\nFigures suggest client\n\nBroadcom is keeping the names of its customers a secret, instead only referring to \"three hyperscalers\", for example. However, it is clear that these customers must have such a massive budget that they can develop their own chips, which Broadcom then manufactures to order. As the circle of these companies is not too large, speculation quickly falls back on Google, Meta and Co. Many of them are still supplied by Nvidia in this area.\n\nAccording to the speculative reading of the Broadcom figures, however, Nvidia customers could soon become Nvidia competitors. Instead of using the graphics card manufacturer's chips, hyperscalers prefer to develop their own and then have them manufactured by Broadcom and TSMC.\n\nAnzeige\n\nBroadcom talks with SK Hynix\n\nThis would be anything but a welcome development for Nvidia. Neither is the fact that, according to a media report, Broadcom has already approached SK Hynix, which is to supply the high bandwidth memory (HBM) components for the AI chips. The South Korean chip giant is Samsung's biggest competitor in the memory chip market and also supplies Nvidia with HBM. Accordingly, SK Hynix already has to adjust its production capacities for the Broadcom order, which could lead to delays in the next generation of SK Hynix's 1c DRAM.\n\nNvidia's largest customer for AI accelerators is Microsoft, but according to The Next Platform, there is a similar development here too. Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are increasingly turning to the US chip manufacturer Marvell. This could significantly increase the pressure on Nvidia, which is also struggling with US export restrictions for the Chinese market, in 2025.\n\n(nen)",

The firm is also thought to be collaborating with Apple to develop the iPhone maker\u2019s first artificial intelligence server chip, codenamed \u201cBaltra,\u201d providing the advanced networking technologies essential for AI processing.\n\nBad news for Nvidia\n\nAccording to TheElec, Broadcom has now approached South Korean memory giant SK Hynix to provide the HBM it plans to use in custom AI chips for a \"major\" (but predictably unnamed) tech company.\n\nTheElec\u2019s sources say that Broadcom actively pursued SK Hynix to supply its verified HBM solutions and has secured a large order of the in-demand memory, with shipments expected to begin in the second half of 2025.\n\nSK Hynix, Samsung\u2019s biggest memory rival, is a key supplier of HBM to Nvidia, which likely won\u2019t be thrilled with this latest news.\n\nTo meet the increased demand from Broadcom, SK Hynix is reportedly adjusting its production capacity. TheElec says the company will boost its 1b DRAM wafer output (used as the core die in its HBM) from 140,000\u2013150,000 units to 160,000\u2013170,000 units in 2025. There is a knock on with this expansion however, which is that it could delay the rollout of SK Hynix\u2019s next-generation 1c DRAM as the company prioritizes its immediate production needs.\n\nAre you a pro?

Investors seem to be starting to believe that at least Broadcom could eventually break Nvidia's control over the AI chip market. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri stated:\n\n\"Broadcom is currently the leader in manufacturing custom AI chips, while Marvell is 'close behind'; they are the only two companies in the U.S. heavily engaged in this business.\"\n\nAs the \"only two\" in the U.S., the \"competition\" between Broadcom and Marvell has also begun.\n\nIn early December last year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan heavily promoted the potential of the custom AI chip market, claiming that the company's three major clients, including Google, could spend $60 billion to $90 billion per year on custom chips within two years.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that although Broadcom currently holds about 70% of the custom AI chip market, over time, its share may be taken by Marvell, and Broadcom's market share could drop to around 50%. Specifically, Marvell has several advantages:\n\nSupport from important clients: Marvell has already won the favor of important clients like Amazon, and possibly Microsoft as well. Broadcom has alienated clients like Amazon due to its tough negotiation strategies. Favor from cloud service providers: Analysts believe that the main demand for custom AI chips will come from cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, where Marvell has a competitive edge. Greater growth potential: Due to its current smaller scale, Marvell has more room for growth from the expansion of the AI chip market. It is expected that by 2028, Marvell's annual revenue from AI chips could grow to over $20 billion, with overall revenue being four times its current level. Additionally, Marvell's valuation is more attractive.\n\nNvidia will still maintain its dominant position\n\nDespite the rapid development of custom AI chips by Broadcom and Marvell, analysts believe that NVIDIA's dominance in the overall AI chip market is unlikely to be shaken in the short term.\n\nKevin Krewell, chief analyst at technology research firm Tirias, stated that NVIDIA's GPUs are more versatile and \"user-friendly\" compared to the AI chips developed by Broadcom and Marvell, supporting a wider range of workloads. Custom chips are still considered a \"niche\" business compared to NVIDIA's general-purpose chips.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA's technological accumulation and ecosystem development in the AI chip field are far ahead of these competitors",

            "content": "In the past year, U.S. tech stocks have once again become the focus of global investors.\n\nWith a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion, Broadcom has officially joined the ranks of tech giants, expanding the club of large tech stocks to eight: Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, and Broadcom\u2014these eight stocks are collectively referred to as \"BATMMAAN.\"\n\nNotably, among BATMMAAN, NVIDIA, which has the highest return rate, may currently have the lowest valuation.\n\nData shows that NVIDIA recorded a 171% increase in 2024, the largest among the eight stocks in BATMMAAN. Meanwhile, based on the closing price in 2024, NVIDIA's expected price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 31 times, while analysts generally expect NVIDIA's earnings to grow by 52% in 2025, resulting in a PEG ratio of 0.6.\n\nThe PEG metric was invented by investment master Jim Slater in the 1960s, referring to the company's expected P/E ratio divided by the expected earnings growth rate. If the PEG is greater than 1, the stock may be overvalued; conversely, it may be undervalued.\n\nAmong BATMMAAN, only NVIDIA has a PEG ratio below 1. This means that NVIDIA's valuation remains reasonable, making it the \"cheapest\" among large tech stocks. Broadcom ranks second lowest with a level of 2.3.\n\nIn comparison, although Tesla's expected earnings growth rate for next year is also 37%, its expected P/E ratio is as high as 121 times, pushing the PEG to 3.2, making it the highest in BATMMAAN.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft recorded only a 12% cumulative increase in 2024, making it the only stock in BATMMAAN to underperform the market, with a PEG of 2.3, indicating overvaluation. The other two companies with low earnings growth rates are Alphabet and Meta, with PEG ratios of 1.8 and 1.9, respectively, while Apple and Amazon have PEGs of 1.8 and 1.4, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that high valuations do not necessarily mean poor performance in the short term. Looking back at history, as we entered 1999 from 1998, despite many analysts warning that stock market valuations were too high, the S&P 500 index still rose by 21% in 1999",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins.\n\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a \u201cbig problem\u201d for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) \u2026. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they\u2019re not really AI plays, they\u2019re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They\u2019ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you\u2019re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that\u2019s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,\u201d Niles said.\n\nNiles said stocks can face a \u201crough\u201d time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed.\n\n\u201cThe Fed finally admitted inflation wasn\u2019t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that\u2019s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025.

It rewarded those, including Nvidia Corp NVDA and Broadcom Inc AVGO, that successfully tapped the artificial intelligence wave while punishing those that failed, like Intel Corp INTC.\n\nA third of the ten global companies worth over $1 trillion came from the chip industry, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia Completes Run:ai Buyout: Details\n\nIn 2024, Broadcom joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM and Nvidia in the coveted Trillion club.\n\nBroadcom stock surged 114%, while Intel plunged 58% in the last 12 months, underscoring the strategies that worked or failed for the companies.\n\nBroadcom develops custom chips for U.S. Big Tech companies like Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL, Google, Meta Platforms Inc META, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.\n\nContract chipmaker Intel lost out on mobile chips to Qualcomm Inc QCOM, Arm Holdings plc ARM, and Apple Inc AAPL, CNBC reports.\n\nNvidia proved to be another nemesis for Intel after the former\u2019s GPUs, targeted at video games, have transformed into critical hardware for developing AI models. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc AMD also started snatching market share in the PC and server CPU markets by tapping Taiwan Semiconductor, which proved a triple whammy for Intel.\n\nAll of which rendered Intel\u2019s CPU, formerly the most significant and expensive part of a server, redundant in an AI server. Nvidia GPUs meant for 2025 do not need an Intel CPU.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom emerged as the second most valuable chip company after Nvidia, which reached a $3.4 trillion valuation thanks to the AI frenzy, gaining 179% in the last 12 months.\n\nOnce the most valuable chipmaker, Intel saw its valuation tumble from a $300 billion market cap in 2020 to $85 billion in 2024, prompting it to downsize its workforce, fire veteran CEO Pat Gelsinger, and potentially divest core parts of its business. Nvidia replaced it in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestors continue to reward Broadcom for its more straightforward and affordable XPUs than Nvidia\u2019s GPUs.\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call, Broadcom chief Hock E. Tan shared plans to double shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers, including Google and, reportedly, TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta.\n\nTan expects the companies to incur $60 billion\u2014$90 billion in XPU capital expenditures in the next two years. Broadcom expects AI revenue to constitute 65% of its revenue in the first quarter from 40% in the fourth quarter.\n\nTan projected a decade-long sustained AI demand backed by Big Tech ambitions, citing investments by OpenAI and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. Rosenblatt\u2019s Hans Mosesmann expects Broadcom\u2019s custom-chip (ASIC) AI abilities and surging AI demand to boost rivalry with AMD and Nvidia.\n\nIn 2025, Intel will release a new AI chip dubbed Falcon Shores.\n\nIntel had divulged plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit and does not expect meaningful sales from outside customers until 2027.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Toshiya Hari, Benchmark\u2019s Cody Acree, Needham\u2019s N. Quinn Bolton, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer, and KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh flagged Intel\u2019s competitive pressures and margin challenges on the back of modest revenue growth.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector through VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX.\n\nPrice Actions: At last check Thursday, AVGO stock was up 2.45% at $237.51 premarket, while INTC stock was up 1.20%.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock",

One strength that Nvidia has is that it offers package deals beyond just the highly touted Blackwell chip, Arya said.\n\nRead more: Where Wall Street stands on Nvidia in 2025\n\nArya noted that a few years ago, tech\u2019s buzzword was 5G (in effect, high-speed phone service). There's no need to \u201cget frazzled over what may or may not happen in technology three years from now in such a dynamically changing market,\u201d he said.\n\nWith giants like Amazon (AMZN) announcing an $8 billion partnership with Anthropic to enter the AI chip space and Google (GOOG) dropping a supercomputer with an AI chip called Willow, it's evident Big Tech companies want in on the action.\n\nSimilarly, Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) have released advanced custom chips, but, \u201cthere is no software expertise, no partner to bring enterprise demand to you,\u201d Arya said. \u201cThat is the value add that Nvidia has.\u201d\n\nAmid that package deal on tech, Nvidia has room to grow.\n\nThe company expects data center sales will have reached $110 billion in 2024, Arya said. Broadcom and Marvell expect data center sales to reach $12 billion and $700 million for last year, respectively, per Arya.\n\nFor 2025, Nvidia is expected to grow data center sales to $200 billion while Broadcom should be around $17 billion. Marvell will pull in anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion, Arya estimates.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Nvidia\u2019s market share of whatever\u2019s going on, it is 80% to 85% in the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Why Blackwell won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Product of the Year award\n\nOne reason the market favors Nvidia is because \u201cin semiconductors, incumbency scale matters,\u201d Arya said. \u201cUnless the incumbent messes up, it is very hard to dislodge them from a market share perspective because they are the ones who get the first call when there is anything short in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nFor example, if a company such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is unable to produce the next generation of chips, or if Hynix (000660.KS) or Micron (MU) don\u2019t have enough memory, \u201cwho is going to be their first call?\u201d asked Arya.",

            "content": "The stock market has seen multiple companies hit the $1 trillion mark in valuation in the past few years, the latest one being semiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO -2.14%). The stock's valuation more than doubled in 2024 as sales and profits have been soaring in recent quarters.\n\nBut has it become too expensive and too late to invest in it after such a strong year and with the stock trading at close to 40 times its projected future profits? Or could this be just the start of a much bigger rally for Broadcom, with more gains to come in 2025?\n\nWhy Broadcom has been such a hot buy of late\n\nA big reason investors have been captivated by Broadcom is the semiconductor company's potential in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities. And prior to its big run-up in value, it was still one of the more modestly priced AI stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple below 30.\n\nThe company recently wrapped up its year-end results for fiscal 2024 (which ended Nov. 3). Sales totaling $51.6 billion rose by 44% year over year, largely driven by a 181% increase in infrastructure software sales ($21.5 billion) -- due in large part to the closing of the acquisition of VMware in November of 2023.\n\nThe semiconductor solutions business, its main segment, grew by a more modest rate of 7% to $30.1 billion. Included within that was $12.2 billion in AI-related revenue, which grew by 220% year over year -- likely catching investors' attention and sparking the stock's fierce rally.\n\nA lot hinges on demand from hyperscalers\n\nCEO Hock Tan often talks about the growth opportunities pertaining to hyperscalers: large companies with significant data centers that are scaling up their operations at a fast pace.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and Alphabet's Google and their respective cloud businesses are all examples of some key partners Broadcom works with.\n\nThose are some great collaborators to have, but on the flip side, it also means that Broadcom may be a bit too dependent on demand from a handful of key customers. Research company Gartner projects that by the end of 2025, 30% of generative AI projects could end up abandoned because there isn't a clear payoff from all those ambitious initiatives. If that indeed happens, financial pain could trickle down from that effect and impact the needs of these hyperscalers.\n\nIs Broadcom a good buy in 2025?\n\nBroadcom has been rallying recently, but its growth rate hasn't taken off to such a level to suggest that the AI stock is worth such a steep premium. The semiconductor business is generating just modest growth, and although the CEO is optimistic about opportunities to help certain hyperscalers develop their own AI accelerators, investors may have already priced those opportunities into the stock's inflated valuation.\n\nThe company's growth rate has accelerated in recent quarters, but I'm not sold on this being a great stock at its current valuation. What I'll be looking for is how the company does in its next few quarters as it laps earnings results, which will include contributions from VMware. That will give investors a better indication of its organic growth and how fast the business is really accelerating.\n\nBetween Broadcom's reliance on a few customers and the potential for a slowdown in AI projects and spending in 2025, I think the conditions might be ripe for a potential correction of this high stock price, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gave back some of its gains in the months ahead.",

Goldman Sachs estimates that companies will pour $1 trillion into generative AI investments over the next few years in their efforts to keep pace with each other.\n\nAll of that spending will propel some of the world's leading AI companies forward, accelerating their growth in a surge that could last for many more years. But which ones would be the best to invest in now as the AI market takes shape? Here are two AI stocks that should be among your top contenders.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nA semiconductor with the letters \"AI\" on top of it.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a major player in the AI market because of its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), many of which are now being used in AI data center infrastructure. As companies expand AI models, they need data centers capable of handling ever more sophisticated processing. Tech giants including Alphabet and Meta already rely on Broadcom's hardware to help provide the processing power their AI software demands.\n\nBroadcom's top and bottom lines are already benefiting from this increased demand for advanced data center chips. Its sales increased by 44% in its fiscal 2024 to $51.5 billion, and its non-GAAP net income increased by 29% to $23.7 billion. More specifically, the company's AI revenue spiked by 220% to more than $12 billion.\n\nThere's likely more growth ahead for Broadcom as companies' needs for AI processors increase. For example, in October, Broadcom reportedly began working to design an AI chip for ChatGPT creator Open AI. And Broadcom's management said on the most recent earnings call that based on the roadmaps its large clients have already laid out, by 2027, it will have a serviceable addressable market for its custom AI accelerators and networking hardware in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion.\n\nBroadcom currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38.1, which is admittedly pretty expensive compared to the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 23.8. But with Broadcom already benefiting from AI demand and with more spending on the way, it's likely that it still has more room to run.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nAnother angle you can take on investing in the AI trend is to buy shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), also called TSCM, which manufactures an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced chips.\n\nThat dominance has led to significant growth for the company recently. In the third quarter, its sales rose 39% to $23.5 billion and earnings increased by 54% to $1.94 per American depositary receipt (ADR). Many of tech's most important companies are utilizing TSMC's advanced manufacturing to make the best AI processors possible, tapping into its ability to produce 3-nanometer (nm) process node chips -- and its planned commercialization of 2nm process node chips in 2025.\n\nIf you're skeptical about investing in an AI chip manufacturer rather than an AI software maker, consider that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has a lot of skin in the AI game as well, estimates that tech companies will spend $2 trillion over the next five years building out AI data centers. Even if they only come relatively close to that estimate, AI represents a massive opportunity for TSCM in the coming years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 22.8, which is much cheaper than many of the company's AI peers and also lower than the S&P 500's average ratio. Between TSMC's relatively inexpensive share price and its leading position in AI chip manufacturing, adding its stock to your portfolio now and holding on for the long term could prove to be a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The past year has been a solid one for semiconductor companies, as evident from the 21% gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index during this period. But not all semiconductor stocks have benefited from the broader market's rally.\n\nFor instance, while shares of Broadcom (AVGO -2.14%) have jumped an impressive 115% in the past year, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -3.40%) stock has headed in the opposite direction and lost 14% of its value. Both companies play a key role in the semiconductor market as they design chips that are used in personal computers (PCs), smartphones, gaming consoles, and data centers.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the prospects of both of these semiconductor stocks and determine which is the better buy following their contrasting performances in the past year.\n\nThe case for AMD\n\nWhile 2024 was a bad year for AMD, the company could witness a nice turnaround in 2025 thanks to the sunny prospects of the PC and data center markets. A closer look at AMD's third-quarter 2024 results (released in October 2024) tells us that a turnaround is already in progress.\n\nThe chipmaker's quarterly revenue increased 18% year over year to $6.8 billion, along with a 31% spike in its earnings per share to $0.92 per share. AMD is forecasting a year-over-year increase of 22% in its revenue for the fourth quarter to $7.5 billion. Analysts are projecting the company's earnings to increase by 41% to $1.09 per share.\n\nThe forecast for 2025 is rosier. AMD's bottom line is projected to jump by 54% in the new year to $5.13 per share on the back of a 27% spike in its revenue to $32.5 billion. It is easy to see why analysts are expecting AMD to step on the gas in 2025. The company's data center business gained momentum throughout 2024 as AMD was able to attract more customers for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in servers for artificial intelligence (AI) model training and inference.\n\nAMD was originally expecting to sell $2 billion worth of data center GPUs in 2024, but it has increased that forecast to more than $5 billion. The company could witness further growth in this segment in 2025 thanks to an improved supply chain, which should allow AMD to fulfill more demand for its AI GPUs. Meanwhile, CEO Lisa Su points out that PC OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are set to triple the number of products powered by AI-capable Ryzen PC processors in 2025.\n\nAs a result, it won't be surprising to see AMD gaining a greater share of the client CPU market. Mercury Research reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market increased by 4.6 percentage points year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to 23.9%. AMD's solid positioning in AI PCs should allow it to grab a bigger chunk of this space in 2025, which should be good enough to help the company maintain its outstanding growth in this segment.\n\nIn all, there are a lot of positives for AMD in the new year, which could help this chip stock come out of the rut that it's in. AMD carries a median 12-month price target of $183 based on 55 analysts covering it, which points toward 46% upside from current levels.\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nBroadcom is already a bigger player in the AI chip market than AMD. It generated $12.2 billion in revenue last fiscal year from sales of its custom AI processors and networking chips, which was a massive jump of 220% from the preceding year. More importantly, AI has set the stage for terrific long-term growth at Broadcom since the company sees its addressable market in this space increasing to a range of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027.\n\nBroadcom is in a robust position to make the most of this lucrative growth opportunity as it controls 55% to 60% of the custom processor market. Assuming Broadcom manages to hold on to a 60% share of this market after three years and the size of the custom processor market increases to $75 billion (based on the midpoint of its guidance range), its AI revenue could jump to $45 billion after three years.\n\nThat would be a big jump of almost four times over the revenue that the company generated from this segment in fiscal 2024. The impressive performance of Broadcom's AI-specific semiconductor business has been solid enough to help the company offset the weakness that it is facing in the non-AI semiconductor business.\n\nMore specifically, Broadcom's non-AI semiconductor revenue fell 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to $4.5 billion. That was in sharp contrast to the 150% year-over-year increase in AI semiconductor revenue to $3.7 billion. The good part is that Broadcom's non-AI semiconductor business has hit a bottom already and the company is expecting a recovery in this segment going forward.\n\nAs such, it is not surprising to see that Broadcom's growth in fiscal 2025 is expected to be stronger than last year. The company finished fiscal 2024 with organic revenue growth of 9%. Its top line came in at $51.6 billion for the quarter. As the following chart tells us, Broadcom is expected to step on the gas in fiscal 2025, followed by healthy growth over the next couple of years as well.\n\nSo, Broadcom is likely to remain a top semiconductor stock going forward thanks to its sunny prospects in AI and a potential recovery in other markets. But is it worth buying this chipmaker over AMD following the outstanding gains that it has delivered in the past year?\n\nThe verdict\n\nWe have seen that both AMD and Broadcom are likely to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond, suggesting that both semiconductor stocks may be worth buying right now. However, Broadcom is trading at a richer valuation than AMD following its impressive surge in the past year. This is evident in the chart below.\n\nBroadcom's sales and earnings multiples are well above AMD's. Of course, Broadcom's dominant position in the custom AI processor market explains why it deserves that rich valuation. However, AMD is expected to deliver faster growth in the new year. That's why investors looking for a growth stock that's trading at an attractive valuation are likely to prefer buying AMD over Broadcom as the former could come out of its slump and soar higher in 2025.",

            "content": "Happy 2025 STH\u2019ers! I just wanted to put this into a post, since it is something we may reference later. I just wanted to quickly mark the new year with what our starting point is for those buying servers. Since it is 2025, I figure this would be a good post to memorialize where we are at with the technology stack.\n\nCPU Cores Per Socket\n\nAMD is currently at 192 Turin Dense cores and 384 threads per socket, and 128 full cache and clock speed cores (256 threads) in Turn. Intel has its 128 core/ 256 thread Granite Rapids AP and its Sierra Forest-SP at 144 cores/ threads. The smaller Granite Rapids-SP and larger 288 core Sierra Forest-AP we expect in the second half of Q1 2025, assuming that 288 core part does not become solely a special order hyper-scale part.\n\nOn the Arm side, NVIDIA Grace is still at 72 cores for the single CPU module and 144 cores for the dual chip module. Check out our Quick Introduction to the NVIDIA GH200 aka Grace Hopper piece because the memory bandwidth varies based on the capacity. Ampere Altra Max is 128 cores and is still chugging along while the AmpereOne is at 192 cores.\n\nNetworking Speeds\n\nOn the switching side, we are at 51.2Tbps switch silicon, although the 102.4T generation should start to emerge in the next quarter or two. We already showed the Delta DC-90640 A Next-Gen 2025 102.4T Switch.\n\nFor client networking, we expect to stay at 400GbE for the near future. It will take PCIe Gen6 or multi-host adapters to get to 800Gbps speeds due to the PCIe bandwidth limitations.\n\nSomething that will change is that 25GbE is currently a PCIe Gen5 x1 slot making it harder to deploy given how inefficient it is to use just given PCIe lanes. 100GbE is becoming the new 25GbE, but the AI space is really pushing 400Gbps networking to efficiently use PCIe lanes.\n\nSSDs and HDD Capacities\n\nHard drives are still progressing slowly as we have seen the launch of a few 30TB class models. On the other hand, SSDs are growing in capacity at an immense pace. We discussed in our Solidigm D5-P5336 61.44TB SSD Review how hard drives lost. The 122.88TB generation is upon us with multiple vendors starting to ship. Those might be sold out for 2025.\n\nAround the corner is the 245.76TB generation and that is coming faster than many think.\n\nServer Memory\n\nWhile most memory today is a maximum of DDR5-6400, the capacity has really stalled. We are still seeing a lot more 64GB and 128GB DIMMs being used than one probably would have thought would be the case in 2020. Instead of increasing capacity per DIMM, we are seeing servers offer 12 memory channels. On the speed side, adding, eventually, MCR DIMMs will be a big deal.\n\nPerhaps the bigger trend is that we are seeing a lot more on the CXL memory front. We have been seeing designs utilize CXL Type-3 devices for memory expansion which is great to see.\n\nGPUs for AI\n\nThere are plenty of AI accelerators out there, but the GPUs are the big one. NVIDIA is transitioning from the HGX H100/ H200 platforms for those that are starting to get GB200 platforms. For those who are not huge customers, the Hopper generation is still it.\n\nAMD is transitioning from the Instinct MI300X to the MI325X generation. On the APU side, it seems like that has become part of El Capitan, but we did not hear about a major refresh yet. AMD\u2019s main architecture is an 8-way OAM platform with two AMD EPYC CPUs and direct Infinity Fabric links.\n\nIntel still says Falcon Shores is coming in 2025.\n\nFinal Words\n\nFrom a rack level, a top-end AI rack is in the 120-140kW range which will be quaint by 2027. Hopefully, that covers most of the big system components. In the future, when we look back on the start of 2025, we at least have this memorialized set of where we started the year.",

            "content": "The year 2024 was a strong one for stocks involved in artificial intelligence (AI), and winners could be found in a variety of areas. For example, Nvidia and Broadcom helped lead the AI chip and infrastructure space higher, while Palantir Technologies was a huge winner in the AI software sector. Amazon and Alphabet helped lead the charge in the cloud computing space.\n\nFor investors looking to invest in AI stocks without trying to pick out the next individual winners, there are a number of solid AI-focused exchange-traded funds (ETF) to invest in for 2025. Let's look at three good options to consider.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nRoundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF\n\nThe Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: CHAT) is an actively managed ETF, meaning that it is managed by a team of investment professionals who can buy and sell stocks within its portfolio based on their research. It currently has 51 holdings, and over 90% of its portfolio is in large-cap stocks that have market caps of $10 billion or more.\n\nThe ETF is fairly new, starting in May 2023. It has been a strong performer in 2024, up about 31%. It has an expense ratio of 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 invested.\n\nThe Roundhill ETF currently has a nice, well-rounded portfolio of top holdings across the AI space that cover all aspects of AI, including semiconductors, cloud computing, system integrators, and software. If you want a mixture of stocks benefiting from AI, this is a great ETF to start with.\n\nIts top holdings as of Dec. 29, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Nvidia NVDA 7.56% Alphabet GOOGL 5.70% Microsoft MSFT 5.29% Meta Platforms META 4.17% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM 3.71% Dell Technologies DELL 3.51% Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE 3.23% Palantir Technologies PLTR 3.05% Broadcom AVGO 3.04% Arista Networks ANET 3.02%\n\nKraneShares Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\n\nThe KraneShares Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF(NASDAQ: AGIX) is a fund that started in July 2024, so it has a very limited history. The fund largely tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, although it can also hold shares in private companies outside of the index as well.\n\nThe Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index includes stocks based on a proprietary AI Exposure Score that is meant to determine how well prepared a company is to benefit from AI. The index includes companies with market caps above $2 billion involved in hardware, infrastructure, and applications.\n\nWhile the ETF is newer, I really like its portfolio heading into 2025. It has exposure to cloud computing providers and the top chipmakers in Nvidia and Broadcom. It also has some solid AI software companies, which could be the next stage of AI winners. However, its 1% expense ratio is on the high side.\n\nIts top 10 holdings as of Dec. 27, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Microsoft MSFT 7.53% Meta Platforms META 7.50% Amazon AMZN 5.20% Nvidia NVDA 4.64% Apple AAPL 4.63% Salesforce CRM 3.93% ServiceNow NOW 3.70% Tesla TSLA 3.67% Alphabet GOOGL 3.58% Broadcom AVGO 3.28%\n\nGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\n\nThe oldest of the ETFs, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF(NASDAQ: AIQ), has been around since May 2018. It tracks the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index, which includes companies set to benefit from AI. It has an expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nThe ETF adds a bit of diversity from your typical AI ETF with more of a focus on software, which is about 40% of its portfolio. Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks, which tend to make a large percentage of most ETF funds, represent less than 15% of its holdings. Nvidia is only its 13th-largest holding at 3%. It also adds some international exposure, with companies outside the U.S. representing nearly 30% of its holdings.\n\nIf you're looking to build a portfolio of a few AI ETFs, the Global X Artificial Intelligence ETF is a nice option since it is still investing in AI-related stocks, but its make-up is different. Meanwhile, the ETF has been a solid performer over the years, with an average annual return of nearly 18% over the past five years as of the end of November.\n\nIts top-10 holdings as of Dec. 27, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Tesla TSLA 4.74% Broadcom AVGO 4.00% Netflix NFLX 3.84% ServiceNow NOW 3.83% Saleforce CRM 3.58% Cisco CSCO 3.48% Meta Platforms META 3.33% IBM IBM 3.28% Amazon AMZN 3.25% Oracle ORCL 3.20%\n\nAI ETFs\n\nWhile AI has helped power the market in 2024, the technology still appears to be in its early innings. AI infrastructure stocks have tended to be the big early winners, but there is an expectation that other areas of AI, such as software, could be the next group of stocks to benefit. As such, AI continues to look like a strong theme to invest in for 2025, and these ETFs are a nice way to get some diversified AI exposure.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "In this article INTC\n\nAVGO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nHock Tan, CEO of Broadcom (L) and former CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger. Reuters | CNBC\n\nIt was a big year for silicon in Silicon Valley \u2014 but a brutal one for the company most responsible for the area's moniker. Intel, the 56-year-old chipmaker co-founded by industry pioneers Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce and legendary investor Arthur Rock, had its worst year since going public in 1971, losing 61% of its value. The opposite story unfolded at Broadcom , the chip conglomerate run by CEO Hock Tan and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, about 15 miles from Intel's Santa Clara campus. Broadcom's stock price soared 111% in 2024 as of Monday's close, its best performance ever. The current company is the product of a 2015 acquisition by Avago, which went public in 2009. The driving force behind the diverging narratives was artificial intelligence. Broadcom rode the AI train, while Intel largely missed it. The changing fortunes of the two chipmakers underscores the fleeting nature of leadership in the tech industry and how a few key decisions can result in hundreds of billions \u2014 or even trillions \u2014 of dollars in market cap shifts. Broadcom develops custom chips for Google and other huge cloud companies. It also makes essential networking gear that large server clusters need to tie thousands of AI chips together. Within AI, Broadcom has largely been overshadowed by Nvidia , whose graphics processing units, or GPUs, power most of the large language models being developed at OpenAI, Microsoft , Google and Amazon and also enable the heftiest AI workloads. Despite having a lower profile, Broadcom's accelerator chips, which the company calls XPUs, have become a key piece of the AI ecosystem. \"Why it's really shooting up is because they're talking about AI, AI, AI, AI,\" Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at Cascend, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier this month.\n\nwatch now\n\nIntel, which for decades was the dominant U.S. chipmaker, has been mostly shut out of AI. Its server chips lag far behind Nvidia's, and the company has also lost market share to longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices while spending heavily on new factories. Intel's board ousted Pat Gelsinger from the CEO role on Dec. 1, after a tumultuous four-year tenure. \"I think someone more innovative might have seen the AI wave coming,\" Paul Argenti, professor of management at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" after the announcement. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment. Broadcom is now worth about $1.1 trillion and is the eighth U.S. tech company to cross the trillion-dollar mark. It's the second most valuable chip company, behind Nvidia, which has driven the AI boom to a $3.4 trillion valuation, trailing only Apple among all public companies. Nvidia's stock price soared 178% this year, but actually did better in 2023, when it gained 239%. Until four years ago, Intel was the world's most valuable chipmaker, nearing a $300 billion market cap in early 2020. The company is now worth about $85 billion, just got booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 replaced by Nvidia \u2014 and has been in talks to sell off core parts of its business. Intel now ranks 15th in market cap among semiconductor companies globally.\n\n'Not meant for everybody'\n\nFollowing the Avago-Broadcom merger in 2015, the combined company's biggest business was chips for TV set-top boxes and broadband routers. Broadcom still makes Wi-Fi chips used in laptops as well as the iPhone and other smartphones. After a failed bid to buy mobile chip giant Qualcomm in 2018, Broadcom turned its attention to software companies. The capstone of its spending spree came in 2022 with the announced acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware for $61 billion. Software accounted for 41% of Broadcom's $14 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to VMware. What's exciting Wall Street is Broadcom's role working with cloud providers to build custom chips for AI. The company's XPUs are generally simpler and less expensive to operate than Nvidia's GPUs, and they're designed to run specific AI programs efficiently.\n\nwatch now\n\nCloud vendors and other large internet companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia's GPUs so they can build their own models and run AI workloads for customers. Broadcom's success with custom chips is setting up an AI spending showdown with Nvidia, as hyperscale cloud companies look to differentiate their products and services from their rivals. Broadcom's chips aren't for everyone, as only a handful of companies can afford to design and build their own custom processors. \"You have to be a Google, you have to be a Meta , you have to be a Microsoft or an Oracle to be able to use those chips,\" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Dec. 13, a day after Broadcom's earnings. \"These chips are not meant for everybody.\" While 2024 has been a breakout year for Broadcom \u2014 AI revenue increased 220% \u2014 the month of December has put it in record territory. The stock is up 45% for the month as of Monday's close, 16 percentage points better than its prior best month. On the company's earnings call on Dec. 12, Tan told investors that Broadcom had doubled shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers. The most well known of the bunch is Google, which counts on the technology for its Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, used to train Apple's AI software released this year. The other two customers, according to analysts, are TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta. Tan said that within about two years, companies could spend between $60 billion and $90 billion on XPUs. \"In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric,\" Tan said of the three hyperscale customers. In addition to AI chips, AI server clusters need powerful networking parts to train the most advanced models. Networking chips for AI accounted for 76% of Broadcom's $4.5 billion of networking sales in the fourth quarter. Broadcom said that, in total, about 40% of its $30.1 billion in 2024 semiconductor sales were related to AI, and that AI revenue would increase 65% in the first quarter to $3.8 billion. \"The degree of success amongst the hyperscalers in their initiatives here is clearly an area up for debate,\" Cantor analyst C.J. Muse, who recommends buying Broadcom shares, wrote in a report on Dec. 18. \"But any way you slice it, the focus here will continue to be a meaningful boon for those levered to custom silicon.\"\n\nIntel's very bad year\n\nwatch now\n\nPrior to 2024, Intel's worst year on the market was 1974, when the stock sank 57%. The seeds for the company's latest stumbles were planted years ago, as Intel missed out on mobile chips to Qualcomm, ARM and Apple. Rival AMD started taking market share in the critical PC and server CPU markets thanks to its productive manufacturing relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . Intel's manufacturing process has been a notch behind for years, leading to slower and less power-efficient central processing units, or CPUs. But Intel's most costly whiff is in AI \u2014 and it's a big reason Gelsinger was removed. Nvidia's GPUs, originally created for video games, have become the critical hardware in the development of power-hungry AI models. Intel's CPU, formerly the most important and expensive part in a server, has become an afterthought in an AI server. The GPUs Nvidia will ship in 2025 don't even need an Intel CPU \u2014 many of them are paired to an Nvidia-designed ARM-based chip. As Nvidia has reported revenue growth of at least 94% for the past six quarters, Intel has been forced into downsizing mode. Sales have declined in nine of the past 11 periods. Intel announced in August that it was cutting 15,000 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce. \"We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,\" board Chair Frank Yeary said in a Dec. 2 press release announcing Gelsinger's departure. A big problem for Intel is that it lacks a comprehensive AI strategy. It's touted the AI capabilities on its laptop chips to investors, and released an Nvidia competitor called Gaudi 3. But neither the company's AI PC initiative nor its Gaudi chips have gained much traction in the market. Intel's Gaudi 3 sales missed the company's own $500 million target for this year. Late next year, Intel will release a new AI chip that it codenamed Falcon Shores. It won't be built on Gaudi 3 architecture, and will instead be a GPU. \"Is it going to be wonderful? No, but it is a good first step in getting the platform done,\" Intel interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus said at a financial conference held by Barclays on Dec. 12. Holthaus and fellow interim co-CEO David Zinsner have vowed to focus on Intel's products, leaving the fate of Intel's costly foundry division unclear. Before he left, Gelsinger championed a strategy that involved Intel both finding its footing in the semiconductor market and manufacturing chips to compete with TSMC. In June, at a conference in Taipei, Gelsinger told CNBC that when its factories get up and running, Intel wanted to build \"everybody's AI chips,\" and give companies such as Nvidia and Broadcom an alternative to TSMC. Intel said in September that it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital. But for now, Intel's primary client is Intel. The company said it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. At the Barclays event this month, Zinsner said the separate board for the foundry business is \"getting stood up today.\" More broadly, he indicated that the company is looking to remove complexity and associated costs wherever possible. \"We are going to constantly be scrutinizing where we're spending money, making sure that we're getting the appropriate return,\" Zinsner said.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted.\n\nAs 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven\u2019t been so lucky.\n\nAs an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world\u2019s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period.\n\nSo why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company.\n\nHowever, while the GPU maker hasn\u2019t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm\u2019s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn\u2019t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion.\n\nBut an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock\u2019s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren\u2019t impressed and they weren\u2019t optimistic about the firm\u2019s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO\u2019s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention.",

According to recent SEC filings, Broadcom executives recently made several large transactions. On December 24, Mark David Brazeal, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, offloaded 20,168 shares at an average cost of $238.79, minting $4.82 million. After the transaction, Brazeal held 321,660 shares, a 5.9 percent drop from his stake.\n\nOn the same day, Broadcom CEO Hock E Tan also sold 45,000 shares at $239.96 a piece for a total of $10.8 million. Tan's holdings fell by 5.07 % with this sale, and they now own 842,836 shares, valued at $202.25M. She later sold 15,000 shares at $226.68 apiece at prices that day on December 23, worth $3.4 million. Overall, the 6,460 shares remain an ownership stake for Vavra that has declined 69.9%.\n\nWhile insider selling is not uncommon, it always brings questions about the company's future purposes. While Broadcom has done well lately, with its earnings and dividends looking strong, these transactions could signal a case of too soon by top executives. As Broadcom enters into the new year, investors will be waiting to see what further disclosures or market reactions might emerge.",

            "content": "Savvy investors like stock splits for two reasons: They make stocks more accessible by reducing the share price, and they can be roundabout indicators of high-quality companies. That's because forward stock splits are only necessary after significant share price appreciation, which rarely happens to sub-par companies.\n\nNot surprisingly, a few hedge fund billionaires in the third quarter bought shares of Broadcom (AVGO -2.05%) and Arista Networks (ANET -0.90%). Both companies recently split their stocks.\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management bought 1.6 million shares of Broadcom, increasing his stake 912%. Broadcom now ranks among his top 20 holdings.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office bought 239,980 shares of Broadcom, starting a new position. Broadcom ranks among his top 15 holdings.\n\nSteven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management bought 211,823 shares of Arista, increasing his stake 32%. Arista now ranks among his top 3 holdings excluding options contracts.\n\nOther billionaire fund managers also purchased shares of Broadcom and Arista in Q3, but the relative sizing of their positions is much smaller. For instance, Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors bought both stocks, as did Israel Englander of Millennium Management.\n\nImportantly, investors should never buy a stock without understanding the business. Read on to learn more about Broadcom and Arista.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom specializes in semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its semiconductors are used in Ethernet switches and routers (networking equipment), data center storage systems, and mobile devices. Meanwhile, its software addresses cybersecurity, mainframe observability, and data center virtualization.\n\nBroadcom has a particularly strong presence in certain semiconductor markets. Its chips are the industry standard in networking equipment. The company has 80% market share, and spending on Ethernet chips is projected to increase at 20% to 30% annually in the next few years, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBroadcom is also the leader in high-end, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence (AI). Broadcom has 60% market share, and spending on AI accelerators (both custom and graphics processing units (GPUs) is expected to grow at 29% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nBroadcom reported reasonably good financial results in fiscal Q4 of 2024, which ended in November. Revenue increased 51% to $14 billion and non-GAAP earnings increased 28% to $1.42 per diluted share. But organic revenue increased just 11%, as the acquisition of virtualization specialist VMware added 40 percentage points to top-line growth.\n\nHowever, insight from CEO Hock Tan on the earnings call sent the stock soaring. Broadcom currently designs custom AI accelerators for three hyperscale companies, reportedly Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Tan told analysts that revenue from those companies will increase at least fivefold in the next three years.\n\nHe also said Broadcom is working with two new hyperscalers, reportedly Apple and OpenAI, that will likely be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means revenue from custom AI chips could increase much more than fivefold during the next three years, which itself implies substantial market-share gains for Broadcom.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Broadcom's adjusted earnings to increase at 22% annually through fiscal 2027. That makes the current valuation of 49 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. Patient investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\n2. Arista Networks\n\nArista specializes in high-speed networking. The company sells Ethernet switching and routing platforms that move information through enterprise and cloud data centers, and it augments its hardware with adjacent software for network monitoring, automation, and security. Morgan Stanley sees Arista as the company best positioned to benefit from demand for AI networking.\n\nArista has disrupted the market in two ways. Its core innovation is the Extensible Operating System (EOS), software that runs across its entire hardware portfolio. That single-system approach distinguishes Arista from legacy vendors like Cisco Systems that use multiple operating systems, which makes networking monitoring more complicated.\n\nAdditionally, Arista relies exclusively on third-party semiconductors. By sourcing chips from companies like Broadcom, Arista can design networking equipment with the latest technologies without investing heavily in semiconductor design. That strategy lets the company focus on its core competency, software development, and it affords customers flexibility in selecting which chips are used in their networking gear.\n\nArista reported solid results in Q3. Revenue increased 20% to $1.8 billion, and non-GAAP earnings increased 31% to $0.60 per diluted share. Management also raised full-year guidance such that revenue is now expected to increase 22% in Q4. Beyond that, the company anticipates 16% revenue growth in 2025.\n\nImportantly, Arista is the market leader in high-speed Ethernet switching platforms, which include 100-gigabit switches and faster. Demand for high-speed networking hardware should trend higher as companies invest in AI infrastructure, and Arista is ideally positioned to benefit from that trend.\n\nWall Street expects the company's adjusted earnings to grow at 16% annually through 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 52 times earnings look expensive, but investors should still consider buying a small position today. Arista's earnings have grown more quickly than consensus estimates in 12 consecutive quarters.",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nFamously known as the \u201cgodfather of artificial intelligence\u201d, British-Canadian computer scientist Professor Geoffrey Hinton has recently warned that the pace of technological change today is much faster than was initially anticipated. As a result, there is a 10% to 20% chance that artificial intelligence will wipe out humanity within the next three decades. Previously, he had said there was only a 10% chance of technology doing so.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm\n\nDespite such warnings, companies are racing to lead the AI arms race. OpenAI, for instance, which is also known as the company that started the race itself, has recently outlined plans to revamp its structure. The company said that it would create a public benefit corporation so that it would make it easier to raise more capital.\n\nReuters reported the news back in September, which had sparked debate among corporate watchdogs and tech moguls regarding whether the company would be able to allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and whether the company would be able to strike a balance between making a profit and breeding public good as it develops AI.\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness. The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission\u201d.\n\nThe company plans to turn its for-profit branch into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC), aligning its structure with rivals such as Anthropic and Musk\u2019s xAI, which use a similar structure and have recently raised billions in funding.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business. This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Treasury yields fell, which is good for the market after they surpassed 4.6% in recent days, the highest level seen since midyear. Trading volume is light today, which is normal in the final week of the year because more investors are taking time off or on vacation, so I wouldn't read too much into the action last week or this week.\n\nInvestors have been bearish since the Federal Reserve concluded its final meeting of the year on Dec. 18, delivering a more hawkish message to the market that said the agency would proceed with interest rate cuts cautiously. Inflation is still above the Fed's 2% preferred target and the labor market still looks strong on many accounts. Furthermore, some fear President-elect Donald Trump's potential policy proposals involving tax cuts and tariffs could reignite inflation in 2025.\n\nTom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, told CNBC this morning that he is not so worried about today and sees further tailwinds ahead in 2025 including a pro-business Trump administration and signs of cooling inflation. He thinks 7,000 is in the cards for the S&P 500 in the first half of next year.\n\n\"It is not a liquid environment because we're in the final two days of the year,\" he said. \"Strangely, if the last week of December is weak, I actually think it bodes well for a rebound in the first week of January.\"\n\nNot everyone is as bullish, however. Jeremy Siegel, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School also went on CNBC this morning and said he is more cautious about the market. He thinks the probability of a 10% market correction in 2025 has risen.\n\n\"I think we have challenges next year because of all the optimism that has been built in this year,\" Siegel said, acknowledging that the AI narrative is still strong. \"We still have a bifurcated market in the sense that the Mag 7 being ... 30-35 times earnings and the rest of the market being 18-20, which is much more reasonable. I think 2025 could be that switch around.\"\n\nDon't read too much into this week\n\nI want to emphasize that investors shouldn't read too much into the market's big moves in recent days. There's light trading volume right now and investors could be selling at the end of the year for many different reasons. I agree with Siegel that the likelihood of a correction next year is elevated. However, I also agree with Lee that there haven't yet been enough indicators to suggest a major sell-off is warranted right now. Ultimately, I expect turbulence next year but could see the market eking out more gains when all is said and done.\n\nHighly valued tech and AI stocks like Broadcom and SoundHound AI concern me the most because the margin for error is much slimmer. Micron trades at a reasonable valuation, so I see a better risk-reward proposition in this name.",

            "content": "Stephen Yiu, fund manager at Blue Whale Growth Fund, has made a bold prediction for Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), suggesting it could outshine Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) in delivering returns by 2025. This optimism stems from Broadcom\u2019s strategic positioning in the AI chip market, particularly through its partnerships with tech behemoths like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta Platforms Inc. (META). These companies, while heavily reliant on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs for AI applications, are now diversifying by developing custom chips, a niche where Broadcom excels.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s appeal lies in its ability to offer cost-effective solutions in the high-stakes AI chip market. Yiu points out that dependency on a single supplier like Nvidia, whose GPUs are notably expensive, poses risks for tech giants looking to manage costs and supply chain vulnerabilities. Broadcom\u2019s focus on custom silicon for AI not only provides an alternative but also positions it as a key player in this sector. This strategic direction is reflected in its impressive financial performance, with a year-to-date return of 110.12% as of recent $234.92 print, culminating in a market cap exceeding $1 trillion, $1.13 trillion as of last check, driven by a 220% increase or tripling of AI revenue to $12.2 billion in 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s collaborations extend beyond the usual suspects, involving major cloud computing entities like Meta, Alphabet (GOOGL), and ByteDance, where it\u2019s actively developing custom AI chips. This diversification of partnerships is crucial, as it not only reduces the risk of over-reliance on one technology provider but also opens up multiple revenue streams. Furthermore, even competitors in the AI space like OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) are turning to Broadcom for their server chip needs, highlighting the company\u2019s growing influence and reliability in the tech ecosystem.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s CEO, Hock Tan, has been vocal about his confidence in the AI sector\u2019s growth, supporting the company\u2019s direction towards custom solutions. This approach is in line with industry trends where major tech firms are looking to optimize AI performance while controlling costs. The demand for specialized chips is surging as market dynamics increasingly favor chipmakers like Broadcom, with supply struggling to keep pace with demand. Notably, the global AI chips market was valued at $5.26 billion in 2023 and is projected to soar to $51.5 billion by 2030, growing at an impressive CAGR of 38.5% over the forecast period.\n\nIn contrast, while Nvidia continues to be a titan in the AI hardware space with its powerful GPUs, its scale might pose challenges for exponential growth at the same pace. Yiu has adjusted his fund\u2019s exposure, significantly reducing Nvidia\u2019s share while increasing stakes in Broadcom, betting on the latter\u2019s potential for substantial growth due to its relatively smaller size yet pivotal role in the AI ecosystem. For a company like Nvidia, adding another $1.5 trillion to its valuation to match a 50% growth is a monumental task, whereas for Broadcom, reaching from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion seems more feasible.\n\nThis scenario paints a picture of a shifting landscape in the AI chip market, where Broadcom is emerging not just as an alternative but potentially as a leader in custom AI solutions. As tech companies continue to seek balance between performance, cost, and supply security, Broadcom\u2019s strategic partnerships and focus on custom silicon could indeed set the stage for significant outperformance in the coming years, making it a compelling investment for those looking to capitalize on the AI boom.",

            "content": "Major market indexes experienced declines today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping significantly before recovering some losses. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also dipped but traded less than 1% down by midday. In particular, within the tech sector, Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) saw its stock price fall by 1.71% to $237.62. This decline was influenced by a low trading volume environment typical of the year's final week, compounded by bearish investor sentiment due to caution from the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate cuts amid persistent inflation concerns.\n\nBroadcom Inc (AVGO, Financial) is a key player in the semiconductor industry, recognized as the sixth-largest globally. It boasts a diverse product portfolio serving various markets, including wireless, networking, and industrial sectors. Despite its robust market presence, AVGO's stock is currently facing valuation challenges. The GF Score indicates that Broadcom is significantly overvalued, with a GF Value of $111.7, suggesting potential downside risk when compared to its current market price. For more details, view Broadcom's GF Value.\n\nOn the financial front, Broadcom's PE ratio stands at a high 193.82, reflecting a premium valuation. Additionally, its Price-to-Sales ratio is close to a 10-year high of 22.4, signaling a potentially overstretched valuation metric. Despite these challenges, Broadcom's Altman Z-Score is strong at 7.55, indicating low bankruptcy risk. The company also maintains a strong Altman Z-score, pointing toward solid financial strength.\n\nBroadcom's operating margin is expanding, which is typically a positive indicator of improving profitability. Additionally, Broadcom's Altman Z-score of 7.55 reflects strong financial health, while its operating margin expansion suggests a trend of improving profitability. Financial growth, however, is somewhat stymied by insider selling activities, with 11 insider transactions over the past three months without any insider purchasing, which might indicate a lack of confidence among insiders in the company's near-term stock performance.\n\nDespite recent price declines, Broadcom continues to demonstrate strong revenue and earnings growth, with a five-year dividend growth rate at 14.1%. Investors may find value in the company's predictable revenue streams and expanding margins, though current valuations suggest exercising caution.",
