            "content": "For the first time, scientists have documented a hummingbird chick that may mimic a poisonous caterpillar to dissuade hungry predators. In 2024, researchers stumbled upon a one-day-old white-necked Jacobin chick (Florisuga mellivora) in Soberan\u00eda National Park outside Panama City, Panama. The baby bird was covered in long brown feathers, which at this point appeared like the hair of several poisonous caterpillar species in the region that can be dangerous or even lethal to predators. When approached, the chick wagged its head back and forth in the same way that many caterpillars do when threatened. As most hummingbirds hatch naked, researchers were surprised to see the chick covered in feathers. They were also surprised to see the shaking behavior, which researchers hadn\u2019t previously reported in any other hummingbird species. \u201cWe know so little about what nesting birds do in the tropics,\u201d said Jay Falk, the paper\u2019s first author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and University of Colorado Boulder, in a press release. \u201cBut if we put more effort into observing the natural world, we might discover these kinds of behaviors are very common.\u201d\n\nRead more at CU Boulder Today.",

            "content": "Have a boxwood in your yard? You need to check for a moth infestation\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Here are the worst 10 invasive species in the Great Lakes In a new study, scientists created a top 10 list of the worst 188 aquatic non-native invasive species in the Great Lakes. The team of scientists ranked the invaders based on their environmenal and socioeconomic impacts.\n\nThe box tree moth, an invasive species from East Asia, poses a significant threat to boxwood shrubs in Michigan.\n\nThe moth caterpillars can defoliate a boxwood within a single season and eventually kill the shrub.\n\nInfestations are identified by yellowing leaves, small green caterpillars with black stripes, and webbing within the shrub.\n\nLIVINGSTON COUNTY \u2014 Residents with boxwoods should be aware of an invasive species that's threatening the shrub this season.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the box tree moth originated in East Asia, and it's become a big problem.\n\nLocal Arbiter Jeremy Hertz, owner of Family Tree Doctor, said the bug can defoliate a plant within one season if left unchecked. He found infestations in Brighton and Farmington Hills last season.\n\n\u201cIt's been moving, I just was surprised to find it in Livingston County so quickly,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cSome things move faster than others, and this seems to be a fast mover.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Michigan State University Extension Office, box tree moths were first found in North America in 2018 in Toronto, Canada. In 2021, infested shrubs may have been sent to nurseries in Michigan, despite being checked for infestation.\n\nAs of June 2024, a quarantine applied to 12 counties: Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, Livingston, Oakland, Jackson, Washtenaw, Wayne, Lenawee, Monroe, Macomb and St. Clair.\n\nHertz said the moth caterpillars spin silk to survive the winter. Once it starts to warm up, they start feeding.\n\nMore: Not much of a green thumb? With spring coming, The Dertian Ranch in Howell is a must-visit\n\n\u201cBoxwoods typically look like they've been winter damaged,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cI think people come out of the winter and they look at their plants and they go, \u2018Oh, it was a bad winter,\u2019 when, in fact, the plant is being possibly defoliated.\u201d\n\nOnce the foliage has been consumed, the box tree moth moves on to the bark, which eventually kills the shrub.\n\nHow to spot an infestation\n\nAccording to the MSU Extension Office, the first sign of a box tree moth infestation is yellowing. If the plant appears damaged, it should be checked for caterpillars \u201cwhich are lime green with black stripes and have white spots and hairs. Their distinctive shiny black heads are a significant identifying characteristic.\u201d\n\nThe office advises checking deep into the shrub and looking closely at tightly clustered branches where caterpillars may have formed a nest with webbing.\n\nHertz said the caterpillars will eat foliage and leave the midrib of the leaf, which will then curl up.\n\nAnother sign is small, lime green frass \u2014 also known as insect poop \u2014 on the plant, on the ground, and caught in the webbing.\n\nThe adult moths are active June-October. In North America, they're most commonly white and brown with white spots on their forewing that resemble a comma. Sometimes they appear with dark brown coloring and the same white spot on their forewing.\n\nMy boxwood is infested. Now what?\n\nThe box tree moth only feeds on boxwoods, so there's no risk to other plants in the area. That said, boxwoods are an ornamental shrub that can be expensive to plant, so it's important to check them for infestation or risk losing them.\n\nHertz said plant-owners can try to eradicate the larvae, either by hand-picking them or using a strong stream of water to knock them off.\n\n\u201cBut more likely, the more effective treatment would be to spray it with an insecticide that controls moths,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nSupport local news: Subscribe to get unlimited access to our local coverage\n\nThe extension office recommends spraying pesticide in late July or early September. It suggests an application of bifenthrin or \u201cany pyrethroid insecticide for homeowner use that can be used to control all life stages.\u201d\n\nHertz advises carefully following label instructions on any pesticide. When in doubt, call a professional.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of professionals are going to be inundated with box tree moths. I know I'm going to be spending a lot of time managing it this year,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cBut I think most people, if they're do-it-yourselfers and they want to hear from the expert directly, I'd be willing to talk people through it.\"\n\nLearn more on the official website for the MSU Extension Office.\n\n\u2014 Contact reporter Tess Ware at tware@livingstondaily.com.",

            "content": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 20, 2025) \u2014 The Eastern tent caterpillar (ETC) gained notoriety during the early 2000s when its accidental ingestion by pregnant mares was linked to Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS). From 1999 to 2001, MRLS caused an estimated 3,500 foal losses, including abortions, stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Central Kentucky alone lost around 30% of its 2001-02 Thoroughbred foal crop, resulting in an estimated state economic impact of $336 million across all horse breeds \u2014 making tracking and managing the pests significant for horse owners, even to this day.\n\nDue to a colder winter and slower accumulation of growing-degree days (GDD) this year, experts at the University of Kentucky Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment (CAFE) anticipate a delayed hatch for ETCs.\n\n\u201cETCs begin to hatch after enough warm days accumulate,\u201d said Jonathan Larson, assistant extension entomology professor in the Department of Entomology. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slower approach to that number this winter, which gives horse owners more time to monitor and prepare.\u201d\n\nThese native insects typically begin hatching at 90-100 GDD. As of March 17, representative counties such as McCracken (99 GDD), Barren (116 GDD), Fayette (82 GDD) are approaching or ticking over that threshold, while others, such as Harlan (28 GDD) remain well below that threshold. Horse owners and farm managers should begin vigilance for small caterpillars, as ETC infestations pose a serious risk to pregnant mares. Locally, managers can look for forsythia shrubs that have started to bloom as an indicator of ETC hatch.\n\nIdentifying and managing eastern tent caterpillars\n\nEastern tent caterpillars are commonly observed on wild cherry, apple and crabapple trees, although they may also infest hawthorn, maple, peach, pear and plum. True to their name, these caterpillars construct compact silk \u201ctents\u201d in the forks of branches. The tightly woven nests serve as shelters, helping to protect the growing larvae from predators and harsh environmental conditions.\n\nOver the winter, ETCs remain dormant as egg masses wrapped around pencil-thin twigs, waiting for the warmer days of early spring to hatch. Once they emerge, the larvae feed primarily at dawn, dusk or overnight and can grow to a length of 2 to 2.5 inches. As resources become scarce \u2014 or when it is time to pupate \u2014 these caterpillars often leave their host trees, wandering along fence lines and into pastures in search of new food sources or protected pupation sites.\n\nIn pregnant mares, ETC hair cuticles can lodge in the lining of the digestive tract, creating an entry point for bacteria. The resulting infection may harm both the fetus and placenta, posing a significant threat to equine health and foal development.\n\n\u201cIf farm managers notice high numbers of nests, they should relocate pregnant mares from areas near wild cherry trees to reduce the risk of exposure,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThe greatest danger occurs when mature caterpillars leave the trees to pupate and transform into moths.\u201d\n\nPreventive strategies for horse owners and farm managers\n\nHorse owners and farm managers can employ several preventive strategies to mitigate risks. First, monitoring wild cherry and other host trees is important, as it requires carefully inspecting them for egg masses and developing tents. Early detection allows for timely intervention before the caterpillars spread.\n\nWhen infestations are discovered, removing affected branches may be necessary. Smaller tents can be wound onto a stick, while larger ones should be pruned. Burning tents with an open flame is not advisable, as this can easily damage the tree.\n\nWith insecticide use, early intervention with the organic pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can help target young caterpillars. For taller trees or extensive infestations, professional arborists may recommend trunk injections with labeled products such as Tree-\u00e4ge (emamectin benzoate), Inject-A-Cide B (Bidrin), Abacide 2 (abamectin) or Lepitect (acephate).\n\nFinally, it is essential to stay informed by tracking the local growing-degree days and consulting extension resources. By doing so, horse owners and farm managers can anticipate when hatching and peak caterpillar activity will likely occur, thereby reducing potential risks.\n\n\u201cETC activity can vary annually due to climatic conditions, predators and disease,\u201d Larson said. \u201cHowever, understanding their life cycle and habitat preferences allows us to address potential risks preemptively. Awareness is our best defense. By tracking the hatching and development of these caterpillars, we can implement targeted interventions to protect our trees and, crucially, our horses.\u201d\n\nFor more detailed guidance on identifying and removing egg masses, download the UK entomology publication \u201cChecking Eastern Tent Caterpillar Egg Masses\u201d at https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef449.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against other best industrial dividend stocks to invest in now.\n\nIndustrial stocks play a crucial role in economic growth, encompassing a wide range of businesses, from manufacturing to transportation. This sector often performs well during periods of economic expansion and stands to gain from higher government investment in infrastructure projects. Although the sector is diverse, companies within it exhibit common characteristics and are positioned to benefit from several overarching trends. These factors contribute to the view that industrials play a significant role in the equity portion of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nIn recent years, the industrial economy has generally experienced improving demand trends, though certain areas, such as manufacturing automation, have shown signs of weakening. A report by Edward Jones suggested that while the recovery is expected to continue, several near-term uncertainties could impact the sector\u2019s growth. These include a potential slowdown in economic expansion, ongoing geopolitical challenges, and declining business and consumer confidence.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Undervalued Bitcoin Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nAdditionally, the growing risk of a global trade war between the United States and key trading partners has introduced further uncertainty for the industrial sector. While the administration has announced tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, the full impact of these measures remains unclear. Further tariff actions are anticipated, with a likely focus on China and the European Union. In response, these regions are expected to retaliate through tariffs or other policy measures.\n\nIn 2024, the industrial sector delivered solid returns overall, though it slightly trailed the broader market in what was a strong year for stocks. A report by Fidelity Investments noted that industrials started the year on a strong footing, generally keeping pace with the broader market through April. However, the sector underperformed in May and June before rebounding in July, emerging as one of the market\u2019s stronger segments. It largely maintained those relative gains through mid-December. This uneven performance reflected a balance between optimism surrounding a potential soft landing for the US economy and a surge in major construction projects, contrasted with concerns over weak manufacturing indicators and historically high stock valuations.\n\nThe Fidelity report also highlighted several key themes that could present investment opportunities in the coming year. One of the primary themes is the resurgence of manufacturing within the United States. Various factors are driving an unprecedented wave of reinvestment in domestic infrastructure, efforts to onshore supply chains to mitigate geopolitical risks, and increased investments in electrification and artificial intelligence development.\n\nThe cyclical nature of industrial stocks has contributed to strong performance over time. Over the past three years, the market\u2019s Industrial Index has slightly outpaced the broader market, driven by solid growth across several key industries, including Aerospace & Defense, Building Products, Machinery, and Electrical Equipment. This year, as stocks have been in negative territory for a while now, the industrial sector has recorded a 0.74% decline, while the broader market has fallen by nearly 3%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the fourth quarter of 2024 and selected industrial companies across various segments within the industry, including manufacturing, construction, aerospace and defense, machinery and equipment, transportation and logistics, as well as utilities. From this pool of companies, we identified 12 dividend companies and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them at the end of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) ranks fifth on our list of the best industrial stocks that pay dividends. The American manufacturing company specializes in construction, mining, and other engineering equipment. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported $16.2 billion in revenue, marking a 5% decline from the previous year. The drop was largely attributed to an $859 million decrease in sales volume, driven by shifts in dealer inventories and weaker equipment sales to end users. Dealer inventory levels fell by $1.3 billion during the quarter, a steeper reduction compared to the $900 million decline recorded in the same period of 2023. Despite the revenue decline, profit per share rose to $5.78, up from $5.28 a year earlier.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) remained financially strong throughout 2024, generating $12.0 billion in operating cash flow and ending the fourth quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. Over the year, the company returned capital to shareholders through $7.7 billion in share repurchases and $2.6 billion in dividend payments. Its robust cash flow has supported 30 consecutive years of dividend increases. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.41 per share for a dividend yield of 1.65%, as of March 17.\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) grew to 62 in Q4 2024, from 50 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $6.8 billion. With over 9 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q4.\n\nOverall, CAT ranks 5th on our list of best industrial dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The Eastern Tent Caterpillar (ETCs) gained notoriety during the early 2000s when its accidental ingestion by pregnant mares was linked to Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS). From 1999 to 2001, MRLS caused an estimated 3,500 foal losses, including abortions, stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Central Kentucky alone lost around 30 percent of its 2001-02 Thoroughbred foal crop, resulting in an estimated state economic impact of $336 million across all horse breeds \u2014 making tracking and managing the pests significant for horse owners, even to this day.\n\n\n\nDue to a colder winter and slower accumulation of growing-degree days (GDD) this year, experts at the University of Kentucky Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment anticipate a delayed hatch for ETCs.\n\n\u201cETCs begin to hatch after enough warm days accumulate,\u201d said Jonathan Larson, assistant extension entomology professor in the Department of Entomology. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slower approach to that number this winter, which gives horse owners more time to monitor and prepare.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese native insects typically begin hatching when 90-100 GDD have accumulated. As of March 17, representative counties such as McCracken (99 GDD), Barren (116 GDD), Fayette (82 GDD) are approaching or ticking over that threshold, while others, such as Harlan (28 GDD) remain well below that threshold. Horse owners and farm managers should begin vigilance for small caterpillars, as ETC infestations pose a serious risk to pregnant mares. Locally, managers can look for forsythia shrubs that have started to bloom as an indicator of ETC hatch.\n\nIdentifying and managing Eastern Tent Caterpillars\n\n\n\nEastern tent caterpillars are commonly observed on wild cherry, apple and crabapple trees, although they may also infest hawthorn, maple, peach, pear and plum. True to their name, these caterpillars construct compact silk \u201ctents\u201d in the forks of branches. The tightly woven nests serve as shelters, helping to protect the growing larvae from predators and harsh environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nOver the winter, ETCs remain dormant as egg masses wrapped around pencil-thin twigs, waiting for the warmer days of early spring to hatch. Once they emerge, the larvae feed primarily at dawn, dusk, or overnight and can grow to a length of 2 to 2.5 inches. As resources become scarce \u2014 or when it is time to pupate \u2014 these caterpillars often leave their host trees, wandering along fence lines and into pastures in search of new food sources or protected pupation sites.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn pregnant mares, ETC hair cuticles can lodge in the lining of the digestive tract, creating an entry point for bacteria. The resulting infection may harm both the fetus and placenta, posing a significant threat to equine health and foal development.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf farm managers notice high numbers of nests, they should relocate pregnant mares from areas near wild cherry trees to reduce the risk of exposure,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThe greatest danger occurs when mature caterpillars leave the trees to pupate and transform into moths.\u201d\n\nPreventive strategies for horse owners and farm managers\n\n\n\nHorse owners and farm managers can employ several preventive strategies to mitigate risks. First, monitoring wild cherry and other host trees is important, as it requires carefully inspecting them for egg masses and developing tents. Early detection allows for timely intervention before the caterpillars spread.\n\n\n\nWhen infestations are discovered, removing affected branches may be necessary. Smaller tents can be wound onto a stick, while larger ones should be pruned. Burning tents with an open flame is not advisable, as this can easily damage the tree.\n\nWith insecticide use, early intervention with the organic pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can help target young caterpillars. For taller trees or extensive infestations, professional arborists may recommend trunk injections with labeled products such as Tree-\u00e4ge (emamectin benzoate), Inject-A-Cide B (Bidrin), Abacide 2 (abamectin) or Lepitect (acephate).\n\n\n\nFinally, it is essential to stay informed by tracking the local growing-degree days and consulting extension resources. By doing so, horse owners and farm managers can anticipate when hatching and peak caterpillar activity will likely occur, thereby reducing potential risks.\n\n\u201cETC activity can vary annually due to climatic conditions, predators and disease,\u201d Larson said. \u201cHowever, understanding their life cycle and habitat preferences allows us to address potential risks preemptively. Awareness is our best defense. By tracking the hatching and development of these caterpillars, we can implement targeted interventions to protect our trees and, crucially, our horses.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor more detailed guidance on identifying and removing egg masses, download the UK entomology publication \u201cChecking Eastern Tent Caterpillar Egg Masses\u201d at https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef449.",

ChatGPT and its relatives rely on large amounts of data, and therefore large amounts of electricity. Perhaps the Chinese system, DeepSeek, can save energy. However, the number of people using DeepSeek is increasing dramatically, which in turn increases the demand for electricity. More renewable energies and more nuclear power are needed to produce the necessary electricity. The big advantage of nuclear power is that electricity can be produced safely around the clock. One of the biggest supporters of nuclear power is France. More than 60 percent of electricity there is produced in nuclear power plants. At the recent AI summit in Paris, Macron responded to Donald Trump's slogan \"drill, baby, drill\" with \"it's just plug, baby, plug\". Greenhouse emissions in Germany fell by almost 25 percent in 2023 compared to 2017. However, the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2045 will not be achievable. The energy transition is making progress, climate targets are getting closer and nuclear power is part of the energy mix. But there is still a lot to do in terms of electricity prices, a secure power supply and grid expansion.

(PHOTO: Caterpillar)\n\nThe Cat 330 UHD is a 46-tonne machine with a 205 kW (275 hp) Cat C7.1 engine that meets the US Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V and Japan 2014 emission standards.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, the excavator\u2019s next generation design allows it to better meet the demands of urban and city demolition and dismantling projects.\n\nVincent Migeotte, Caterpillar senior product and sales consultant, said: We\u2019re excited about the prospects for the Cat 330 UHD as a replacement of the 325C UHD. It has been more than 10 years since Caterpillar offered a model in this important segment.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFor operators working in tough demolition applications, where mobilisation, safety and productivity are vital, the 330 UHD will be a reliable and efficient next generation machine, compliant with all workplace safety standards, and offering an attractive return on investment.\u201d\n\nThe machine features an ultra-high demolition boom with a maximum pin height of 20 m (65 ft 6 in) and a TOPS demolition-rated tilting cab, enabling it to easily work at five- and six-storey heights.\n\nIt is available with either a Long Narrow or a Hydraulic Variable Gauge undercarriage for added stability and can accommodate a 3-tonne work tool.\n\nIn addition, Caterpillar says the model is \u201cessentially two machines in one\u201d, as it can also accept either a single or variable angle retrofit boom. It incorporates a hydraulic quick disconnect system for tool-free swapping of attachments and booms.\n\nTechnologies such as Cat Payload, Cat 2D E-Fence and Cat Grade are also included \u201cto optimise its utilisation with the retrofit boom\u201d.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar built the 330 UHD to withstand difficult demolition of tall structures. Careful attention to detail has seen the 330 UHD designed to reach even the trickiest inner-city worksites,\u201d said Vincent.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe machine is quickly and easily reconfigurable, allowing operators to extract maximum return from the machine by deploying it for general construction when not required for demolition contracts.\u201d",

            "content": "Jay Falk and Scott Taylor first spotted the white-necked Jacobin hummingbird chick deep in Panama\u2019s rainforest. The tiny bird, smaller than a pinky finger, was covered in brown fuzz.\n\nWhen they approached, the chick twitched and shook its head, displaying behavior they had never seen in birds before. This movement resembled a poisonous caterpillar found in the same region.\n\nTaylor, an associate professor at CU Boulder, and his team described this mimicry in a paper published in the journal Ecology.\n\n\u201cWe know so little about what nesting birds do in the tropics,\u201d said Falk, the paper\u2019s first author and a postdoctoral fellow in Taylor\u2019s lab. \u201cBut this could be a very common thing if we had dedicated more efforts to observe and discover new things about the natural world.\u201d\n\nHidden survival strategies\n\nWhite-necked Jacobin hummingbirds are common in Central and South America. Males have shimmering blue and green feathers, while females have muted green plumage.\n\nThe tropical rainforest poses many dangers for small birds, with predators such as snakes, monkeys, birds, and insects. Studies suggest bird chicks in the tropics face higher predation risks than those in temperate forests.\n\nDuring a trip to Soberan\u00eda National Park in 2024, Falk might have uncovered how these tiny hummingbird chicks survive. Despite regularly observing adult Jacobins at his feeders, he had never seen their chicks or nests.\n\nThat changed when co-authors Michael Casta\u00f1o and Sebastian Gallan-Giraldo found a female Jacobin incubating an egg near a forest trail. The nest, no bigger than Falk\u2019s palm, blended seamlessly with its surroundings.\n\nHummingbird chick moves like a caterpillar\n\nThe researchers observed the nest for a month and saw the chick hatch.\n\nUnlike most hummingbirds, which are born naked, this chick had long brown feathers that made it resemble the nest material. Then, they noticed its strange jerking behavior. Scientists had never recorded such behavior in any hummingbird species.\n\n\u201cI started texting a video to people and asking them, \u2018What does this look like?\u2019\u201d said Taylor. \u201cAnd invariably, they said, \u2018That looks like a caterpillar.\u2019 It was very exciting.\u201d\n\nOn the chick\u2019s second day, a predatory wasp hovered over the nest while the mother was away. The chick twitched its body and swung its head from side to side, mimicking a caterpillar. A few seconds later, the wasp flew away.\n\nLessons from other species\n\nFalk and Taylor couldn\u2019t help but think of another study. That one was about a bird, the cinereous mourner chick, living in the Amazon. It didn\u2019t just look different \u2013 it had an unusual trick.\n\nCovered in bright orange feathers, it closely resembled a toxic caterpillar. When disturbed, it shook its head just like the real thing.\n\nCurious, the researchers turned their attention to Panama\u2019s caterpillars. What they found was striking. Many were covered in brown hairs that weren\u2019t just for show. Those tiny spikes could cause excruciating pain, even death, to predators.\n\nAnd just like the hummingbird chick, some of these caterpillars had a habit of shaking their heads when they sensed danger. Was the tiny bird copying them? It certainly seemed possible.\n\nHummingbird mimics a caterpillar\n\nThis mimicry strategy, where a harmless species imitates a dangerous one, is called Batesian mimicry. It is common in butterflies and snakes. For instance, non-venomous milk snakes resemble venomous coral snakes to deter predators.\n\n\u201cA lot of these really classic examples of Batesian mimicry involve butterflies mimicking other butterflies, or snakes mimicking other snakes. But here, we have a bird potentially mimicking an insect, a vertebrate mimicking an invertebrate,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThough the study was based on a single observation, the team hopes to test their theory by placing artificial chicks with different appearances and behaviors in nests to see which ones avoid predation. They also encourage birdwatchers and citizen scientists to document more hummingbird nests.\n\n\u201cOur perception of the natural world is very biased by our own thoughts about what could be possible,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what we can discover, but we really have to think broadly.\u201d\n\nThe study is published in the journal Ecology.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

During the summer, adult moths lay eggs on pine needles.\n\nThe larvae emerge between September and October and spend the winter in silk nests in tree branches. As temperatures rise, they begin to descend in single file to the ground, where they bury themselves and pass into the chrysalis stage, giving rise to future moths.\n\nAlthough caterpillars can defoliate pine trees, they rarely kill them because they do not consume new growth, allowing the trees to regenerate in the spring.\n\nRisks to humans and animals\n\nThe main dangers of the pine caterpillar come from its hairs, which are released as a defense mechanism and can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common symptoms include:\n\nSkin reaction: skin irritation with itching, burning, redness and swelling;\n\nRespiratory problems: inhaling hairs can cause coughing, breathing difficulties and, in extreme cases, anaphylactic shock;\n\nEye irritation: symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, such as red, itchy and swollen eyes.\n\nIn animals, especially dogs, contact with caterpillars can be extremely dangerous, leading to tongue necrosis and other serious complications.\n\nIf you are exposed to hairs, follow these steps:\n\nAvoid rubbing the affected area to prevent the hairs from spreading;\n\nWash your skin and eyes with plenty of water;\n\nUse tape to remove loose hairs from the skin;\n\nApply a moisturising cream to relieve irritation;\n\nTake an oral antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction;\n\nConsult an ophthalmologist if there is eye contact;\n\nGo to the emergency room in case of a severe reaction.\n\nFor animals, seek immediate veterinary care if you suspect contact with caterpillars.\n\nPreventive measures\n\nAvoid areas with pine trees during the winter months and early spring;\n\nKeep pets on a leash in risky areas;\n\nSignal and inform the authorities if you find nests or large concentrations of caterpillars;\n\nIf nests need to be removed, contact municipal services or specialists, as improper removal can spread the stinging hairs.\n\nThe pine processionary caterpillar is a natural phenomenon, but requires precautions to avoid incidents. Staying informed and following good prevention practices is essential to minimise risks and protect both the population and pets.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThe hummingbird chick was covered in long brown feathers. Credit: Scott Taylor/CU Boulder\n\nWhen Jay Falk and Scott Taylor first saw the white-necked Jacobin hummingbird chick in Panama's dense rainforest, the bird biologists didn't know what they were looking at.\n\nThe day-old bird, smaller than a pinky finger, had brown fuzz all over its body. When Falk and Taylor walked closer to the nest, the chick began twitching and shaking its head\u2014a behavior they had never seen in birds before.\n\nIt turns out the hummingbird might fend off predators by mimicking a poisonous caterpillar that lives in the same region. In a new paper published March 17 in Ecology, Taylor, associate professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at CU Boulder, and his team described this unusual mimicry behavior for the first time in hummingbirds.\n\n\"We know so little about what nesting birds do in the tropics,\" said Falk, the paper's first author and postdoctoral fellow in Taylor's lab. \"But this could be a very common thing if we had dedicated more efforts to observing and discovering new things about the natural world.\"\n\nA chance discovery\n\nWhite-necked jacobin hummingbirds are common in Central and South America. Male birds have shimmering blue and green feathers, while females tend to sport low-key green plumage.\n\nThe tropical rainforest is a dangerous place for small birds, said Falk, who's also a researcher at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Snakes, monkeys, birds and even insects all prey on them. Prior studies have suggested bird chicks in the tropics are more likely to be eaten by predators than those in temperate forests.\n\nSo how can tiny hummingbird chicks survive? Falk may have stumbled on the answer during a trip to Soberan\u00eda National Park in Panama in 2024.\n\nDespite the birds' frequent visits to Falk's feeders outside his research station in Panama, Falk had never seen a white-necked jacobin chick or its nest before.\n\nBut last March, co-authors Michael Casta\u00f1o at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Sebastian Gallan-Giraldo at the University of Antioquia in Colombia discovered a female jacobin hummingbird incubating an egg in its nest, not far from a forest trail. The nest, smaller than Falk's palm, was made of plant parts to blend in perfectly with the surrounding environment.\n\nThe hummingbird chick began shaking its head like a caterpillar when the researchers approached the nest. Credit: Jay Falk/CU Boulder and The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute\n\nOver the following month, the team closely monitored the nest and witnessed a chick hatch from the egg. Unlike most hummingbirds that are born naked, the jacobin chick was covered in long brown feathers, looking nearly identical to the nest material. That's when the team witnessed the chick's unusual jerking behavior. Scientists have never reported similar behavior in any other hummingbird species.\n\n\"I started texting a video to people and asking them, \"What does this look like?'\" said Taylor. \"And invariably, they said, \"That looks like a caterpillar.\" It was very exciting.\"\n\nOn the second day after the egg hatched, the team saw a predatory wasp approach the chick when the mother was away. As the wasp hovered above the nest, the chick started to twitch its body vigorously like it had for the researchers, swinging its head from side to side. A few seconds later, the wasp flew away.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Another team of researchers reported that a young cinereous mourner, a songbird native to the Amazonian rainforest, might resemble toxic orange caterpillars from the region by having a bright orange coat and waving its head from side to side when disturbed.\n\nFalk and his colleagues looked into other caterpillars in this region of Panama and found that many have similar-looking brown hairs that can give painful stings to predators and even kill them. Some of these caterpillars also shake their heads when they feel threatened, much like the chick.\n\nScientists refer to this survival strategy of mimicking the defensive signaling of a harmful species as Batesian mimicry. For example, some non-venomous milk snakes have developed a pattern of red, yellow and black coloring similar to that of venomous coral snakes to ward off predators.\n\n\"A lot of these really classic examples of Batesian mimicry involve butterflies mimicking other butterflies, or snakes mimicking other snakes. But here, we have a bird potentially mimicking an insect, a vertebrate mimicking an invertebrate,\" Taylor said.\n\nWhile the study described a single observation, the researchers hope to test their theory in the future through experiments like placing artificial chicks with different looks and behaviors in nests to see which are more likely to be attacked by predators. They also hope to encourage birdwatchers and citizen scientists to document more hummingbird nests.\n\n\"Our perception of the natural world is very biased by our own thoughts about what could be possible,\" Taylor said. \"It's incredible what we can discover, but we really have to think broadly.\"\n\nMore information: Jay J.

            "content": "Caterpillar has launched its next generation ultra-high demolition excavator, the Cat 330 UHD.\n\nFocused on urban residential demolition, where it will compete in the 30 MT size class, the 330 UHD features a UHD boom with a maximum pin height of up to 20m to make it comfortably capable of five to six-story work.\n\nThe 330 UHD is essentially two machines in one. While the UHD boom accommodates all standard demolition work tools, the machine also accepts two types of retrofit booms (single and variable angle (VA) boom type). The changeover to deploy traditional buckets and work tools in the role of a \u2018standard\u2019 construction excavator takes a short amount of time.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar built the 330 UHD to withstand difficult demolition of tall structures. Careful attention to detail has seen the 330 UHD designed to reach even the trickiest inner-city worksites, with a transport width of less than 3 m (3\u201910\u201d). The machine is quickly and easily reconfigurable, allowing operators to extract maximum return from the machine by deploying it for general construction when not required for demolition contracts,\u201d says Vincent Migeotte, senior product and sales consultant at Caterpillar.\n\nThe 330 UHD is capable of carrying a large demolition 3300kg work tool at a height of up to 20m. To optimise its utilisation with the retrofit boom, it is also configured with up-to-date technology such as Cat Payload, Cat 2D Grade control system, and Cat 2D E-fence. The latter helps keep the front linkage within a predefined work area, helping provide operator confidence while protecting the machine from damage and monitoring jobsite safety.\n\nThis machine is equipped with a stability monitoring system that helps improve jobsite safety by using the in-cab 10-inch touchscreen monitor to display the machine\u2019s stability via swing angle and front position. The monitor also displays images from the integrated standard rear and side-view camera, a surround-view attachment is an optional extra, while a work-tool camera and second monitor is a dealer-installed aftermarket option.\n\nThe tiltable cab is TOPS demolition-rated, fitted with a premium seat, P5A glass and full operator protective guards (OPG), helping improve jobsite visibility while providing operator comfort.\n\n\u201cAs a next generation machine, the 330 UHD benefits from a modular platform. This will allow annual product updates as necessary, if desired by operators, or if required by safety regulators,\u201d says Migeotte. \u201cThe ability to keep the machine \u2018current\u2019 further increases its appeal, beyond its versatile dual-purpose capabilities. And recognising that ease of maintenance and servicing also contributes to machine longevity, all daily tasks \u2013 such as checking engine and hydraulic oil, coolant levels, and water and sediment separators and drains \u2013 are fully accessible at ground level.\u201d\n\nPowering fuel efficiently, the 330 UHD uses the same engine as the 330 Next Generation excavator, the Cat C7.1 TTA. Meeting the US EPA Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V, and Japan 2014 emission standards, the 7-litre unit is rated at 205kW (275hp) gross.\n\nProspective 330 UHD operators can also choose between two undercarriage types. The Long Narrow undercarriage uses the same base frame as the 330 Next Generation Excavator, maintaining the machine\u2019s mobility within the all-important 3m transportation width and a fully assembled weight under 40 MT.\n\nAlternatively, they can specify the Hydraulic Variable Gauge undercarriage, similar to that used on the 340F UHD, to provide the additional stability needed to function safely and confidently with the largest work tools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the prospects for the Cat 330 UHD as a replacement of the 325C UHD,\u201d adds Migeotte. \u201cIt has been more than 10 years since Caterpillar offered a model in this important segment. For operators working in tough demolition applications, where mobilisation, safety and productivity are vital, the 330 UHD will be a reliable and efficient next generation machine, compliant with all workplace safety standards, and offering an attractive return on investment.\u201d",

            "content": "Steve Sapsford, Academic Advisory Group Lead at the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) looks at the opportunities for hydrogen internal combustion engines, especially for difficult to electrify sectors.\n\nI recently co-chaired a task force for the UK government\u2019s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) that examined these opportunities. The findings are interesting.\n\nIt is estimated by the APC that the non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) sector was worth over \u00a317.6 billion to the UK in 2022, with over 83% of revenue from exports and employing around 100,000 people (~31,000 direct and 68,000 indirect). Consequently, it represents a significant pillar of the UK economy. This significant revenue comes from key global manufacturers with 9 equipment manufacturers including JCB, Volvo Construction Equipment, Caterpillar, and Case New Holland together with a range of Tier 1 suppliers (engines, parts, and accessories) such as Cummins, Perkins (Caterpillar), Johnson Matthey, BorgWarner and JCB engines.\n\nPrimarily due to the harsh and remote environments in which these machines operate, and the wide variety of application and duty cycles, electrification alone cannot be expected to shoulder the burden of decarbonising the entire sector. Instead, a range of solutions will be required that includes electrification, but also hydrogen technology in the form of fuel cells and internal combustion engines.\n\nThe Task Force\n\nThe Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine Subgroup was an industry-led task and finish group convened by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) reporting to the Off-taker Working Group of the Hydrogen Delivery Council (HDC).\n\nOur objective was to consider evidence on the application and use of hydrogen internal combustion engines (H2ICE) as a decarbonisation option for diesel engines, primarily for NRMM, and present a report and recommendations to the HDC. It should be noted that the production, transportation, storage, skills, and regulation of hydrogen were outside our remit and under the auspices of other working groups within the HDC.\n\nThe group was wholly industry-led with senior representation from across the H2ICE sector including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), key component suppliers, end users, trade bodies, independent experts, and academia. It was co-chaired by myself and Amanda Lyne, CEO of ULEMCo.\n\nThe group quickly identified four 4 key areas that needed to be addressed: Performance and efficiency, Emissions (both greenhouse gas emissions and air quality), Practicalities and Impact.\n\nPerformance and Efficiency\n\nData supplied by the main OEMs illustrated quite clearly that H2ICE have efficiencies and performance that are similar or better than equivalent diesel-fuelled engines with brake thermal efficiencies in excess of 40% and with a clear path through to ~50% based on well-established ICE development routes. Not only that, the response of H2ICE to rapid changes in load in the real world is at least as good as their conventional diesel equivalents.\n\nEmissions - Air quality\n\nThe adoption of H2 ICE as a net zero technology in the appropriate applications would offer significant and immediate air quality improvements (up to 95% reduction in NOx and 99.8% reduction in Pm) whilst achieving the same or better performance than a conventional diesel equivalent. Evidence provided in the report shows this is primarily enabled by running the engines very lean where the engines operate at peak efficiency, but the relatively low temperature of combustion means that the production of NOx is minimised.\n\nEmissions - GHG\n\nThe use of H2ICE in NRMM can reduce emissions of the main greenhouse gas, CO 2 , by 99.95%, and the aggregate Global Warming Potential (GWP) of all greenhouse gases by up to 99.9%. Whilst you might expect this to be a 100% reduction (since there is no carbon in the fuel), there is a tiny amount of lubrication oil that can be burned as a result of the combustion process.\n\nPracticalities\n\nThe group found that the use of hydrogen as a fuel for ICE poses no additional challenges compared to using hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell electric vehicles. The main challenges are associated with storage and distribution of the hydrogen on-site and remain the same irrespective of the energy conversion process. However, H2ICE offers a number of advantages compared to other net-zero solutions:\n\nProduction, installation, service, and maintenance utilises well-established skills and processes with no need to learn new technology other than the fuel system\n\nH2ICE is likely to be the least inflationary approach to decarbonising this sector since the cost of the propulsion system will be a little different from the current engines with no requirement for traction batteries. Any increase in machine cost will be due to the on-board hydrogen storage system.\n\nRepowering and upcycling are easier and cheaper\n\nImpact\n\nIn a sector worth at least \u00a317.6 billion to the UK economy in 2022 and employing almost 100,000 people, H2ICE represents the best opportunity to mitigate the risk of job losses and retention of skills in the energy transition. In fact, by leading and embracing the UK\u2019s already globally leading industry with 80% of its revenue today from exports, there is an overwhelming likelihood that first mover advantage will help to fill current skills gaps, develop new skills and opportunities, and generate disproportionate benefit to UK economic growth.\n\nNot only that, H2ICE in NRMM offers a hugely significant opportunity for delivering machines at scale, reducing the time to deliver cost-effective zero-carbon solutions with additional benefits to the wider hydrogen component supply chain and, indeed, the hydrogen economy as a whole.\n\nThe report strongly recommends that H2ICE is not only accepted but also actively promoted as an appropriate net-zero emissions technology for rapid decarbonisation of the NRMM sector with the co-benefits of significantly improved air quality.\n\nGiven the level of reduction in both GHG and regulated emissions available, the report also recommends that H2ICE should be considered a net-zero emissions technology for other sectors including on-road applications.\n\nAdditionally, H2ICE is considered to be the least inflationary approach to delivering decarbonisation at scale in the NRMM sector and within the timescales of net-zero and will also offer a great opportunity to kick-start demand for hydrogen, both within the sector and the hydrogen economy as a whole, in support of the immediate ambition for clean growth in the UK-wide economy.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more, you can find a copy of the full report on the APC website here.\n\n* APC estimated it using ONS and other data.",

            "content": "Even if you don't live in the states mentioned, you should still monitor your box plants to watch out for these early signs of box tree moth infestations. Look out for leaf damage, such as sections that have been eaten, especially inside the edges. Leaves that appear skeletonized are also a good indication that the caterpillars are active on your plants. If you notice this type of damage, look for the lime-green larvae among the foliage. Check the undersides of the leaves for a distinct silk webbing that is housing the pupa. If you spot signs of the box tree moth on your plants, you should immediately report them to your state's plant regulatory official or your state's plant health director.\n\nYou might even spot a sawdust-like substance, which is the caterpillar's excrement and is commonly referred to as frass. This may be visible on the foliage or even under the base of the shrub. Noticing these signs early may allow you to save your box plants if infestations are fairly localized. In this case, you can just cut off the affected branches, double-bag them in plastic, and dispose of them in the trash. For more severe cases, entire plants may have to be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the pest. It helps to familiarize yourself with what you should know to stop the box tree moth in its tracks. If all else fails, rest assured that there are plenty of other evergreen shrubs to make your landscaping look great that you can grow instead of boxwoods.",

            "content": "Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence estimates that 2.3 million bank cards were leaked on the dark web, based on an analysis of data-stealing malware log files from 2023-2024. On average, every 14th infostealer infection results in stolen credit card information, with nearly 26 million devices compromised by infostealers, including more than 9 million in 2024 alone. Kaspersky released its report on the infostealer threat landscape while the technology world gathers at MWC 2025 in Barcelona.\n\nKaspersky experts estimate that approximately 2,300,000 bank cards have been leaked on the dark web. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the log files from data-stealing malware, dated 2023-2024, that were leaked on the dark web market. While globally the share of leaked cards is well below one percent, 95% of the observed numbers appear technically valid.\n\nInfostealer malware is not only designed to extract financial information, but also credentials, cookies and other valuable user data, which is compiled into log files and then distributed within the dark web underground community. An infostealer can infect a device if a victim unknowingly downloads and runs a malicious file, for example one disguised as legitimate software, such as a game cheat. It can be spread through phishing links, compromised websites, malicious attachments in emails or messengers and various other methods. It targets both personal and corporate devices.\n\nOn average, every 14th infostealer infection results in stolen credit card information. Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence experts found that nearly 26 million devices running Windows were infected with various types of infostealers in the past two years.\n\n\u201cThe actual number of infected devices is even higher. Cybercriminals often leak stolen data in the form of log files months or even years after the initial infection, and compromised credentials and other information continue to surface on the dark web over time. Therefore, the more time passes, the more infections from previous years we observe. We forecast the total number of devices infected with infostealer malware in 2024 to be between 20 million and 25 million, while for 2023, the estimate ranges between 18 million and 22 million,\u201d says Sergey Shcherbel, expert at Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence.\n\nIn 2024, Redline remained the most widespread infostealer, accounting for 34% of the total number of infections.\n\nThe most significant surge in 2024 was in infections caused by Risepro, whose share of total infections increased from 1.4% in 2023 to almost 23% in 2024. \u201cRisePro is a growing threat. It was first discovered two years ago but seems to be gaining momentum. The stealer primarily targets banking card details, passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and may be spreading under the guise of key generators, cracks for various software and game mods,\u201d explains Sergey Shcherbel. Another rapidly growing stealer is Stealc, which first appeared in 2023 and increased its share from nearly 3% to 13%.",

            "content": "My adventures continue in Star Citizen. I don\u2019t have much time to play lately due to Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows analysis, but I get a few hours to make a few trips. What are a few hours of sleep compared to travel through space in search of wealth?\n\nLet\u2019s say that last weekend I put aside Naoe and Yasuke to throw a 8-9-hour marathon at Star Citizen. I did many things, but it is summarized in a nutshell: assault ships in search of valuable booty to store or sell taking advantage of the active event. I did more things, obvious, but I don\u2019t want to disperse.\n\nIt is not called stealing when it comes to thieves\n\nThis adventure, like all the above, begins by climbing my friend\u2019s ship, a Corsair. This time we are three. Two in the mentioned ship (pilot and gunner) and a third member that accompanies us with a cutlas. The plan is quite simple: accept hunting contracts and take us anything of value that thugs keep in their wineries.\n\nWe are looking for groups with very specific ships, Hercules and Caterpillar, because they usually travel loaded to material stops. But it is not as simple as getting, shooting and looting. The meetings must be planned so that the objective ships are incapacitated in the exact place and moment. The idea to leave them out of combat in space or enough near the ground so that it does not explode when the severity of the planet does its job. The ideal are missions in asteroid fields.\n\nWe give an interesting objective. I do not identify the ship, but my colleagues say it is worth it. And they succeed. The problem is that it has fallen to the surface. Still we descend to loot it. My partner leaves me on the ship of the ship while instructions to open all the gates. Both place the ass of their ships in front of the open cargoes to transfer the load with the tractor rays. It sounds easy, but in the middle of the maneuver I was trapped in a ship\u2019s fold and they have to knock me out to get me with the tractor ray. In addition, that downloading and loading the cargo is not a simple task. All this takes us a good time.\n\nAfter downloading and accepting a few more contracts, we give a very interesting objective: a Caterpillar that we managed to disable in the middle of an asteroid field. It is a freighter, a ship\u2019s monster with a lot of cargo capacity, and a real beauty that I would love to have in the hangar, if you want my opinion. Both repeat the play of placing their ships while entrusting me with a very exciting mission: enter the shattered ship, ride in the pilot\u2019s seat and open all the loading gates.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many hours I will have played Star Citizen so far, but I still don\u2019t believe many of the moments I live during my adventures. We are three thugs that go through space destroying thugs and rapping anything of value of their ships. At that time I was floating through the halls of a monstrous freighter \u2026 and the last interruption or load screen was when it went into a game. In spite of everything, the part that I enjoy most is when we inspect the cargo and transfer the boxes from one ship to another.\n\n\n\n\n\nNor is anything from the other world, but I like this activity and the context is simply incredible, because we are in space. And the best thing is that the thing does not end after loading all the material, because then you have to download everything by hand in the base to sell or store it. Surely it is as painful as it sounds for the majority, but I have no words to express how happy I am while I am in those situations. More when I do not hurry, but they would not be my friends to refrain to take a bag. I think I was born too soon \u2026\n\nHere it may seem about 40 minutes or an hour of gameplay, but in reality all this extended over almost four hours to the many of the night. The first ones, because then we went to buy my first ship in Star Citizen and continued with our business, but now with another ship with its respective cargo zone. Although that is history for another publication.\n\nIn Lifextra | They promised me war in Star Citizen and that was what I found: incredible ships, huge weapons and death in the cruel emptiness of space\n\nIn Lifextra | I have spent a week living adventures in Star Citizen and I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of everything I want to do in this universe\n\nIn Lifextra | I refuse to address more ships in Star Citizen until I forget the anxiety that I have suffered during my first hunting joy",

            "content": "Column: Spraying pesticides on bougainvillea and other plants harms nature and people\n\nThis is a story about bougainvillea, one of the more beautiful, but perhaps least understood plants here in Palm Beach.\n\nWhen I moved here from the Northeast, I knew a great deal about northern plants, but virtually nothing about tropical species. So when my landscaper told me I needed to spray my bougainvillea because caterpillars were eating all the blossoms, I figured I should do as he said. The same thing has probably happened to you.\n\nBut this is the worst thing you can do for your bougainvillea.\n\nAll those caterpillars on the bougainvillea are actually bird food, and they are here now to provide necessary protein for nesting chicks. Adult birds need 300-500 caterpillars per day to support their nestlings, and they will forage in a radius of only 500 yards. If the caterpillars aren\u2019t available, the nest will likely fail. In Via Flagler, which is adjacent to Henry\u2019s Restaurant and Main Street Caf\u00e9, bougainvillea grows over all the walls; toxic pesticides here would be dangerous to the many visitors who sit outside to eat or sip their coffee.\n\nWith this in mind, the Breakers stopped spraying the plants in the via, including the bougainvillea. Almost immediately, birds started arriving and began nesting in the vines, which provide wonderful shelter and habitat. They devoured the caterpillars and their guano provided fertilizer for the roots of the vines.\n\nSince the birds\u2019 arrival, the blossoms on the bougainvillea have been twice as dense and colorful, and the added benefit of constant birdsong is a huge bonus. Additionally, most of the plantings in Via Flagler are native species, and are proving to be exceptionally hardy and beautiful in large planters, on trellises, and cascading over walls.\n\nErnodia littoralis, or beach creeper, is used extensively in the via as a wonderful replacement for green island ficus; its arching stems cascade over the sides of the central planter creating dense mats of shiny green foliage with tiny tubular flowers that attract hummingbirds. This low-growing plant thrives on neglect \u2014 it is drought- and heat-tolerant, loves full sun or part shade, and can be left alone or trimmed to any desired shape. It does well on coastal dunes, in manicured gardens, rock gardens, or atop a sunny wall. This beautiful but threatened species deserves to be far more widely planted.\n\nCoontie (Zamia integrifolia) is a terrific native species you\u2019ll find in the planting beds at Via Flagler. This tough evergreen cycad grows to about 2 feet with lovely arching fern-like fronds. It\u2019s happy in sun or shade, and is extremely drought-tolerant. This is very slow growing so don\u2019t give up on it if it doesn\u2019t appear to be thriving \u2014 and right now it may be looking a little tired at the end of winter. But be patient: it is about to flush out with beautiful new spring growth that will attract the stunning blue atala butterflies. This is one of our most important native species and the only endemic cycad in North America. Make sure to add several to your gardens!\n\nCocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco) is another fabulous plant in the via that is often sadly mistreated. This is a valuable shrub for screens or hedges, with beautiful dense glossy green foliage. The red-tipped variety is especially lovely, thriving in full sun with spikes of tiny fragrant white flowers that bloom all year. Perhaps because this plant is so tough, it is often improperly sheared, leaving unsightly, exposed stems. This seems so unfair to this stunning specimen, which, left alone, will mature into an elegant, pest-free shrub with graceful upright to arching branches.\n\nWhen the cocoplum's pink fruits ripen to a deep purple, they can be eaten as is or made into delicious jams or jellies. The fruits are rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants; they are an excellent source of nutrients supporting eye and heart health and are said to prevent cancer. They are also loved by birds. If you must prune them, do so by hand, not with hedge shearers, and they will retain their lovely form.\n\nWe have had several forums on \u201cWhere have all the songbirds gone?\u201d here in Palm Beach over the past few years. The bird population in the United States and Canada has declined by more than 3 billion birds in the last 50 years, so it\u2019s gratifying to at least see their bustling activity in the bougainvillea in Via Flagler, and in my adjacent garden off Sunset, where they nest in the live oaks, Simpson's stoppers, wild coffee, wooly teabush, cinnamon bark, and wild lime.\n\nI have some doves nesting in the sabal palm outside my window and it\u2019s fun to have them always peeking in at me. I\u2019m assuming that bats are living in the crowns of the trees as we have very few mosquitoes and a single bat will eat 3,000 to 4,000 of the little devils every night. I love going into the garden in the morning to listen to the music of the song sparrows, cardinals, doves, and mockingbirds \u2014 and they continue to perform in the late afternoons 'til dusk.\n\nIf we all planted just a few native species and stopped using chemicals in our gardens for even a month, we would enjoy a dramatic increase in birds, butterflies and pollinators that will come to visit! With the right plants in the right places, you\u2019ll find that you don\u2019t need any pesticides at all \u2014 and you\u2019ll save a ton of money!\n\nI recently attended a meeting on the Florida Wildlife Corridor, our most at-risk resource. This 18 million-acre corridor of land stretches from the Everglades headwaters near Orlando, to Gulf Islands National Seashore near Pensacola, and down to Florida Bay, connecting conserved farmlands, ranches, forests and watersheds essential to the survival of Florida\u2019s endemic and endangered wildlife. It is imperative that we find solutions to balancing Florida\u2019s increasing population growth with the permanent connection, restoration, and protection of this land.\n\nThe significance of the corridor and the many species of wildlife it preserves, including the iconic Florida panther and black bear, cannot be understated. It will also provide wonderful recreational options for hiking, kayaking, biking, horseback riding, and exploring the rivers and trails of Florida\u2019s unique and exquisite heartland. Maintaining and protecting functioning ecosystems for all the creatures of our state and our world will also strengthen resilience to intensifying storms and will protect water quality, and preserving these spaces of connected ecosystems will instill a love of the environment for our children and future generations. For more information on this important foundation, visit floridawildlifecorridor.org.\n\nJust as land must be open and connected for our wildlife to survive, so must our landscapes and gardens here in Palm Beach. We need more than just a few pockets of native plants and pesticide-free areas \u2014 there must be contiguous habitat and sustenance if our pollinators and birds are to survive. No one needs to remove all or even any exotic species from their landscapes, unless they are known invasives.\n\nBut if all of us planted just a few natives and stopped applying chemicals, we would go a long way toward cleaning up the very unhealthy environment that currently exists on our island.",

            "content": "\u2018Resilience\u2019 is key for New Hampshire farms \u2014 but state support of grant program is in doubt\n\nIn late May, a Charlestown farm was preparing to plant a crop of carrots and potatoes. Then, 4.5 inches of rain and hail fell in a little more than an hour.\n\n\u201cIt caused tremendous damage and erosion of valuable soil, which is, you know, a limited resource that we need to protect,\u201d said farmer Donna Bascom, of Bascom Farm. \u201cWe could not get those crops in, and it severely undermined my growing season.\u201d\n\nThis year is different, she said, thanks to the help of the Climate Resilience Grant Program, run through the state\u2019s 10 county conservation districts. Bascom will have a 100-by-16-foot caterpillar tunnel \u2014 a domed tunnel that protects the crops \u2014 that will allow her to plant \u201ceven if we have drought or if we have another flooding season,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt will give me more resiliency, and more resiliency to produce a crop for our consumers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is one of dozens of farmers who have benefited from the grant program, which was first launched in 2022. Since then, the program has provided grants totaling more than $700,000 to 95 farms across the state, with hopes to provide another $336,000 in grants this year.\n\nThe program acknowledges two realities: First, that farmers feel the impacts of a changing climate up close and in ways that can make an often difficult business even harder, and second, that the agricultural sector contributes to planet-warming emissions. The grants provide funds to address both these aspects \u2014 mitigation and adaptation.\n\n\u201cI think that the past few years, we\u2019ve had periods of drought. 2023, we had periods of really intense flooding,\u201d said Ben\u00e9e Hershon, the community engagement director with the Cheshire County Conservation District, in an interview. \u201cI think farmers are already starting to see and feel the impacts of climate change in our state. And I think that is also trickling down to community members who, you know, we rely on these farms for our local food system.\u201d\n\nThe program funds projects in four main categories: soil health, water management, on-farm energy, and crop and livestock protection, said Amanda Littleton, the district manager of the Chester County Conservation District. The grants range up to $10,000 each, and farmers typically fund between a quarter and half of the project costs themselves, she said. And the demand is high, with about 30% of applicants turned away each year, Littleton said.\n\nPrivate donors have funded the bulk of the program, but supporters say that state backing is needed. Bascom was one of the farmers making the pitch to lawmakers on the House Finance Committee for House Bill 246, which would provide $100,000 in state general funds to the program over fiscal years 2026 and 2027. So far, though, the fate of that legislation is uncertain in a tight budget year, with the committee voting last month to retain the bill.\n\n\u201cOur private funders are at the point where you know they\u2019re saying, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re into it, we want to do this, but does the state care?\u2019\u201d said Lionel Chute, the director of natural resources for Sullivan County and the district manager of the county\u2019s conservation district, to the committee. Others echoed the point that state funding was essential for keeping donations flowing.\n\nAgriculture in the state contributes significantly to the economy, supporting thousands of jobs, generating tens of millions in tax revenue, and contributing a total economic output of more than $500 million in 2019, according to a state report.\n\nAt the same time, farmers face difficult economic realities. Chute pointed to the 2022 U.S. Department of Agriculture census of agriculture, which found that 80% of commercial farms in the state grossed less than $25,000 a year, and 92% of farms grossed less than $100,000. In a good year, Chute said, farms are making net profits of about 10%, meaning most farmers in the state are left with only a few thousand dollars a year in profit, if that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an agricultural system that is really hanging on by a thread,\u201d Chute said.\n\nMany of the farmers who have received grants from the program said the projects would not have been possible without the support of the grant program.\n\nThat\u2019s true for a 250-acre Pittsburg beef farm, where grants helped to upgrade its manure pit, purchase a hay feeder that helped reduce waste significantly, and rehabilitate its fields, said Rebecca and Keith Robinson, of Robinson Family Farm.\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t received the funds, the projects would not have been able to get done,\u201d Rebecca Robinson told lawmakers.\n\nKeith Robinson said in an interview that the farm has tried to keep spending from the grants as local as possible, looking first to his community and within the state, and that they try to work primarily with small businesses.\n\nOther projects in his county have included \u201cstorm water collection systems, enhancing hay field quality, and retrofitting equipment for no-till use practices, and installing energy efficient solar panels,\u201d he said.\n\nJack Rixey, the owner and operator of Dog Days Farm in Fitzwilliam, which sells produce, said the program helped him purchase an agricultural flame weeder in 2023, and that he was applying for a grant this year to help enhance some of the farm\u2019s greenhouses.\n\n\u201cThese pieces of equipment allow us to farm efficiently and profitably and support our business, which \u2026 is a fledgling business for me,\u201d he said. He said his purchase of the farm about three years ago came with debt and high start-up costs.\n\n\u201cAgricultural equipment is notoriously high-cost,\u201d Rixey said. \u201cWithout this grant, we would not be able to purchase some of the vital pieces of equipment that we use to farm profitably, to \u2026 pay our employees a fair wage, and to protect our soil, which is the most important part of our farm.\u201d\n\nLawmakers leading the bill urged their colleagues to see the funds as a money-saving investment \u2014 one that would pay dividends for farmers and the state.\n\nRep. Judy Aron, a South Acworth Republican sponsoring the bill, said state support would yield continued backing from private donors; ultimately increase farm production, and therefore state tax revenues; and make farmers better equipped to handle floods, droughts, and pests, which will make them less likely to need disaster help in the future.\n\n\u201c$50,000 that will help a whole lot of farms is a lot cheaper than \u2026 the recovery money that we could possibly be asked for if we don\u2019t do that,\u201d said Rep. Peter Bixby, a Dover Democrat and co-sponsor.\n\nThis story was originally published by the New Hampshire Bulletin.",

            "content": "Despite the early morning temperatures in the middle 20s, I made a visit to the winter garden during a lull between rainstorms. Because of the cold and the rain, much of the vegetable garden is muddy and even the winter-hardy cole crops look mushy. But this is the perfect time to check on the garden fauna: slugs, snails, cutworms, beetles and more. All these little beasts are active now and easy to find if you know where to look. So let's see who is hiding in the garden.\n\nFor many years, I have placed non-treated scrap boards in the garden to monitor and control pests. How does this work? Slugs and many other pests prefer to hide during the day and come out to graze on vegetables at night when the air is more humid. The wooden boards, which I place between rows of vegetables, create a dark, damp and protected daytime habitat for various invertebrates. I check underneath them every three to five days to see which garden visitors have been drawn to the boards. At this time of year, there are usually multiple pests, especially slugs and cutworms, upon which I can dispense justice.\n\nOur most common garden cutworm is the caterpillar of the large yellow underwing moth (Noctua pronuba), which was introduced from Europe in 1979. The adult moth has mottled gray forewings and beautiful orange hindwings, and you may notice them taking flight when you mow the lawn or weed the garden. The caterpillars are active all year, even during the cold and wet months. As far as I can determine, they will eat any green plant, and the vegetable garden is their favorite place. I have found the wooden boards to be quite effective in attracting them.\n\nWhat about all the variously sized black beetles that are also found under those same boards? Garden friend or foe? Very good friends. The snail-killer carabid (Scaphinotus angusticollis), European ground beetle (Carabus nemoralis), and night-stalking tiger beetles, have come by their names honestly, with both adults and larvae being predaceous on slugs and other pests. The snail-killer carabid, for example, is a specialist in killing and eating slugs and snails. Compared to other beetles, it has narrow jaws, head and shoulders that allow it to squeeze deep into a snail shell to dine on fresh escargot.\n\nSo how do I know I am really controlling pests by using wooden boards to attract them and their predators? The area around my garden is very wet in winter and covered with vegetation: a nonpareil habitat for slugs and snails. After using the boards for many years, I have noticed that the European brown garden snail has become rare and the slugs have become much smaller in size. By changing the population dynamics (in removing the larger slugs), I am removing the most likely slugs to be reproducing and laying the largest clutches of eggs. Slugs and snails are hermaphroditic; when two slugs mate, they exchange eggs and sperm with each other and both individuals get pregnant. This allows populations to grow very quickly if uncontrolled.\n\nUsing the boards makes it easy to corral and dispatch the slugs, cutworms and other pests in your garden, and provides the helpful predaceous beetles with a safe, stable place to rest during the day. It also puts you in a direct relationship with nature. Give the board method a try and find out what is going undercover in your garden.\n\nPete Haggard (he/him) taught extension courses on Vegetable Gardening at CalPoly Humboldt for many years. He writes with editorial assistance from Jane Monroe (she/her), who wishes the board method would work on aphids.

To be honest, it would have been ideal to do this back in February, but that\u2019s okay \u2014 there\u2019s still time because jackets may come in handy over the next few weeks.\n\nNovyny.LIVE will tell you which jacket style has lost its relevance this spring.\n\nJackets that are no longer in trend\n\nWe\u2019d like to draw your attention to one jacket that every second woman probably owns. It\u2019s worn by many people, and stores are still actively selling it because it\u2019s really comfortable and practical. But there is one \"but\": it has lost its fashionable status.\n\nMany people now mentally open their wardrobe and remember what is hanging there. If you have a jacket with thin stitching \u2014 in the form of small horizontal stripes \u2014 then this is it. That\u2019s the one we\u2019re talking about.\n\nStriped quilted jacket. Photo from Instagram\n\nThis model is often called a \"caterpillar\" because of the narrow rows of quilting. And although the idea of quilted jackets remains in trend, the format with small stripes has long been out of fashion. In the spring of 2025, such jackets will look banal and a little outdated.\n\nWhat\u2019s in fashion now\n\nQuilted outerwear is still relevant \u2014 just in a slightly different form. Wide quilted stripes are what to look for. Jackets with diamond-shaped quilting are even cooler. The main rule is that the seams should be large, with a clear geometry, not small and small.\n\nA fashionable jacket. Photo from Instagram\n\nSo, if you want to look up-to-date, pay attention to jackets with large diamonds or wide quilted lines. And leave that old \"caterpillar\" for a walk with the dog or the summer residence. Because style is not only about comfort, but also about how you feel in things.\n\nEarlier, we wrote about the popularity of quilted jackets with flowers this spring.\n\nWe also told you what style of leather jacket is in trend this year.",

            "content": "Caterpillar celebrates 100-year milestone with employees at Georgia manufacturing plant\n\nErrol Wint, the man in charge of the Caterpillar plant in Athens, Georgia, took a seat at a conference room table last week to chat with the press about the company\u2019s success in its first 100 years.\n\nCaterpillar, formed in 1925 in California, is now a global business operating plants throughout the world. The manufacturing plant in Athens opened in 2013.\n\nThese big, powerful machines moving dirt for highways and construction projects are a product of the Caterpillar employees, according to Wint.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar cares about their employees and the products reflect it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo be around 100 years \u2212 I think that\u2019s what 100 years teaches you,\u201d Wink said about the emphasis the company places on its employees. The plant in Athens, where Wink is facilities manager, employees about 1,100 people.\n\nThis week Caterpillar sent its Centennial World Tour bus to the Athens plant for employees to visit. The interactive mobile unit provided information on plants worldwide and included a futures room projecting Caterpillar\u2019s role in the future, even what its products might look like when Mars is settled by humankind.\n\nMore from USA TODAY: Canadian backlash erupts over Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trade war hits wine, spirits. What\u2019s next?\n\nThe company in Athens makes the smaller bulldozers, often used on highway ramp construction, and the smaller version excavators.\n\nAs part of the local celebration, the Caterpillar Foundation donated a $23,000 check to the Athens Area Community Foundation, according to Lisa Miller, a media relations specialist with Caterpillar. Donations will also be made at other Caterpillar cities to charitable organizations, she said.\n\nDuring a tour of the mobile unit, several employees commented on Caterpillar\u2019s impact on their careers, reflective of what Wint had expressed.\n\nApollonia Favors of Athens has worked at the plant for 11 years.\n\n\u201cI came here because I was looking for a career and not a job,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring my time here, I have worked in three different departments, so I have gotten a lot of experience. \u201cI was so excited about the 100th anniversary. It shows the longevity of the company and why I came here for a career.\"\n\nNathan Welch of Athens explained he was in high school when he heard about the plant opening. Later he was working as a machinist for another company when he was hired by Caterpillar about three years ago.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar is helpful in getting to my career goals. They\u2019ve been working with me in going back to school and finishing my college degree. They\u2019ve been willing to work with me,\u201d he said.\n\nLuke James, who has worked there almost eight years, explained he has been welding since he was 10 years old and decided to make it a career about 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cI heard they had a good program here,\u201d he said, adding he has liked bulldozers since he was a kid.\n\nWorking here has \u201cbeen fantastic. I\u2019ve gotten to build the blades on bulldozers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way better job than some of the others I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nAfter Athens, the mobile unit will visit other Caterpillar plants across the country as part of the anniversary.\n\nWink, an 11-year employee, said he has told employees that \u201cwhat you make is a reflection of who you are.\u201d\n\nAnd he predicted, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it for 100 years more.\u201d",

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.22%.\n\nThe construction equipment company's shares have seen a decrease of 6.2% over the last month, surpassing the Industrial Products sector's loss of 6.79% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.15%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Caterpillar in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Caterpillar to post earnings of $4.32 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 22.86%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $14.65 billion, indicating a 7.29% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nCAT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.64 per share and revenue of $63.29 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -10.32% and -2.34%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Caterpillar. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.66% downward. Caterpillar is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nDigging into valuation, Caterpillar currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.3. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.3, which means Caterpillar is trading at no noticeable deviation to the group.\n\nIt's also important to note that CAT currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.84. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Manufacturing - Construction and Mining was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.03 at yesterday's closing price.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Dobermans of the Dow: 10 Stocks to Consider. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against other Dobermans of the Dow to buy.\n\nThe Dobermans of the Dow strategy serves as an alternative to the well-known Dogs of the Dow approach, offering a more selective screening process. While the Dogs of the Dow ranks stocks solely based on dividend yield, the Dobermans method prioritizes high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations. The selection process involves two key steps: first, the 30 stocks in the Dow are ranked by Return on Equity (ROE), with the top 20 retained. Then, these 20 companies are further ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, narrowing the selection to the final ten stocks, which form the Dobermans portfolio. Historically, a hypothetical portfolio following this approach and rebalanced annually has delivered superior performance compared to the Dow, the broader market, and the Dogs of the Dow strategy, according to a report by Forbes. The report further mentioned that since 2000, this methodology has generated a cumulative return of 810%, more than doubling the long-term performance of these benchmarks.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Invest In\n\nThe significance of dividend stocks is well established, with extensive research examining their long-term performance. A study by Robert Arnott found that over a period of more than 200 years, ending in 2002, the US stock market delivered an average annualized total return of 7.9%, with dividend reinvestment accounting for 5% of that growth. Beyond enhancing overall returns, dividends also provide a buffer during market downturns. Various studies have shown that companies paying dividends tend to experience lower downside risk and recover losses more quickly, ultimately leading to higher risk-adjusted returns over extended investment periods.\n\nWithin dividend investing, companies with a consistent track record of dividend growth tend to attract greater investor interest. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that firms with ample cash reserves are better positioned to sustain and expand their operations while continuing to pay stable or increasing dividends. To assess the sustainability of dividends, companies must evaluate whether their payouts are supported by cash generated from operating activities and the availability of free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\u2014such as spending on property, plants, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014from cash flow generated through operations. Excess cash can be allocated toward dividends, debt reduction, share buybacks, or business expansion.\n\nA positive or growing free cash flow often signals stable or increasing profitability. Since strong free cash flow may indicate a healthy balance sheet, S&P Dow Jones conducted an analysis to determine whether free cash flow yield\u2014measured as annual free cash flow per share divided by stock price\u2014provides valuable insights into investment returns. The underlying investment thesis suggested that all else being equal, companies with a higher free cash flow yield are preferable, as they generate greater free cash income for each dollar invested.\n\nAn analysis of the broader market universe, divided into quintiles based on free cash flow yield, revealed that the top-quintile stocks delivered an annualized return of 15.7% between December 1990 and June 2017. This performance exceeded the returns of all other quintiles and outpaced the broader market by an average of 3.6%. While the bottom two quintiles also achieved respectable returns of 11.0% and 8.6% annually, respectively, both underperformed relative to the overall equity market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered the Dow stocks by Return on Equity, narrowing the list to the top 20. These are then ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, with the top 10 earning the title \u201cDobermans of the Dow.\u201d The stocks are ranked according to their free cash flow yield. In cases where multiple stocks had the same free cash flow yield, the number of hedge fund investors was used as a deciding factor. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: 0.05\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is an American manufacturing company that specializes in construction, mining, and other engineering equipment. Building on its long-standing tradition of innovation, the company has intensified efforts to integrate advanced technology and digital connectivity across its product lineup. Its strategy to expand autonomous solutions, electrified powertrains, and AI-driven capabilities has contributed to business diversification.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) reported revenue of $16.2 billion, reflecting a 5% year-over-year decline. The decrease was primarily due to an $859 million drop in sales volume, driven by shifts in dealer inventories and lower equipment sales to end users. Dealer inventory levels declined by $1.3 billion during the quarter, a sharper reduction compared to the $900 million decrease recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite the revenue dip, profit per share increased to $5.78, up from $5.28 in the same period the previous year.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.63%, as recorded on March 10. The company maintained a strong financial position in 2024, generating $12.0 billion in operating cash flow over the year and closing the fourth quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. Throughout the year, the company allocated $7.7 billion to share repurchases and distributed $2.6 billion in dividends to shareholders. This strong cash position has enabled the company to raise its payouts for 30 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, CAT ranks 6th on our list of Dobermans of the Dow to buy.

Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhy Does CAT Stock Spark Debate?\n\nWith its iconic yellow machinery working on construction sites, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) manufactures construction equipment like bulldozers, excavators, and parts and maintenance services.\n\nTwo Things to Like:\n\n1. Outstanding Long-Term EPS Growth\n\nAnalyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 14% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 3.8% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\n2. New Investments Bear Fruit as ROIC Jumps\n\nROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\n\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, Caterpillar\u2019s ROIC has increased significantly over the last few years. This is a great sign when paired with its already strong returns. It could suggest its competitive advantage or profitable growth opportunities are expanding.\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nSlow Organic Growth Suggests Waning Demand In Core Business\n\nIn addition to reported revenue, organic revenue is a useful data point for analyzing Construction Machinery companies. This metric gives visibility into Caterpillar\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, Caterpillar\u2019s organic revenue averaged 5% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy, which can add an extra layer of complexity to its operations.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s positive characteristics outweigh the negatives, but at $340.30 per share (or 15.6\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nStocks We Like Even More Than Caterpillar\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 6 Stocks for this week.

The suffragettes and civil rights protesters often spring to mind, but many others have also changed our world for the better over the centuries.\n\nThis history will be be brought right up to date at the Cardigan Guildhall Corn Exchange next week. The role of current-day activists will be illustrated in an exhibition of Faces of Rebellion from 17th to 22nd March.\n\nIt features the work of Mark Skipper, who uses the name Bitterjug for his art work. He says, \u201cI\u2019m a software engineer with a sketchbook. I\u2019m also a climate activist, and reportage sketcher: I take my sketchbook to protests to capture scenes and atmosphere in ways that photography cannot.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s sketches of activists\u2019 faces are surrounded by the person\u2019s own words about how and why they became active, and the variety is striking.\n\nMark continues, \u201cFaces of Rebellion tells the stories of climate activists as humans in a way the media cannot. Its enduring themes are compassion and community.\u201d\n\nMark encourages other artists to get involved, and portraits by Solutionairy, from The Netherlands, will also be included. Solutionary gives her background: \u201cI trained as a solution focussed psychologist. We focus on people\u2019s strengths and their unique ways to deal with life\u2019s challenges. With Faces of Rebellion I get to apply this to our greatest challenge. I\u2019m inspired by the variety of stories of courage and kindness in the face of climate breakdown.\u201d\n\nCaroline Juler is a local artist and film-maker who lives in Brynberian. She has made many short videos of Cardigan based climate activists, and these will also be part of the exhibition. \u201cI\u2019ve been very aware of the escalating climate crisis for some time, and recently I\u2019ve been taking a more active part in trying to do something about it. We all bring our own backgrounds and talents to climate work, and these all feed into effective climate campaigning when we work together. I wanted to make the videos to show how this works for some of the many local activists.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition has been arranged by West Wales Climate Coalition members, and Philippa Gibson has helped with some of the organisation. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel disheartened by slow progress, and Donald Trump\u2019s denial of the climate cristis doesn\u2019t help, but we need to be aware that we are part of an \u201cecosystem of change\u201d that includes COP international climate conferences, national legislation, community action, industry innovation, and individual commitment, including protests and non-violent direct action to to challenge damaging practices.\u201d She added, \u201cAll these parts work together to make meaningful impacts achievable. We ALL have a role to play. This exhibition aims to be inspiring and positive.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information about the exhibition or about local climate campaigning, contact [email protected]",

            "content": "Successful parasitism by C. kariyai in non-host My. loreyi parasitized by Me. pulchricornis\n\nAttraction of parasitoid wasps to sympatric unsuitable host species and subsequent oviposition onto or into unsuitable hosts is widely documented. Females of the specialist endoparasitoid wasp, C. kariyai (Ck), also respond to chemical cues from unsuitable host species, including sympatric My. loreyi (Myl), and exhibit oviposition behavior toward them24,28,34,46. Our results demonstrate that Ck females recognize Myl caterpillars and oviposit into them as into their usual host, My. separata (Mys) caterpillars (Experiment 1). However, Myl caterpillars parasitized solely by Ck never produced Ck adults (Experiment 2).\n\nRemarkably, our multiparasitism experiments revealed that Ck can complete larval development in Myl caterpillars when these caterpillars are also parasitized by the naturally sympatric endoparasitoid wasp, Me. pulchricornis (Mp), which uses Myl as its usual host (Experiments 3 and 4). In essence, Ck can utilize unsuitable host Myl caterpillars as hosts when multiparasitism with Mp occurs. According to observations of parasitoid larvae in multiparasitized Myl caterpillars, no Ck larvae were found parasitizing Mp larva (Experiment 5). Therefore, hyperparasitism (cf.65), does not explain this phenomenon.\n\nCk females protect their eggs and their larvae from the immune response of their usual hosts, Mys caterpillars, by injecting polydnavirus (CkPDV) and venom46,50,55,66. These maternal anti-immunity factors are effective against Mys caterpillars, but not against other caterpillars46, which restricts the range of potential hosts for Ck. In fact, although Ck females oviposited 53.7\u201359.0 eggs into Myl caterpillars (Experiment 1), no Ck larvae were observed in hemocoels of Myl caterpillars eight days post-oviposition (Experiment 5), and successful parasitism never occurred (Experiment 2). Similarly, Mp females introduce virus-like particles (MpVLPs) into host caterpillars along with a single egg, which then regulate the immune response of the host insects51,52,53. Since 83.3% of multiparasitized Myl caterpillars contained Ck larvae eight days after oviposition, it is possible that maternal factors of Mp protect not only Mp eggs and larvae, but also Ck eggs and larvae, allowing Ck larvae to survive in Myl caterpillars. However, identifying physiological mechanisms that allow Ck to survive in unsuitable host caterpillars in multiparasitism remains a future challenge.\n\nA series of studies by Magdaraog\u2019s group56,57,58 clarified intrinsic competition between Ck and Mp in Mys caterpillars, which are ordinary hosts for both parasitoids. They demonstrated that multiparasitized Mys produce either Ck or Mp when the interval between the first and second oviposition is between 1 and 96 h, but the parasitoid species ovipositing first generally prevails over the other56. For example, when Ck oviposited into Mys 1 h before Mp, the successful parasitism rate of Ck was approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of Mp56. In contrast, in our study, the successful parasitism rate of Ck in multiparasitized Myl is significantly lower than that of Mp, regardless of oviposition order or host instar, with the maximum successful parasitism rate of Ck being only 20.0%, when Ck oviposited into 4th instar Myl caterpillars 12 h before Mp (Experiment 4).\n\nThe outcome of intrinsic competition between Ck and Mp in Mys was also mutually exclusive56, as observed in Myl in this study, and is determined by three factors: resistance to the host immune response, direct conflict among larvae, and toxic effects of maternal anti-immunity factors (CkPDV, MpVLP or venom) on heterospecific parasitoid larvae58. Our results showed that multiparasitized-Myl have the ability to produce Ck when female Ck oviposited Myl caterpillars < 24 h before Mp, or < 12 h after Mp. In cases in which Ck oviposited more than 48 h before Mp, Ck eggs may have been killed by the Myl immune response before Mp oviposition. Conversely, when Ck oviposited more than 48 h after Mp, Ck could not complete larval development because Myl caterpillars die soon after Mp emergence67. This assumption is supported by observation of dead Ck larvae inside Myl caterpillars from which Mp had emerged67.\n\nKraaijeveld31 hypothesized that oviposition into sympatric, unsuitable host species by parasitoids could increase survival probability when the ordinary host species is absent, acting as a kleptoparasitoid by exploiting the anti-host immunity of another parasitoid species via multiparasitism. However, successful parasitism of a parasitoid in unsuitable host species when multipatrasitised with a naturally sympatric parasitoid had not been demonstrated previously31,32,42,43,44. Our results present successful parasitism by a wasp in an unsuitable host through multiparasitism with a naturally sympatric parasitoid. Although the parasitism success rate by Ck in Myl caterpillars multiparasitized with Mp (< 20.0% ) was lower than that in the ordinary host Mys (> 70%24,68), oviposition by Ck females in unsuitable host Myl caterpillars is clearly possible. Therefore, as Kraaijeveld31 predicted, oviposition of parasitoid wasps in unsuitable hosts can be adaptive, especially when females cannot find their ordinary hosts. For example, in the case of Ck in Japan, the ordinary host, Mys, cannot overwinter when the average winter temperature falls below 4 \u00b0C, so the Mys population in spring is typically low. However, their numbers increase during summer and autumn due to mass migrations from China (Koyama & Matsumura69 and its references). Under these conditions, temporary use of \u201cnon-host\u201d species like Myl, which occur stably throughout the year, may enhance the reproductive potential of Ck. Given that the parasitism rate of Mp on Myl in the wild can reach 42.9%47, it is likely that multiparasitism with Ck occurs. However, the emergence rate of Ck from Myl in cage experiments (Experiment 6) was extremely low (6%), and currently, there are no records of Ck emerging from Myl in the wild. The frequency of this phenomenon occurring in natural environments is likely extremely low, and further field investigations are required to document this interaction.\n\nPirate parasitism: introducing a new term\n\nOver 100 years ago, Pemberton and Willard43 discovered that the larval parasitoid wasp Tetrastichus giffardianus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), introduced into Hawaii from West Africa70, could use a local, unsuitable host, the Hawaiian fruit fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (= Dacus cucurbitae) (Diptera: Tephritidae), only when the fruit fly larva was previously parasitized by another parasitoid, Psyttalia fletcheri (= Opius fletcheri) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), also introduced to Hawaii from India71. Based on this study, Askew72 called this phenomenon \u201cobligatory multiparasitism\u201d, without providing a definition. On the other hand, today, the term \u201cobligatory multiparasitism\u201d (or obligate multiparasitism) is also used to describe a phenomenon observed in species such as Pseudorhyssa (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) or Eurytoma (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae)73,74. These wasps parasitize insects hidden in hard materials, such as timber or thick cocoons, as their hosts. However, they cannot drill through these materials themselves to reach the hosts. Therefore, these parasitoids attack hosts previously oviposited by another parasitoid by following an oviposition hole in the material created by the previous parasitoid. This behavior is often termed \u201cobligate multiparasitism\u201d73,74. Consequently, the term \u201cobligatory parasitism\u201d currently connotes parasitism that cannot be completed without the help of oviposition by another parasitoid.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we propose a redefinition of the term \u201cobligatory parasitism\u201d and introduce a new term, \u201cpirate parasitism\u201d (Fig. 5). We redefine \u201cobligatory multiparasitism\u201d as kleptoparasitic parasitism by a parasitoid that requires oviposition by another parasitoid species to attack the host and/or complete development in/on the host body post-oviposition. In the latter case, as a subclass of obligatory multiparasitism, we propose a new term, \u201cpirate parasitism\u201d, defined as parasitism by parasitoids that necessitates prior parasitism by another parasitoid species, resulting in complete development through multiparasitism. We also propose referring to parasitoids that require multiparasitism to utilize an \u201cunsuitable host\u201d as \u201cpirate parasitoids.\u201d We call those parasitoid wasps that facilitate pirate parasitoids as \u201cmediators\u201d (Fig. 5).\n\nFig. 5 Pirate parasitism: Introducing a new term. Obligatory multiparasitism refers to kleptoparasitic parasitism by a parasitoid that requires oviposition by another parasitoid species either to (a) reach the host, or (b) complete its development in the host after oviposition. In the latter case, termed \u201cpirate multiparasitism\u201d, parasitism is defined as occurring when a parasitoid necessitates prior or subsequent parasitism by another parasitoid species and can complete its development through multiparasitism. Full size image\n\nIn the case of the host/parasitoid system in our study, C. kariyai is a specialist parasitoid on My. separata, but can utilize My. loreyi through \u201cpirate parasitism\u201d when multiparasitism with Me. pulchricornis occurs. In this case, C. kariyai is the \u201cpirate parasitoid\u201d, and Me. pulchricornis is the \u201cmediator.\u201d Meteorus pulchricornis, suffers a disadvantage due to pirate parasitism. However, there may also be cases of pirate parasitism in which the mediator suffers no disadvantage.\n\nThe ecological and evolutionary significance of the response and oviposition in unsuitable host species\n\nThe concept of pirate parasitism indicates that attraction to, acceptance of, and oviposition by parasitoids on unsuitable host species increases reproductive potential. If parasitoid wasps were only attracted to their customary hosts, their reproductive success would be reduced to zero whenever their usual host was absent. However, with pirate parasitism, parasitoids can oviposit in unsuitable hosts, thereby maintaining some reproductive potential and increasing their fitness. Specialist parasitoid wasps, in particular, are more likely than generalist parasitoids to encounter environments in which their hosts are absent. Therefore, reproducing via pirate parasitism might significantly increase their reproductive potential. This suggests that the seemingly maladaptive behavior of parasitoid wasps ovipositing in non-hosts may actually represent an adaptive behavior. In fact, many species of parasitoids are attracted to and oviposit not only in sympatric unsuitable hosts, but also in introduced unsuitable hosts (Kruitwagen et al.,75 and references).\n\nThe concept of pirate parasitism is also important from the perspective of evolution of parasitoid host ranges. Host shifts and host range expansions of parasitoid wasps have been thought to occur through a process in which wasps accidentally oviposit in unsuitable host that they had not previously used2,37,38,39. If development is successful in unsuitable hosts, newly emerged wasps learn the smell of that new host or its habitat, and subsequently show a preference for oviposition on it. The fact that our research results indicate that oviposition in unsuitable hosts can increase reproductive success implies that such oviposition behavior can serve as preadaptation in the context of host shifts and host range expansions in parasitoid wasps. This could increase the likelihood of the aforementioned \u201chappy accident.\u201d\n\nMultiparasitism is also generally considered maladaptive for parasitoids as it reduces the likelihood of successful parasitism due to direct or indirect competition between parasitoid species76. However, in the case of pirate parasitism, a pirate parasitoid increases its fitness through multiparasitism. This suggests that female pirate parasitoids can identify and preferentially oviposit in unsuitable hosts that have already been parasitized by mediators, but this possibility remains to be verified.\n\nEven though multiparasitism is thought to occur frequently in the field, it is difficult to detect by host collection and rearing because in most cases, only one parasitoid species emerges from the host76. Future studies need to investigate the presence, frequency, and generality of pirate parasitism in parasitoid-host systems by detecting multiparasitism using molecular tools with species-specific primers, as recently used for detection of hyperparasitism77,78 and laboratory multiparasitising experiments.",

            "content": "Caterpillar has introduced a long reach configuration of its 395 excavator.\n\nThe long reach excavator (LRE), also available as a kit, assists operators to make easy work of long-distance applications such as dredging, ditch cleaning, and canal and waterway maintenance.\n\nWith a maximum digging depth of nearly 22 metres, and up to 28 metres of reach at ground level, the 395 LRE fits firmly in the \u2018super long reach\u2019 category and matches its stick and boom configuration with substantial digging force.\n\n\u201cAvailable as a kit, which can be retrofitted to any 395 model, the 395 LRE option provides operators with a boost to the capabilities and reach of a standard 395, bringing its power, speed and fuel efficiency to bear on a whole new range of excavation applications,\u201d said Vincent Migeotte, Caterpillar\u2019s Senior Product and Sales Consultant.\n\n\u201cFully integrated with the standard machine, the 395 LRE kit creates a highly specialized machine that takes in its stride all the challenges of working at distance.\u201d\n\nThe aftermarket kit includes an 11.8 metre stick, a 15.5 metre boom and a CV linkage adapted for the new stick and boom. Boom cylinders form part of the kit, and the specially designed bucket offers a 2 cubic metre capacity.\n\nRecognizing that the super long reach excavator will frequently be used for underwater tasks, the kit also includes fully waterproofed sensor boxes to allow continued operation of the full range of next generation technologies, such as Cat Payload Management System, Cat 2D Grade control system and Cat 2D E-fence. The latter keeps the front linkage within a predefined work area, providing greater operator confidence when working at distance and protecting the machine from damage while improving site safety.\n\n\u201cThe kit\u2019s been designed to cover every operating requirement,\u201d Migeotte said. \u201cSo, another important feature is the ability to equip the machine with high pressure or medium pressure auxiliary lines, with a quick coupler. This allows full use of retrofit hydromechanical work tools, such as a grapple.\u201d\n\nUpgraded undercarriage\n\nCat also upgraded the undercarriage. A car body extension of 1.33 metres provides a boost to stability, while overall ground clearance increases by 85 mm. The configuration also adds 24 cm to the cab position height, providing the operator with more all-round visibility.\n\nAnother nod to stability is in the design of the counterweight. Caterpillar has upped its mass by nearly 40 per cent, but despite the increase to 21.5 tonnes, it sits within the same dimensions, preserving the machine\u2019s tail ratio.\n\n\u201cThe kit also underlines Caterpillar\u2019s commitment to productive, safe worksites, with additional handrails making for safer access and egress, while as-standard rear and side view cameras can be supplemented by a 360-degree option for maximum visibility,\u201d Migeotte said.\n\nIn terms of safety, Migeotte said the addition of the kit preserves all the characteristics of the standard 395, but with added versatility and performance.\n\n\u201cWith the Cat 395 LRE, operators benefit from the same low costs of ownership, low fuel consumption and low maintenance, offering the same attractive return on investment that has become synonymous with any Cat machine,\u201d he said.",

How can you move and sort materials \u2013 waste, scrap, or recycling \u2013 in as little time as possible, with as few moves as possible, using as little fuel as possible, and all without compromising safety or operator comfort? That\u2019s the essential principle of our next gen architecture. Keeping control over operating costs, without sacrificing performance, and it\u2019s those parameters that come to the forefront in the MH3032,\u201d says Vincent Migeotte, Senior product and sales consultant at Caterpillar.\n\nWith a near-15m reach, the MH3032 is available with both drop-nose and straight-stick options for maximum configurability.\n\nAccording to the OEM, typical scrap materials are no challenge for the standard Cat orange-peel grapple with its 1m3 capacity, while a 20kW generator option puts magnet attachments into play for even greater on-site versatility.\n\nEase of operation and optimum productivity are provided by Cat Payload, the built-in technology that allows operators to see how much they are lifting in each load and to constantly monitor tonnage output.\n\nAlso fitted as standard on the MH3032 is Cat 2D E-fence, which keeps the arm within a predefined work area away from the elevated cab, providing greater operator confidence while protecting the machine from damage. This is combined with a new Swing Assist feature which automatically stops the swing motion at an operator-defined preset point.\n\n\u201cTechnologies like these not only help reduce the operator fatigue associated with repetitive tasks but also help improve site safety. Optimised movements also mean incremental improvements to time and fuel consumption,\u201d adds Migeotte.\n\nThe safety theme continues into the dedicated material handler cab, where an in-cab monitor displays dual external camera views to maximise visibility and hazard awareness.\n\nAlthough the MH3032 joins the material handler lineup as a completely new model, it uses proven components common to the rest of the MH3000 Next Generation range.\n\nPower for the MH3032 follows the same principle: its Cat C7.1 engine is one of Caterpillar\u2019s most modular \u2013 and most compact \u2013 power units, meeting US EPA Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V, and Japan 2014 emission standards or emitting equivalent to U.S. EPA Tier 3 and EU Stage IIIA based on regional availability. Deployed in the MH3032, it is coupled with long-life filters, fewer hoses and fewer check points to allow extended maintenance intervals for further operational savings.\n\n\u201cBy meeting the demands of the 30 MT size class head-on, the MH3032 should prove a popular selection in the all-important material handling sector. It\u2019s a fine machine, totally at ease with its next gen credentials, and we\u2019re delighted to see it launch in 2025,\u201d concludes Migeotte.",

            "content": "Thousands of years of Indigenous farming traditions and myths have played a critical role in the survival of cassava, a vital food source for nearly a billion people worldwide, according to a new study. Despite being a clonal crop, meaning it is grown from stem cuttings rather than seeds, the latest findings reveal that cassava has maintained an unexpectedly high level of genetic diversity.\n\nThe research, conducted by a team from the University of Warwick, the Smithsonian Institution, and Embrapa (Brazil\u2019s agricultural research agency), sheds light on how cultural practices have shaped the evolution of cassava. Their findings, published in Science, suggest that Indigenous farmers have actively preserved and enhanced cassava\u2019s genetic diversity, ensuring the crop\u2019s resilience against disease, drought, and poor soil conditions.\n\nA Mysterious Level of Diversity\n\nCassava, also known as yuca or manioc, is primarily grown through clonal propagation, meaning farmers cut stems from an existing plant to grow new ones. Theoretically, this should result in low genetic diversity, making the crop more vulnerable to threats like pests and disease.\n\nHowever, when researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 500 cassava plants\u2014ranging from modern varieties to herbarium and ancient archaeological specimens\u2014they found something surprising: cassava has even more genetic diversity than its wild relatives.\n\nExploring this mysterious level of diversity further, the researchers turned to Indigenous farming practices as a possible solution.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this practice of cloning stem cuttings would keep diversity low since reproducing by seed is a way of reshuffling the genetic deck and folding in new variation,\u201d Dr. Logan Kistler from the Smithsonian Institution, the study\u2019s first author, said in a recent statement. \u201cWe saw the total opposite: cassava has even more diversity than its wild relatives because of how people have prioritized and maintained diverse varieties.\u201d\n\nThe Caterpillar God and Cassava\n\nTo uncover the roots of cassava\u2019s diversity, the research team spoke with Indigenous farmers in Brazil, who described generations-old cultural practices that subtly but powerfully influenced the crop\u2019s evolution.\n\nOne of the most striking examples is the story of Kukurro, a caterpillar god revered by some Indigenous communities. Farmers honor Kukurro by decorating their farming tools and creating special \u201cKukurro houses,\u201d where they plant nearby cassava stems. This encourages sexual reproduction through seeds rather than cloning alone, introducing new genetic variation into the crop.\n\n\u201cStories and myths linked with crops are a strong part of Indigenous cultures,\u201d said Dr. F\u00e1bio de Oliveira Freitas, an Embrapa researcher involved in the study. \u201cThis kind of work shows how some myths can impact crop evolution, why it is so important to support those people and how much we still have to learn.\u201d\n\nBeyond mythology, cassava diversity has also been shaped by the movement of people and plants. Indigenous farmers in different regions trade and exchange cassava cuttings, preventing isolated genetic pockets and promoting widespread genetic mixing. In some cultures, newlywed brides bring cassava cuttings to their husbands\u2019 villages as part of marriage customs, ensuring that diverse cassava varieties continue to spread.\n\nUsing Cassava as an Example for Global Food Security\n\nThe findings highlight the critical role Indigenous knowledge plays in maintaining biodiversity and food security, particularly in challenging environments.\n\n\u201cThis study really shows the importance of small-scale Indigenous farming to our global food security,\u201d said senior author Professor Robin Allaby from the University of Warwick. \u201cUnderstanding these cultural biodiversity practices could help inform future breeding strategies and conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nIn a world facing increasing climate challenges, these age-old traditions, like those used to help the cassava plant, may hold key insights for ensuring the resilience of other vital crops. Scientists and policymakers can work toward a more sustainable and secure food future by recognizing and valuing Indigenous agricultural wisdom.\n\nKenna Hughes-Castleberry is the Science Communicator at JILA (a world-leading physics research institute) and a science writer at The Debrief.

However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nRecent times have been advantageous for Caterpillar as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Is Caterpillar's Growth Trending?\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Caterpillar's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 9.5% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 89% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 4.6% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 11% each year, which is noticeably more attractive.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Caterpillar's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of Caterpillar's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nHaving said that, be aware in our investment analysis, you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

The company described it as \u201ca complete solution that not only automates the truck but also automates the delivery of the water.\u201d It also says the new truck will optimize the complete haul road watering process. Autonomous water trucks help dust suppression on site and enhance productivity by enabling mine operations to digitally track water consumption and reduce waste.\n\n\n\nThe Cat autonomous water truck includes the full support of the Cat dealer and parts network. Combining an automated water delivery system with an autonomous truck \u2013powered by MineStar \u2013 creates a truly automated technology solution that enhances haul road watering safety and efficiency.\n\nCaterpillar has said the 789D will be fully integrated into the mine site\u2019s Cat command autonomous haulage fleet, which will allow it to control haul road dust. The model is also the market\u2019s first commercially available AWT built on the field-proven 789D mining truck chassis. The model also integrates the truck, tank, and Cat water delivery system (WDS), all connected with Cat MineStar technology.\n\nCompany officials mentioned some important new safety features. For instance, the Cat 789D water truck is equipped with the Command for hauling autonomous haulage solution, which makes it possible for the truck to drive among other staffed and autonomous machines, along haul road routes and within active load and dump areas. The model also enhances safety by removing operators from hazardous or remote sites and reduces the number of people required on site. Finally, the Cat water delivery system utilizes automatic start and stop to help eliminate overwatering at road intersections.\n\nMore information is posted on www.Cat.com.",

            "content": "Caterpillar is strengthening its line-up of material handlers with the launch of the Cat Next Generation MH3032 Material Handler.\n\nPositioned to plug the gap between the MH3026 and MH3040, both already on the next generation platform, the new MH3032 calls on the same criteria to deliver performance in a 30 MT technology-driven design.\n\n\u201cMaterial handling is all about efficiency. How can you move and sort materials \u2013 waste, scrap, or recycling \u2013 in as little time as possible, with as few moves as possible, using as little fuel as possible, and all without compromising safety or operator comfort?\u201d said Vincent Migeotte, senior product and sales consultant. \u201cThat\u2019s the essential principle of our next gen architecture: Keeping control over operating costs, without sacrificing performance, and it\u2019s those parameters that come to the forefront in the MH3032.\u201d\n\nWith a near-15-meter reach, the MH3032 is available with both drop-nose and straight-stick options for maximum configurability. Typical scrap materials are no challenge for the standard Cat orange-peel grapple with its 1 m3 capacity, the company says, while a 20 kW generator option puts magnet attachments into play for greater on-site versatility.\n\nEase of operation and optimum productivity are provided by Cat Payload, the built-in technology that allows operators to see how much they\u2019re lifting in each load and to constantly monitor tonnage output. Also fitted as standard on the MH3032 is Cat 2D E-fence, which keeps the arm within a predefined work area away from the elevated cab, providing greater operator confidence while protecting the machine from damage and helping improve site safety. This is combined with a new Swing Assist feature, which automatically stops the swing motion at an operator-defined preset point.\n\n\u201cTechnologies like these not only help reduce the operator fatigue associated with repetitive tasks but also help improve site safety,\u201d added Migeotte. \u201cOptimized movements also mean incremental improvements to time and fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nThe safety theme continues into the dedicated Material Handler cab, where an in-cab monitor displays dual external camera views to maximize visibility and hazard awareness.\n\nProven components\n\nAlthough the MH3032 joins the material handler line-up as a completely new model, it uses proven components common to the rest of the MH3000 Next Generation range. This ensures tried and tested performance, reliability and easy parts availability without operators having to compromise on class or versatility.\n\nPower for the MH3032 follows the same principle: its Cat C7.1 engine is one of Caterpillar\u2019s most modular \u2013 and most compact \u2013 power units, meeting U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V, and Japan 2014 emission standards or emitting equivalent to U.S. EPA Tier 3 and EU Stage IIIA based on regional availability. Deployed in the MH3032, it\u2019s coupled with long-life filters, fewer hoses and fewer check points to allow extended maintenance intervals for further operational savings.\n\n\u201cBy meeting the demands of the 30 MT size class head-on, the MH3032 should prove a popular selection in the all-important material handling sector,\u201d said Migeotte. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine machine, totally at ease with its next gen credentials, and we\u2019re delighted to see it launch in 2025.\u201d\n\nCaterpillar began manufacturing material handlers in 1998 starting with the M318 MH followed by the M320 MH later that year. The first models produced featured the MH Boom and MH Drop Nose Stick, 4-point stabilizer undercarriage, hydraulic or fixed cab riser, a magnet generator, and solid tires. Today, Caterpillar designs and manufactures eight models of material handlers in facilities around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Cat MH30332 Material Handler, contact a Cat dealer or visit: www.cat.com",

The State Department justified the decision by stating that \u201can emergency exists that requires the immediate sale to the Government of Israel of the above defence articles and defence services in the national security interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe DSCA underscored that the deal aligns with US strategic objectives in the region, stating: \u201cThe United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability.\u201d\n\nThe sale, they claim, is expected to enhance Israel\u2019s ability to secure its borders, protect infrastructure, and defend its population centres.\n\nThe agency also added that \u201cthe proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\u201d The bulldozers, known for their use in military engineering and combat support roles, will be incorporated into the Israeli Ground Forces with \u201cno difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.\u201d\n\nCaterpillar Inc., based in Irving, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the deal. The DSCA stated that it is \u201cnot aware of any offset agreement proposed in connection with this potential sale,\u201d though such terms may be negotiated separately.\n\nThe US government has also confirmed that the sale will not require \u201cthe assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Israel,\u201d nor will it impact America\u2019s own defence readiness.\n\nWhile the full breakdown of costs remains subject to final agreements, the DSCA clarified that \u201cthe description and dollar value are for the highest estimated quantity and dollar value based on initial requirements. Actual dollar value will be lower depending on final requirements, budget authority, and signed sales agreement(s), if and when concluded.\u201d",

The manufacturing plant in Athens opened in 2013.\n\nThese big, powerful machines moving dirt for highways and construction projects are a product of the Caterpillar employees, according to Wint.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar cares about their employees and the products reflect it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo be around 100 years \u2212 I think that\u2019s what 100 years teaches you,\u201d Wink said about the emphasis the company places on its employees. The plant in Athens, where Wink is facilities manager, employees about 1,100 people.\n\nThis week Caterpillar sent its Centennial World Tour bus to the Athens plant for employees to visit. The interactive mobile unit provided information on plants worldwide and included a futures room projecting Caterpillar\u2019s role in the future, even what its products might look like when Mars is settled by humankind.\n\nThe company in Athens makes the smaller bulldozers, often used on highway ramp construction, and the smaller version excavators.\n\nAs part of the local celebration, the Caterpillar Foundation donated a $23,000 check to the Athens Area Community Foundation, according to Lisa Miller, a media relations specialist with Caterpillar. Donations will also be made at other Caterpillar cities to charitable organizations, she said.\n\nDuring a tour of the mobile unit, several employees commented on Caterpillar\u2019s impact on their careers, reflective of what Wint had expressed.\n\nApollonia Favors of Athens has worked at the plant for 11 years.\n\n\u201cI came here because I was looking for a career and not a job,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring my time here, I have worked in three different departments, so I have gotten a lot of experience. \u201cI was so excited about the 100th anniversary. It shows the longevity of the company and why I came here for a career.\"\n\nNathan Welch of Athens explained he was in high school when he heard about the plant opening. Later he was working as a machinist for another company when he was hired by Caterpillar about three years ago.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar is helpful in getting to my career goals.

            "content": "The endangered Karner blue butterfly has struggled with habitat loss. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nIf the joy of seeing butterflies seems increasingly rare these days, it isn\u2019t your imagination.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2020, the number of butterflies fell by 22% across the continental United States. That\u2019s 1 in 5 butterflies lost. The findings are from an analysis just published in the journal Science by the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Powell Center Status of Butterflies of the United States Working Group, which I am involved in.\n\nWe found declines in just about every region of the continental U.S. and across almost all butterfly species.\n\nOverall, nearly one-third of the 342 butterfly species we were able to study declined by more than half. Twenty-two species fell by more than 90%. Only nine actually increased in numbers.\n\nSome species\u2019 numbers are dropping faster than others. The West Coast lady, a fairly widespread species across the western U.S., dropped by 80% in 20 years. Given everything we know about its biology, it should be doing fine \u2013 it has a wide range and feeds on a variety of plants. Yet, its numbers are absolutely tanking across its range.\n\nWhy care about butterflies?\n\nButterflies are beautiful. They inspire people, from art to literature and poetry. They deserve to exist simply for the sake of existing. They are also important for ecosystem function.\n\nButterflies are pollinators, picking up pollen on their legs and bodies as they feed on nectar from one flower and carrying it to the next. In their caterpillar stage, they also play an important role as herbivores, keeping plant growth in check.\n\nButterflies can also serve as an indicator species that can warn of threats and trends in other insects. Because humans are fond of butterflies, it\u2019s easy to get volunteers to participate in surveys to count them.\n\nThe annual North American Butterfly Association Fourth of July Count is an example and one we used in the analysis. The same kind of nationwide monitoring by amateur naturalists doesn\u2019t exist for less charismatic insects such as walking sticks.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing butterflies to decline?\n\nButterfly populations can decline for a number of reasons. Habitat loss, insecticides, rising temperatures and drying landscapes can all harm these fragile insects.\n\nA study published in 2024 found that a change in insecticide use was a major factor in driving butterfly declines in the Midwest over 17 years. The authors, many of whom were also part of the current study, noted that the drop coincided with a shift to using seeds with prophylactic insecticides, rather than only spraying crops after an infestation.\n\nThe Southwest saw the greatest drops in butterfly abundance of any region. As that region heats up and dries out, the changing climate may be driving some of the butterfly decline there. Butterflies have a high surface-to-volume ratio \u2013 they don\u2019t hold much moisture \u2013 so they can easily become desiccated in dry conditions. Drought can also harm the plants that butterflies rely on.\n\nOnly the Pacific Northwest didn\u2019t lose butterfly population on average. This trend was largely driven by an irruptive species, meaning one with extremely high abundance in some years \u2013 the California tortoiseshell. When this species was excluded from the analyses, trends in the Pacific Northwest were similar to other regions.\n\nWhen we looked at each species by its historical range, we found something else interesting.\n\nMany species suffered their highest losses at the southern ends of their ranges, while the northern losses generally weren\u2019t as severe. While we could not link drivers to trends directly, the reason for this pattern might involve climate change, or greater exposure to agriculture with insecticides in southern areas, or it may be a combination of many stressors.\n\nThere is hope for populations to recover\n\nSome butterfly species can have multiple generations per year, and depending on the environmental conditions, the number of generations can vary between years.\n\nThis gives me a bit of hope when it comes to butterfly conservation. Because they have such short generation times, even small conservation steps can make a big difference and we can see populations bounce back.\n\nThe Karner blue is an example. It\u2019s a small, endangered butterfly that depends on oak savannas and pine barren ecosystems. These habitats are uncommon and require management, especially prescribed burning, to maintain. With restoration efforts, one Karner blue population in the Albany Pine Bush Preserve in New York rebounded from a few hundred individuals in the early 1990s to thousands of butterflies.\n\nSimilar management and restoration efforts could help other rare and declining butterflies to recover.\n\nWhat you can do to help butterflies recover\n\nThe magnitude and rate of biodiversity loss in the world right now can make one feel helpless. But while national and international efforts are needed to address the crisis, you can also take small actions that can have quick benefits, starting in your own backyard.\n\nButterflies love wildflowers, and planting native wildflowers can benefit many butterfly species. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has guides recommending which native species are best to plant in which parts of the country. Letting grass grow can help, even if it\u2019s just a strip of grass and wildflowers a couple of feet wide at the back of the yard.\n\nSupporting policies that benefit conservation can also help. In some states, insects aren\u2019t considered wildlife, so state wildlife agencies have their hands tied when it comes to working on butterfly conservation. But those laws could be changed.\n\nThe federal Endangered Species Act can also help. The law mandates that the government maintain habitat for listed species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in December 2024 recommended listing the monarch butterfly as a threatened species. With the new study, we now have population trends for more than half of all U.S. butterfly species, including many that likely should be considered for listing.\n\nWith so many species needing help, it can be difficult to know where to start. But the new data can help concentrate conservation efforts on those species at the highest risk.\n\nI believe this study should be a wake-up call about the need to better protect butterflies and other insects \u2013 \u201cthe little things that run the world.\u201d\n\nEliza Grames, Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences, Binghamton University, State University of New York\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

            "content": "Eliza 'Betsy' Jumel a Rhode Island rags to riches story | Opinion\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption URI labor historian Scott Molloy Bus driver turned labor historian, Scott Molloy and his collection of labor history materials at the URI Library.\n\nEliza Jumel (n\u00e9e Elizabeth Bowen) was born in Providence on April 2, 1775, the daughter of Phebe Kelly and John Bowen, a sailor. After her parents separated, Phebe lived in poverty. To survive she worked in a mixed-race brothel in which her two young daughters, Betsy and Mary, were raised.\n\nIn 1785, when the Town Council closed Phebe\u2019s \u201cdisorderly house,\u201d Betsy and her sister were sent to the \u201cworkhouse\u201d directed by the Overseers of the Poor. Eventually Betsy was indentured to the family of sea captain Samuel Allen, and Phebe died of yellow fever during the great Providence epidemic of 1798.\n\nIn the ensuring years, Elizabeth \u201cBetsy\u201d Bowen would burst out of poverty and transform herself from a lowly caterpillar into a prominent social butterfly known to New Yorkers as Madam Eliza Jumel. In that role she has become the heroine of a fascinating biography by Margaret Oppenheimer, appropriately titled \"The Remarkable Rise of Eliza Jumel: A Story of Marriage and Money in the Early Republic\" (2015).\n\nIn 1803, 28-year-old Betsy moved from Providence to New York City and changed her name to Eliza Brown to put her past behind her by assuming a prominent Providence surname. She lost no time. By April 1804 she had met and married Stephen Jumel, a wealthy French merchant headquartered in New York City who was 10 years her senior. In 1810, the couple acquired a mansion with sweeping views of the Harlem River. It had been built by Col. Roger Morris and served as George Washington\u2019s headquarters in September 1776 during his New York Campaign. Today, the well-preserved Morris-Jumel Mansion is a museum.\n\nDuring the 28 years of Eliza\u2019s marriage to Stephen, ending in May 1832 with his death in a carriage accident, the couple had no children, but they raised Eliza\u2019s niece, Mary. The marriage was not smooth sailing and was punctuated by Stephen\u2019s frequent business trips to France and elsewhere.\n\nThe union, though turbulent, was not without its pleasant trips to Europe and the American South. The couple also acquired an elegant summer home in fashionable Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\nAfter Stephen\u2019s death, his wealthy widow was courted by the notorious Aaron Burr, the former U.S. vice president who had killed Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel. Eliza, seeking to preserve her social standing, married Burr on July 1, 1833, less than 14 months after Stephen\u2019s fatal accident. At that time, she was 58 years of age. The marriage of mutual convenience was terminated on July 8, 1836, on the basis of Burr\u2019s alleged adultery, in an acrimonious divorce proceeding. Thereafter, Eliza acted out her role in New York society as one of the city\u2019s richest women in her own right. She died at her mansion on July 16, 1865, at the age of 90.\n\nEven in death, she did not relinquish the spotlight. A feud among her heirs and bogus claimants to her estate lasted for decades and litigation concerning it reached the U.S. Supreme Court twice. However, the battle tarnished her reputation and revealed her humble origins.\n\nEliza\u2019s biographer, Margaret A. Oppenheimer, has offered the best summation for the life of the complex and resourceful woman: \u201cAlthough Eliza was in some ways a difficult woman, her determination, intelligence, and strength of character were what allowed her to survive and thrive in spite of the disadvantages of her youth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oppenheimer, \u201cher contemporaries would have been less disturbed by her ascent into the upper class had she been a more conventional \u2018womanly\u2019 woman \u2012 a lady who hid her emotions and ambitions beneath a veneer of delicacy, gentleness, and charm.\u201d That was not a fa\u00e7ade Eliza could maintain for long. But on her own terms, she achieved much: financial security, a certain social status, a landed estate, and a surviving, elegant home. She rose far above the social class to which she was born.\n\nIn 2020, Madam Jumel was elected into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame, an award now displayed in her New York museum.\n\nPatrick T. Conley is president emeritus of the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.",

But what can investors expect for the year ahead for this member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index? Does it make sense to follow the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and buy the stock? Here's what you need to know.\n\nCaterpillar's cyclicality\n\nAs always with Caterpillar, investors should be mindful that it's a cyclical company, so its sales tend to oscillate according to a trend. Its main end markets are construction, resource industries (encompassing mining machinery and aggregate machinery), and energy and transportation (oil and gas equipment, power generation equipment, transportation, and industrial machinery).\n\nMany of these end markets have been in good health in recent years, with commercial construction solid, infrastructure spending receiving bipartisan support, and mining and energy equipment supported by good commodity prices, encouraging capital investment. In addition, a newfound discipline among energy and mining companies encourages the view that capital spending in those industries is set for a long, moderately growing supercycle, rather than the boom and bust of previous decades.\n\nCaterpillar's management acknowledges the cyclicality and outlines financial targets with it in mind. For example, in the current year, management estimates that its machine, energy, and transportation (ME&T) free cash flow from trough to peak will range from $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nWith this in mind, there are three factors that investors need to consider before buying Caterpillar stock.\n\n1. Caterpillar's valuation\n\nBased on management's estimates, Caterpillar appears to be at the top of the cycle in terms of FCF. The chart below shows the evolution of its FCF, and management's guidance for 2025 FCF is a figure in the \"top half\" of its annual target range -- in other words, a figure between $7.5 billion and $10 billion.\n\nIt would be simple to put in the midpoint of the 2025 guidance ($8.75 billion), multiply it by 20 (a typical price-to-FCF multiple), and get a target market cap for Caterpillar of $175 billion. That figure suggests a 6.5% upside potential from the current market cap.\n\nHowever, suppose this is the top of Caterpillar's cycle. In that case, it makes sense to be cautious and price the stock at the midpoint of the $5 billion to $10 billion cyclical range, meaning $7.6 billion in FCF and $150 billion market cap, again assuming a 20 times FCF multiple.\n\n2. Caterpillar's services growth\n\nThere are a couple of other reasons to be cautious about Caterpillar. The first comes from its services growth. Caterpillar generated $64.8 billion in sales in 2024, of which $24 billion came from services -- a 4% increase from 2023.\n\nServices are essential to Caterpillar; they help reduce the cyclicality of its earnings (services are more sticky in a weak economic environment), create a margin expansion opportunity for the company, and offer a long-term income stream.\n\nThey are a key part of management's growth plans, which aim to double services revenue from $14 billion in 2016 to $28 billion in 2026.\n\nWith $24 billion in services revenue in 2024, Caterpillar needs to grow services revenue by 8% a year through 2026 to hit its target. That looks like a tall order, given that management expects its total sales to be slightly lower in 2025 than in 2024. Indeed, it's noticeable that CEO Jim Umpleby referred to the target as \"aspirational\" on the recent earnings call.\n\n3. Caterpillar can't rely on price realization\n\nPrice realization is the ability to achieve a product's listed selling price. Not all products sell at the selling price, partly due to promotions or discounts. The best way to think about it is to consider that a positive trend in price realization indicates more substantial pricing power and vice versa.\n\nGoing into 2024, Caterpillar's growth in price realization (which drops straight into profits) was more than offsetting sales volume declines, but as you can see in the chart, that's no longer the case. In fact, price realization turned negative in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThis suggests Caterpillar's pricing environment is weakening, and pricing is catching up with year-over-year sales volume declines.\n\nA stock to buy?\n\nCaterpillar doesn't look like an outstanding value stock right now. That might change if the economy enters a supercycle for commodities (Caterpillar has exposure to mining and energy and the infrastructure needed to harness it) or if the impressive improvement in FCF in recent years is structural.\n\nHowever, given the trend in price realization, service revenue growth, and sales volumes, Caterpillar has likely already passed the peak in the current cycle. It's one for the watch list for now, and it looks like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust has already made easy money on the stock.",

            "content": "Paul Richard Simmons passed peacefully, surrounded by family, on February 27, 2025, at the age of 85. He was welcomed into eternity just seven months after the passing of his beloved wife, Patricia Ann Simmons, his partner in life and love for over six decades. Paul was born on March 18, 1939, in Yuma, Ariz., alongside his twin sister, Patricia, to parents Maude and Al Simmons. He was the youngest of ten children and the third set of twins his mother lovingly brought into the world. In 1956, Paul answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, a duty he carried out with great pride. Following his service, he moved to Riverside, Calif., where he met the love of his life, Patricia. The two were married on June 22, 1958, and together, they built a beautiful family, raising three children: Richard Alan, Sherry Lynn, and Pamela Gail. Paul was a devoted grandfather to five grandchildren: Sarah, Jeremiah, Danielle, Anthony, and Christopher; and a proud great-grandfather to ten: Lily, Katy Beth, Arden West, Lucas, Norabelle, Kruz Alan, Abbott Grey, Rory Lee, August Rey, and Olive Willow. His legacy extended even further with the blessing of one great-great-grandchild, LoreLei. In 1992, Paul and Patricia made the life-changing decision to move from San Marcos, Calif., to Springdale, Ark., bringing with them their three adult children, their spouses, and grandchildren. Their unwavering commitment to family was a testament to the love and loyalty that bound them together, an extraordinary example of Agape love. Paul was a man of deep faith, who loved Jesus with all his heart. A natural leader, he pastored and preached many services, officiating weddings and funerals for those dear to him. He lived by the values he instilled in his family: work hard, pray harder. A skilled general contractor, Paul built many homes, including the one he and Patricia cherished for over 32 years. He had a passion for heavy equipment, particularly his Caterpillar D8 dozer, and was never one to sit still; always working, tinkering, and fixing something. His hands were rarely idle, and his work ethic was unmatched. On Sundays, Paul could always be found dressed to the nines in a suit, ready to worship. In his free time, he found joy in square dancing and bowling, hobbies he shared with Patricia and friends. Paul's family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the staff at The Bungalows Assisted Living and Circle of Life Hospice, both in Springdale, Ark., for their compassionate care during his final days. A celebration of Paul's life will be held on his birthday, March 18, 2025, at 12:30 p.m., at Springdale First Assembly Church, where loved ones will gather to honor his memory and the incredible life he lived. Burial will follow at Fayetteville National Cemetery. Rest in peace, Grandpa. You were the pillar of our family, the foundation upon which we stood. Your love, wisdom, and unwavering faith will live on in our hearts forever. Online condolences may be left at: www.siscofuneral.com.",

The manufacturing plant in Athens opened in 2013.\n\nThese big, powerful machines moving dirt for highways and construction projects are a product of the Caterpillar employees, according to Wint.\n\n\u201cCaterpillar cares about their employees and the products reflect it,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal Business: Downs Preschool Academy under new ownership\n\n\u201cTo be around 100 years \u2212 I think that\u2019s what 100 years teaches you,\u201d Wink said about the emphasis the company places on its employees. The plant in Athens, where Wink is facilities manager, employees about 1,100 people.\n\nThis week Caterpillar sent its Centennial World Tour bus to the Athens plant for employees to visit. The interactive mobile unit provided information on plants worldwide and included a futures room projecting Caterpillar\u2019s role in the future, even what its products might look like when Mars is settled by humankind.\n\nThe company in Athens makes the smaller bulldozers, often used on highway ramp construction, and the smaller version excavators.\n\nAs part of the local celebration, the Caterpillar Foundation donated a $23,000 check to the Athens Area Community Foundation, according to Lisa Miller, a media relations specialist with Caterpillar. Donations will also be made at other Caterpillar cities to charitable organizations, she said.\n\nDuring a tour of the mobile unit, several employees commented on Caterpillar\u2019s impact on their careers, reflective of what Wint had expressed.\n\nApollonia Favors of Athens has worked at the plant for 11 years.\n\n\u201cI came here because I was looking for a career and not a job,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring my time here, I have worked in three different departments, so I have gotten a lot of experience. \u201cI was so excited about the 100th anniversary. It shows the longevity of the company and why I came here for a career.\"\n\nNathan Welch of Athens explained he was in high school when he heard about the plant opening.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: University of Warwick\n\nA research collaboration between The University of Warwick, the Smithsonian Institution and Embrapa (Brazilian agricultural research), has shown that thousands of years of farming myths and cultural traditions have been key to the survival of the cassava crop (the source of tapioca).\n\nCassava (also called Yuca or Manioc) is a root vegetable that feeds around a billion people worldwide. It thrives in poor soil, drought conditions and pest-prone environments, making it an essential crop in difficult climates. It is grown worldwide via stem cuttings, a method that produces new cassava plants that are genetic clones of the original. Clonal planting is expected to result in low genetic diversity, which leads to plants becoming vulnerable to diseases.\n\nIn the article published in Science, analysis of the genomes of more than 500 modern, herbarium and archaeological cassava plants found the cassava genome to be extraordinarily diverse for a clonal crop.\n\nTo understand how this genetic diversity arose, researchers looked to Indigenous Brazilian farmers for answers. Through interviews, they found that local cultural practices and traditions have been responsible for creating and maintaining the varied cassava gene pool.\n\nSenior author of this paper, Professor Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick, said, \"This study really shows the importance of small-scale Indigenous farming to our global food security.\"\n\nCredit: University of Warwick\n\nFor example, Indigenous farmers discussed their belief in Kukurro, the caterpillar god with whom they decorate their farming implements. In Kukurro's honor, farmers occasionally plant stems of high-yielding and resilient cassava plants in close proximity in special \"Kukurro houses.\" This enables seed-based sexual reproduction, resulting in \"cassava from the sky,\" rescuing genetic diversity to the system.\n\nDr. Logan Kistler from the Smithsonian Institution and first author, said, \"We wondered if this practice of cloning stem cuttings would keep diversity low, since reproducing by seed is a way of reshuffling the genetic deck and folding in new variation. We saw the total opposite: cassava has even more diversity than its wild relatives because of how people have prioritized and maintained diverse varieties.\"\n\nSimilar patterns of cassava diversity were found across the different areas of the Amazon region and Caribbean; this is unusual as regional genetic variation is common in widespread crops. This was explained by the farmers' reports of exchanging and trading cuttings of different cassava varieties, resulting in regional distribution of resilient and diverse crops.\n\nThis cultural practice is so ingrained that, as part of the marriage custom of the Brazilian Waur\u00e1 people, new brides bring Cassava cuttings to their husband's village.\n\nDr. F\u00e1bio de Oliveira Freitas, EMBRAPA researcher, said, \"Stories and myths linked with crops are a strong part of Indigenous cultures. This kind of work shows how some myths can impact crop evolution, why it is so important to support those people and how much we still have to learn.\"\n\nDeveloping our understanding of these Indigenous biodiversity practices could inform future breeding strategies, and bolster efforts in crop conservation and food security in difficult environments.\n\nMore information: Logan Kistler et al, Historic manioc genomes illuminate maintenance of diversity under long-lived clonal cultivation, Science (2025).

But those big tractors were heavy. In the rich, moist soil along the San Joaquin River Delta, they would get stuck in the mud or compact the soil. Enter two men \u2013 Benjamin Holt and C.L. Best. Today on KVPR\u2019s Central Valley Roots, we learn how they teamed up to create one of the largest corporations in the U.S.\n\nHolt and Best had a complicated relationship and rivalry. Both headed farm machinery companies, with Holt based in Stockton and Best based in San Leandro. In 1904, Holt developed the first viable tractor that was propelled by tracks instead of wheels. Best\u2019s father David owned critical patents for tractor technology, and in 1908 Holt bought David Best\u2019s company.\n\nThe younger C.L. Best quickly setup a new firm and began making his own crawlers. Best called his tractor the Tracklayer, while Holt called his The Caterpillar. Best\u2019s company specialized in serving the agricultural market while Holt secured government contracts in World War I and specialized in larger machines. Along the way, his crawlers helped inspire the development of the military tanks.\n\nThe end of World War I brought with it a recession and the end of a lucrative line of business for Holt\u2019s company. In 1925 Holt and C. L. Best merged to form the Caterpillar Corporation\u2026born here in the San Joaquin Valley, and now the world\u2019s largest builder of construction equipment.\n\n",

            "content": "Have you ever heard of the southern flannel moth (Megalopyge opercularis)? Maybe you've seen one but didn't know what it was. It has a very distinctive, fluffy look (even its wings are covered with silk hairs). If you ever come across one, you definitely won't miss it\u2014but you should definitely avoid it.\n\nThe southern flannel moth caterpillar is the unique looking larval form, and it goes by many names: puss moth caterpillar, tree asp, and woolly slug. More important than its varied nomenclature is the fact that the larval, or caterpillar, form is also super venomous. In fact, it is one of the most dangerous caterpillars in the United States. We'll tell you how to watch out for this perilous caterpillar and what to do if you come across one.\n\nNature's Images/Getty Images\n\nHow To Identify Flannel Moth Caterpillars\n\nThe 1- to 1 1/2-inch long caterpillars are covered in long, hairlike setae. These setae have the appearance of animal fur, which is why many say the caterpillars resemble Persian cats. Similar to cats, the colors of the caterpillars may vary from grayish white to golden light brown with bright orange streaks to dusty charcoal gray. According to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Services (IFAS) Extension, during its earliest stages, the caterpillar is yellow and has fewer hairs. With each molt, the caterpillar gets hairier and more muted in color. The \"fur\" is sometimes extremely curly, making the larva look even fluffier.\n\nTheir light yellow eggs are slightly rounded and laid in clusters on leaves. They may look like a speck of dust. Since they have a similar appearance to other moth eggs, they can be hard to distinguish without considering the plant they are found on.\n\nWhere Do Flannel Moth Caterpillars Live?\n\nFlannel moths have been known to feed on many trees and shrubs, like elms, maples, hackberries, hollies, oaks, and sycamores, according to the NC State Extension. They are commonly spotted in oak and elm trees. Since these plants are frequently found in parks, gardens, and backyards, children are most likely to come in contact with the caterpillars. Make sure you teach children about these caterpillars and warn them not to touch them. Basically, if you see a caterpillar wrapped in a stylish fur coat and munching on a tree, shrub, or anything else, it's best to keep your distance.\n\nSouthern flannel moth caterpillars are widespread in the United States and can commonly be found on the East Coast in states stretching from New Jersey to Florida. They can also be found as far west as Texas and Arkansas, and also in the desert southwest.\n\nHow Dangerous Are Flannel Moth Caterpillars?\n\nGiven their appearance and resemblance to soft, fluffy pets, it's easy to understand why people would want to touch the southern flannel moth caterpillar. Unfortunately, the \"fur\" is nothing like a cuddly, feline friend. It actually contains venomous spines to protect it from predators. Coming into contact with these spines will cause extremely painful reactions in the skin. Caterpillars that are more advanced in the larval stage have the most potent defense.\n\nThe southern flannel moth caterpillar made the news because a 5-year-old child in Texas was stung by one while playing outside at daycare. According to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth, the child was hospitalized after the caterpillar's spines stuck in her arm which led to pain and swelling. Her teachers removed the spines using tape, which was quick thinking, as it is best to treat a sting from the venomous spines within the first few hours. According to the girl's mother, Lauren Chambers, \"They said if that had not happened it could actually cause her whole body to go numb and start shutting down.\"\n\nIs The Adult Moth Harmful?\n\nThe adult southern flannel moth is harmless on its own. The moth is covered in lengthy fuzz\u2014not venomous spines\u2014with colors ranging from a dull orange to a bright lemon yellow, and its fuzzy feet are always black. Though the adult moths do not sting, if they are seen in an area, it is safe and best to assume that the more dangerous larvae are nearby or will soon be born.\n\nWhat To Do If You Are Stung\n\nThe extreme pain-inducing spines are a form of defense meant to protect the caterpillars until they turn into moths and the venomous spines disappear. The slightest amount of contact, even merely brushing past them, will cause the spines to break off the caterpillar and inject venom into the skin. Sometimes, the spines become deeply embedded in the skin and they need to be removed.\n\nIf you are stung, wash the area to remove hairs and toxins that may be on the surface of the skin. Use strips of cellophane tape to remove any hairs in skin and repeat until you have gotten them out. Tweezers may also help. Apply an ice pack to reduce swelling and hydrocortisone can relieve any itching. As with other stings, a paste of baking soda and water can help alleviate any discomfort.\n\nThe pain from the southern flannel moth caterpillar sting has been described in several different, but all excruciating ways\u2014a white-hot or knife-like sensation, a pain you can feel in your bones, or even a snake bite\u2014hence why some call these caterpillars \"asps\" (a venomous snake species).\n\nIn the best-case scenario, reactions to the sting are localized to the affected area. However, what happens more often is that the pain radiates throughout the entire limb and eventually the entire body. It can cause burning, swelling, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, and bumps or marks on the skin. In cases of a severe allergic reaction, some people experience difficulty breathing or even anaphylaxis. Home remedies for mild cases include ice packs, antihistamines, baking soda paste, hydrocortisone cream, and calamine lotion. Emergency medical attention should be sought in cases of extreme reactions.",

They participated in classroom discussions over Zoom, completed virtual lab work and mastered critical skills in relative isolation from behind a computer screen. Now, as they enter the workforce as interns or full-time employees, many of them are prioritizing onsite roles where they can receive intensive, hands-on training and build meaningful connections with peers and mentors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was Griffin Peters\u2019 experience when he interned with Caterpillar, the world\u2019s leading construction and mining manufacturer, at the company\u2019s global headquarters in Irving. Virtual education experiences had shaped his perspective about the internships he\u2019d take on in college \u2014 and the future of his career as a whole. \u201cAfter being with all my classmates on Zoom calls, I did not want to enter a job where I could only meet people through a screen,\u201d he says. When Peters moved from his home state of Indiana to Texas during the summer before his senior year of college, he found purpose and meaning in his career as he worked alongside other interns and learned from mentors at Caterpillar. As a member of the company\u2019s IT team, he handled tasks like developing code to automate data visualization. The program was a stark contrast to his previous, fully remote internship with a different company. \u201cI have a much different motivation when I feel alone versus when I\u2019m working with other people,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s Early Talent corporate internship is a 12-week, paid internship designed for undergraduate students and graduate students to explore potential career paths within the Caterpillar network. Students learn real-world skills and solve legitimate business challenges, often with lasting impact. For example, some of the code Peters worked on as an intern is still in use today. Now a full-time employee, he has continued to update and improve upon it with new data.\n\nFWD>DFW Making a difference in North Texas is our \"why.\" SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s investment in its internship program is an investment in its talent pipeline. Prospective interns are sometimes courted up to nearly a year in advance of the program, sometimes at college fairs and, often, as returning interns. Pay is based on the number of credit hours a student has obtained, and it\u2019s supplemented with housing and travel stipends.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s innovative Early Talent corporate internship provides invaluable experience to interns, with many going on to become full-time employees. (Courtesy Caterpillar)\n\nTaking care of essential needs like housing and travel costs enables interns to enjoy and explore the cities where they live for the summer, says Cedric Garron, a talent acquisition partner at Caterpillar. \u201cWe want to take care of that, so that the money you do get you can put back into Dallas,\u201d he says. And, in this way, Caterpillar contributes to the influx of talent headed to North Texas for jobs, as it provides young professionals not only with career experience but with an experience of the culture and community. The program even goes so far as to connect interns with a group of leaders who cultivate engagement in the city of Dallas. \u201cOur hope is that, at the end of their internship, they will convert to full time, or that they will take a return internship, come back, spend another summer in Texas and just fall in love with it,\u201d says Garron.\n\nMore than half of Early Talent internship participants do convert to full-time employees. When Peters finished the summer program, he stayed on as a part-time intern for the duration of his senior year of college and then was hired as a full-time employee at the global headquarters in Irving shortly after graduation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne unique facet of the Early Talent corporate internship is the intern presentation. Interns pick from a set of business challenges to solve, work together as a group and present their solutions to Caterpillar\u2019s executive team, which gives them face time with experienced leaders.\n\n\u201cDesigning an internship program that way, where interns get that level of exposure and networking, makes it clear from the start that the company cares for the people who work for them,\u201d says Dalton Reed, another former summer intern who later became a full-time Caterpillar employee.\n\nReed acknowledges that interns are often still sorting out what they want in a career, and the program enabled him to learn firsthand about potential career opportunities throughout the company. He says team members had an \u201copen door policy,\u201d and he found the work environment collaborative. Getting mentorship this early in his career helped him grow. \u201cI think I learned more in two months than I did in multiple years of college,\u201d says Reed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more than 110,000 employees across the world and numerous business divisions, Caterpillar\u2019s infrastructure supports the career development that many young professionals crave by enabling them to discover different prospective vocations.

Keeping control over operating costs, without sacrificing performance, and it\u2019s those parameters that come to the forefront in the MH3032.\u201d\n\nWith a near-15 metres of reach, the MH3032 is available in both drop-nose and straight-stick configurations. Typical scrap materials are no challenge for the standard Cat orange-peel grapple with its 1 cubic metre capacity, while a 20 kW generator option enables magnet attachments for even greater on-site versatility.\n\nMaterial handler tech\n\nEase of operation and optimum productivity are provided by Cat Payload, the built-in technology that allows operators to see how much they\u2019re lifting in each load and to constantly monitor tonnage output.\n\nAlso fitted as standard on the MH3032 is Cat 2D E-fence, which keeps the arm within a predefined work area away from the elevated cab, providing greater operator confidence while protecting the machine from damage and helping improve site safety. This is combined with a new Swing Assist feature, which automatically stops the swing motion at an operator-defined preset point.\n\n\u201cTechnologies like these not only help reduce the operator fatigue associated with repetitive tasks but also help improve site safety,\u201d Migeotte said. \u201cOptimized movements also mean incremental improvements to time and fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nThe safety theme continues into the dedicated material handler cab, where an in-cab monitor displays dual external camera views to maximize visibility and hazard awareness.\n\nProven components\n\nAlthough the MH3032 joins the material handler line-up as a completely new model, it uses proven components common to the rest of the MH3000 next generation range. This assures tried and tested performance, reliability and easy parts availability without operators having to compromise on class or versatility.\n\nThe MH3032 fis powered by the Cat C7.1 engine, one of Caterpillar\u2019s most modular and most compact power units, meeting Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V, and Japan 2014 emission standards.\n\nDeployed in the MH3032, it\u2019s coupled with long-life filters, fewer hoses and fewer check points to allow extended maintenance intervals for further operational savings.\n\n\u201cBy meeting the demands of the 30 MT size class head-on, the MH3032 should prove a popular selection in the all-important material handling sector,\u201d Migeotte said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine machine, totally at ease with its next gen credentials, and we\u2019re delighted to see it launch in 2025.\u201d",

            "content": "While necessary for dust control, driving a water truck across mine site haul roads is a repetitive task that lends itself to automation and autonomy. As such, Caterpillar has launched what it said is the first commercially available autonomous water truck (AWT), based on the 789D mining truck chassis integrated with the truck, tank and Cat Water Delivery System (WDS) and connected with Cat MineStar technology.\n\nThe autonomous water truck is based on a 789D mining truck chassis integrated with the truck, tank and Cat Water Delivery System (WDS) and connected with Cat MineStar technology. (Photo: Caterpillar)\n\nThe 789D is the largest model in the company\u2019s water truck product offering and can accommodate up to 165,000 liters (43,588 gal.), depending on tank configuration. The WDS varies waterflow based on truck speed and automatically determines the correct amount of water needed to control dust. The AWT in turn senses when the water tank is running low and can be programmed to integrate with the water refill station to fully automate the water refill process. The auto shutoff feature prevents tank overfilling.\n\nFeaturing Command for hauling, the 789D AWT complies with watering plans and seamlessly interacts with other autonomous equipment, the company stated. It also integrates with customer mining processes and systems managed by MineStar.\n\nThe Cat Water Delivery System varies waterflow based on truck speed and automatically determines the correct amount of water needed to control dust. (Photo: Caterpillar)\n\n\u201cTo meet customer requirements for dust control, Caterpillar implemented a MineStar-integrated watering model based on many years of site watering studies and Cat WDS performance data,\u201d said Corey Wurtzbacher, general manager and vice president, Technology and Global Sales Support at Caterpillar. \u201cThis model allows the truck to monitor traffic, weather and road conditions, prioritize what areas need watered, when the areas need watered and how many passes it should take to apply the correct amount of water saturation for the given conditions.\u201d\n\nIf a site is not yet ready for a fully autonomous water truck, MineStar has cloud-based solutions that will work in the interim and allow customers to utilize, track and measure the productivity of the 789D before it is put into autonomous operation.\n\nMines have the option to quickly switch the 789D AWT from autonomous mode to staffed mode as necessary for tasks such as front water cannon operation. Even with staffed operation, Auto Mode water delivery automates the watering process. The water truck can be integrated into the MineStar ecosystem once a site is ready for full autonomous mode.",

He startedCaterpillars Count!, a citizen science project that measures the seasonal variation of arthropods like caterpillars on trees and shrub foliage. At more than 150 sites across North America, anyone interested can conduct branch surveys, collect data and submit their findings.\n\nHurlbert said monarchs differ from most butterflies due to their migratory nature.\n\nMonarch butterflies found in North America fall into two populations \u2014 eastern and western.\n\nPopulations found to the east of the Rocky Mountains undergo a multigenerational migration from Mexico to as far north as Canada and back again over the course of the year.\n\nA smaller monarch population lives west of the Rockies throughout the Northwest and Southwest and only migrates as far as Southern California during winter.\n\nEastern monarchs heading to Mexico pass through the North Carolina mountains during their fall journey south.\n\nHurlbert attributes the monarch\u2019s decline to several factors.\n\nHabitat loss\n\nDeforestation can impact the monarch population.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really susceptible to habitat loss in these very special areas where monarchs just literally drape the trees by the thousands and thousands, or even millions in some cases,\u201d said Hurlbert.\n\nHurlbert said the butterflies are also vulnerable because their caterpillars and larvae are specialists, meaning they can only feed and grow on milkweed plants, while many other butterflies are generalists and feed on different types of leaves.\n\nHistorically, milkweed was found on the edges of agricultural fields or on roadsides, but that is changing.\n\n\u201cWith the advent of genetically modified crops, farmers can broadly apply herbicide to kill all the weeds, knowing their crop is resistant, so there\u2019s a lot less milkweed in those agricultural lands than there used to be,\u201d said Hurlbert.\n\nWeather events and climate change\n\nHurlbert said small, localized and short-duration weather events, like an intense storm or an ill-timed cold front or heat wave, could potentially take out a large percentage of the monarch population if it happened where many butterflies were gathered.\n\nThroughout history, there have always been heat waves, cold fronts and storms, but increased frequency of these weather events can contribute to species decline and is directly tied to climate change.\n\n\u201cClimate change is shifting the timing and availability of conditions under which monarchs thrive,\u201d said Hurlbert. \u201cAlso, it may be upsetting the seasonal timing or the synchrony between monarchs and the plants that they use.\u201d\n\nHurlbert noted milkweed as an example, saying if the timing of plant growth shifts and monarchs arrive at a place where milkweed hasn\u2019t popped up yet, they will be unable to lay their eggs.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nHurlbert said the unfortunate news of the monarch\u2019s new endangered status isn\u2019t surprising, but a widely admired species being threatened may propel people into action.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is the attention being drawn to these declines. The monarch butterfly is certainly not the only species that\u2019s been undergoing large-scale declines over the last several decades. But it\u2019s a very iconic one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt raises eyebrows; it raises people\u2019s concern level. Ideally, it brings attention to this broader problem of ecosystem health and species declines in general.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public can aid the monarch population by growing milkweed, avoiding the use of pesticides and participating in community caterpillar monitoring and reporting.\n\nPlanting milkweed\n\nThe North Carolina Botanical Garden manages several natural areas in and out of Chapel Hill, some with naturally occurring populations of milkweed, said Daniel Stern, director of horticulture at the North Carolina Botanical Garden.\n\nMilkweed leaves are critical to the monarch caterpillar\u2019s exclusive diet, Stern said. And once flowered, the plant supports a wide variety of pollinators.\n\n\u201cPeople planting more milkweed is going to support more insect life, which then supports all order of animal life above that.\u201d\n\nStern said the most common types of milkweed in the area are:\n\nButterfly milkweed ( Asclepias tuberosa ) \u2014 orange or yellow low-growing herbaceous perennial that tolerates dry, sandy soils.\n\nSwamp milkweed ( Asclepias incarnata) \u2014 taller, narrower plant with pink or light purple flowers that tolerates moist sites and heavy soils.\n\nCommon milkweed ( Asclepias syriaca ) \u2014 great host plant, can be aggressive in small garden spaces but a great for a natural meadow or open area.\n\nStern said he\u2019d recommend planting in the fall because it\u2019s easier for plants to becomeestablished rather than the spring when it heats up quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to plant from the seed, Stern said to sow them in a plastic pot, water gently and allow to drain for at least 12 hours. Next, place the pot in a sealed plastic bag and store in the refrigerator for six to eight weeks. After taking them out of the fridge, remove the plastic bag and place them in a warm, bright spot protected from digging animals and direct rain. After germination, separate the seedlings into individual pots and let them grow for the remainder of the season before transplanting to the garden.\n\nAnother option would be to buy whole plants and put those in the ground before and during early fall.\n\nOn Sept. 24, two days after the season\u2019s official start, the Botanical Garden will host its annualFall Plant Sale. Native wildflower seeds, shrubs, trees, vines and ferns will be available for purchase, along with milkweed, one of the most popular offerings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that we sell out of most quickly,\u201d said Stern.\n\nGrowing milkweed in your yard, taking hikes to check leaves for caterpillars and using the monarch\u2019s example to raise awareness of species declines are all ways you can contribute to \u201cthe great power of citizen science,\u201d Hurlbert said. Thousands of people across the continent have the potential to gather more information than any one scientist could on their own.",

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nLet's discuss what to do with shares of Caterpillar.\n\nThe case to buy or hold Caterpillar stock\n\nCaterpillar is recognized as the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, renowned for its iconic yellow heavy-duty machinery. The company's products, including excavators, giant trucks, specialized engines, and industrial power systems, are considered essential in multiple industries and have a well-deserved reputation for durability.\n\nA long history of innovation has continued with a major effort to integrate more high-tech features and digital connectivity across its lineup. The strategy to introduce more autonomous options, electrified powertrains, and even artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities has helped to diversify the business.\n\nThe impact was evident in 2024 when steps toward financial efficiency to support margins helped push full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up by 3% to $21.90, marking a company record. This was achieved even as total revenue slipped by 5% compared to 2023 balancing weakness in demand from China, alongside mixed trends in North American construction still dealing with high interest rates.\n\nHeavy duty construction equipment operating in an industrial setting.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 remains sluggish, with management guiding for another slight decline in full-year sales. According to Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo! Finance, 2025 EPS is projected to fall by 6.5% to $20.47.\n\nNevertheless, the bigger takeaway is a sense of overall fundamental stability. Caterpillar is still generating billions in free cash flow, with management projecting optimism in its ability to return to profitable growth over time.\n\nInvestors who are confident that the current headwinds are simply a bump in the road have plenty of reasons to stick with Caterpillar as a blue chip stock for the long run. A scenario where macroeconomic conditions strengthen could be the catalyst needed for the company to outperform expectations and send the stock to a new all-time high.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 Estimate Revenue (in billions) $64.8 $63.5 Revenue growth (YOY) (3.4%) (2%) Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $21.90 $20.47 Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 3.3% (6.5%)\n\nData source: Yahoo Finance. YOY = year over year.\n\nThe case to sell Caterpillar stock\n\nInvestors typically look to buy stocks that present improving prospects. In this case, the latest update from Caterpillar left a lot to be desired, at a time when the market is facing a new round of uncertainty.\n\nWhile details have not been confirmed, proposed tariffs by the Trump administration on steel and aluminum have the potential to disrupt Caterpillar's manufacturing supply chain, mentioned during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call as a development the company is watching closely. The repercussions could extend into the broader business environment if customer demand slows as a response to an escalating trade war.\n\nAll this is against the backdrop of Caterpillar's valuation. Caterpillar shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17 times its consensus 2025 EPS, a level that matches the five-year average for the earnings multiple, covering a period with stronger growth. One interpretation is that the stock could be overvalued with further room to fall.\n\nInvestors concerned that Caterpillar may struggle for an extended period as its outlook deteriorates could consider selling the stock or at least avoiding it.\n\nCAT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nCAT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nDecision time: A wait-and-see approach\n\nThere's a lot to like about Caterpillar as an industrial sector leader that has proven itself more than capable of navigating various market cycles.\n\nThat said, I just don't see enough good news to jump in and buy the stock with confidence for a rebound anytime soon. Current shareholders can likely continue holding the stock looking ahead to the next few quarterly updates for signs of stronger trends. Meanwhile, investors sitting on the sidelines may find better opportunities elsewhere in the stock market right now.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

With a near-15-metre reach, the MH3032 is available with both drop-nose and straight-stick options for maximum configurability. The manufacturer says typical scrap materials are no challenge for the standard Cat orange-peel grapple with its 1 cubic metre capacity, while a 20 kW generator option puts magnet attachments into play for even greater on-site versatility.\n\n\u201cMaterial handling is all about efficiency,\u201d explains Vincent Migeotte, Caterpillar senior product and sales consultant. \u201cHow can you move and sort materials \u2013 waste, scrap, or recycling \u2013 in as little time as possible, with as few moves as possible, using as little fuel as possible, and all without compromising safety or operator comfort?\u201d\n\nHe says efficiency is the essential principle behind the company\u2019s next gen architecture. \u201cKeeping control over operating costs, without sacrificing performance,\u201d he continues, \u201cand it\u2019s those parameters that come to the forefront in the MH3032.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEase of operation and optimum productivity are provided by Cat Payload, a built-in technology that allows operators to see how much they\u2019re lifting in each load and to constantly monitor tonnage output. Also fitted as standard on the machine is Cat 2D E-fence, which keeps the arm within a predefined work area away from the elevated cab, providing greater operator confidence while protecting the machine from damage and helping improve site safety. This is combined with a new Swing Assist feature, which automatically stops the swing motion at an operator-defined preset point.\n\n\u201cTechnologies like these not only help reduce the operator fatigue associated with repetitive tasks but also help improve site safety,\u201d explains Migeotte. \u201cOptimized movements also mean incremental improvements to time and fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nThe safety theme continues into the dedicated material handler cab, where an in-cab monitor displays dual external camera views to maximize visibility and hazard awareness.\n\nPower for the MH3032 is provided by way of a Cat C7.1 engine, one of Caterpillar\u2019s most modular and most compact power units, meeting U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final, EU Stage V, and Japan 2014 emission standards or emitting equivalent to U.S. EPA Tier 3 and EU Stage IIIA based on regional availability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwww.cat.com",

A new study making use of monitoring data found a 22 per cent decline in U.S. butterflies from 2000 to 2020. (Doug Taron - image credit)\n\nA fluttering butterfly makes most people smile with delight \u2014 a reaction that makes them special among insects.\n\nSome people love butterflies so much that, like birders, they look for and count them for fun. In the past two decades, those volunteers, along with researchers, have spotted and counted 12.6 million individual butterflies from 554 species as part of 76,000 surveys at 2,478 different locations across the U.S.\n\nNow, a new study funded by the U.S. Geological Survey has finally compiled all that data \u2014 and found some bad news. Populations declined 22 per cent between 2000 and 2020, reports the new study published in the journal Science Thursday.\n\nA volunteer photographs a butterfly with her phone as part of a survey, one of more than 76,000 that provided 12.6 million butterfly records analyzed in the new study.\n\nA volunteer photographs a butterfly with her phone as part of a survey, one of more than 76,000 that provided 12.6 million butterfly records analyzed in the new study. (Jeffrey Pippen)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I was really upset,\" said Collin Edwards, lead author of the new study. Edwards, who worked on the project during his postdoctoral research in quantitative ecology at the University of Washington in Seattle, added that he wasn't the only one devastated by the results.\n\n\"I know coworkers or coauthors who cried when they saw the manuscript with the final numbers.\"\n\nMichelle Tseng, an ecologist and assistant professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who wasn't involved in the study, had heard preliminary reports of the decline at scientific conferences, but initially couldn't believe the declines could be so big.\n\n\"So to see it in front of me, I was a bit shocked actually\u2026. It's depressing,\" she said after reading the study. \"That's massive.\"\n\nWATCH | Monarch butterfly count is 2nd lowest on record: researchers\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany of the more than 30 scientists who collaborated on the study had noticed declines among individual butterfly populations, but no one had compiled all the data until now.\n\n\"This is really the biggest and most comprehensive study of insects in certainly in the U.S., arguably in North America that we've done,\" said Edwards, now a data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. \"And, and so I think it really should be a bit of a wake-up call.\"\n\nBad news for other insects, Canadian butterflies?\n\nErica Henry is a prairie ecologist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife who studies rare butterfly conservation and who co-authored the study. She said that the loss of butterflies is a big deal, not just because they're beautiful and they inspire people, but also because of the role they play in ecosystems.\n\nAs caterpillars, butterflies transfer nutrients from plants up the food chain, while providing food for animals such as baby birds. As butterflies, they pollinate flowering plants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the potential impacts and implications go beyond that; what's happening to butterflies is likely happening to other insect species crucial to ecosystems, she said. \"It could be a canary in a coal mine situation,\" she said.\n\n\"Where we're seeing these widespread declines with butterfly species \u2026 that's likely happening for other species as well.\"\n\nErica Henry, a co-author of the new study, points to a rare Taylor's checkerspot caterpillar raised in captivity and released into a restored prairie in Washington state this week.\n\nErica Henry, a co-author of the new study, points to a rare Taylor's checkerspot caterpillar raised in captivity and released into a restored prairie in Washington state this week. (Submitted by Erica Henry)\n\nBesides the overall butterfly population, the new study also looked at trends for individual species with enough data \u2014 about 350 of them. It found 13 times more species were declining than increasing. More than 100 species had lost more than half their population. And there was no obvious pattern to the declines \u2013 it seemed unrelated to things like location, the size of the species or the type of plants it relied on.\n\nA Taylor's checkerspot caterpillar explores its new home at Scatter Creek Wildlife Area in Washington State on March 5, 2025.\n\nA Taylor's checkerspot caterpillar explores its new home at Scatter Creek Wildlife Area in Washington State on Wednesday. (Erica Henry)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat's causing the decline?\n\nIn this paper, Edwards acknowledged the data they have \u2014 counting butterflies \u2014 just doesn't tell them why butterfly losses are so huge.\n\nPesticides, climate change, habitat loss are thought to be drivers of decline for many species.\n\nTseng said those threats are affecting butterflies not just in the U.S., but in Canada also, and many species live on both sides of the border. \"And so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the same patterns [in Canada],\" she said.\n\nJeremy Kerr, a University of Ottawa professor who studies butterflies and co-founded the eButterfly monitoring platform, said his own work in southern Ontario and the Prairies suggests butterfly declines in Canada are \"probably pretty similar\" to those in the U.S. He said species are also struggling with warming temperatures on our side of the border.\n\nThe Taylor's Checkerspot butterfly was once common along the eastern part of Vancouver Island, but is now only found in two places: Denman Island and a private property near Campbell River.\n\nThe Taylor's Checkerspot butterfly is also a rare species in Canada, found on Denman Island and a private property near Campbell River in B.C. (B.C. Ministry of the Environment)\n\nWhat can be done \u2013 including at home\n\nHenry said the good news is that while butterfly populations can fall quickly due to threats like droughts, they can also grow quickly in response to interventions like habitat restoration, since most species can produce one to three new generations per year. She spoke to CBC News from Scatter Creek Wildlife Area in Washington, where she and colleagues were restoring prairie habitat and releasing captive-reared Taylor's checkerspot caterpillars.\n\nShe said there are things people can do at home too, such as cutting pesticide use.\n\nBoth she and Kerr suggested planting your garden, or even your balcony, with species that butterflies need as hosts for their caterpillars (such as milkweed for monarchs) as well as flowers they need for nectar as butterflies.\n\nWATCH | N.S. woman inspires others to build national butterfly highway\n\nTseng said the new study also shows the importance of people volunteering their time to monitor wildlife through citizen science or community science apps.\n\n\"We'd love to encourage anybody out there at all to just, if you see a butterfly, take a quick photo and then put it onto iNaturalist or eButterfly or whatever platform is your favourite.\"",

            "content": "Helping to prevent haul road overwatering and underwatering is the new Cat 789D autonomous water truck (AWT) designed to enhance productivity by enabling mine operations to digitally track water consumption and reduce waste.\n\nFully integrating into the mine site\u2019s Cat Command autonomous haulage fleet to control haul road dust, the market\u2019s first commercially available AWT is built on the field-proven 789D mining truck chassis and integrates the truck, tank and Cat Water Delivery System (WDS), connected with Cat MineStar technology.\n\nFeaturing Command for hauling, the new 789D AWT offers the same potential for greater utilization than staffed equipment. The fully autonomous truck reduces shift changes, meal breaks and other operational delays to improve efficiency.\n\nComplying with watering plans, the water truck interacts with other autonomous equipment and integrates with customer mining processes and systems managed by MineStar.\n\nThe 789D is the largest Cat water truck product offering that can accommodate up to 165,000 l (43,588 gal), depending on tank configuration. The AWT senses when the water tank is running low and can be programmed to integrate with the water refill station to fully automate the water refill process. The auto shutoff feature prevents tank overfilling.\n\n\u201cTo meet customer requirements for dust control, Caterpillar implemented a MineStar-integrated watering model based on many years of site watering studies and Cat WDS performance data. This model allows the truck to monitor traffic, weather and road conditions, prioritise what areas need watered, when the areas need watered, and how many passes it should take to apply the correct amount of water saturation, for the given conditions. The integration of Caterpillar\u2019s many years of autonomous truck operations and water delivery development have been combined to make a high performing autonomous watering solution,\u201d says Corey Wurtzbacher, general manager and vice president technology and global sales support at Caterpillar.\n\nWhen Caterpillar set out to develop an autonomous water truck, integration with Cat MineStar Command for hauling and the Cat WDS was key to the entire integration process. The team began building communication between the truck on-board systems and the office control consol to work together with the Cat WDS interface.\n\nTo ensure seamless operation and proper communication between the water delivery system and MineStar, a compatibility check has been implemented in Cat WDS to confirm all truck control systems are running compatible software and reporting any onboard failures to the MineStar system for appropriate corrective action.\n\nFully integrated into the truck\u2019s design, the exclusive Cat WDS varies waterflow based on truck speed and automatically determines the correct amount of water needed to control dust. Knowing where, when and how much water to dispense, the 789D AWT helps customers conserve water, a scarce resource at many mining locations around the world.\n\nWhen truck speed drops below the minimum watering speed setting, determined by site operations, the system halts water delivery to help prevent overwatering, poor traction, and damage to haul road intersections and other stopping areas.\n\nWhen truck speed exceeds the minimum watering speed setting, the system begins depositing the specified amount of water commanded by MineStar. Cat WDS actively monitors water level and automatically turns off watering once the tank is empty. To reduce potential damage, the system has multiple safeguards in place to prevent the water pump from running dry. This feature helps prolong water pump life and extends service intervals.\n\nThe automated system\u2019s flat, controlled spray pattern delivers optimal litres-per-square-meter (gallons-per-square-foot) coverage across the haul road. Larger, heavier droplets designed to reach the ground aids in reducing spray loss to wind and evaporation.\n\nReducing health hazards associated with airborne particles, automated water delivery supports the reduction of dust that limits operator visibility for staffed equipment to enhance overall site safety. Remote tank fill control, complete with auto shut-off to prevent overfilling, eliminates the need for a worker to be involved in the refilling process, reducing the potential of slips and falls.\n\nMines can quickly switch the 789D AWT from autonomous mode to staffed mode as necessary for tasks like front water cannon operation. The cannon has a capacity of distributing up to 2,839 l/min (759 gal/min) with a spray distance reaching 60m (200ft). Even with staffed operation, Auto Mode water delivery automates the watering process to leverage variable water flow and automatic determination of the correct amount of water needed to control dust.",

To crown his achievements, Caterpillar awarded Doheny with a trip for two to a location where Caterpillar has one of its production facilities.\n\n\u201cI am beyond thrilled to have earned the title of the best Caterpillar machine operator on the planet,\u201d Doheny said.\n\n\u201cKudos to Caterpillar for hosting such an incredible event to highlight the importance of our profession. It is truly a dream come true to see your life\u2019s passion be rewarded in such an amazing way.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming 2025-2026 challenge will include more events, countries and operators than ever.\n\nCaterpillar is seeking operators to participate in local challenges, which Caterpillar dealers will facilitate for the first round of competition. The opening round will be held from January to September 2025. Cat dealers in Australia and New Zealand will host challenge events from February to June.\n\nThe opening round of competition will test the operator\u2019s versatility with at least three different challenges on at least three separate pieces of equipment awaiting them in the initial round.\n\nScoring is based on the operator\u2019s skills, safety, efficiency and competence in using integrated technology such as payload, grade control and operator ease-of-use features to enhance the machine\u2019s performance.\n\nThe top competitors from each local Australia and New Zealand dealer event will then advance to the regional semifinal competitions in Japan at the end of October, where they will meet other Asia Pacific finalists.\n\nThe top three regional finalists will then represent Asia Pacific. Globally, nine finalists will emerge from the regional semifinals and participate in the final competition in March 2026 at Caterpillar\u2019s outdoor Festival Grounds exhibit during CONEXPO-CON/AGG in Las Vegas.\n\nThe winner will receive a $10,000 cash prize or an equal-value trip for two where Caterpillar has a worldwide location. \u2022\n\nFor more information, visit cat.com/operatorchallenge",

            "content": "Shares in Caterpillar (CAT -1.85%) were down by 3.2% as of 11:30 a.m. ET today. There's little doubt over the reason for the decline: the coming into effect of 25% tariffs on products imported from Mexico and Canada, alongside raising tariffs on products from China to 20%.\n\nWhy Caterpillar is impacted\n\nThe sell-off is understandable given the company's negative exposure to an escalation in trade tensions. Caterpillar is a truly international company in its sales and operations. It has more employees outside the US (61,400) than it does in the US (51,500) , and it has plenty of competitors in local and regional markets across all of its businesses.\n\nAs such, an escalation of trade conflict could lead to its products becoming uncompetitive due to retaliatory tariff action. In addition, Caterpillar has numerous manufacturing plants worldwide, including plants in China and Mexico. An increase in tariffs is likely to increase the costs of components manufactured at these plants, and that will eat into profit margin.\n\nIn addition, as investors learned from the supply chain crisis that followed the COVID lockdowns, trade disruptions can significantly raise the cost of procuring supplies and create logistical nightmares as supply chains adjust to a new pricing environment.\n\nFinally, if the tariff actions lead to a series of retaliatory actions that negatively impact the global growth environment, Caterpillar's construction machinery sales will be hit. Worse, its commodity-related sales (mining machinery, oil and gas equipment, and construction machinery for energy projects) will be severely hit if capital spending plans are cut due to tariffs on commodities.\n\nTime to panic?\n\nPerhaps not. The tariffs can be eased once President Donald Trump achieves his aims.",

            "content": "Shares of Caterpillar (CAT, Financial) declined by 2% today, as reflected in its current trading price of $325.41. This drop is primarily linked to recently imposed tariffs and increased trade tensions, impacting the company's extensive international operations.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT, Financial) presents a mixed outlook. The company is currently trading with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.74, which is close to its 1-year low, signaling potentially undervalued shares. Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 7.98 is a reflection of its substantial market presence in the industrial machinery sector.\n\nCaterpillar's market cap stands at $155.52 billion, with a global reach that generates approximately 54% of its sales outside the United States. However, recent trade policy changes could pose challenges to this international footprint by increasing production costs and affecting profit margins due to higher tariffs on imports from key markets like China, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nValuation metrics indicate that Caterpillar is fairly valued according to its GF Value, which is a concise indicator of a stock's intrinsic value. Investors can explore detailed valuation metrics in the GF Value page for Caterpillar to gain further insights into its current market positioning.\n\nDespite certain financial strengths, including an expanding operating margin and strong Altman Z-score of 3.79, Caterpillar (CAT, Financial) faces a couple of medium warning signs. These include a slowdown in revenue growth over the past year and issuances of new debt. Nevertheless, the company has shown resilience in its profitability, demonstrated by a robust operating margin expansion.\n\nGiven these factors, investors should closely monitor the global economic landscape, particularly trade relations, as these will significantly impact Caterpillar's operations and future earnings potential. The company's insider buying activity over the last quarter also suggests confidence in its long-term prospects, despite current market fluctuations.",

            "content": "(Photo courtesy of Joe Viola)\n\nThe calendar has flipped to March, and that means it's time for the annual migration match for monarchs and some of our beloved birds, like hummingbirds and orioles. The first sign that spring is creeping in slowly but surely: Monarchs have been spotted in the United States.\n\nIt will still be at least a few weeks before the butterflies make their way to Illinois and then Will County, but their migration has begun, with sightings reported in several cities in Texas and Florida so far this year. You can chart their progress based on reported sightings from citizen scientists thanks to a map from Journey North.\n\nHistorically, the first sightings in Will County come sometime in May, although in some recent years they have arrived as early as mid-April.\n\nProgram coordinator Suzy Lyttle said each year's migration can vary depending on the weather conditions they encounter along their journey. They're much more delicate than birds, she said, and they can't fly in the rain. Winds also can make a big difference. They normally can fly at speeds up to 20 mph, and favorable wind conditions can allow them to travel anywhere from 40 to 100 miles per day.\n\n\"From year to year, things change,\" Lyttle said of their annual trek north. \"It just depends. Some years they're early, and some years they're late.\"\n\nThe monarchs we see in Illinois overwinter in the oyamel fir forests of Mexico. There are two monarch populations in the United States: the eastern population and western population. Ours is the eastern population, and it includes all monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains. The smaller wester population is found west of the Rockies and overwinters in California.\n\nYou can get involved\n\nDo you want to get in on the reporting action? It's simple and can be accomplished directly through the Journey North site. Just sign up for an account, and you're all set. It only takes a minute to share your sighting. The data, which is submitted by more than 60,000 registered users in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, is used to better understand migratory species.\n\nFor now, while you're waiting for them to arrive in your yard, here's something fascinating to check out: A segment we did on monarchs for our \"Buzz\" nature show.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL",

            "content": "By Valorie Brecht The TRG\n\nLeRoy Dommer is taking a new turn on the road of life, as he has retired after serving for 67 years as the road grader and snow plow driver for the Town of Unity in Clark County.\n\nDommer, who turned 95 March 1, decided after he pulled a muscle getting into the machine a few weeks ago that it was time to retire.\n\nDommer has lived in Riplinger since 1956. He spent 27 years as a part-time grader, or the second man for the township; 13.5 years full-time and another 20-plus years as the second man again.\n\nDommer grew up in Nebraska. In 1956, at the age of 27, Dommer and his wife Kathryn bought an 80-acre farm in Riplinger. Dommer spent many a morning up early milking cows before going to plow the roads at 7 a.m. while his wife finished the farm chores. In 1985, he retired from farming and passed the farm on to his son. He now lives just across the road from the farm.\n\nHe started grading roads for the township in 1958.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I drove a Caterpillar in California for my uncle, farming sugar beets. Well, when they found that out here, the township asked me if I would work for them,\u201d said Dommer.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Dommer first drove a Caterpillar with a pull-behind grader that only went 2.5 miles per hour. It took three or four days to do one mile of road. Now the township has two John Deere graders with six-wheel drive and, running both of them, it only takes six or seven hours to do one mile.\n\nThe township went through several equipment upgrades in Dommer\u2019s time. Dommer used to drive a Warco grader with stick steering. Then the township got a Caterpillar No. 12, followed by a Caterpillar No. 14. The town got its first all-wheel grader in 2003 or 2004.\n\nThe town also saw some personnel changes. Dommer worked under three town chairmen: Bernard Newman, Roscoe Meacham, and Wayne Hendrickson. Over his time grading and plowing the roads, Dommer got to know the people of his community well and had some interesting experiences.\n\n\u201cTwice, there were ladies I knew who were pregnant and ready to have their baby. I plowed all the way to 13 so they could get to the hospital,\u201d said Dommer.\n\nHe also worked during nasty blizzards, making for some long days. The longest he plowed continuously was from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\n\u201cI had to go over the roads twice because of the drifting in. Years ago, the road was lower so there was lots of drifting,\u201d said Dommer.\n\nThe town of Unity has 68 miles of road, which is one of the higher totals among townships in the county. Dommer and his coworker, most recently Jeff Oelrich, would split up the township, with Dommer doing everything north of the town hall on Division and Oelrich doing everything south of it.\n\nDommer said his retirement felt bittersweet.\n\n\u201cWhen the grader went by here other day plowing snow, I sure felt left out. But, you know, you gotta quit sometime, and I guess this is sometime,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed it. I was always proud of the township of Unity and how we kept our roads,\u201d he added.\n\nHendrickson praised Dommer for a job well done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really good (having Dommer as an employee). We could really depend on him,\u201d said Hendrickson. \u201cWe could call him at midnight, if we had a heavy rain or something, and he\u2019d go out right away and fix it. He\u2019s been a reliable employee.\u201d\n\nDommer will be celebrated at the Town of Unity\u2019s annual meeting in April.\n\nDOMMER AND HIS DEERE - LeRoy Dommer is shown with the most recent John Deere rig he drove. He has enjoyed operating heavy equipment throughout his life, going back to when he drove a Caterpillar on his uncle\u2019s sugar beet farm in California at age 15.\n\nTRG STAFF PHOTO/VALORIE BRECHT",

(NYSE:CAT) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

Valued at a market cap of $164.4 billion, the company also offers wear and maintenance components, parts distribution, logistics solutions and distribution services, dealer portfolio management, and marketing strategy services.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap\u201d stocks and Caterpillar fits right into that category with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the farm & heavy construction machinery industry. The company is one of the world's leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment and is known for its safety and quality standards.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, this machinery giant has dropped 17.8% from its 52-week high of $418.50, reached on Nov. 7, 2024. Moreover, it has declined 14.8% over the past three months, massively lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s ($NASX) 1.1% fall over the same time frame.\n\nMoreover, in the longer term, CAT has gained 4.4% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming NASX\u2019s 18.2% return. On a YTD basis, shares of CAT are down 5.2%, compared to NASX\u2019s 2.4% dip over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its recent bearish trend, CAT has been trading below its 200-day moving average since early February, and is trading below its 50-day moving average since late January.\n\nOn Feb. 3, shares of Caterpillar plunged 2.7% due to concerns around new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.\n\nMoreover, on Jan. 30, CAT\u2019s shares closed down 4.6% as the company delivered a mixed Q4 performance. Its adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share declined 1.7% from the year-ago quarter but topped the Wall Street estimates by 3.4%. However, the company reported a 5.3% year-over-year fall in revenues to $16.2 billion, which missed the forecasted figure by 2.5%. An overall decline in volumes and unfavorable price realization adversely affected the results.\n\nCAT has outpaced its rival, Komatsu Ltd.\u2019s (KMTUY) 2.9% gain over the past 52 weeks but has lagged behind Komatsu\u2019s 9.6% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nAlthough Caterpillar has underperformed relative to the Nasdaq recently, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 21 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $397.53 suggests a 15.6% premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The yen briefly hit 149.11 to the dollar, the highest since Feb 28.\n\nAsked about Mr Trump\u2019s comments, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tokyo was not taking policies directly aimed at weakening the yen.\n\nMr Kato told a news conference in Tokyo on March 4 that Japan had confirmed its \u201cbasic stance on currency policy\u201d with Group of Seven (G-7) countries and with the United States, including at a bilateral meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nSpeaking at a separate news conference, Japanese Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa said on March 4 the government intervenes in the currency market only when yen movement is \u201cspeculative\u201d.\n\nJapanese policymakers have been sensitive to the risk of Mr Trump making explicit comments about the yen and causing market volatility that could hurt its fragile economic recovery.\n\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in February he agreed with Mr Trump that the two countries will leave foreign exchange rate matters in the hands of their finance ministers.\n\nWhile a weak yen gives Japanese exports a boost, Tokyo\u2019s recent forays in the currency market have been to prevent sharp yen falls that inflate import costs and hurt consumption.\n\nJapan\u2019s top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura last week acknowledged the yen\u2019s rebound back then as reflecting Japan\u2019s solid economic fundamentals and prospects of a near-term interest rate hike by the central bank.\n\nJapan has consistently, and successfully, called for G-7 and G-20 members to reaffirm their agreement that excess volatility in the currency market is undesirable \u2013 language Tokyo sees as giving it justification to conduct yen intervention when the currency\u2019s moves are too sharp and driven by speculative trade.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s criticism of a weak yen and uncertainty on how his tariff threats could affect global growth may complicate the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BOJ) decision on how soon to raise interest rates.\n\nThe central bank ended a decade-long, massive stimulus in 2024 on the view that Japan was on the cusp of sustainably pulling out of prolonged deflation and economic stagnation.\n\nWith inflation exceeding its 2 per cent target for nearly three years, the BOJ is eyeing further interest rate hikes after raising borrowing costs to 0.5 per cent in January.\n\nA majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to hike rates once more this year, most probably during the third quarter, to 0.75 per cent.

This is a luxury that is not empty.\u201d Norbert Stumpfl\u2019s first look book image in this expanded Brioni women\u2019s collection finely illustrated the something that Brioni is onto: a gorgeously cut tuxedo beneath which was layered a top made by subtracting the shoulders and sleeves from a tailored jacket.\n\nAfforded by Brioni owner Kering Group the time to take a considered approach, which has included consulting with Gigliola Savini Perrone, daughter of the house cofounder, Gaetano Savini, Stumpfl\u2019s vision for womenswear has developed from cautious caterpillar to increasingly confident chrysalis. Its identity is shaped by Brioni\u2019s 80-year heritage of excellence in masculine tailoring: However, what\u2019s crucial to its potential is that while Brioni\u2019s masculine DNA defines its process, it does not dictate this product.\n\nThus Brioni\u2019s highly evolved menswear catalog of canonical cuts, materials, and methods were taken as raw materials before being applied to shaping garments for women. A safari suit was transformed by lengthening the shirt into a dress and transforming the shorts into pants. Pencil skirts in pale fil coupe of cashmere were given movement-affording range by applying the same single vent normally cut into the back of a men\u2019s jacket into the front of the garment. A version of that opening tuxedo top was flipped into an evening dress by switching it from black to white, cutting it full length, and hand-applying black floral embellishments.\n\nThere were plenty of tailored jackets cut with the hand-hewn precision and ease that you would absolutely expect here. However, both their architecture and length were recast by application to a block crafted for the shape of their destined wearers. Furthermore, the jackets were sometimes accessorized with a belt\u2014something near sacrilegious in the masculine sphere of tailoring\u2014and layered over garments deracinated from shirts to blouses by the raglan-style shoulder shapes and the dis-imposition of collars.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about being known for wearing any particular brand,\u201d said Stumpfl when asked to profile the female client for whom he and his teams are manifesting these clothes. \u201cShe just wants her clothes to work beautifully in order to let her work.\u201d In this, at least, Brioni\u2019s womenswear and menswear are in harmony. Stumpfl\u2019s opening definition of the house\u2019s luxury as \u201cnot empty\u201d seemed on the money. This cosmopolitan-not-cosplay approach to apex dressing seems full of potential.",

            "content": "The world\u2019s largest copper producer, BHP\u2019s Escondida copper mine in Chile. Credit: Caterpillar\n\nCanada and Australia could trail emerging mining nations such as Argentina if their governments don\u2019t speed up permitting and lower costs, BHP (NYSE, LSE, ASX: BHP) CEO Mike Henry warned.\n\nCountries such as the United States, Argentina and Saudi Arabia are making \u201csizeable\u201d efforts to reform their mining sector and attract capital, Henry said Sunday in Toronto. At the same time, established natural-resource powerhouses such as Canada and Australia have seen their global attractiveness erode.\n\nHenry\u2019s comments come as the US administration of President Donald Trump looks to spur domestic production of critical minerals in part by overhauling permitting requirements. According to a June 2024 report by S&P Global, the US has the second-longest average development times in the world of the 23 countries they evaluated.\n\n\u201cJust as is the case for business, nations need to remain competitive on the global stage or they will be left behind in the race for metals and minerals investment programs,\u201d Henry said in a speech and subsequent question and answer session at the annual Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada conference. \u201cThe competitive landscape isn\u2019t static.\u201d\n\nBenchmarking\n\nIf a country isn\u2019t constantly benchmarking, \u201cit runs the risk of falling behind,\u201d added Henry. \u201cOnce capital mobilizes in one direction, sometimes it can be quite hard to mobilize in the other direction.\u201d\n\nPermitting delays are a key irritant for miners. New mines in Australia and Canada typically take from 10 to 15 years to get built, compared with as few as five years in a country like Chile, Henry said.\n\nAlthough Canada possesses many advantages, including plentiful natural resources and a strong ecosystem that includes engineering firms with mining experience, the country is no longer as attractive to foreign investment as it once was, the Canadian-born Henry said.\n\nCanada\u2019s competitiveness has dropped from eighth to 19th in the past four years in the World Competitiveness Yearbook published by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development, and the country needs a renewed reform agenda to bolster mining competitiveness, he said.\n\nIssues in Australia include electricity prices that are about 50% higher than in the US and combined tax and royalty levels that are \u201csimply uncompetitive for capital,\u201d Henry said. To make matters worse, the country has limited reserves of \u201cfuture-facing commodities\u201d like copper, nickel or lithium, he added.\n\n\u201cAustralia can no longer rely as heavily on its geological advantages but instead must exercise its policy muscles to improve competitiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to confront the fact that productivity growth is sluggish across the broader economy and has fallen in the mining sector across the past two decades.\u201d\n\n\u2018Can-do\u2019\n\nAs a result, policymakers \u201cneed to examine the entire set of policy and regulatory settings and ask whether they are making the country more or less competitive globally,\u201d the BHP CEO added.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story in the US, where multiple initiatives are under way to expand mining output. Henry spent last week in Washington to meet with US lawmakers and says he came away encouraged by the \u201ccan-do, make-it-happen attitude\u201d in his meetings.\n\nCompared with Canada and Australia, \u201cother countries are mobilizing a more urgent effort and have higher ambitions around this. That includes the US, who\u2019s currently behind the curve but could very well end up being far ahead of the curve if they carry through with some of their current intent,\u201d he said.\n\nHenry is also optimistic about Argentina, given its reserves of copper, gold and lithium. In copper alone, projects representing about 1.2 million tonnes of annual output are in the pipeline, with \u201cmuch more to come,\u201d he said.\n\nBHP and Canada\u2019s Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN) recently closed the $4.1 billion acquisition of Argentina\u2019s Filo Corp as part of an increased focus on copper. BHP\u2019s contribution was about $2 billion, Henry said.\n\n\u201cArgentina could very well become a top 5 copper producer,\u201d Henry said. \u201cArgentina is serious about competing globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they need to attract capital to make it happen and they are focused on unlocking the opportunity. Our sector is taking notice.\u201d\n\nReforms\n\nSince taking office in December 2023, Argentinian President Javier Milei has taken steps to make the country more attractive for mining investment, primarily by pursuing deregulation, reducing inflation, and improving economic stability.\n\nLast year, the Milei administration introduced the Incentive Regime for Large Investments, offering 30-year tax, trade, and foreign-exchange benefits for projects investing at least $200 million in sectors such as mining.\n\nThe reforms have attracted some large investments: In December, Rio Tinto (NYSE, LSE, RIO, ASX: RIO) announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its Rincon lithium project. This development is expected to position the country as a leading lithium producer.\n\nCanada\u2019s First Quantum Minerals (TSX: FM) plans to invest $3.6 billion in the Taca Taca copper project in Salta province. If realized, this could elevate Argentina into the top 10 global copper producers.\n\nHaving abandoned attempts to acquire Anglo American (LSE: AAL), BHP is busy pivoting to organic growth. Up to $10 billion is being spent on Chile\u2019s Escondida, the world\u2019s largest copper mine, in which Rio Tinto has a 30% stake.\n\nUrbanization and growing electrification are two of the reasons the use of critical minerals is projected to soar in the coming decades. Copper, for one, is facing a 70% increase in demand by the middle of the century, Henry said. Some $250 billion will be needed over the next five to 10 years to keep pace with the surging appetite for metals, BHP forecasts.",

Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nWith this in mind, we will now have a look at the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts\n\n12) Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~10.3%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~14.0x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is engaged in integrated energy and chemicals operations. The company\u2019s economic moat revolves around its strong franchise, healthy supply chain capabilities, and cost efficiencies. Bloomberg reported that the company is exploring an opportunity to acquire Phillips 66\u2019s stake in their 50-50 chemicals JV, CPChem, with activist Elliott Investment Management pushing for an exit. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s CEO Mike Wirth believes that chemicals have strong demand growth.\n\nThis is because more people continue to enter the middle class globally, and there is an increased need for energy-efficient, lightweight plastics in airplanes and vehicles, as highlighted by Wirth in an interview with Bloomberg T.V. CPChem has significant growth projects, such as $8.5 billion polymers facility in Orange, Texas, and $6 billion complex in Qatar. Notably, they will utilize low-cost ethane as feedstock, placing them in an advantageous position compared to plants in Europe and Asia that use naphtha. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) continues to be active in managing its portfolio, as highlighted by the recent Canadian divestment announcement. These strategic initiatives remain focused on optimizing Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s asset base and are targeting high-return opportunities.\n\n11) Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~12.2%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~13.5x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a financial services company, which provides diversified banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. The financial services giant enjoys a wide economic moat, stemming from the cost advantages and switching costs. Furthermore, its extensive branch network and healthy market position offer a solid foundation for growth. The focus on efficiency and cost-cutting initiatives resulted in improving operational performance, placing it well to capitalize on economic recovery.\n\nAnalyst Glenn Thum from Phillip Securities maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, providing a price target of $85.00. The rating is backed by a combination of factors, such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s financial performance and strategic initiatives. As per the analyst, the outlook for 2025 is positive, with expected growth in NII due to loan expansion and reduced market funding costs, together with further decrease in expenses. Such factors, along with the continued increase in non-interest income, mainly in investment banking and trading activities, support the rating.\n\nElsewhere, Bank of America Securities also gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s stock with a price objective of $86.00. For FY 2025, the company expects net interest income to be ~1% \u2013 3% higher than in 2024 and non-interest expense of ~$54.2 billion. Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) was the top contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered diversified bank\u2019s stock price rose after reporting what we see as solid third-quarter earnings where the company\u2019s efficiency ratio continued to improve as expenses were well controlled. The fee income segment also performed well, growing 12%. In addition, Wells Fargo had the opportunity to repurchase $3.5 billion in shares during the period, bringing the full-year repurchase to roughly $16 billion. In November, the stock price continued its upward trend following the U.S. presidential election as investors are optimistic that the financials sector will benefit from looser regulations and lower corporate taxes, thus stimulating a better environment for dealmaking. We continue to believe that Wells Fargo is a competitively advantaged bank that can use its superior business mix and return potential to unlock further value.\u201d\n\n10) Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~12.6%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~17.1x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is engaged in the manufacturing and selling of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. Morningstar believes that the company has a wide economic moat, stemming from its significant intellectual property and customer switching costs. Analysts at DA Davidson upped Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\u2019s price target to $357 from $350, keeping a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating. The firm believes that data centers and energy-related projects have been fueling the company\u2019s business throughout all 3 segments.\n\nThe company\u2019s brand remains synonymous with durability and reliability, adding significant value to its products. These factors are expected to help contribute to customer loyalty and drive incremental sales. Moving forward, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is expected to gain significantly from the anticipated upturn in the equipment replacement cycle, mainly in the mining sector. This cycle is fueled by the aging of existing equipment fleets and the requirement for more efficient, technologically advanced machinery.\n\nGiven its market position with a healthy brand reputation, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is well-placed to capture a significant share of this replacement demand. Diamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter.

            "content": "Bill Gates has dedicated years and billions of dollars to addressing climate change. His foundation has directed substantial funding toward climate technology solutions while consistently highlighting major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from large energy and manufacturing companies that burn fossil fuels extensively. However, Gates believes that many people overlook one of the significant contributors to climate change: agriculture, particularly methane emissions from livestock and the impact of fertilizers.\n\nThe foundation has been a major financial backer of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for malaria and tuberculosis vaccine research. It also played a pivotal role in launching Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which spearheads immunization efforts in low-income nations. Headquartered in Seattle, the foundation continues to expand its global impact. Following a $20 billion donation, Gates outlined plans to boost its annual spending by 50%, targeting $9 billion by 2026.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett have collectively contributed around $100 billion to the Gates Foundation to date. During an interview with the BBC, the Microsoft co-founder and Gates Foundation chair disclosed the extent of his philanthropic efforts. According to a foundation fact sheet, Gates and French Gates, who are now divorced, donated a total of $59.5 billion between the organization's inception in 2000 and the end of 2023. Meanwhile, Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has contributed an additional $39.3 billion.\n\nIn 2000, Bill and Melinda Gates established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , now one of the world's largest charitable organizations. The foundation focuses on public health, poverty reduction, education, and climate change. Since 1994, the Gateses have contributed over $50 billion to its initiatives, including more than $1.94 billion in grants for vaccine research during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBill Gates is one of the most influential figures in the modern world. The software company he co-founded, best known for its Windows operating system, ranks among the most valuable companies globally, boasting a market capitalization of $3 trillion. This success has contributed to Gates becoming one of the wealthiest individuals, with his net worth recently estimated at $108 billion.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Bill Gates . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince 2015, Breakthrough Energy, the climate-focused investment firm he founded, has allocated $2.2 billion to more than 160 startups and initiatives, aiming to generate investor returns while reducing emissions. In addition to these investments through the firm, Gates has also pursued climate-focused ventures independently. Some of these startups focus on practical solutions, such as sealants to improve heating efficiency, while others explore more unconventional approaches, including burying plant waste to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nAs of Q4 2024, The Gates Foundation, managed by Michael Larson, has a portfolio valued at over $42 billion. The tech and industrial goods sectors represented 29% and 26.3% of the portfolio, respectively. The finance sector made up over 21% of the fund\u2019s portfolio. In view of this, we will take a look at the best stocks to buy according to Bill Gates.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the latest stocks in Bill Gates\u2019 portfolio, we scanned through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s SEC filings for the fourth quarter and picked out the top ten stocks with the highest investment stakes.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) the Cheap Global Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nA construction crew operating a hydraulic shovel during a nighttime project.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nStake Value as of Q4 2024: $2,667,597,015\n\nRenowned for its iconic yellow heavy-duty machinery, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company boasts a global workforce of 113,200 and has suppliers in 175 countries around the world.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) faced challenges in Q4 2025 as its revenue of $16.2 billion (down 5% YoY) fell short of the forecasted $16.61 billion, primarily due to reduced market demand. However, the adjusted EPS of $5.14 still managed to beat expectations, showcasing the company\u2019s operational resilience through efficient cost strategies.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) maintains a robust balance sheet, having generated approximately $40 billion of ME&T free cash flow since 2019, including $10.3 billion only in 2024. Such a strong and consistent ME&T free cash flow has allowed the company to reduce the average number of shares outstanding by approximately 18% since the beginning of 2019. CAT maintains a strong track record of returning value to its shareholders, having paid higher annual dividends for 31 consecutive years and attaining the prestigious title of a dividend aristocrat. The company lived up to its name and distributed $10.3 billion to its shareholders in 2024, with $7.7 billion of share repurchases and $2.6 billion in the form of dividends.\n\nOverall CAT ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Bill Gates. While we acknowledge the potential for CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Deliveries by the Irving, Texas-based company are expected to begin in 2027.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation released a statement confirming a munitions sale to Israel for an estimated cost of $675.7 million. Repkon USA, located in Tampa, Florida, and The Boeing Company, located in St. Charles, Missouri, will manufacture the equipment, which is estimated to be delivered to Israel beginning in 2028.\n\nOn Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he had \"signed a declaration to use emergency authorities to expedite the delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.\"\n\nRubio noted that the Trump administration has so far approved nearly $12 billion in foreign military sales to Israel.\n\nThe latest arms sale comes as the first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of war, freed Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and enabled more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, is set to expire on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel and Hamas seem willing to maintain their truce while negotiators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar guide talks aimed at getting to the next phase.\n\nThe parties were supposed to have begun ironing out the details of phase two weeks ago. But talks were delayed as the first six weeks of the ceasefire were marred by disputes between Israel and Hamas over alleged violations of the deal.\n\nUnder the terms of the truce that began in Jan. 19, the second phase would compel Hamas to release all the remaining living hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Hamas has freed 33 living and dead hostages in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners. The militant group still holds 59 captives, 32 of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nIsrael is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives.",

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nWASHINGTON - The US State Department has approved the potential sale of nearly US$3 billion (S$4 billion) worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel, the Pentagon said in statements on Feb 28 .\n\nThe prospective weapons sales were notified to Congress on the afternoon of Feb 28 on an emergency basis.\n\nThat process sidesteps a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress.\n\nThe sales included 35,529 general-purpose bomb bodies for 2,000-pound bombs and 4,000 bunker-busting 2,000-pound bombs made by General Dynamics. While the Pentagon said that deliveries would begin in 2026, it also said \u201cthere is a possibility that a portion of this procurement will come from US stock\u201d which could mean immediate delivery for some of the weapons.\n\nA second package, valued at US$675 million, consisted of five thousand 1,000-pound bombs and corresponding kits to help guide the \u201cdumb\u201d bombs. Delivery for this package was estimated to be in 2028.\n\nA third notification consisted of US$295 million worth of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers.\n\nThe Feb 28 announcements marked the second time in February the Trump administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also utilised emergency authorities to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review.\n\nOn Feb 24 , the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order that required it to report potential violations of international law involving US-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has eliminated most US humanitarian foreign aid.\n\nA ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas last month halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while also leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.\n\nHowever, Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end of the war.

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nCharles Fuller (born March 5, 1939, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died October 3, 2022, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was an American playwright who is best known for A Soldier\u2019s Play (first performed 1981), which won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for drama.\n\nFuller attended Villanova University (1956\u201358) and La Salle College (1965\u201367) and served in the U.S. Army from 1959 to 1962. In 1967 he cofounded the Afro-American Arts Theatre in Philadelphia, and he was codirector from 1967 to 1971. His play The Village: A Party (1968) is a drama of racial tensions among a community of racially mixed couples. During the 1970s he wrote plays for the Henry Street Settlement theatre in New York, and in 1974 the Negro Ensemble Company produced his In the Deepest Part of Sleep. He based The Brownsville Raid (1976) on an actual incident involving the dishonourable discharge in 1906 of an entire Black U.S. Army regiment for inciting a riot (they were exonerated in 1972).\n\nIn Zooman and the Sign (1980) Fuller presented a father\u2019s search for the killer of his daughter. A Soldier\u2019s Play follows the investigation by a Black army captain of the murder of a Black soldier at a base in Louisiana. Fuller also wrote the screenplay of the critically acclaimed film adaptation (A Soldier\u2019s Story; 1984), for which he received an Academy Award nomination. After A Soldier\u2019s Play, Fuller began work on a series of plays devoted to African American history during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. The We cycle, as it became known, included Sally (1988), Prince (1988), Jonquil (1990), and Burner\u2019s Frolic (1990). Continuing to draw inspiration from the military, Fuller later wrote One Night\u2026 (2013), about a female soldier who was raped by fellow servicemen while stationed in Iraq. He also penned the children\u2019s book Snatch: The Adventures of David and Me in Old New York (2010). In 2020 A Soldier\u2019s Play debuted on Broadway, and it later won a Tony Award for best revival.",

            "content": "Blue chip stocks are the stocks of well-known, high-quality companies that are industry leaders. These companies have stood the test of time and are respected by their customers and shareholders.\n\nBlue chip companies have solid business models and impressive track records of returns for investors. These returns often include regular and growing dividend payments. The blue chip stocks' attractive risk-reward profiles make them among the most popular for conservative investors. However, even more risk-tolerant investors should consider buying blue chip stocks to diversify their portfolios and provide stability during turbulent stock market conditions. What are they? What is a blue chip stock? So what are they? A blue chip stock is defined as a security that represents an equity position in a company that meets most of the following criteria: It's an industry leader with a dependable business model.\n\nIt has a strong reputation with consumers and shareholders.\n\nIt has a history of delivering strong returns over the long term.\n\nIt pays dividends to shareholders and makes regular increases to its payouts.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nTop five to buy now Best blue chip stocks to buy right now Even if you've never invested in the stock market, you'll recognize the names of many top blue chip stocks. These large-cap companies provide products and services that billions of people worldwide use daily. Here are some of the best blue chip companies on the market:\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple (AAPL -2.81%) is one of the world's most profitable companies. It has pioneered advancements in the technology sector throughout its history. The company innovated with its Macintosh computers in the 1980s and made media portable with its iPods in the early 2000s. Its iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches are ubiquitous today. In a world where consumers flock to the latest tech fads, Apple's products enjoy notable loyalty from its customer base. Apple also earns recurring revenue through its services, which include its iTunes, App Store, and streaming television businesses. Apple's market capitalization climbed past the $1 trillion mark in 2018 up to an unprecedented $2 trillion in 2020, and the tech giant then became the first company to reach a $3 trillion market cap. Thanks to incredible profitability and anticipation for future opportunities, Apple's valuation has been able to march significantly higher from there.\n\nDefinition Icon Revenue Revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\n\nWhile the company's valuation has sometimes fluctuated in conjunction with volatility for the broader market, the tech giant's stock has been an excellent performer for long-term investors. Apple has been among the largest public companies for a long time -- and the business has plenty of room for growth over the long term.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.18%)(BRK.B 1.42%) is a major player in the insurance industry, offering various lines of commercial and personal insurance through subsidiaries GEICO and Gen Re. But Berkshire owns a diverse set of businesses. For example, Berkshire owns restaurant chain Dairy Queen, railroad giant BNSF, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility company. It owns water companies, consumer apparel businesses, battery brands, and more. Beyond its subsidiary businesses, the investment conglomerate also owns a large portfolio of publicly traded stocks. With such a broad range of businesses, the company has a reputation for safety, security, and consistent performance. It's important to note that Berkshire Hathaway is the only blue chip stock on this list that doesn't pay a dividend. CEO Warren Buffett has one of the most impressive track records of market-beating returns in history and prefers investing the company's cash to paying dividends. His strategy has worked out great for shareholders so far.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.74%) has been a leader in the beverage industry for more than a century, with its namesake soft drink spawning a global empire. Yet Coca-Cola has also changed with the times and now provides a much broader array of products, including juices, sports drinks, and bottled water tailored for more health-conscious consumers. Coca-Cola particularly stands out for increasing its dividend. Its streak of consecutive annual dividend payment increases dates back to the early 1960s, a track record placing it among the top 10 dividend stocks on the market.\n\n4. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.08%) is well known for its popular consumer products, including baby shampoo, Band-Aids, and Tylenol pain reliever. However, J&J separated its consumer health products business into a new company called Kenvue (KVUE -0.24%) through a stock spinoff completed in May 2023. The two companies are separate entities, but J&J still owned roughly 90% of Kenvue stock at the time of the spinoff, so it remains heavily invested in its major consumer products brands. Even with the spinoff, J&J is a true healthcare giant and makes a wide array of medical devices to help doctors and other medical professionals perform lifesaving procedures. Johnson & Johnson also has a vast pharmaceutical business and produces drugs, such as the arthritis treatment Remicade, prostate cancer drug Zytiga, and psoriasis drug Stelara. Spinning off Kenvue has also positioned J&J for better growth because the consumer health products business was generally considered the weaker of the company's segments. Johnson & Johnson has been restructured around its highly regarded pharmaceuticals and medical devices segments, and these businesses have promising long-term growth outlooks.\n\n5. American Express\n\nFinancial giant American Express (AXP -2.61%) is another blue chip stalwart to consider. It's both a credit card company and a payments network. Its main revenue generators are credit card fees and transaction processing fees. With new users and higher transaction volume, the company is poised to increase both revenue streams. It's more than 170 years old, but it's staying relevant: More than 75% of new consumer gold and consumer platinum card accounts in 2023 were opened by millennials and Gen Z consumers. Adoption and spending among customers in the combined demographic category continued to move even higher in 2024 -- an encouraging sign. American Express' management believes it can expand profits at a double-digit pace in years to come, and it plans to pay out roughly a quarter of its profits as shareholder dividends. It announced a 17% increase in its dividend in March 2024. Ongoing earnings growth should lead to additional increases in future years.\n\nDefinition Icon Gen Z The generation of people immediately following the millennials. They were born between 1996 and 2012.\n\nA bigger list A bigger list of blue chips Investors have a sizable number of blue chip stocks to choose from. Here's a list of 20 more:\n\nWhy invest? Investing in blue chip companies Blue chip stocks are smart choices for investors of all kinds. Beginning investors are likely familiar with the products and services of blue chip companies. Familiarity with a company makes buying shares more comfortable, and it's exciting to become a partial owner of a business you know. Meanwhile, long-time investors will have seen blue chip stocks rise to the top over the long haul, outlasting their weaker rivals and finding ways to stay relevant and continue growing, even as their industries change. Investors of all experience levels can appreciate the stability and reliability blue chip businesses give to shareholders. Many of these companies pay great dividends and have payout growth streaks that have earned them a spot among the illustrious ranks of the Dividend Kings.\n\nETFs and mutual funds Hands-off investing with blue chip funds Investors interested in blue chips may also want to consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. Blue chip-focused ETFs and mutual funds bundle numerous blue chip stocks into a single security, offering a simple way to diversify across many high-quality stocks and build exposure to industries ranging from technology and hardware to pharmaceuticals and electric utilities. These investment vehicles also tend to be less volatile than individual stocks, making them particularly appealing to people who are retired or nearing retirement. Blue chip ETFs and mutual funds can also be a good fit for younger investors seeking the defensive advantages of diversification and those who don't have the time to research individual stocks adequately. Alternatively, blue chip ETFs can offer a narrower concentration of high-quality stocks than an S&P 500-tracking ETF or a Nasdaq-tracking ETF.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nBalancing your portfolio Blue chips in a well-balanced portfolio If you're looking for maximum growth in your stock investments, you'll also want to go beyond blue chip stocks to look at some up-and-coming small-cap stocks of innovative young companies seeking to disrupt their larger rivals. These high-growth upstarts aim to be the blue chip companies of tomorrow. However, just about every investor can benefit from having a portion of their portfolio invested in blue chip stocks. It doesn't have to be a set percentage; investors will have varying viewpoints about how much risk they want to assume. But the more you want to preserve and protect the money you have invested in the stock market, the more attractive blue chip stocks will be as you try to meet your objectives and reach your long-term financial goals.\n\nFAQs\n\nBlue chip stocks FAQs What are blue chip stocks? angle-down angle-up Blue chip stocks are stocks of large, well-known, and widely respected companies.

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.59%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 1.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.63%.\n\nThe construction equipment company's shares have seen a decrease of 9.33% over the last month, not keeping up with the Industrial Products sector's loss of 7.14% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.42%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Caterpillar in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.32, down 22.86% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $14.65 billion, indicating a 7.29% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nCAT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.77 per share and revenue of $63.29 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -9.73% and -2.34%, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Caterpillar. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, there's been an 8.28% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Caterpillar currently has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nLooking at valuation, Caterpillar is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.2. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 10.8.\n\nInvestors should also note that CAT has a PEG ratio of 1.83 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate.

            "content": "In the hidden corners of the world, caterpillars and ants have a remarkably specialized relationship. The caterpillars secrete a sweet, nectar-like substance that ants feed on, and the ants often protect the growing caterpillars from predators.\n\nThis interesting relationship, which exists between ants and the larvae of some species of the Riodinidae family (metalmark butterflies), is so particular that each species of caterpillar interacts with only one species of ant.\n\nScientists have now investigated the complex mechanisms of this mutualistic partnership.\n\nThey show that chemical signals and sweet secretions determine whether the ant response is one of protection or destruction.\n\nCaterpillar protection from ants\n\nIn tropical forests, caterpillars provide an important food source to many insectivores. Caterpillar mortality is inevitably high, unless the adult butterfly lays its eggs on a plant that is inhabited by the correct species of ant.\n\nThe research was conducted by Luan Dias Lima during her postdoctoral studies at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Ribeir\u00e3o Preto School of Philosophy, Sciences, and Letters ( FFCLRP-USP ).\n\nThe ants and caterpillars were collected at the Serra das Araras Ecological Station in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chemical signals produced by caterpillars. The goal was to understand how ants can identify specific types of caterpillars as those to protect or those to kill.\n\nThe findings suggest that this relationship is delicately balanced as each species of ant recognizes only one species of caterpillar as worthy of protection.\n\nThe ants will kill any other caterpillars, even if they secrete the sweet liquid that is believed to promote protection.\n\nChemical signals and sweet secretions\n\nIn the experiments, the researchers focused on caterpillars of the species Juditha molpe , which live in harmony with ants of the species Dolichoderus bispinosus .\n\nThe team also studied caterpillars of the species Nymphidium chione , which are found only where there are ants of the species Pheidole biconstricta .\n\nThey analyzed the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) present on the ants, caterpillars and plants. CHCs are chemical compounds that are found in the coverings of plants and insects, and play a vital function in waterproofing, communication , and species recognition.\n\n\"We found insect and plant CHCs to be quite different from each other. In caterpillars, they signal food for ants. The caterpillars in our experiment offered a sweet secretion, allowing them to be recognized and protected by specific ant species,\" explained Lima, the study\u2019s first author.\n\nThis sugary secretion not only promotes recognition but also cements the partnership between these species by offering the ants a source of food.\n\nIn return for the nectar, the ants defend the caterpillars from predators, thus improving their chances of survival.\n\nWhen ants turn hostile\n\nHowever, when the researchers mixed up the ant-caterpillar pairings, the harmonious alliance turned hostile, and destroyed the delicate balance that sustains this symbiotic relationship .\n\nAt first, the unfamiliar ants showed little interest in the caterpillars, seemingly indifferent to their presence. They ignored them until they discovered the caterpillar organ that secretes the nectar, which momentarily piqued the ants' curiosity.\n\nTheir curiosity soon turned to aggression, however, and they began to behave erratically, opening their mandibles and biting the larvae. What started as a potential new alliance quickly devolved into a deadly confrontation.\n\n\"Almost all of the caterpillars were killed during this pair-switching treatment. Soldiers of the species P. biconstricta even used their strong mandibles to cut J. molpe into pieces,\" said Lima.\n\nThe importance of the right partnership\n\nWhy are caterpillars relying on ants when things can go so badly wrong? It turns out that ant protection is so important to the caterpillars that adult female butterflies lay eggs only on plant species colonized by the right ant species.\n\nThe life of the developing young caterpillars depends on their protection from ants. Without this protection, predators would destroy them.\n\nIn the future, the scientists aim to investigate whether CHCs also serve as a deterrent against other natural enemies like parasitoids.\n\nEvolution of caterpillar-ant relationships\n\nThe exclusivity of these caterpillar-ant partnerships raises intriguing questions about their evolutionary origins.\n\nScientists suggest that these relationships may have developed through a long process of co-evolution, where both species adapted to each other over time.\n\nOne theory proposes that ancestral caterpillars, once vulnerable to predation, evolved the ability to secrete nectar as a survival strategy, and gradually refined their chemical signals to align perfectly with specific ant species.\n\nIn turn, ants learned to recognize these caterpillars as a valuable food source, strengthening the mutual dependence between them.\n\nThe evolution of such specialized interactions likely resulted from a long history of natural selection .\n\nCaterpillars that failed to match their chemical profiles to local ants faced higher risks of mortality, while those that adapted found a niche where they could thrive.\n\nBy studying these ancient alliances, researchers hope to uncover broader patterns in insect evolution and symbiosis, and to shed light on how cooperation between different species shapes ecosystems.\n\nAlso contributing to the study were University of S\u00e3o Paulo , the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul , and the Federal University of Alagoas .\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Insect Science .\n\n-----\n\nLike what you read?

            "content": "In this Friday, Oct. 12, 2012, photo, a construction worker finishes a roof in Chicago, Illinois. [AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh]\n\nTwo Chicago construction workers were electrocuted Tuesday morning while working on the newly built Grace Manor Apartments in Lawndale on the city\u2019s West Side.\n\nA 33-year-old construction worker died from his injuries. A 26-year-old worker was rushed to a local hospital and was reported in good condition and recovering. The names of the workers have not been released.\n\nBoth workers were on a mobile elevated work platform, about five stories high, attaching metal framing to the outside of the building. The equipment and building materials connected with power lines, energizing the platform and setting it on fire. The 33-year-old touched the railing of the lift and was electrocuted, according to police.\n\nWitnesses told local ABC7 News, \u201cYou just feel so helpless at that point, because it\u2019s like, you know you want to help, but it\u2019s nothing you can do. My heart just goes out to the whole work team here.\u201d\n\nParamedics and firefighters waited for ComEd to halt the flow of electricity in order to extinguish the fire and then take the workers to hospitals.\n\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched a six-month investigation of the employer, Interlayer Corp. as well as Burling Builders, Inc., who served as the general contractors for the building. The contractors could be found in violation of OSHA Standard 1926.20(b)\u2014employer accident prevention responsibilities. These include identifying electrical hazards while operating equipment near an energized overhead power line.\n\nThe OSHA investigation will likely result in at most a token fine. OSHA\u2019s maximum penalties in 2025 for serious and other-than-serious violations is $16,550 per violation, and maximum penalty for willful or repeated violations is $165,514 per violation.\n\nFines amounting to a few thousand dollars are merely a cost of doing business and do not fundamentally impact large, deep-pocketed employers. The project the two workers were killed on cost an estimated $40 million.\n\nLast year, two Chicago construction workers, David O\u2019Donnell, age 27, and Jeffrey Spyrka, age 36, fell nine stories from a scaffolding at a construction site at the University of Chicago Medical Center campus, resulting in the death of O\u2019Donnell and critically injuring Spyrka, who somehow survived. The result of the OSHA investigation into that incident was a fine for two companies\u2014$41,480 for Turner Construction and $32,264 for New Horizon Steel. Last year, a 24-year-old man was killed when sheet metal fell on him at DPR Manufacturing in Michigan, a death that resulted in an insulting fine of just $7,000.\n\nIn an another tragedy, 28-year-old Caterpillar worker Daulton Simmers was killed within seconds by molten metal at the Mapleton, Illinois Caterpillar foundry near Peoria. The foundry has a record of unsafe conditions, and three workers have died there in the last few years. The $145,000 fine by OSHA for the death of Steven Dierkes, another worker at the same foundry who fell into a vat of molten metal and died of \u201cthermal annihilation,\u201d was immediately contested by Caterpillar.\n\nIndustrial deaths are increasingly frequent, due to lax regulations and the lack of any real oversight or enforcement of safety rules by pro-company unions.\n\nIn the United States, thousands of workers die or are injured every year. Across all industries, a worker died every 99 minutes from a work-related injury in 2023, the last tally of workplace deaths reported.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics documented 5,283 fatal work injuries in 2023, a 4.2 percent decrease from 2022. These figures show what a slaughterhouse American factories and industries have become, as companies coin massive profits at the expense of their workers\u2019 lives and health.\n\nIn the construction industry alone, fatalities have hit their highest number in more than a decade, with 1,075 deaths in 2023.\n\nWith the Trump administration looking to gut even the meager protections federal regulatory agencies give, such as OSHA, this trend will only intensify with the full complicity of the trade union bureaucracies and the capitalist political parties.",

            "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Caterpillar Inc. ( ) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Caterpillar's Debt?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Caterpillar had US$38.3b in debt in December 2024; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$6.17b in cash leading to net debt of about US$32.2b.\n\nHow Strong Is Caterpillar's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Caterpillar had liabilities of US$32.3b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$6.17b in cash and US$9.52b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$52.6b.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Caterpillar is worth a massive US$163.6b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nWe'd say that Caterpillar's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.1), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 452 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Notably Caterpillar's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Caterpillar can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Caterpillar recorded free cash flow worth 64% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nOn our analysis Caterpillar's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Caterpillar is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nIf you're looking to trade Caterpillar , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

(more)\n\nKushner grew up in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and attended Columbia University and New York University. His early plays include La Fin de la Baleine: An Opera for the Apocalypse (1983), A Bright Room Called Day (1985), Yes, Yes, No, No (1985), and Stella (1987). His major work, Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, consists of two lengthy plays that deal with political issues and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s while meditating on change and loss\u2014two prominent themes throughout Kushner\u2019s oeuvre. The first part, Millennium Approaches (1990), won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for best play; the second, Perestroika (1991), also won a Tony Award for best play. Angels in America proved to be extremely popular for a work of its imposing length (the two parts run seven hours in total), and it was adapted for an Emmy Award-winning television film that aired in 2003.\n\nKushner\u2019s subsequent plays include Slavs! (1994); A Dybbuk; or, Between Two Worlds (1995), an adaptation of S. Ansky\u2019s Yiddish classic Der Dibek; Henry Box Brown; or, The Mirror of Slavery (1998); and Homebody/Kabul (1999), which addresses the relationship between Afghanistan and the West. He also wrote the book for the musical Caroline, or Change (1999). His unfinished Only We Who Guard the Mystery Shall Be Unhappy, written in response to the Iraq War, was performed in a number of readings in 2004, and his translation of Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children was staged in New York City in 2006. Kushner\u2019s The Intelligent Homosexual\u2019s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures (2009) is a naturalistic drama about an extended family of intellectuals dealing with their patriarch\u2019s desire to die by suicide.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nIn addition to his work for the stage, Kushner contributed screenplays to Steven Spielberg\u2019s films Munich (2005; cowritten with Eric Roth), Lincoln (2012), and The Fabelmans (2022; cowritten with Spielberg), all of which earned Kushner Academy Award nominations. He also wrote the script for Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story (2021). In addition, Kushner authored the children\u2019s book Brundibar (2003; illustrated by Maurice Sendak) and coedited (with Alisa Solomon) the essay collection Wrestling with Zion: Progressive Jewish-American Responses to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (2003). He received the National Medal of Arts in 2013.",

One of these families (Riodinidae) includes two species that interact solely with two species of ants.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Insect Science, researchers in Brazil affiliated with the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL) show that this interaction is highly specific in the sense that each caterpillar species interacts only with one ant species. The study was supported by FAPESP.\n\nIn an experiment performed by the researchers involving switched caterpillar-ant pairs, the ants attacked and killed the caterpillars even when the latter used specific organs to secrete a sugary liquid that should have assured protection by ants.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that cover the outermost layer (cuticle) of virtually all plants and insects, serving as a waterproofing agent and as a communication signal, among other functions.\n\n\u201cWe found insect and plant CHCs to be quite different from each other. In caterpillars, they signal food for ants. The caterpillars in our experiment offered a sweet secretion that enabled them to be recognized and protected by certain ant species,\u201d said Luan Dias Lima, first author of the study, which was conducted as part of her postdoctoral research at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Ribeir\u00e3o Preto School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCLRP-USP), with funding from FAPESP.\n\nIn a previous study, the researchers demonstrated that other species that interact with ants may use a different strategy, hiding from the ants by releasing the same odor as the plant they inhabit (read more at: agencia.fapesp.br/34787).\n\nThis latest study is part of the project \u201cThe evolution of caste plasticity and caste dimorphism in insect societies\u201d, supported by FAPESP and led by F\u00e1bio Santos do Nascimento, a professor at FFCLRP-USP. Another co-author, Diego Santana Assis, received a doctoral scholarship from FAPESP while studying at the same institution.\n\nCaterpillar in pieces\n\nIn the experiment, the researchers collected caterpillars of the species Juditha molpe, which live in harmony with ants of the species Dolichoderus bispinosus, and caterpillars of the species Nymphidium chione, which are found only where there are ants of the species Pheidole biconstricta. The caterpillars were collected at the Serra das Araras Ecological Station in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.\n\nIn one group, the researchers switched only the plant caterpillars and kept the same ant species. In another, they switched the pairs, putting J. molpe caterpillars with P. biconstricta ants and N. chione caterpillars with D. bispinosusants, while combining all of them with the same plant genus (Inga spp).\n\n\n\nPheidole biconstricta ants protecting Nymphidium chione caterpillars (foto: H\u00e9lio Soares J\u00fanior)\n\nIn the first group, the interaction was the same as it had been with the previous plant, and the pairs interacted harmoniously. The ants touched the caterpillars with their feelers until they located two openings to specific organs for communication by the caterpillars with ants. The caterpillars secreted a nectar, which the ants consumed, and soon afterward the ants began protecting the caterpillars.\n\nWith different ants, however, the outcome was unfavorable to the caterpillars. In this context, the ants at first ignored the caterpillars until they found the opening to one of the specialized nectar secretion organs. After the ants touched the site with their feelers, the caterpillars secreted the nectar, which initially calmed the ants.\n\nThis effect was short-lived, however. It ended when a caterpillar was unable to go on producing the nectar, or when the ants touched the region near another organ used solely for interaction with ants, and the organ did not react. After inspecting the caterpillar a little longer, the ants began behaving aggressively, opening their mandibles and biting.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of the caterpillars were killed during this pair-switching treatment. Soldiers of the species P. biconstricta even used their strong mandibles to cut J. molpe into pieces,\u201d Lima said.\n\nFinding ants to pair with is so important for the caterpillars, he explained, that adult females lay eggs only on the plant species inhabited by the right ant species.\n\n\u201cWhen the eggs hatch, the ants will protect the caterpillars from predation by other animals. Without the ants\u2019 protection, they die before their time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers now plan to find out whether the small amounts of CHC also ward off attacks by other natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids that use chemical clues to locate prey and hosts.\n\nThe article \u201cChemical conspicuousness, ant organs, and specificity in myrmecophilous caterpillars partitioning ant-plant systems\u201d is at: onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1744-7917.13474.",

(NYSE:CAT) stands against other cheap global stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape has drastically changed since the beginning of the decade, with the COVID-19 pandemic followed by worldwide spikes in inflation leading to completely different economic tendencies if compared to the previous decade. The conflict in Ukraine brought even more geopolitical turmoil, with many analysts believing that this war represents the end of several political and economic alliances, notably between Europe and Russia on the one hand, and between the USA and China on the other hand. The first so-called alliance of the past led to strong economic growth in both the EU and Russia, as the former used cheap energy and commodities from Russia to fuel its industrial sector (particularly that of Germany), while Russia itself had the freedom to export its capital and source the technology and talent it needed for development. The second so-called alliance, between the USA and China, fueled unprecedented growth in China, in a journey to secure the American market and industry with cheap electronics, components, consumer products, and everything the country needed to grow its technological leadership.\n\nALSO READ: 10 Cheap New Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nAs the Ukraine conflict unfolded in Eastern Europe, some tendencies from the times of the Cold War proliferated again, with the East and the West isolating each other, as the USA and Europe aligned to support Ukraine, while China had the back of Russia. The aforementioned \u201cold\u201d alliances were shattered, and each region started to face new problems \u2013 the EU\u2019s energy security faced unprecedented risks, with energy prices skyrocketing across central and eastern Europe, leading to a slowdown in economic growth and tremendous pressure on the regular consumer. The US and China escalated the trade wars that had their roots in the previous decade \u2013 in an attempt to protect its technological leadership, particularly in the AI field, the US imposed restrictions to export semiconductor equipment used in the production of state-of-the-art chips, such as powerful GPUs to train AI models. China imposed some retaliatory restrictions regarding several strategic commodities sourced by the US. Even though the trade wars are still not fully enforced by both parties, the tensions persist and have deep implications for the financial markets and the global economy.\n\nAs geographic markets became more disconnected, the stock markets in the USA, Europe, and APAC had quite different performances, with the former leading by a wide margin in 2023-2024. For reference, the 5-year performance of the German stock market lagged that of the US by 57%, China lagged the US by 94%, and Japan lagged the US by 58%. In light of the proliferating geopolitical challenges, which still persist as the new Trump 2.0 administration threatens tariffs on its supposed allies as well as China again, we believe that global companies that are diversified across geographies will be the most favored in the years to come, due to stronger potential to diversify idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, as the US stock market is currently near all-time highs after a stellar 2023-2024 period, cheap companies trading under 15.0x forward P/E might be the only viable option to buy in the current expensive market. Successful investors like Warren Buffet acknowledged that an overstretched valuation could hinder the subsequent performance of a stock. Here\u2019s precisely what he said during his 1998 letter to shareholders:\n\n\u201cFor the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a Finviz screener to filter the largest stocks trading at under 15x forward P/E and analyzed the companies\u2019 filings in order to identify 7 promising global companies that generated at least 40% of revenue in the last financial year from outside the US. For each company, we also include the number of hedge funds that own the company as of Q4 2024 and rank them in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nForward P/E ratio as of February 24th: 14.81x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is a global leader in construction and mining equipment, engines, and industrial power systems. Its heavy machinery is widely used across infrastructure, energy, and resource industries, benefiting from sustained global investment in large-scale projects. Beyond equipment sales, CAT generates strong recurring revenue through parts, services, and digital solutions that enhance fleet efficiency. As the industry shifts toward automation and sustainability, the company is investing in electrified machinery, autonomous technology, and alternative fuels to strengthen its position and adapt to the evolving demands of the heavy equipment market.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has demonstrated remarkable growth since 2017, with earnings power tripling and sales increasing by 50%. The company\u2019s success has been driven by its strategy for profitable growth, focusing on operational excellence, expanded services, and sustainability. A key component of their success has been the Operating and Execution model, which enables a more granular understanding of financial performance across products. The company has significantly improved its services business, targeting $28 billion in revenue by 2026, with current progress at $23 billion as of 2023.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has demonstrated strong cash generation capabilities, consistently producing $5-10 billion in free cash flow since 2017, except during the 2020 pandemic. The company is experiencing significant growth in the Energy & Transportation segment, particularly driven by data center demand and distributed power generation opportunities. In the mining sector, CAT has made progress in autonomous solutions, making it economically viable for smaller fleets of 10-12 trucks compared to the previous requirement of 70+ trucks. The company maintains a strong balance sheet and has demonstrated resilience during market downturns while continuing to invest in growth opportunities across its business segments. Looking forward, management sees significant organic growth opportunities, particularly in services, distributed generation, data centers, and mining sector growth driven by electrification trends.\n\nOverall, CAT ranks 5th on our list of cheap global stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Credit: Carol La Rosa - Shutterstock.\n\nIn Malaga, the pine processionary plague, a natural phenomenon resulting from abnormally warmer weather, has been causing a surge in the poisonous caterpillars in the Costa del Sol around its pine trees.\n\nThe long head-to-tail rows of caterpillars, which devour needles from pine trees, pose a significant hazard to both humans and animals due to their tiny venomous stinging hairs. The College of Veterinarians of Malaga warns of the need for prevention and control plans for these caterpillars, as they can cause a variety of nasty symptoms when people or animals come in contact with their hairs. Dogs are particularly at risk as their natural curiosity often tempts them to sniff the furry little insects.\n\nThe National Association of Environmental Health Companies (ANECPLA) is calling for much more to be done in council prevention plans in the spring and autumn seasons to minimise the harmful effects of the processionary plague.\n\nCouncils take measures against processionary caterpillar\n\nMalaga council has already initiated preventive biological treatments against the processionary caterpillars in suburban parks and forest areas of the city that contain pine forests, aiming to reduce the threat of caterpillar proliferation of pine processionary caterpillars in spring.\n\nIn conclusion, the pine processionary plague poses a significant threat to both humans and animals in the Malaga region, and it is crucial for local administrations to implement effective prevention campaigns and control plans to mitigate its harmful effects.\n\nProcessionary caterpillar: tips for dog owners\n\nAdvice for dog owners is to stay vigilant, particularly during late winter to early spring when these caterpillars are most active \u2013 around now, actually, since it\u2019s February, 2025. For example, Marbella se Queja, the social media platform, are currently warning a proliferation of nests in trees in the zone of Santa Maria Golf, and to not walk your dogs there.\n\nFirst off, keep your dog on a lead/leash when walking near pine trees or wooded areas where the critters might be. The caterpillars often travel in nose-to-tail lines or hang out in silky nests in the branches, where sometimes they fall onto unsuspecting passersby.\n\nIf your dog gets too curious \u2013 sniffing, pawing, or, worse, trying to eat them \u2013 it can lead to serious trouble.\n\nThose hairs are loaded with a protein that causes irritation or allergic reactions, and direct contact can be even nastier. If you suspect your dog has come into direct contact with processionary caterpillars, rinse around nose and mouth area with cold water and without rubbing and seek veterinarian advice if irritation continues.",

            "content": "In Spain, the Guardia Civil has issued an alert on its social networks about a danger to pets, especially dogs, during walks in parks and woodland. These are processionary caterpillars, an insect that, despite its harmless appearance, represents a significant risk to the health of animals and children.\n\nThe Guardia Civil has warned that these caterpillars have stinging hairs that can cause very serious reactions in animals on contact with the skin or mucous membranes, releasing a toxin that causes irritation, inflammation and, in severe cases, necrosis.\n\nThe Guardia Civil recommends taking extreme precautions when walking your dog and avoiding areas where the presence of caterpillars has been detected. If you suspect that your pet has come into contact with them, it is crucial to act quickly to prevent the animal from licking the affected area, which could aggravate the reaction.\n\nThe processionary pine caterpillar takes refuge in silk bags on pine trees during the winter. As the larvae mature, they descend from the trees in the characteristic \u2018procession\u2019 from which they take their name, looking for a place to bury themselves and become a butterfly. It is at this moment that they release their stinging hairs as a defence mechanism, posing a risk to the health of people and animals.\n\nAccording to animal health experts, the most common symptoms of contact with the stinging hairs of the processionary caterpillar in dogs include lesions on the tongue, excessive drooling, swelling of the mouth and throat, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can cause anaphylactic shock and require urgent veterinary attention.\n\nIn addition to dogs, children are also particularly vulnerable to the effects of the processionary caterpillar. Contact with their hair can cause rashes, intense itching, inflammation and, sometimes, severe allergic reactions. It is therefore essential that parents are vigilant and prevent children from approaching or touching these caterpillars.",

The mine currently operates Sandvik and Caterpillar LHDs and is in the process of adding Sandvik haul trucks. Eldorado is also implementing autonomous tramming for its teleremote haul trucks at Lamaque.\n\nThe company concluded: \u201cLooking ahead, we have a significant opportunity at our Lamaque Complex. In December, we announced our inaugural mineral reserve at Ormaque, with 619,000 oz of gold. With the development of the Ormaque deposit, we will be adding a second underground mine to the Lamaque Complex, which provides operational flexibility and efficiency as we leverage the existing plant and infrastructure.

Featuring foreword by Shardha Sharma, Founder & CEO of YourStory Media, and Afterword by Sachin Karnik, Founder & CEO of The Great Unicorn Hunt, this book showcases the extraordinary stories of 32 trailblazing women who have broken barriers and redefined success.\n\n\n\nWith stories spanning leadership, entrepreneurship, technology, and social impact, this book offers inspiration, guidance, and reassurance to anyone seeking mentorship or navigating uncharted paths. These are just a few of the extraordinary stories that illuminate the pages of this book. Each narrative offers a glimpse into struggles, breakthroughs, and unwavering dedication to making a difference.\n\n\n\nHere is an excerpt from the book:\n\n\n\nThe Butterfly Effect in Business and Life\n\nBhawna Bhatia\n\n\n\nBhawna\u2019s story is one of extraordinary metamorphosis \u2014 much like a caterpillar that doesn\u2019t transform just once, but continuously throughout its life. She has turned the cocoon of self-doubt and conventional expectations into wings of success and self-discovery. From a shy, asthmatic child to a confident professional breaking barriers in the tech world, her path has seen a series of unexpected evolutions.\n\n\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nNow an experienced thought-leader in the computer software industry and an Architect Advisor at SAP, Bhawna\u2019s career is a testament to resilience, adaptability and continuous learning. With expertise across various technologies and industries, she has consistently driven impactful business outcomes. But her path to success was far from straightforward.\n\n\n\nI come from a family that has gone through India\u2019s partition, Bhawna begins, her voice tinged with pride and reflection. My grandmother stayed in Lahore in a transit camp before moving to India. She wasn\u2019t educated herself, but she ensured all her kids were educated. She was very progressive for her time.\n\n\n\nBhawna\u2019s story is one of extraordinary metamorphosis \u2014 much like a caterpillar that doesn\u2019t transform just once, but continuously throughout its life. She has turned the cocoon of self-doubt and conventional expectations into wings of success and self-discovery. From a shy, asthmatic child to a confident professional breaking barriers in the tech world, her path has seen a series of unexpected evolutions.\n\n\n\nThis progressive spirit ran through the family. Bhawna\u2019s father and mother, coming from a not very well-to-do but educated family, broke barriers to become doctors. These early influences shaped Bhawna\u2019s worldview and instilled in her a deep respect for education and perseverance.\n\n\n\nHowever, Bhawna's childhood wasn\u2019t without its challenges. Up to the third grade, I was a very shy child, she recalls. I could not speak in class and had major confidence issues. I would cry to not go to school. Because of childhood asthma, I would have anxiety issues every morning. The turning point came in the third grade when Bhawna encountered a teacher who severely impacted her confidence. She was cruel, Bhawna says, her voice hardening at the memory. She would throw personal insults at us without understanding why we had ended up in that situation. By the end, she killed my confidence so much that I just did not want to go to school.\n\n\n\nBut life had other plans for Bhawna. In fourth grade, she met a teacher who would change the course of her life. She saw something in me that I did not recognise, Bhawna remembers fondly. She would personally spend time with me and be very appreciative even for the small things I did. It gave me so much confidence that I transformed as a person. This transformation was nothing short of remarkable. From a struggling student, Bhawna blossomed into a top performer. I was getting C\u2019s and B\u2019s in class, and suddenly I became an A-grade student. I started figuring in the top ten of my class, she says with pride. I topped my 12th standard and was a gold medallist. Imagine a student who up to the third grade could not speak in class transforming into a student who could top 12th standard.\n\n\n\nCareer Beginnings and Challenges\n\nBhawna \u2018s journey took an unexpected turn when she chose to pursue Economics Honours at Lady Shri Ram College, despite having no prior background in the subject. This decision set the tone for her career, marked by a willingness to venture into uncharted territories.\n\n\n\nI am a science with biology student who chose Economics Honours without having studied Economics in my high school, Bhawna explains. Later, I went into a BPO in a procurement pre-sales role. Procurement is something that you never study in school or college. But again I encountered amazing mentors who helped me shape my career.\n\n\n\nHowever, her college life wasn\u2019t without its challenges. In her second year, Bhawna faced a significant mental health crisis. I had a mental breakdown during my exams, accompanied by panic attacks, she recalls. My mother, who is a doctor, had to put me on antidepressants. This experience taught Bhawna invaluable lessons about stress management and mental health. Now, I never let myself take stress professionally, she says. That moment made me realise that till you\u2019re not dying and you\u2019re there, everything can be solved. It may be hard, it may take time, patience and resilience but its never unsurmountable.\n\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\n\nA Legacy of Impact\n\nBhawna emphasises the importance of continuous growth and self-discovery. Your personality is like an onion. You have to keep peeling the layers, one by one, and that is the only way you can truly discover yourself, she reflects.\n\n\n\nAs Bhawna approaches her next innings, she\u2019s contemplating her larger purpose in life. I want to start mentoring people, helping them grow in their careers and shape their trajectories, she shares. She also dreams of setting up a space where people can work on their mental well-being, inspired by her own experiences and her family\u2019s medical background.\n\n\n\nTo young women, Bhawna offers this advice: Break the mental barriers in your head. Break the barriers that somebody will not allow you to do something. If you have a desire to do something, put your heart into it and go all out. You don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone, except yourself.\n\n\n\nBhawna Bhatia\u2019s journey from a shy, asthmatic child to a confident, successful professional and aspiring mentor, is a powerful reminder that our potential is not defined by our starting point, but by our willingness to learn, adapt, and push beyond conventional boundaries.\n\n\n\nSuccess Mantras\n\n\u2756 Never Stop Learning: Be a student for life. Your education doesn\u2019t end with college.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Break Conventional Barriers: Don\u2019t be confined by traditional career paths. You can excel in any field with passion and logic.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Your Mind is Your Biggest Obstacle: Overcome mental barriers to unlock your true potential.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Embrace Continuous Growth: Your personality is like an onion\u2014 keep peeling layers to discover yourself.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Value Time: Time doesn\u2019t wait for anyone. Make the most of every moment.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Be Humble: Humility keeps you grounded and open to new learning experiences.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Read the Room: Be aware of your environment and adapt accordingly, especially in professional settings.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Balance Confidence with Openness: Have opinions, but be open to learning from others.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Create Your Support System: Build a circle of supporters who will be your flag bearers.\n\n\n\n\u2756 Give Back: Use your experiences and success to help others grow.\n\n\n\n[The excerpt reproduced with the permission of the publishers.]",

            "content": "Caterpillar (CAT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -16.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 14.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Caterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.36 per share, indicating a change of -22.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.3%. This estimate has changed -8.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.11 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Caterpillar is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.65 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.29 billion and $66.68 billion estimates indicate -2.3% and +5.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCaterpillar reported revenues of $16.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. EPS of $5.14 for the same period compares with $5.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.57%. The EPS surprise was +3.42%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCaterpillar is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Caterpillar. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

And, one gardener recently found this out the hard way.\n\nThe aptly named electric caterpillar stung professional gardener Melita Rumley last week while she was tending to a golden cane palm tree in a yard on Queensland's Magnetic Island and was left with bumps on her skin that were \"stingy\". And incredibly, it's not the first time she's encountered the insect \u2014 in February 2023 she was left with tentacle-like marks across the back of her leg that took three months to heal.\n\n\"I was working in a garden and as I crouched down it was squished behind my knee, I didn't realise it was there,\" she told Yahoo News. \"The feeling was like an electric zap, I jumped back pretty quickly.\n\n\"Don't take these little bad guys for granted!\" she said, explaining many in her area have suffered from \"horrendous\" reactions after making contact with the critters.\n\nThe 'cute' caterpillars are brightly coloured and blend in among vegetation. Source: Facebook/Maggie'sGardenGirls\n\nSpikes inflict 'significant pain' when stung, expert warns\n\nElectric caterpillars are found on a range of vegetation in Aussie gardens but particularly enjoy munching on lilly pillies or types of palm. They belong to the limacodidae family and are categorised as such for their impressive spikes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Many of this group contain caterpillars with spikes and hairs that are quite brightly coloured and can cause significant pain when stung,\" entomologist Caitlyn Forster from the University of Sydney told Yahoo News. \"Research suggests that the species of caterpillar sting is more painful than a bee sting and the pain also lasts a bit longer.\"\n\nThe sting from an electric caterpillar can last for days. Source: University of Queensland/Institute for Molecular Bioscience\n\nThe stings inject a venom into the sufferer's skin and can cause severe itching, stinging or burning sensations that last for days, as well as lesions that last for months. However, it's only Queenslanders who have to worry about them \u2014 they're found in the north-east of the state.\n\nI've been stung by an electric caterpillar \u2014 what do I do?\n\nRemove the caterpillar hairs from the skin \u2014 use some kind of adhesive tape, not your hands Wash the area with soapy water and pat dry Apply a cold press for 10-15 minutes Apply an antihistamine cream or take oral antihistamine tablet Monitor for allergic reactions \u2014 seek medical attention if any surface.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

            "content": "Reading time: 2 minutes\n\nThe University of Hawai\u02bbi Insect Museum at Gilmore Hall came alive with curiosity and exploration in celebration of Darwin Day 2025, a global celebration of science, discovery and evolutionary biology. Held every year on February 12, UH M\u0101noa\u2019s event featured interactive exhibits and an adventurous insect-tasting session.\n\nNomi Ruiz, a team member of the UH M\u0101noa College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resilience ( CTAHR ), examined an assortment of insect snacks at the museum before cautiously biting into a dark chocolate-coated cricket. She eyed a tray of chocolate chip cookies made with cricket flour, but decided she had enough six-legged treats for the day. Her food adventure set the tone for the event, which honored Charles Darwin and his groundbreaking contributions to the study of life sciences and natural selection.\n\n\u201cDarwin fundamentally reshaped how we view the natural world,\u201d said Dan Rubinoff, director of the UH Insect Museum and professor at the Department of Plant and Environmental Protection Sciences. \u201cThis international event gives us a chance to celebrate those ideas and their relevance today.\u201d\n\nRubinoff explained how the museum, which is part of the UH M\u0101noa College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resilience, highlights Darwin\u2019s legacy of evolution and understanding how life on Earth is shaped by our environment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important not just for itself, but also for agriculture and conservation, because we have invasive species that come in and replace the native species,\u201d Rubinoff said.\n\nDarwin Day in Hawai\u02bbi\n\nSpencer Pote, a PhD student at UH M\u0101noa, emphasized the importance of celebrating Darwin Day in the islands.\n\n\u201cThe islands act almost like a conveyor belt of evolution, with species diversifying in ways we don\u2019t see anywhere else,\u201d Pote said. \u201dDarwin Day lets us share these incredible stories of natural diversity with the community.\u201d\n\nGal\u00e1pagos finches, rare caterpillars\n\nThe museum buzzed with activity as visitors explored a diverse array of exhibits from UH M\u0101noa\u2019s research labs. Displays featured ocean creatures from Kewalo Marine Lab and mantis shrimp from the Porter Vision Lab. A collection of Gal\u00e1pagos finches and snails from Bishop Museum\u2019s Malacology Research Center were also on display. One of the most fascinating exhibits at the event showcased rare native species such as Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s carnivorous caterpillars alongside invasive insects.\n\n\u201cWe have over half a million specimens,\u201d Rubinoff said. \u201cMany of them date back to 1908, including species now extinct, making this collection invaluable for research and education.\u201d\n\nKTUH radio host Alex Sosa reflected on his first Darwin Day experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to learn so much\u2014from upside-down jellyfish to carnivorous plants. Honestly, I love seeing science come alive in such a fun, interactive way.\u201d",

Their relatively modest power demands make it easier to develop electric alternatives compared to their larger counterparts.\n\nAdditionally, due to their compact size, these machines can operate indoors whether in basements or during demolition which helps reduce emissions and improve health conditions.\n\nGrowing Demand for Electric Wheel Loaders in the Europe Electric Construction Equipment Market\n\nWheel Loaders witnessed a high electrification rate in European countries in 2024. Electrification penetration of wheel loaders is expected to reach around 25% by 2030.\n\nWheel loader is versatile equipment that can operate across construction, mining, & agriculture industries. The utilization of electric wheel loaders is higher as compared to other equipment in the Europe electric construction equipment market due to its extensive usage across different industries. Moreover, electric wheel loaders operate at mining sites that have ample space to install fixed high-power sources to charge wheel loaders.\n\nRise of Fossil Fuel-Free Construction Sites\n\nThere is a growing demand for fossil-fuel-free construction sites across the European countries. The rise in fossil fuel construction sites is aligned with European government sustainability goals.\n\nProminent cities like Helsinki, Oslo, Copenhagen, Vantaa, and Barcelona are dedicated to goals that require fossil-free construction machinery for public projects, striving to reduce emissions and promote the use of zero-emission construction equipment by 2025.\n\nIn 2024, European countries have planned to reduce 20% of carbon emissions from construction machinery by 2025 and reduction of 50% of carbon emissions by 2030 in public projects. This encourages an immediate transition to cleaner technologies driving the Europe electric construction equipment market growth.\n\nGovernment Support for Sustainable Battery Manufacturing\n\nThe evolution of battery technology played a crucial role in promoting the Europe electric construction equipment market. Electrification of construction machinery is required to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the sustainability target set by the governments. Also, battery technology is required to improve energy density, power capacity, long life span, safety & ecological sustainability.\n\nSeveral new initiatives are being promoted by the European Government to support the battery production industry. For instance, Battery 2030+ is a European research initiative aimed at creating sustainable batteries in line with the European Green Deal. It emphasizes the swift discovery of battery interfaces and materials, the integration of cutting-edge functionalities, and interdisciplinary approaches for developing new chemistries.\n\nINDUSTRY RESTRAINTS\n\nLack of Charging Infrastructure\n\nLack of charging infrastructure is one of the major challenges that can impact the Europe electric construction equipment market growth. Urban construction sites currently do not have the essential electric charging infrastructure to support electric construction machinery. This presents a limitation, as the adoption of electric construction machinery in the industry may hinder the overall accessibility and practicality of these machines in urban locations.\n\nSeveral infrastructure development projects happen in underdeveloped regional locations. Therefore, establishing charging infrastructure can be costly due to the need for extensive electrical and network enhancements, limited electricity availability, and high installation expenses.\n\nHigh Cost of Electric Construction Equipment\n\nTransitioning to electric construction machinery offers potential benefits for the construction sector, but it also entails significant initial costs. The increased initial expense of electric machinery is primarily due to expensive batteries and advanced technology, necessitating intricate engineering and costly materials. Furthermore, the limited production scale increases the unit costs, making electric equipment pricier than the well-established diesel technology.\n\nAs per estimates from Volvo CE, a leading manufacturer of construction machines, the average cost of an electric mini excavator is around (~$66,000), whereas its diesel counterpart costs only ($26,000). Conventional machinery is priced at less than half that of electric models based on these average price points. The ownership cost of electric construction equipment is higher than diesel counterparts. Such factors can also hamper Europe electric construction equipment market growth.\n\nVENDOR LANDSCAPE\n\nRecent Developments in Europe Electric Construction Equipment Market:\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery collaborated with a Dutch charging equipment maker and Japanese trading house, Itochu, on mobile charging systems for construction sites in October 2023.\n\nNorth Volt secured a USD 5 billion non-recourse project funding to expand North Volt Ett, marking the largest green loan in Europe in January 2024.\n\nVolvo Group completed the acquisition of the battery business of US-based Proterra Inc. in February 2024 for USD 210 million.\n\nUrban Mobility Systems (UMS) and Ampowr confirmed a partnership in May 2023 to provide advanced energy storage systems to various sectors.\n\nIn February 2024, ACC - Automotive Cells Company secured USD 4.7 billion to build four new gigafactories (battery manufacturing plants) in Europe.\n\nIn collaboration with Gotion High-Tech, ABB signed an MoU in December 2023 to support the development of large-scale lithium-ion battery factories for the European and US EV markets.\n\nAt SaMoTer 2023, Bobcat unveils its latest products, including the robust T86 compact tracked loader catering to the compact track loader demand of Italy.

            "content": "Longtime Caterpillar (CAT -1.85%) shareholders who have ever wondered what it's like to drive one of the company's flagship bulldozers likely got a similar experience through the stock's earth-moving 186% return in the past five years. Despite a volatile macroeconomic environment, the industrial giant has delivered record earnings through its diversified global footprint and impressive strategic execution.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock has hit a bump in the road and is currently under pressure, down about 16% from its 52-week high amid some muted sales guidance for 2025. Does this sell-off represent a new buying opportunity to scoop up shares, or is it a sign to dump the stock before the ground caves in?\n\nLet's discuss what to do with shares of Caterpillar.\n\nThe case to buy or hold Caterpillar stock\n\nCaterpillar is recognized as the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, renowned for its iconic yellow heavy-duty machinery. The company's products, including excavators, giant trucks, specialized engines, and industrial power systems, are considered essential in multiple industries and have a well-deserved reputation for durability.\n\nA long history of innovation has continued with a major effort to integrate more high-tech features and digital connectivity across its lineup. The strategy to introduce more autonomous options, electrified powertrains, and even artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities has helped to diversify the business.\n\nThe impact was evident in 2024 when steps toward financial efficiency to support margins helped push full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up by 3% to $21.90, marking a company record. This was achieved even as total revenue slipped by 5% compared to 2023 balancing weakness in demand from China, alongside mixed trends in North American construction still dealing with high interest rates.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 remains sluggish, with management guiding for another slight decline in full-year sales. According to Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo! Finance, 2025 EPS is projected to fall by 6.5% to $20.47.\n\nNevertheless, the bigger takeaway is a sense of overall fundamental stability. Caterpillar is still generating billions in free cash flow, with management projecting optimism in its ability to return to profitable growth over time.\n\nInvestors who are confident that the current headwinds are simply a bump in the road have plenty of reasons to stick with Caterpillar as a blue chip stock for the long run. A scenario where macroeconomic conditions strengthen could be the catalyst needed for the company to outperform expectations and send the stock to a new all-time high.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 Estimate Revenue (in billions) $64.8 $63.5 Revenue growth (YOY) (3.4%) (2%) Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $21.90 $20.47 Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 3.3% (6.5%)\n\nThe case to sell Caterpillar stock\n\nInvestors typically look to buy stocks that present improving prospects. In this case, the latest update from Caterpillar left a lot to be desired, at a time when the market is facing a new round of uncertainty.\n\nWhile details have not been confirmed, proposed tariffs by the Trump administration on steel and aluminum have the potential to disrupt Caterpillar's manufacturing supply chain, mentioned during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call as a development the company is watching closely. The repercussions could extend into the broader business environment if customer demand slows as a response to an escalating trade war.\n\nAll this is against the backdrop of Caterpillar's valuation. Caterpillar shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17 times its consensus 2025 EPS, a level that matches the five-year average for the earnings multiple, covering a period with stronger growth. One interpretation is that the stock could be overvalued with further room to fall.\n\nInvestors concerned that Caterpillar may struggle for an extended period as its outlook deteriorates could consider selling the stock or at least avoiding it.\n\nDecision time: A wait-and-see approach\n\nThere's a lot to like about Caterpillar as an industrial sector leader that has proven itself more than capable of navigating various market cycles.\n\nThat said, I just don't see enough good news to jump in and buy the stock with confidence for a rebound anytime soon. Current shareholders can likely continue holding the stock looking ahead to the next few quarterly updates for signs of stronger trends. Meanwhile, investors sitting on the sidelines may find better opportunities elsewhere in the stock market right now.",

            "content": "New Zealand\u2019s Bug of the Year competition has crowned an ancient, bizarre, and surprisingly savage predator as its 2024 champion: the New Zealand velvet worm (Peripatoides novaezealandiae).\n\nThis peculiar creature triumphed over the praying mantis and the giant springtail, earning public votes and official recognition from the Entomological Society of New Zealand.\n\nWhile the competition included some incredible contenders\u2014like a bug that practices sexual cannibalism and a springtail so enormous it can\u2019t even jump anymore\u2014it\u2019s hard to argue against the velvet worm\u2019s victory.\n\nThis \u201cliving fossil\u201d has been creeping through forests for half a billion years, perfecting its signature move: shooting slime to trap prey before turning them into soup.\n\nThe Velvet Worm\u2019s Strange, Ancient Design\n\nAt first glance, P. novaezealandiae looks like the result of an evolutionary mix-up: part slug, part worm, part caterpillar, with a velvety body speckled in orange and a set of adorably stubby legs. But this strange appearance isn\u2019t just for show.\n\nScientists consider velvet worms to be a \u201cmissing link\u201d between annelid worms and arthropods, displaying traits of both. What\u2019s even more impressive? They haven\u2019t changed much in 500 million years.\n\nThese creatures were crawling through ancient forests long before dinosaurs roamed the Earth, surviving ice ages, mass extinctions, and the rise of mammals.\n\nTheir resilience has earned them the nickname \u201cliving fossils\u201d, a title they share with creatures like the horseshoe crab and the coelacanth.\n\nA Predator Lurking in the Undergrowth\n\nDon\u2019t let its fuzzy appearance fool you\u2014this is a hunter with a taste for beetle soup. Velvet worms are nocturnal ambush predators, lurking in New Zealand\u2019s damp forests, waiting for unsuspecting prey.\n\nWhen a termite, beetle, or other small invertebrate wanders too close, the velvet worm unleashes a jet of sticky slime from specialized nozzles near its mouth, gluing the victim to the ground.\n\nOnce its prey is immobilized, the velvet worm cuts into it with razor-sharp jaws while injecting digestive saliva to break down its insides. The final step? Sucking up the liquefied remains, leaving behind an empty husk.\n\nA Secretive Survivor Facing New Threats\n\nDespite its long evolutionary history, the New Zealand velvet worm remains poorly studied. It is reclusive, preferring to stay hidden in decaying logs and leaf litter, making population assessments difficult. Scientists don\u2019t even know its exact conservation status.\n\nHowever, like many of New Zealand\u2019s unique creatures, velvet worms face serious threats from habitat destruction and introduced predators like rats, birds, and hedgehogs.\n\nEven human curiosity poses a risk\u2014collectors and researchers sometimes remove them from their habitats, further reducing their numbers.\n\nWhy Bug of the Year Matters\n\nWhile New Zealand\u2019s Bird of the Year competition has drawn international attention with its quirky and unexpected winners (including a drunk pigeon and a rogue bat), the Bug of the Year contest aims to shine a spotlight on overlooked invertebrates.\n\nBy celebrating the velvet worm, conservationists hope to raise awareness about these bizarre, ancient predators before they slip into history.\n\nSo next time you\u2019re walking through a damp New Zealand forest, take a moment to appreciate the tiny, slime-shooting relics beneath your feet. They\u2019ve been here for 500 million years\u2014and with a little help, they might just stick around a little longer.",

The hand crank-starting Tin Lizzie was the first vehicle to have a steering wheel on the left side, came with an optional front windshield (before they were a standard feature), and the transmission was so smooth that virtually anyone could shift the gears. It helped drive an automotive industrial revolution that has since become an essential component of today's global economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, how do Model T Snowmobiles fit in? Well, that \"automobile revolution\" was part of a much larger Second Industrial Revolution that occurred from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, when some genuinely revolutionary inventions were created (the lightbulb, petroleum refining, the tractor, etc.). Trains, motorcycles, and automobiles made moving about the country easier, and big cities with massive skyscrapers started sprouting up.\n\nEnter Virgil White, an inventor and authorized Ford dealer in the tiny town of West Ossipee, New Hampshire, an area that averages 73 inches of snow each year. As the old saying goes, \"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" so instead of creating a whole new vehicle, White built his first converted Model T \"snowmobile\" (a term he coined) in 1913. He patented the conversion kit in 1917 but spent the next five years perfecting the design before finally selling it to the general public during the winter of 1922.\n\nAdvertisement",

What\u2019s even more notable is that the sector ETF\u2019s current positioning suggests the potential for further upside, given its technical setup. Having consolidated for nearly a month, XLI appears to be edging closer to a potential breakout higher, especially as the broader market continues to reach new all-time highs.\n\nWith this outperformance, strong inflows into the sector, and an overall bullish setup, it\u2019s worth looking at industrials and some of the most attractive individual stocks within the sector.\n\nThe Industrial Sector Has Outperformed the Benchmark in 2025\n\nThe industrial sector has outpaced the broader market in 2025 due to several key catalysts. One of the most significant drivers is the trend of reshoring, where manufacturing operations are returning to domestic markets. This shift is driven by geopolitical stability concerns, supply chain resilience, and favorable government policies encouraging local production. As a result, industries such as aerospace, machinery, construction, and transportation, all significant components of XLI, are benefiting substantially.\n\nFurthermore, technological advancements in automation, electric vehicles, and renewable energy infrastructure have fueled increased demand for industrial products. Government investments in infrastructure and defense spending have also provided strong tailwinds for the sector. Notable companies within XLI, including Caterpillar, Deere & Co., and GE Aerospace, continue demonstrating strong fundamentals, contributing to the ETF\u2019s appeal.\n\nAnother factor bolstering the sector\u2019s performance is market rotation. Investors have shifted capital from high-growth technology stocks to cyclical industries, such as industrials, which stand to gain from economic cycles. The XLI ETF\u2019s relatively low expense ratio of 0.09%, a dividend yield of 1.16%, and high liquidity further enhance its attractiveness, drawing increased capital inflows that amplify its performance.\n\nWhile industrials remain sensitive to economic cycles and global trade dynamics, technological innovation, policy support, and investor interest have provided a solid foundation for continued growth in 2025.\n\nGiven these favorable conditions, familiarizing oneself with three of the strongest industrial stocks YTD is well worth it.\n\n3 Industrial Giants Leading the Sector\n\n\n\nAxon Enterprise Surges 19.4% YTD, Outpacing the Market\n\n([content-module:CompanyOverview, NASDAQ: AXON\n\nAxon Enterprise AXON, a leading provider of law enforcement technology solutions, including less-lethal weapons, body cameras, and cloud-based software, has significantly outperformed both the sector and the broader market. As of Tuesday's close, the stock has surged an impressive 19.4% YTD. Additionally, Axon set a new all-time high after closing at $710.01.\n\nWith its upcoming earnings report scheduled for February 25, the stock appears well-positioned for continued momentum after its recent breakout. Analysts remain bullish on Axon, maintaining a consensus Buy rating. For Q4 2024, the consensus estimate for EPS is $1.40, with projected revenue of $567.5 million. Given its strong financials, return to shareholders, and bullish technical positioning, Axon remains a standout in the industrial sector.\n\nGE Stock Soars 80% Over the Past Year, Outperforming the Market\n\n([content-module:CompanyOverview, NYSE: GE\n\nGE Aerospace GE, the largest holding within the XLI ETF, has continued its remarkable surge in 2025. The company is a global leader in jet and turboprop engines, aircraft components, and integrated aviation systems. Headquartered in Evendale, Ohio, GE Aerospace has already gained nearly 26% YTD, bringing its one-year performance to an astonishing 80% as of Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nDespite its RSI beginning to creep into overbought territory, the stock remains in a strong uptrend, consolidating near all-time highs above previous resistance. GE recently delivered impressive earnings, reporting EPS of $1.32, a 27% beat over expectations, along with revenue of $9.8 billion, surpassing estimates by 4.13%. This robust earnings performance further supports the stock\u2019s continued rally.\n\nRTX Gains 7% YTD, Outpacing the Industrial Sector and Broader Market\n\n([content-module:CompanyOverview, NYSE: RTX\n\nRTX RTX, the third-largest holding in XLI, is a multinational aerospace and defense company providing advanced systems and services to commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. Although its YTD gains of nearly 7% may seem modest compared to Axon and GE Aerospace, RTX has still outpaced both the industrial sector and the broader market.\n\nAfter briefly achieving new highs following an impressive earnings beat, RTX has since pulled back toward a higher timeframe support level, potentially presenting an attractive buying opportunity. The company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings, released on January 28, 2025, showed an EPS of $1.54, beating the consensus estimate of $1.35 by $0.19.

            "content": "Diesel engines have played a crucial role in building and powering America, from farms and construction sites to highways and emergency services. Beyond U.S. borders, diesel engines dominate the workload in mechanized industries worldwide.\n\nWhile all engine manufacturers strive for excellence, certain diesel powerplants stand out due to their durability, mechanical simplicity, and horsepower potential. These exceptional engines have earned a reputation for reliability and performance, making them some of the best ever built.\n\nMany of the engines on this list come from an era before stringent emissions regulations introduced complexities that affected reliability. During that time, diesel engines were built with fewer restrictions, leading to robust and dependable machines.\n\nThe list includes legendary names like Cummins, International, Caterpillar, Detroit, John Deere, GM, and Mack\u2014brands that have left a lasting impact on the industry. Although many of these engines are no longer in production, they remain highly respected and sought after by enthusiasts and professionals alike.\n\nThis carefully selected compilation highlights ten of the greatest diesel engines ever made. These powerhouses represent the best compression-ignition technology and continue to be celebrated for their performance and longevity. With that in mind, and without ranking them in any specific order, the following pages present the ultimate list of legendary diesel engines.\n\n1. International DT466\n\nThe International DT466 is one of the most widely used and recognized diesel engines, powering school buses, box trucks, farm tractors, and small bulldozers. As the largest engine in International Harvester\u2019s 400 series, it shared a block with the smaller 414 and 436 cubic-inch models.\n\nBuilt for durability, the DT466 featured a deep-skirt cast-iron crankcase, a forged-steel crankshaft with seven main bearings, and ductile-iron wet cylinder liners. Its 4.30-inch bore and 5.35-inch stroke contributed to its torque-heavy performance, making it a reliable choice for various demanding applications.\n\nOne of the DT466\u2019s standout characteristics is its ability to handle extreme levels of stress in stock form. Thanks to its sturdy rotating assembly and six head bolts per cylinder, it can withstand up to 1,200 horsepower before the factory head gasket becomes a concern.\n\nAccording to Hypermax Engineering, this means that enthusiasts can push the engine to its limits by adding more fuel and air without needing major internal upgrades. Its robustness and resilience have made it a favorite among those who demand high power output without compromising reliability.\n\nBeyond its use in medium-duty trucks, the DT466 has become a legend in tractor-pulling. Decades of innovation have led to extreme modifications, including replica blocks, billet crankshafts, stronger rods, and solid heads.\n\nWhen paired with high-performance components like Sigma injection pumps, triple-feed injectors, and multiple turbochargers, DT466-based engines can withstand 300 psi of boost and produce over 4,000 horsepower. This remarkable versatility and strength ensure that the DT466 remains an icon in both work and competition settings.\n\n2. 6BT Cummins\n\nThe 5.9L Cummins, specifically the 6BT, revolutionized the diesel pickup truck industry and played a significant role in the growth of the diesel aftermarket. Introduced in 1988, this 12-valve inline-six brought direct injection and turbocharging to the \u00be-ton and larger truck market, setting a new standard for performance and durability.\n\nIts arrival forced competitors like Ford and GM to step up their diesel offerings, but the Chrysler-Cummins partnership had already set the benchmark. The widespread success of the 6BT helped fuel the expansion of the diesel industry, contributing to the creation of publications like Diesel World and a booming aftermarket scene.\n\nOne of the reasons for the 6BT\u2019s legendary reputation is its incredibly strong internal components. Its forged-steel I-beam connecting rods, each with its own rod bearing journal, can handle extreme power levels\u2014especially when upgraded with shot peening, micro-polishing, and ARP rod bolts.\n\nThe engine\u2019s forged-steel crankshaft is induction-hardened and held in place with 14mm main cap bolts, while the cylinder head is secured with six bolts per cylinder for extra durability.\n\nThis overbuilt design allows the engine to last a million miles in stock form or survive four-digit horsepower in modified applications. Even though the newer 6.7L Cummins block is preferred for extreme horsepower builds, the 5.9L remains a viable option for high-performance diesel enthusiasts.\n\nThe 6BT\u2019s 12-valve crossflow cylinder head, made from gray iron, was built with longevity in mind. It features induction-hardened valve seats and durable ductile iron intake and exhaust valve rockers, making it one of the toughest cylinder heads in diesel history.\n\nIn motorsports, the 12-valve head remains a top choice, with aftermarket variants capable of extreme airflow improvements. When extensively ported and equipped with oversized valves, it can achieve airflow rates of over 300 cubic feet per minute (cfm) per cylinder\u2014more than double the stock capability.\n\nThis combination of simplicity, strength, and performance potential cements the 5.9L Cummins as one of the most influential diesel engines ever produced.\n\n3. 3406 CAT\n\nThe Caterpillar 3406 is a legendary engine in the Class 8 trucking world, powering thousands of over-the-road trucks across America with unmatched reliability. Available in multiple versions\u2014A, B, C, and the highly regarded E model\u2014the 3406 featured a 5.40-inch bore, a 6.50-inch stroke, and a displacement of 14.6 liters (893 cubic inches).\n\nDepending on the model, it produced between 375 and 465 horsepower, with factory torque ratings reaching up to 1,850 lb-ft. Its durability and performance have made it a favorite among truck owners who swear by CAT power for long-haul efficiency.\n\nThe 3406E, the most revered version, marked Caterpillar\u2019s transition to full electronic control. While earlier models were mechanical (A and B) or a mix of mechanical and electronic (C), the E model introduced a fully electronic unit injection system around 1993.\n\nThis advancement allowed tuners to recalibrate the engine control module (ECM) for significant horsepower gains, making 550-600hp setups common. The ability to unlock extra power so easily contributed to the 3406E\u2019s cult-like following, cementing its reputation as a powerhouse in both stock and modified forms.\n\nBeyond highway use, the 3406 has proven itself in extreme-performance applications like sled pulling, particularly in the 20,000-pound semi category.\n\nChampionship-winning drivers like Jerry and Jeremy Walker have relied on heavily modified 3406 engines in their competition trucks, pushing displacement beyond 1,000 cubic inches and using massive single turbos with inlets exceeding 5 inches. Whether on the road or the track, the 3406 remains one of Caterpillar\u2019s most iconic and respected diesel engines.\n\n4. 7.3L Power Stroke\n\nThe 7.3L Power Stroke may not be known for high horsepower or quick cold starts, but it is legendary for its reliability. As the largest diesel engine ever offered in a pickup, the Navistar-built 444 cubic-inch V8 debuted in 1994 with 210 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque.\n\nIt introduced hydraulically actuated electronically controlled unit injector (HEUI) technology, developed by Caterpillar and licensed to International to meet emissions regulations. Designed for direct injection and built around a turbocharger, it was Ford\u2019s first serious response to the 5.9L Cummins-powered Dodge Rams, setting a new standard in the diesel pickup market.\n\nBuilt with durability in mind, the 7.3L Power Stroke featured a forged-steel crankshaft and connecting rods (though powdered-metal rods appeared after 2000), along with cast-aluminum pistons and a simple yet strong valvetrain.\n\nThe cast-iron cylinder heads had two valves per cylinder and were secured with six head bolts per cylinder (with sharing). A single camshaft and hydraulic lifters eliminated the need for periodic valve adjustments. While it lacked the power of modern diesel, its robust design allowed it to withstand years of hard use with minimal issues.\n\nThe 7.3L\u2019s long lifespan is a result of its low engine speed, heavy-duty construction, and relatively modest power output, with its most powerful version producing just 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque in 2001.\n\nWhile the HEUI injection system is sometimes criticized, it proved highly reliable in the 7.3L, with properly maintained injectors lasting over 200,000 miles. Nearly two decades after production ended, original injectors are still being found in running engines, a testament to the Power Stroke\u2019s durability and its enduring legacy in the diesel world.\n\n5. Cummins 855 Big Cam\n\nThe Cummins 855 Big Cam was introduced to meet the emissions regulations of the Clean Air Act of 1976 and quickly became one of the most fuel-efficient, durable, and powerful engines in the Class 8 truck market.\n\nDominating the late 1970s and early 1980s, this 14.0L (855 cubic inch) engine featured a 5.50-inch bore and a 5.98-inch stroke, with power ratings ranging from 250 to 400 horsepower in most versions. However, in generator-set applications, some models reached as high as 605 horsepower, solidifying its reputation as a powerhouse on the road and beyond.\n\nThroughout its production run, the 855 Big Cam underwent significant improvements across four versions. The first three models\u2014Big Cam I, II, and III\u2014used Cummins\u2019 PT (pressure-time) fuel system, allowing for mechanically variable timing, while the Big Cam IV, introduced in 1985, incorporated electronic controls before being replaced by the N14.\n\nNotable upgrades included the demand-flow cooling system and pulse exhaust manifold in the Big Cam II (1979), a pressed-steel oil pan and Holset HT3B turbocharger in the Big Cam III (1983), and a revised cylinder head and improved exhaust manifold in the Big Cam IV (1985), ensuring the engine remained competitive throughout its lifespan.\n\nAlso Read: 10 Best Electric Cars with the Longest Range in 2025 for Maximum Driving Distance\n\n6. John Deere 50 Series 6-619\n\nThe 619 cubic-inch (10.0L) 50 Series John Deere engine is a powerhouse both on the farm and in tractor-pulling competitions, making it one of the best diesel engines ever built.\n\nOften used as a swap-in replacement for the original 531 ci engines in models like the 5010, 5020, and 6030, the 619 has proven itself in both agricultural and motorsports settings. In tractor pulling, it frequently goes head-to-head with\u2014and often outperforms\u2014the International DT466, securing its reputation as a dominant force in the sport.\n\nBuilt for durability and power, the 619 features a 5.125-inch bore, a 5.00-inch stroke, cylinder liners, and six head bolts per cylinder. One of its key advantages over earlier John Deere engines is its crank-driven oil pump, which eliminates the excessive cam wear issues that plagued the 30 and 40 Series engines.\n\nThis reliability, combined with its ability to generate substantial horsepower, has made it a popular upgrade option for farmers and a formidable contender in competitive pulling.\n\nIn Pro Stock tractor pulling, the factory-based 619 John Deere is heavily modified for extreme performance. While the block may remain stock or be a factory replica, internal components like the crank, rods, pistons, and cylinder head are billet, and a girdle and thick deck plate reinforce the top end.\n\nMany 619-based engines are expanded to the class maximum of 680 cubic inches and are paired with billet Sigma injection pumps and turbochargers with massive 5.5-inch inducers. Capable of spinning up to 6,000 rpm and producing around 4,200 horsepower, these highly tuned engines showcase the full potential of the legendary John Deere 619.\n\n7. Mack E7\n\nThe Mack E7 diesel engine, introduced in 1988, became a staple in the trucking industry thanks to its durability and immense torque. Spanning over two decades of production, the E7 came in 16 different versions, with power ratings ranging from 250 to 460 horsepower.\n\nIts 728 cubic-inch (12.0L) displacement and low-end torque, particularly the 460hp model producing 1,660 lb-ft at just 1,200 rpm, made it a powerhouse on the road. True to Mack\u2019s reputation, the E7 delivered torque levels that rival larger engines from competitors, embodying the company\u2019s iconic bulldog logo with its rugged, heavy-duty performance.\n\nInitially, the E7 featured a fully mechanical design, but the early 1990s brought electronic advancements like Mack\u2019s V-MAC (Vehicle Management and Control), which introduced sensors and actuators for improved fuel control.\n\nAdditional refinements included the Econovance system for variable mechanical timing and, by 1998, the shift to an electronically controlled unit pump (EUP) for more precise fuel injection.\n\nHowever, by 2003, emissions regulations required the integration of EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), which, along with other modern emissions technology, gradually diminished the engine\u2019s legendary reliability. Despite these later changes, the E7 remains one of Mack\u2019s most respected and long-lasting diesel engines.\n\n8. Detroit Diesel 60 Series\n\nThe Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine line played a pivotal role in revitalizing the company during the 1980s when it was struggling to maintain market share. At a time when electronic control was still emerging, Detroit took a bold step by designing the 11.1L and 12.7L engines with fully electronic unit injection systems, which proved to be highly reliable.\n\nTheir durability was so impressive that initial overhaul recommendations were extended from 500,000 to 750,000 miles. These advancements helped establish Detroit Diesel as a leader in the industry, setting new standards for electronically controlled diesel engines.\n\nIn developing the Series 60, Detroit Diesel\u2014then owned by GM\u2014sought assistance from John Deere to overhaul its struggling engine program. The result was a breakthrough design that addressed previous issues from the 50 Series and became a staple in the trucking industry.\n\nBuilding on this success, Detroit later introduced a 14.0L version in 2001, featuring a 6.62-inch stroke and 5.24-inch bore. This engine delivered an impressive 1,650 lb-ft of torque at 1,200 rpm and 515 horsepower at 1,800 rpm, further solidifying the Series 60\u2019s reputation as one of the most reliable and long-lasting diesel engines ever produced.\n\n9. KTA Cummins\n\nThe KTA Cummins was the largest Class 8 engine ever to run on American highways, boasting a massive 1,150 cubic inches (19.0L) of displacement. Designed originally for industrial applications, it eventually found its way into over-the-road trucks, delivering an impressive 600 horsepower and 1,650 lb-ft of torque in its single-turbo configuration.\n\nHowever, torque delivery was intentionally limited at low RPM to preserve the lifespan of transmissions like the Eaton Fuller 8- or 13-speed. During the late 1970s and 1980s, these power figures were groundbreaking, making the KTA a legendary engine in the trucking world.\n\nEquipped with Cummins\u2019 PT (pressure-time) fuel system, the KTA could achieve four-digit horsepower figures with minor fueling and turbo upgrades, all while remaining a workhorse. Its massive displacement and durability made it a dominant force in truck pulling competitions, where it consistently outperformed smaller Class 8 engines.\n\nFor even more power, Cummins developed the KTTA variant, which featured twin turbochargers and was primarily used in industrial and generator applications. Whether on the road or the track, the KTA cemented its reputation as one of the most powerful and reliable diesel engines ever built.\n\n10. 6.6L Duramax\n\nThe 6.6L Duramax (LB7) debuted in 2001, bringing groundbreaking advancements to the diesel pickup market. With 300 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque, it set new performance benchmarks while also introducing common-rail injection, improved refinement, and aluminum cylinder heads\u2014features that made it the quietest and cleanest diesel pickup engine of its time.\n\nAs one of only two V-8s on the list, it stood apart from competitors by combining power with efficiency, making it a game-changer in GM\u2019s heavy-duty truck lineup.\n\nBeyond its impressive debut, the LB7 Duramax was built for durability, featuring a 4340 forged-steel crankshaft, forged-steel cracked cap rods, and induction-hardened cylinder walls. Remarkably, its core architecture has remained largely unchanged for over two decades, still relying on a deep-skirt, cast-iron block while other manufacturers have moved to CGI.\n\nDespite its complexity, the Duramax has proven its longevity, with many examples surpassing 500,000 miles and even some LMM models exceeding 750,000 miles, solidifying its reputation as a dependable and long-lasting diesel powerhouse.\n\nThese ten diesel engines have made a lasting impact on the industry, showcasing exceptional durability, power, and innovation. From the dependable International DT466 to the formidable KTA Cummins, each engine on this list has played a crucial role in shaping the future of diesel technology.\n\nWhether through groundbreaking technology, sheer reliability, or legendary performance, these engines have proven themselves time and time again in both work and competition settings. Their influence extends beyond their original applications, as many remain sought after by enthusiasts and professionals who recognize their enduring value.\n\nWhile advancements in emissions technology and efficiency continue to push diesel engines forward, these legendary powerplants serve as a testament to an era of uncompromising strength and dependability.\n\nWhether still in service or remembered for their contributions to the industry, these engines represent the pinnacle of compression-ignition engineering.

The warm weather has seen an increase in the numbers of the toxic pine processionary caterpillars which can be a threat to animals and children.\n\nCosta Del Sol Caterpillar Warning\n\nWarm weather has brought forward the appearance of the dangerous pine processionary caterpillar on the Costa Del Sol. The caterpillars usually begin to thrive in late March, but this year they have arrived earlier than normal. The caterpillars are of particular concern to pet owners, and those with young children.\n\nSymptoms Of Exposure\n\nContact with the pine processionary caterpillar can cause dermatitis, eye damage and severe allergic reactions. For pets any contact with these caterpillars can be fatal. Symptoms which may be presented include breathing difficulties, vomiting and foaming at the mouth.\n\nIt is possible to be affected by the caterpillars even without direct contact. The caterpillars shed as many as 500,000 tiny hairs when threatened. Jorge Galvan, director of the Spanish Pest Control Association (ANECPLA), says \u201cJust touching one hair is enough to cause irritation and allergies, especially around the eyes\u201d.\n\nPine Processional Caterpillar\n\nThe preferred habitats for the Thaumetopoea Pityocampa (pine procession caterpillar) are areas with dense pine trees. These caterpillars move in lines, giving an almost snake like appearance. They are 3 to 4 centimeters long. Tiny bristles laden with a toxic chemical cover the caterpillars. If your children or pets come into contact with these caterpillars you should visit a clinic or vet immediately.\n\nPublished: 21.02.2025\n\nWritten by Dave James.\n\nNews On 93.6 Global Radio\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest news from the Costa del Sol with the coast\u2019s official English speaking radio station, 93.6 Global Radio.\n\nMore Costa del Sol News Stories\n\nSome recent headlines from the Costa del Sol.

            "content": "South Dakota House passes bill establishing child care assistance for daycare workers\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to advance House Bill 1132B to establish child care assistance for daycare workers.\n\nHB 1132B passed with seven \"yes\" votes and six \"no\" votes during last Thursday\u2019s House Health and Human Services Committee hearing and on Wednesday, passed 39-31 during the House of Representatives hearing. The bill is primarily sponsored by Minority Leader Rep. Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, and Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings.\n\nHealy stated during Thursday\u2019s Democratic Legislative Leadership weekly news conference that this is the first time in at least a decade a child care bill has passed in both the committee and on the floor.\n\nThe state of child care in South Dakota\n\nSecuring quality child care in South Dakota remains a challenge for many families due to high costs, limited availability and workforce shortages. Existing child care laws and assistance programs aim to support parents, but gaps in eligibility and funding often leave families struggling to find affordable options, with more than 70% of children under age 5 having working parents.\n\nIn 2023, South Dakota launched a child care task force in response, of which both Healy and Reed are members. A report was released in January, composed of national and statewide data to evaluate the strengths as well as gaps in the state\u2019s child care services.\n\nThe findings and suggested actions in the report complete the first phase of addressing child care in South Dakota. It examines barriers to child care access and affordability, recommending strategies to address the child care shortage and improving outcomes for children, families, employers and the state.\n\nMore: Task force releases first look at the state of child care in South Dakota\n\nWhat the task force found is that South Dakota\u2019s current child care model is not sustainable, causing many providers to struggle and even close, Reed stated in January.\n\nAnother aspect is affordability, according to Healy during last Thursday\u2019s committee hearing. She stated that child care costs in South Dakota range from $7,000 to $14,000 per year, putting it out of reach for many low-income families.\n\nMore: 'We're in a crisis,' childcare leaders warn as options remain unaffordable for many\n\nThirdly, low child care employee wages total an average of $12.67 per hour, but the living wage for one adult with no children is $19.58 per hour. Because of this, child care facilities operate under capacity \u201cbecause they can\u2019t find the workforce,\u201d Healy said.\n\n\u201cSo how is somebody who is making that wage supposed to afford child care? These people are taking care of our children, but they can't even afford to have their children taken care of,\u201d Healy said last Thursday.\n\nWhen that happens, Healy said, child care workers leave the industry.\n\nWhat would HB 1132B do for South Dakota?\n\nHouse Bill 1132B aims to be one of the many moving parts in addressing child care in South Dakota, by allowing \u201cthe workers behind the workers\u201d or those who are employed at early child care centers to be eligible for child care assistance.\n\nThis would be done by raising the federal poverty line for child care eligibility from 209% to 300% to ensure child care employees working at least 30 hours per week are able to receive child care assistance.\n\nHealy explained that this would be \u201ca recruitment and retention tool\u201d to incentivize people to work in child care centers.\n\nWhat proponents are saying about HB 1132B\n\nReed emphasized during last Thursday\u2019s committee hearing that HB 1132B would help ensure working families had access to affordable child care and allow businesses the workforce needed to thrive in South Dakota.\n\n\u201cHouse Bill 1132 is a crucial step towards addressing the child care workforce shortage, expanding access to quality child care by reducing financial barriers for child care workers and encouraging businesses and philanthropic organizations to invest in child care solutions,\u201d Reed said.\n\nCEO of the Economic Development Professional Association of South Dakota Michael Bockorny, who is also a lobbyist for the Aberdeen Development Corporation, Aberdeen Area Chamber of Commerce, Webster Development Corporation and the South Dakota Association for the Education of Young Children, mirrored these statements, relaying that the bill would help child care facilities \u201cfill the void\u201d in the workforce and open up more space for children of working parents.\n\nHealy mentioned during Wednesday\u2019s House hearing that the Department of Social Services (DSS) completed a study that revealed nearly 40% of South Dakota child care providers are not at full enrollment due to the workforce shortage.\n\n\u201cThat's what we are hearing over and over and over again,\u201d Healy said. \u201cSo why don't they have the workforce? Because child care workers are underpaid.\u201d\n\nRiAnna Kalovsky, a stay-at-home parent from Ethan, shared her experience of leaving the workforce due to the high cost of child care during last Thursday\u2019s committee hearing. With a background in education and child care, including work with special needs individuals, Kalovsky was earning $34,000 annually as a child care site supervisor. However, when her employer \u2014 who was also her child care provider \u2014 raised rates by 10%, her family's child care expenses would have exceeded $27,000 in 2023, which forced her to leave her position.\n\n\u201cIf House Bill 1132 had been in place two years ago, I would still be participating in the workforce, my family would still have the employee-sponsored benefit program, I would be paying into Social Security, my children would be part of a high-quality child care community and I would be setting my sights on continued, gainful career opportunities,\u201d Kalovsky stated.\n\nMichael Quast, CEO of the Aberdeen Family YMCA, which serves 535 children daily and 8,000 people annually, relayed last Thursday how in the past 15 months, three employees, including a longtime staff member, left after having children because staying employed was financially unfeasible.\n\n\u201cAs stated, South Dakota has one of the largest households where both parents work in the workforce,\u201d Quast said. \u201cThis [HB 1132B] is designed to have parents who want to stay in the workforce, stay in the workforce.\u201d\n\nPresident and Chief Lobbyist with the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce & Industry David Owen said last Thursday there is a common misconception about child care after his board analyzed the issue for three years.\n\n\u201cThere is a myth among the business community that child care organizations are poorly organized, and if they could just get their act together, they'd survive,\u201d Owen stated.\n\nHealy pointed out that the state of Kentucky passed a bill similar to HB 1132B offering child care assistance to child care workers. This ultimately cost less than expected, as many child care workers were already eligible but unaware of the assistance available.\n\n\u201cAnd what that bill did in Kentucky was it opened a lot of providers\u2019 eyes to understanding that child care assistance was available,\u201d Healy stated.\n\nOthers who shared their support of HB 1132B during last Thursday\u2019s committee hearing included representatives from the Brookings Economic Development Corporation in the Brookings Area Chamber, Elevate Rapid City, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women and the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWhat opponents are saying about HB 1132B\n\nDeputy Secretary and Chief of Operations Brenda Tidball-Zeltinger voiced how DSS acknowledges the importance of child care for workforce participation during last Thursday\u2019s committee hearing, but objects to expanding the state-run child care assistance program without dedicated funding.\n\n\u201cThe program is intended to be a safety net for low-income families to support their ability to work or go to school,\u201d said Tidball-Zeltinger.\n\nShe said the current 209% South Dakota federal poverty level for child care assistance equals about $67,000 per year for a family of four and $44,000 for a family of two. If the federal poverty line is raised to 300%, a family of four can earn up to $93,000 per year and $61,000 per year for a family of two.\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature funds the state's child care assistance program each year through DSS, Tidball-Zeltinger relayed. Part of the funding comes from a federal block grant, but that grant is capped. To receive federal funds, the state must also contribute matching funds from its own budget.\n\nTidball-Zeltinger said that last year the program helped about 1,700 families.\n\nHealy argued that HB 1132B would not require expanding the child care assistance program, stating that there is currently a low to no waitlist for child care assistance.\n\n\u201cDSS doesn't have to increase their budget,\u201d Healy said. \u201cWe can widen the pool.\u201d\n\nIt might mean, she continued, that some parents may be put on a waitlist or it could also lower the federal poverty line for other individuals, giving less child care assistance to others if the bill passes. However, none of that would be relevant if there weren\u2019t enough workers to open more child care slots.\n\nMajority Whip Rep. Leslie Heinemann, R-Flandreau, voiced concern that if the bill passes, families already receiving assistance may receive less, or, according to Tidball-Zeltinger, potentially be added to a waitlist, something DSS has not had to do yet.\n\nRep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, stated Wednesday that HB 1132B would \u201ccreate winners and losers\u201d by giving special treatment to child care workers and not other areas such as health care, education and service industries, all of which are also experiencing workforce shortages.\n\nSen. Steve Kolbeck, R-Brandon, voiced the same argument, that recruiting and retaining staff is an issue in every industry currently, stating that HB 1132B is callous and \u201can explicit effort\u201d to repurpose a program to create a government subsidy to a particular employee group.\n\nMore: Are government subsidies the solution to the child care crisis in South Dakota?\n\nHughes also expressed that the bill would be the wrong approach and instead, the state should request or require companies to provide child care benefits for employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is public, private partnerships,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI don't know why we don't expect the largest employers and the wealthiest corporations in our state to address child care. That's real workforce.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Goodwin, R-Rapid City, rebutted that requiring companies to have child care is not \u201cAmericanism\u201d but \u201csocialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a person goes to work someplace, they know what the benefit packages they take or not,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cBut this government does not have a right to require somebody to provide child care.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nHB 1132B had its first reading in the Senate Thursday and was referred to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Then the amendment moves to the Senate hearing for a vote, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nIf HB 1132B is amended in the Senate Committee and passes, the Senate will then take up the bill and go to a joint conference committee to negotiate the changes.\n\nIf the amendment passes in the Senate, it is then sent to the governor to review and sign or veto.",

This marks the first instance of chlorantraniliprole being registered in China specifically for locust control.\n\nPreviously, chlorantraniliprole was authorized for use against pests such as the cabbage beet armyworm and populus fall webworm in China. The newly approved application targets young locust nymphs during their peak period, requiring a dosage of 8-12 ml per mu, combined with 30-60 kg of water, and applied through a single even spray. The recommended safety interval is of five days.\n\nChlorantraniliprole in India\n\nIn India, chlorantraniliprole has been registered for use against a wide range of pests across various crops. It is effective against Green Semi Looper, Stem Fly, Girdle Beetle, and Tobacco Caterpillar on soybean; Stem Borer and Leaf Folder on paddy; American Bollworm, Spotted Bollworm, and Tobacco Caterpillar on cotton; and Fruit Borer and Tobacco Caterpillar on chili, among others. The versatile chemical is widely recognized for its broad-spectrum effectiveness in numerous pest.\n\nChemical Pesticides in China for Locust Control\n\nResearchers from the College of Plant Protection at Shenyang Agricultural University have highlighted the high toxicity of chlorantraniliprole against grassland locust species, including Calliptamus abbreviatus, Chorthippus brunneus, and Myrmeleotettix palpalis. Additionally, studies from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences indicate that combining chlorantraniliprole with Metarhizium in ratios of 8:2 or 5:5 enhances its effectiveness against migratory locusts.\n\nCurrently, China has approved 18 pesticides for grassland locust control. Among them, only two\u2014chlorantraniliprole and imidacloprid\u2014are chemical-based, while the rest consist of biological products such as matrine, Beauveria bassiana, Azadirachtin, and osthole.\n\nFAO Recommendations for Locust Control in India\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has outlined a set of recommended chemicals for locust control, particularly for effective management of locust outbreaks in agricultural areas. The recommended chemicals include chlorpyriphos 20% & 50% EC, deltamethrin 2.8% EC & 1.25% ULV, diflubenzuron 25% WP, fipronil 5% SC & 2.92% EC, lambdacyhalothrin 5% EC & 10% WP, malathion 50% EC & 25% WP & 96% ULV.\n\nPowder formulations like Fenvalerate 0.4% DP, Malathion 5% DP, and Quinalphos 1.5% DP are approved for desert locust control in scheduled desert areas under the RC-413 regulation.\n\nAlso Read: Legal Clarity Needed on Responsibility for MRL Adherence in Pesticides: CCFI\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Reach Farmers, Share Your Story, and Grow Your Brand!\n\nGot news to share?

But did you know that at least two-thirds of invertebrates are active at night, meaning many are unlikely to be seen? Invertebrates carry out many of the same functions as their daytime counterparts, in some cases doing so with greater efficiency and variety.\n\nFor centuries, artificial light has been a symbol of progress. From the flickering flames of early fires to the dazzling LED displays of modern cities, light has shaped human civilisation. But while we celebrate its convenience, we often overlook the darker side of our obsession with illumination: light pollution.\n\nDespite global efforts to combat the climate crisis and wildlife loss, light pollution remains socially accepted. It is not just a nuisance for stargazers: it\u2019s a disruptor of ecosystems, with profound consequences for wildlife, human health and energy consumption.\n\nFuelled by the rapid adoption of cheap and bright LEDs, light pollution has soared by nearly 10% every year for the past decade. This represents a doubling of sky brightness every eight years. Public spaces, roads, homes and businesses are drowned in artificial light, often with little thought given to its impact.\n\nMoths, our best-known nocturnal invertebrates, are suffering from our obsession with light. A 2021 study found that caterpillar populations were 52% lower in areas with street lights.\n\nView image in fullscreen Declining caterpillar numbers mean many blue tits struggle to feed their young. Photograph: Valentina Petrova/AP\n\nThe winter moth is a small but essential species. In early spring its caterpillars provide a critical food source for blue tit chicks. But light pollution disorients the adult moths, disrupts mating and affects egg-laying, leading to fewer caterpillars. With declining caterpillar numbers, blue tits struggle to feed their young, causing ripple effects throughout the food chain.\n\nLight pollution is throwing nature off balance on a wider scale: bats alter their flight patterns, dung beetles struggle to navigate, crickets chirp less and plants are affected as their natural growth cycles shift.\n\nEven the smallest of artificial lights can disrupt natural behaviour. Fireflies and glow-worms, maybe our most charismatic nocturnal invertebrates, can mistake a single LED for a potential partner, limiting mating and reproduction. The problem is so significant that experts consider light pollution as one of the greatest threats to these special glowing beetles globally.\n\nIf we are to truly halt nature loss and protect our essential invertebrates, we must address the problems affecting all species. While light pollution continues to increase unchecked, it is our forgotten species working the night shift that will suffer the most.\n\nLight pollution is easily preventable: turn off unnecessary lights and the problem disappears. Unlike other pollutants, there is no need for a challenging cleanup operation.\n\nWhile artificial light is sometimes necessary for safety, we should prioritise lighting methods that minimise light pollution, reducing harm to the natural world while continuing to meet societal needs.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

The solution enables drilling companies to utilize existing 3512C Tier 2 power solutions to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO).[1]\n\nSolutions that support climate-related targets and maintain efficiency without incurring significant additional costs are in demand, according to Caterpillar, and the 1 MW-rated DGB Gen 2 Kit addresses a critical need in the industry, as drillers today face the complexity of improving operational efficiency and reducing GHG emissions without compromising performance and uptime.\n\nDual-fuel technologies like the DGB Gen 2 Kit represent a key strategy to address rising fuel costs, evolving industry regulations and the CapEx associated with new gas engines. Optimized to blend diesel and natural gas, the DGB Gen 2 Kit features advanced cylinder technology that improves combustion efficiency. Its port injection system allows for precise air/gas ratio control at the individual cylinder level, resulting in faster response times while reducing unburned gas. Multi-port gas injectors and in-cylinder pressure/temperature systems enable real-time performance optimization for each cylinder.\n\nIn addition to lowering GHG emissions, the DGB Gen 2 Kit allows up to two times diesel displacement compared to traditional fumigated technologies to achieve an average 70% diesel displacement, and up to 85% peak displacement. This significantly reduces overall fuel consumption and empowers companies to accurately estimate diesel fuel savings.[ii]\n\nDrilling companies can upgrade all engines on a four-engine rig for nearly the same cost as one new gas-powered engine, which supports decreased capital expenses while also ensuring a diesel-like transient response. Additionally, reducing diesel consumption allows the DGB Gen 2 Kit to help lower operating expenses.\n\n\"With the DGB Gen 2 Kit, drilling companies can maximize their investments in Tier 2 engines while significantly reducing GHG emissions,\u201d stated Derek Kamp, vice president, Caterpillar Oil & Gas. \u201cThe ability to displace 70% of diesel consumption with natural gas without purchasing a new natural gas engine helps drilling companies optimize their existing assets and profitability.\"",

Here, the unit operated an entire 10-hour workday on a single charge, loading 422,000 lbs of nuts into trailers throughout the test.\n\nTo overcome the constraints of being off-grid, Heinrich Farms fully recharged the electrified field elevator overnight during non-working hours using the Cat XES60 Compact ESS mobile battery energy storage system, which provides up to 56.8kWh of capacity.\n\n\u201cThe electrified field elevator from Flory was reliable and unloaded our harvest as fast as conventional equipment powered by diesel engines while generating far less noise,\u201d says Jerad Heinrich, orchard manager for Heinrich Farms. \u201cIt lasted an entire day of work without stopping for a recharge, and we\u2019re eager to use it again for our next harvest as the technology continues to progress.\u201d\n\nThe project was the first presentation of a prototype machine by a third-party OEM using Caterpillar\u2019s battery-powered solution. Based on the positive results of the demonstration, Flory plans to offer pilot units to select customers later this year, with full production expected in 2026.\n\n\u201cThe elevator is a perfect application for electrified machines since it sits idle for most of the workday,\u201d says Tyler Hupp, product development manager for Flory Industries. \u201cThis collaboration was an opportunity to show our commitment to delivering advanced technologies to our customers that improve performance sustainably.\u201d\n\nField elevators are utilized for harvesting all tree nut crops, which include almonds, pecans, hazelnuts, macadamias and pistachios. Used for transferring nuts into trailers or stockpiles, field elevators can process anywhere from 50,000 up to 250,000 lbs. of nuts every day during the fall harvest season.\n\nTypically, field elevators powered by diesel engines spend about 80% of their duty cycles at low idle in between loads, which accounts for about 45% of their total fuel consumption. These long periods of non-productive operation interspersed with the need for instantaneous power make the elevator an ideal target for electrification.\n\nBy replacing the traditional engine with an electrified powertrain, the new system can eliminate up to 126 lbs. of carbon emissions per machine in the field daily while eliminating diesel fuel purchase, transport and storage costs and reducing ambient noise for nearby workers.\n\nWith the support of the XES60, the field elevator was able to work off-grid during the day and be charged overnight.\n\nCaterpillar supported the project by evaluating system requirements, optimizing system architectures, managing system controls development, calibration, and verification and performing final system validation.\n\nEngineers integrated the batteries with inverters, motors, electronic controls, digital services and other critical technologies in a power-dense solution that addresses common user concerns while demonstrating the numerous benefits.\n\nThe electrified powertrain featured Caterpillar\u2019s new prototype battery, which uses lithium-ion technology and features a modular design to boost performance while minimizing packaging. Caterpillar is developing a range of batteries for the off-highway industry.\n\nHolt of California applied its specific knowledge of Flory\u2019s equipment architecture and duty cycles to provide day-to-day engineering, integration and testing support.\n\nFlory engineers coordinated the demonstration project from the Flory Industries\u2019 headquarters and development centre in Salida, California, with support from Caterpillar and Holt of California\u2019s teams located in the Sacramento area. Flory has specified Cat diesel engines for powered equipment throughout its fleet of agricultural equipment since 2002. The company currently uses US EPA Tier 4 Final Cat engines for self-propelled harvesters, shuttle trucks, elevators and brush shredders.\n\nThe battery-powered elevator is designed to be configured with Cat Connect, enabling equipment owners and Cat dealers to remotely monitor performance during operation and charging cycles. This intelligence can then be leveraged to improve productivity by optimizing in-use and on-charge processes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gained valuable insights from working with Flory to apply our knowledge of electrification and high-voltage systems to the challenging environments of working California farms,\u201d says Steve Ferguson, senior vice president of Caterpillar Industrial Power Systems. \u201cThis project demonstrated how Caterpillar is successfully aligning with fellow innovators to develop technologies that maximize the performance and reliability of electrified machines at real-world worksites. Caterpillar can provide customers with access to the full ecosystem of components to insights and the charging infrastructure.\u201d",

            "content": "Almudena Nogu\u00e9s Malaga Thursday, 20 February 2025, 20:28 Compartir\n\nEvery year processionary caterpillars are appearing earlier Spain's Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Empresas de Sanidad Ambiental (national association of environmental health companies) or Anecpla has warned. While in the past they would leave their nests in March and April, at the beginning of spring, the warmer winters have led to the caterpillars appearing earlier.\n\n\"Many regions, with their mild temperatures, have already seen this plague in the middle of February\", the organisation said. In Malaga, with maximum temperatures above 20C, it is already a reality. As an example, the photo below was taken this week in Alhaur\u00edn de la Torre.\n\nZoom\n\nBoth the Guardia Civil and the National Police have also echoed this warning on social media. \"Be very careful if you are walking with your dog and you see a processionary caterpillar. This insect has stinging hairs that can cause a very serious reaction,\" said the Guardia Civil on TikTok. The National Police added on X: \"The processionary caterpillar has come early this year and we must be vigilant in places where there are pine trees\".\n\nIn view of this, Anecpla recommends that local authorities incorporate annual prevention campaigns into their autumn plans. Jorge Galv\u00e1n, the association's director general, said, \"Now we have seen that the processionary plague is coming earlier and earlier due to the effects of climate change, it is essential that we are the ones who anticipate the dangers that this may cause.\"\n\n500,000 venomous hairs\n\n\"This year the processionary caterpillar - commonly known by this name because of its \"processionary\" behaviour, as one caterpillar follows another in single file - is descending earlier than usual from the pine trees as a result of climate change. In provinces such as Malaga, this week they are already working tirelessly on treatments of different kinds to tackle the problems of this early spring and the processionary caterpillar is the most problematic we find on the Iberian peninsula because it is a highly stinging and allergic species,\" agreed Rentokil Initial, a company specialising in pest control.\n\nEach of these caterpillars has about 500,000 venomous hairs in the form of imperceptible darts or arrows. Their tiny size and the possibility that they can be easily detached increase the risk of allergic reactions and inflammation not only through direct contact but also via the air. Anecpla explains that even the slightest contact with the processionary caterpillar can cause dermatitis, eye problems, hives and allergic reactions. \"Just the touch of one of their hairs (which they release as a defence strategy when they feel threatened) is enough to cause irritation and allergies, especially if they reach the eyes,\" Galv\u00e1n explained.\n\nDeadly to pets\n\nThese hairs are knwn scientifically as \"trichomes\" and are \"ready to act as poisoned darts the moment they feel they are in danger\", according to Anecpla. In the case of pets, especially dogs, this contact can even lead to death, warns the director general.\n\nIt is often the case that dogs, out of curiosity, sniff the caterpillars. \"At that moment, it is easy for the trichomes to get stuck in the animal's snout or eyes, causing symptoms such as inflammation, intense itching and abundant salivation. If they eat them (which is not uncommon if they have previously touched them with their paws which they then lick because they are itchy), the ingestion of the toxic substance that carries their trichomes can cause necrosis of the tongue or throat,\" the associaton added.\n\nIn this context, Malaga city hall began in November the application of biological preventive treatments in the city's parks and areas of pine trees. The solution applied is biological and non-toxic, complying with the sustainable use of phytosanitary products that respect the environment and people's health. In this way, integrated pest management is promoted with alternative techniques and non-chemical methods.",

            "content": "The monarch butterfly is a symbol of change, both literally and metaphorically. Their migration heralds the oncoming cold months, while their metamorphosis from caterpillar to delicate winged insect signals wonderful transformation. With unique orange and black wings, monarchs are one of nature\u2019s premier works of art, a sight to behold if you\u2019re lucky enough to see them out in nature. But these beautiful butterflies are on the decline in the United States, largely due to factors like climate change, pesticides, and a decrease in their habitat. Last year (2024) marks the second-lowest year of monarch butterflies recorded to be spending the winter in the U.S. in 30 years.\n\nThe monarch butterfly can be found throughout the North American continent. The insect is well-known for its migratory patterns, flying to warmer locations as the cooler seasons of fall and winter begin to take hold. This phenomenon is known as overwintering. Monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains will typically migrate to Mexico, while their western counterparts spend winter along coastal California.\n\nAn organization called Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has recorded western monarch butterflies\u2019 overwintering patterns throughout California and Arizona since 1997. This year\u2019s overwinter population came in at a meager 9,119 monarchs, a 96% decline from their 2023 figure of 233,394. The 2024 population is one of the lowest in nearly three decades, second only to 2020\u2019s number, which rang in at 1,901 monarch butterflies.\n\nThe largest contributor to this significant decline is a lack of milkweed, a plant vital for monarch reproduction and growth. The milkweed plant hosts the caterpillar that will eventually become a monarch butterfly. According to another monarch conservation group (Monarch Joint Venture), the plant has been vanishing steadily due to urban development, agriculture, drought, and wildfires. The remaining plants are severely affected by pesticides, which also directly impacts the butterfly population.\n\nAnother reason for such a drastic drop in western monarch numbers may be due to extreme heat. Multiple heat waves throughout western states in July, as well as a later heatwave in California during early October saw temperatures soar past 100\u00b0F. According to Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist working with the Xerces Society, 108\u00b0F is lethal to insects, and numerous places throughout the West saw temperatures as high as 124\u00b0F.\n\nWhile Pelton maintains it is too early to tell what this population decrease will mean long-term for monarch butterflies in North America, there may still be hope. The orange-and-black insect had an astonishing bounce back from 2020 to 2022. Of the 2024 numbers, Pelton says, \u201cThis is bad news. But we have seen incredible recovery. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It\u2019s hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d\n\nThis news comes at a pivotal time for the monarch butterfly\u2019s conservational status within the U.S. In December 2024, the nation\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service announced it was working on bumping the monarch species up to the \u201cthreatened\u201d category, which would make it illegal to kill, transport, or disrupt monarchs and their growth patterns.\n\nDoing so would also designate a combined area of over 4,300 acres of land across numerous California counties as protected land for monarch overwintering. With an official decision pending until December 2025, it could mean all the difference in keeping a beautiful species not just alive, but also well.\n\nTo learn more about issues affecting the monarch butterfly population in North America, visit the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation website.\n\nThe western monarch butterfly population in North America hit a near-record low in 2024, according to conservation groups.\n\nKnown for their vibrant black and orange wing patterns, North American monarchs migrate to Mexico or coastal California as the weather gets colder.\n\nThe population that migrated to the California coast dropped by a whopping 96% from 2023 to 2024, declining from 233,394 to just 9,119 monarch butterflies.\n\nA combination of factors related to climate change, pesticides, and habitat loss are to blame for this sudden decrease. A dearth of milkweed, the monarch's host plant for metamorphosis, is also a contributing issue.\n\nConservationists are hopeful that by designating the species \u201cthreatened,\u201d the monarch will be able to come back from this decline, as they have in the past.\n\nXerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation: Website | Facebook | Instagram | Bluesky | YouTube\n\nRelated Articles :\n\nIndia\u2019s Tiger Population Has Doubled Thanks To Active Wildlife Conservation\n\nThis Adorable Marsupial Nearly Went Extinct in South Australia\u2013but Now It\u2019s Bouncing Back\n\nWildlife Photographers Unite in New Book To Highlight Beauty of Endangered Animals\n\nGiant Octopus Sculpture Carrying a Menagerie of Endangered Animals Surfaces in NYC",

            "content": "Field elevators play a vital role in the harvesting of tree nut crops such as almonds, pecans, hazelnuts, walnuts and pistachios. Used to transfer the nuts into hopper trucks or stockpiles, they help facilitate the processing of anywhere from 50,000 to 250,000 lbs. of product per day during the fall harvest season.\n\nThe Flory 4840E electric field elevator is said to eliminate up to 126 lbs. of carbon emissions per machine in the field daily. (Photo: Flory Industries)\n\nDiesel-powered field elevators can spend about 80% of their duty cycle at low idle in between loads, accounting for about 45% of total fuel consumption. Such long periods of non-productive operation interspersed with the need for instantaneous power make this equipment an ideal target for an electrified powertrain.\n\nFlory Industries, a leading manufacturer of nut harvesting equipment, recognized the potential for electrification in this application and sought out prospective suppliers.\n\n\u201cIn early 2023, we met with several of the big OEMs offering large lithium-ion batteries,\u201d said Kyle Dreyer, P.E., engineer at Flory Industries. \u201cWe decided on Caterpillar because of the unrivaled support they\u2019ve provided on diesel engine projects with us. We knew Cat and our Cat dealer, Holt of California, would be invaluable in taking this project from concept to completion.\u201d\n\nThe resulting demonstration project has become the first presentation of a prototype machine by a third-party OEM using Caterpillar\u2019s battery solution.\n\nComponents of electrification\n\nThe Flory 4840E electric field elevator prototype utilizes a portfolio of Rexroth eLion electric powertrain components \u2013 including a 130-hp electric motor \u2013 paired with a 600-volt, 64-kWh Cat lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe demonstration project is the first presentation of a prototype machine by a third-party OEM using Caterpillar\u2019s battery solution. (Photo: Flory Industries\n\n\u201cWe decided on the Rexroth eLION portfolio of components because they could supply everything we needed to power our elevator and charge it,\u201d Dreyer said. \u201cThe support from Rexroth and our Rexroth integration partner, Hydraulic Controls Inc., was another deciding factor.\u201d\n\nThe components operate from 275 to 825 VDC. \u201cThat motivated us to use the 600-volt Cat battery \u2013 and because 600 volts would be enough power for any future machines we electrify,\u201d Dreyer pointed out. \u201cThe Caterpillar battery was designed in-house and has a flexible modular design. Those two factors gave us confidence it would be a reliable design and wouldn\u2019t be at risk of supply chain issues.\u201d\n\nThe battery and electric powertrain components require liquid cooling. \u201cWe went to AKG, which has been a trusted cooling package supplier for our engines. Their AKG Green product family had the solutions we needed,\u201d said Dreyer. \u201cWe used the 5-kW Battery Thermal Management System for the battery circuit. And we used their heavy-duty Power Electronics Cooling system to keep the eLion components at the right temperature.\u201d\n\nIntegrated solution\n\nHolt of California, the local Cat dealer, has applied its specific knowledge of Flory\u2019s equipment architecture and duty cycles to provide day-to-day engineering, integration and testing support for the demonstration project.\n\nEngineers are optimizing the system with the goal of enabling a standard 10-hour day of operation in the field on a single charge, with full recharging overnight. The team is integrating the batteries with inverters, motors, electronic controls, digital services and other critical technologies in a power-dense solution that Caterpillar said addresses common user concerns while demonstrating the numerous benefits.\n\nBy replacing the traditional engine with an electrified powertrain, the new system is said to eliminate up to 126 lbs. of carbon emissions per machine in the field daily, while eliminating diesel fuel purchase, transport and storage costs. A diesel field elevator can use roughly $95 in fuel per 10-hour workday, said Dreyer, while the 4840E electric field elevator will use only $5 in electricity over the same period.\n\nThe 4840E also provides instant torque. \u201cThe machine never stalled from an overloaded belt. Diesel elevators occasionally stall and require the farmer to shovel nuts off of the belt,\u201d Dreyer pointed out.\n\nLow noise is another benefit. \u201cThe 4840E is nearly silent between unload events,\u201d Dreyer said. \u201cThe noise reduction is great for nearby homes, and it was a surprisingly popular feature for the farm workers.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Dreyer said the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District can cover up to 85% of the cost of the electric model if the farmer turns in an old diesel elevator.\n\nCat battery in the the Flory 4840E electric field elevator. (Photo: Caterpillar)\n\nDevelopment is ongoing\n\nFlory engineers are coordinating the demonstration project from the company\u2019s headquarters and development center in Salida, Calif., with support from Caterpillar and Holt of California\u2019s teams located in the Sacramento area. The initial prototype successfully completed a full 2024 harvest testing (see below).\n\nAccording to Dreyer, Flory Industries hopes to use the project to gain expertise in battery-electric powertrains so it can be ready when regulations or technology advancements make electrification the preferred solution.\n\n\u201cWe also wanted to build relationships with suppliers in the battery-electric space,\u201d he said. \u201cIn agriculture, there\u2019s a lot of machines with low duty cycle diesel engines. Like our field elevator, they will be a great case to switch to battery power.\u201d\n\nThe 4840E project is already proving to be a conversation starter with farmers about their views on electric equipment and the challenges of recharging in remote areas.\n\n\u201cThe farmers are really receptive to battery-electric,\u201d Dreyer said, \u201cespecially when it can lower their cost of ownership.\u201d\n\nPilot units of the 4840E electric elevator are scheduled to be available for customers in 2025, with full production expected in 2026.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The Caterpillar and Flory Industries prototype demonstration project was a finalist for the 2024 Power Progress Summit Awards\u2019 Off-Highway Product Application of the Year.",

            "content": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) which saw its share price drive 174% higher over five years. In contrast, the stock has fallen 8.3% in the last 30 days. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Caterpillar\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Caterpillar achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNYSE:CAT Earnings Per Share Growth February 19th 2025\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Caterpillar's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Caterpillar the TSR over the last 5 years was 205%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nCaterpillar shareholders gained a total return of 15% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 25% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Caterpillar better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Caterpillar you should be aware of.",

(NASDAQ: PDYN) has developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) software platform poised to revolutionize the capabilities of robots, enabling them to observe, learn, reason, and act in a manner akin to human intelligence. Our AI and ML software platform empowers robots to perceive variations or changes in the real-world environment, enabling them to autonomously maneuver and manipulate objects accurately in response.\n\nThe Palladyne AI software solution operates on the edge and dramatically reduces the significant effort required to program and deploy robots enabling industrial robots and collaborative robots (cobots) to quickly achieve autonomous capabilities even in dynamic and or complex environments. Designed to achieve precise results with minimal training time, limited data sets, and lower power requirements, compared to current solutions, Palladyne AI believes its software has wide application, including in industries such as automotive, aviation, construction, defense, general manufacturing, infrastructure inspection, logistics and warehousing. Its applicability extends beyond traditional robotics to include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Palladyne AI\u2019s approach is expected to elevate the return on investment associated with a diverse range of machines that are fixed, fly, float, or roll.\n\nBy enabling autonomy, reducing programming complexity, and enhancing efficiency, we are paving the way for a future where machines can excel in tasks that were once considered beyond their reach.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.palladyneai.com and connect with us on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/company/palladyneaicorp.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the future uses of Palladyne software, the benefits of the software, the capabilities or future capabilities of Palladyne AI\u2019s software platforms and products generally, the benefits of the software platform and products and the industries that could benefit from them, the impact of the software platform and products on robotics and the applicability of the software platform to different kinds of machines (such as UAVs, UGVs and ROVs and different available industrial robots).

            "content": "This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine.\n\nWhen you think of venomous animals, caterpillars probably aren\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind. Snakes, of course. Scorpions and spiders, too. But caterpillars?\n\nYes, indeed. The world turns out to be home to hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of species of venomous caterpillars, and at least a few of them pack a punch toxic enough to kill or permanently injure a person. That alone is reason for scientists to study them. But caterpillars also contain a potential windfall of medically useful compounds within their toxic secretions.\n\n\u201cWill we get to the stage where we\u2019ll be taking things from their venoms that are useful? Definitely,\u201d says Andrew Walker, an evolutionary biologist and biochemist at the University of Queensland, Australia. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of foundational work to do first.\u201d\n\nCaterpillars are the larval stages of the insect order Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. It\u2019s just one of many animal groups with little-known venomous members. (Venoms are toxins that are deliberately injected into another animal, while poisons sit passively in an organism\u2019s body, waiting to sicken a potential predator.) By biologists\u2019 best estimate, venoms have evolved at least 100 times across the animal kingdom.\n\nMany venoms are complex, some containing more than 100 different compounds. And they\u2019re also strikingly diverse. \u201cNo two species have the same venom arsenal,\u201d says Mand\u00eb Holford, a venom scientist at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to study as many species as we can find.\u201d\n\nIndeed, studying venoms could be a better way to find new drug candidates than starting from scratch, because they contain molecules fine-tuned over eons to target specific biological processes in the victim. \u201cThey\u2019ve evolved over millions of years, they\u2019ve been tested in nature, and we know they work,\u201d says Holford. \u201cWhen we try to devise them ourselves in the lab, the success rate is a lot less.\u201d\n\nMost groups of venomous organisms, however, are barely on scientists\u2019 radar. \u201cWe have a huge wealth of knowledge about snake venoms and scorpion venoms and spider venoms,\u201d says Nicholas Casewell, a venom biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom. \u201cBut there are lots of groups of venomous animals out there that are largely unstudied.\u201d\n\nCaterpillars, in particular, deserve more attention, says Walker, who wrote about venomous Lepidoptera in the 2025 Annual Review of Entomology. Though only about 2 percent of caterpillar species are venomous, by Walker\u2019s estimate, they\u2019re widely scattered across the lepidopteran evolutionary tree. That pattern means venom likely evolved independently several times within the group, potentially yielding an unusual diversity of chemicals. The deadly caterpillars\u2014within the South American genus called Lonomia\u2014have a snakelike venom that interferes with blood clotting. Others have venoms that cause chronic, lifelong inflammatory problems, and a couple cause miscarriages in horses.\n\nThose nasty few are enough to make venomous caterpillars a significant public health issue, in at least some parts of the world, says Walker. \u201cThey\u2019re not killing many people regularly like scorpions and snakes do, but compared to spiders there\u2019s not much difference in the impact of the health hazard.\u201d The concern has led some researchers to work on understanding the biological effects of the potentially lethal Lonomia venom, and to develop antivenom to treat affected people.\n\nThough a few other caterpillar venoms have been studied at least a little, most remain almost entirely unstudied, says Walker\u2014and medicine may be missing out. For example, he notes, most lepidopteran venoms cause pain, sometimes intense enough to require opioid painkillers. That\u2019s not surprising, since pain is an excellent way to deter predators\u2014but it also allows researchers to use the venom as a probe to identify pain pathways in the body and pain receptors in lab animals and, potentially, in people. That, in turn, could lead to new drugs.\n\nResearch on caterpillar venoms is still sparse enough that no new drugs have resulted yet, but venoms of other organisms have yielded some important therapies. There are blood-pressure and anticlotting medications that were inspired by snake venoms, for example, and a forerunner to the new blockbuster drug semaglutide\u2014better known by brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy\u2014was based on a molecule extracted from a venomous lizard, the Gila monster.\n\nThanks to advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics, venoms of all animals, including caterpillars, are increasingly easy to investigate\u2014and that should mean big steps forward soon, says Casewell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a treasure trove that\u2019s still sitting out there for us to understand.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, a nonprofit publication dedicated to making scientific knowledge accessible to all.

            "content": "For the first three quarters of 2024, Rivian reported a $4 billion operational loss . While that\u2019s a slight improvement from the $4.16 billion loss the company posted in the same period in 2023, the reality is that Rivian is burning through cash at an unsustainable pace. Since the cost of revenues is a significant issue for Rivian (and most, if not all, EV companies), scaling production becomes a big challenge with the need for heavy upfront investment in materials and components. For Rivian, increasing vehicle sales doesn\u2019t immediately lower production costs. Unlike tech companies that can leverage economies of scale, Rivian\u2019s path to profitability is slower and more complex.\n\nAt the start of January, the company briefly lifted investor spirits by reporting that it met its production and delivery targets \u2014producing 49,500 vehicles and delivering 51,500, just above initial expectations. But the big news for early 2025 was the easing of a previously reported component shortage, which had been holding back production. Despite this positive update, Rivian still faces substantial operating losses, reporting a $1.2 billion loss for the most recent quarter. The company is working to cut production costs by finding cheaper materials and suppliers, but the road to profitability is bumpy at best.\n\nThe market\u2019s bullish outlook on RIVN stock depends on the company\u2019s bounceback in 2025 after a tough 2024. Over the past year, Rivian\u2019s stock has fallen 14%, thanks to industry-wide challenges and supply chain issues.\n\nAs Q4 earnings approach later this month , management hopes the quarter will be the first step toward profitability, with supply issues no longer a significant problem. While that could give Rivian\u2019s stock a short-term boost, I struggle to see how the company can satisfy the market\u2019s high expectations, which led to the stock being severely overvalued.\n\nWhile some analysts are optimistic about substantial revenue growth in the next five years, hoping the stock will finally take flight as a beautiful butterfly for investors, RIVN\u2019s most significant hurdle stands tall: finally reporting positive gross margins after years of fanciful promises and missed targets.\n\nRivian Automotive\u2019s (RIVN) electric SUV and pickup truck models look great, but its stock value isn\u2019t as alluring. The company\u2019s shares have been down 90% since its IPO in 2021. With internal mechanics spluttering and industry-wide challenges mounting, RIVN looks like a bit of a caterpillar for investors. Low demand, supply constraints, and ongoing cash burn have all undermined the company\u2019s performance and shareholder outcomes.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRivian\u2019s Road to Profitability and What It Will Take to Justify Its Valuation\n\nSince Rivian is still far from profitability and in the early stages of growth, traditional valuation metrics may not give a complete picture of the company\u2019s value. In this case, using the reverse discounted cash flow method might be a more helpful way to assess Rivian\u2019s valuation.\n\nRight now, Rivian\u2019s stock is trading at $12.50 per share, which, based on my calculations, suggests an ambitious 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31%. To arrive at this rate, I\u2019m using Rivian\u2019s most recent twelve-month figures for the base year, which show a revenue of $4.55 billion and the automotive industry\u2019s average operating margins of 8% (since Rivian\u2019s margins are currently negative). I also factored in depreciation and amortization of $1 billion and capex of $1.12 billion for the same period. For these calculations, I assumed a WACC (Discount Rate) of 10%, which is reasonably moderate, and a long-term growth rate of 2.5%.\n\nIf Rivian can turn its margins positive\u2014at least in line with the automotive industry\u2014it would still need to hit revenues of ~$17.5 billion by 2030. That\u2019s a pretty steep mountain to climb, considering the challenges Rivian is facing in scaling its EV production.\n\nIs RIVN Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nSurprisingly, Wall Street\u2019s long-term outlook for Rivian is somewhat bullish. Analysts expect the company to bring in $4.67 billion in revenue in 2025 and $40.13 billion by 2030, which suggests a solid 56% revenue CAGR.\n\nOn Wall Street, RIVN stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on two Buy, seven Hold, and two Sell ratings over the past three months. RIVN\u2019s average price target of $13.78 per share implies a ~9% upside potential compared to current levels.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) stock forecast for the next 12 months including a high, average, and low price target\n\nGoing against the consensus, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska has a Sell rating on Rivian stock and is skeptical about these long-term optimistic projections. He thinks the consensus is overestimating the market for Rivian\u2019s cars and not fully accounting for the vast capital expenditures required to hit those revenue targets.\n\nAnother bear is CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson, who is skeptical about Rivian achieving a positive gross margin in 2025. The analyst also remains concerned about the company\u2019s cash burn rates, especially given concerns about U.S.-based demand for EVs.\n\nBreaking Down Rivian\u2019s Upcoming Earnings Report\n\nOn February 20, after the closing bell, Rivian will report its Q4 and full 2024 results, although preliminary delivery figures have already been released. To beat market expectations, Rivian must report a loss per share of less than 69 cents and revenues above $1.39 billion.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) financial forecast in view of earnings call coming up on February 20 2025\n\nStill, I believe the key focus will be on Rivian\u2019s goal of achieving positive gross margins in Q4 and throughout FY2025. According to last quarter\u2019s forecast, the company aims to reach this milestone through cost-cutting initiatives and operational efficiencies. For example, Rivian has already reduced material costs per vehicle by 20% in Q4 compared to earlier in the year.\n\nAdditionally, Rivian is working on new vehicle platforms, like the R2, which are expected to significantly lower manufacturing costs. The R2 platform, set to launch in 2026, is designed to be more cost-efficient, allowing Rivian to offer vehicles at lower price points while improving margins.\n\nSo, if Rivian manages to surprise the market by posting positive gross margins and giving a bold outlook for 2025, it could trigger a stock re-rating. This would serve as a strong short-term catalyst and could help the stock spring higher and consolidate its gains, having been under pressure for so long.\n\nRIVN Lacks the Torque to Climb its Uphill Battle\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of electric vehicle companies losing so much money when demand isn\u2019t growing as fast as some may have hoped. Rivian is precisely in this predicament\u2014struggling to scale its business and far away from steady profitability. Currently, the only way to improve margins is by cutting costs and tweaking vehicle inputs.\n\nThe management team is confident Rivian will report positive gross margins in Q4, continuing through 2025. However, maintaining strong margins over the long term will be tough. Rivian needs to scale its operations significantly to hit Wall Street\u2019s ambitious revenue targets over the next five years. As I believe this is crucial for justifying its stock price, I\u2019m bearish on Rivian, as I think some frustration will eventually show up during its arduous uphill climb.\n\nStill, I think positive gross margins in Q4 and a better outlook for 2025 could give the stock a short-term boost (and thereby allow exasperated investors waiting for better levels to sell at to make a run for the trees, safe in the knowledge that this caterpillar will not transform into a butterfly anytime soon).\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against the other GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOver the past year, the market has highlighted the importance of diversifying portfolios to manage risk. Selecting stocks that perform well under various economic conditions has consistently been a challenge for investors, as strategies that work in one market may not work in another. For instance, growth and value stocks have shown different performance trends in various market conditions, making both approaches appealing to investors. Combining elements of both strategies can provide a refreshing alternative to traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes into play. Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) is an investment strategy that focuses on finding companies with strong, sustainable earnings growth and appealing valuations in relation to their growth potential. These companies are often in sectors with positive growth trends or have competitive advantages that position them for future success.\n\nThe GARP strategy, popularized by Peter Lynch, aims to strike a balance between growth and value investing by avoiding the extremes of either approach. It focuses on finding growth stocks that have relatively low price-to-earnings ratios under typical market conditions. When these stocks are identified successfully, they can offer strong returns for investors. Historically, the GARP Index has outperformed its benchmark by tracking companies that demonstrate consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuations, and strong earnings potential.\n\nALSO READ: 10 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now\n\nThe strategy has gained popularity not just in the US, but also globally. After Global X launched the first global broad-based index exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Australia using the GARP framework in September 2024, the strategy delivered strong early-stage performance. According to a Global X report, while global equity markets experienced a rally towards the end of 2024, the GARP stocks outperformed the broader market and other factors like quality, rising approximately 20% since the ETF\u2019s launch. The report also noted that GARP\u2019s success wasn\u2019t driven by technology, but rather by broader sectors such as consumer goods, financials, and communication.\n\nAnalysts globally are also advocating for the GARP strategy. For instance, Brian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital, recommended that Canadian investors adopt the GARP approach this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the market, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that the GARP Index delivered an average annual return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 9.81% growth. Over the same period, the market\u2019s Growth Index and the Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also highlighted that the GARP Index achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to both the growth and value indices during this time frame.\n\nA CNBC report also highlighted insights from BMO\u2019s analysts regarding investment strategies to navigate market uncertainties in the U.S. According to the report, investors should consider the GARP approach alongside dividend growth strategies in the current financial landscape. Dividend stocks have historically performed well during inflationary periods, making them a favored choice among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this article, we used the GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked 10 dividend companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nAn American manufacturing company, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) specializes in construction, mining, and other engineering equipment. Analysts have an optimistic outlook for the company, given that the global market for backup power solutions in AI data centers could reach nearly $23 billion by 2028. In a research note from December, Jefferies highlighted several key factors supporting Caterpillar\u2019s growth prospects. The firm pointed to a potential increase in demand for construction equipment, particularly for rebuilding efforts in war-affected regions like Ukraine. In addition, expectations of eased oil production regulations in the US could drive higher demand for construction machinery within the domestic oil and gas sector. At the same time, Jefferies anticipates a rise in demand for mining equipment due to the growing need for minerals essential to renewable energy production.\n\nIn the past 12 months, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has delivered over 11.5% return to shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company posted revenue of $16.2 billion, reflecting a 5% decline from the same period a year earlier. The decrease was largely driven by an $859 million drop in sales volume, mainly due to shifts in dealer inventories and lower equipment sales to end users. Dealer inventory levels decreased by $1.3 billion during the quarter, a steeper decline compared to the $900 million reduction in the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s profit per share rose to $5.78, up from $5.28 in the same period last year.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) maintained a solid financial position in 2024. The company generated $12.0 billion in operating cash flow throughout the year and ended the fourth quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. Over the year, it allocated $7.7 billion toward share repurchases and distributed $2.6 billion in dividends to shareholders. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $1.41 per share for a dividend yield of 1.6%, as of February 14. It is one of the best GARP dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 30 years straight.\n\nOverall CAT ranks 8th on our list of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Caterpillar ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCaterpillar's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Caterpillar's EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Caterpillar's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. While Caterpillar may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. This does not bode too well for short term growth prospects and so understanding the reasons for these results is of great importance.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check 100% free.\n\nAre Caterpillar Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Caterpillar, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$321m.

The solution enables drilling companies to utilise existing 3512C Tier 2 power solutions to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nThe 1 MW-rated DGB Gen 2 Kit aims to address the need for drillers to face the complexity of improving operational efficiency and reducing GHG emissions without compromising performance and uptime. Solutions that support climate-related targets and maintain efficiency without incurring significant additional costs are in demand.\n\nDual-fuel technologies like the DGB Gen 2 Kit represent a key strategy to address rising fuel costs, evolving industry regulations and the CAPEX associated with new gas engines. Optimised to blend diesel and natural gas, the DGB Gen 2 Kit features advanced cylinder technology that improves combustion efficiency. Its port injection system allows for precise air/gas ratio control at the individual cylinder level, resulting in faster response times while reducing unburned gas. Multi-port gas injectors and in-cylinder pressure/temperature systems enable real-time performance optimisation for each cylinder.\n\nIn addition to lowering GHG emissions, the DGB Gen 2 Kit allows up to two times diesel displacement compared to traditional fumigated technologies to achieve an average 70% diesel displacement, and up to 85% peak displacement. This significantly reduces overall fuel consumption and empowers companies to accurately estimate diesel fuel savings.\n\nDrilling companies can upgrade all engines on a four-engine rig for nearly the same cost as one new gas-powered engine, which supports decreased capital expenses while also ensuring a diesel-like transient response. Additionally, reducing diesel consumption allows the DGB Gen 2 Kit to help lower operating expenses.\n\n\"With the DGB Gen 2 Kit, drilling companies can maximise their investments in Tier 2 engines while significantly reducing GHG emissions,\u201d stated Derek Kamp, Vice President, Caterpillar Oil & Gas. \u201cThe ability to displace 70% of diesel consumption with natural gas without purchasing a new natural gas engine helps drilling companies optimise their existing assets and profitability.\"\n\nRead the latest issue of Oilfield Technology magazine for upstream news, project stories, industry insight and technical articles.\n\nOilfield Technology\u2019s January/February 2025 issue\n\nThe January/February 2025 issue of Oilfield Technology includes keynote articles on enhancing offshore safety and risk management; technical articles on digital technology, drilling, EOR, and flow control.

            "content": "On February 14, 2025, Caterpillar Inc (CAT, Financial), the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, released its 10-K filing, revealing a year of solid financial performance with sales and revenues reaching $64.809 billion. The company operates through three primary segments: Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy & Transportation, and provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. With a market capitalization of approximately $160.3 billion as of mid-2024, Caterpillar Inc (CAT) demonstrates a strong financial foundation and a significant global presence, with 46% of sales in the US and 54% internationally. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's strategic position.\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Power and Market Leadership: Caterpillar Inc (CAT, Financial) boasts a formidable brand reputation, underpinned by its status as the world's leading manufacturer in its industry. With a sales revenue of $64.809 billion, the company's market share approaches 20% across many of its products, reflecting its dominance and the trust customers place in its offerings. The brand's strength is further reinforced by its extensive dealer network, which operates approximately 2,800 facilities worldwide, ensuring Caterpillar's reach into about 190 countries for sales and support services.\n\nDiversified and Innovative Product Portfolio: The company's diverse product range, which includes construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines, caters to a broad spectrum of industries. In 2024, a significant portion of the company's research and development expenditure was allocated to the next generation of construction machines, highlighting its commitment to innovation and maintaining a competitive edge in the market.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCompetitive Market Pressures: Despite its strong market position, Caterpillar Inc (CAT, Financial) operates in a highly competitive environment with both global and regional players. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its leadership, as competitors like Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment, and others vie for market share. This competitive landscape necessitates ongoing investment in research and development to stay ahead, which can strain resources and impact profit margins.\n\nDependence on Global Economic Conditions: The demand for Caterpillar's products is cyclical and sensitive to global economic conditions. Economic downturns or instability can lead to reduced demand for heavy machinery and equipment, impacting the company's sales and profitability. As such, Caterpillar's performance is closely tied to the health of the global economy and the industries it serves, such as construction, mining, and energy.\n\nOpportunities\n\nStrategic Focus on Sustainability: Caterpillar's updated strategy includes a focus on sustainability, which presents an opportunity to meet the growing demand for environmentally friendly products and services. The company's commitment to developing innovative technologies that support customers' sustainability goals aligns with global trends towards reducing carbon footprints and could open new markets and revenue streams.\n\nExpansion of Services and Offerings: The company's strategic areas of Operational Excellence, Expanded Offerings, and Services position it to capitalize on emerging trends and customer needs. By broadening its product and service portfolio, Caterpillar can enhance customer value and drive long-term profitable growth, particularly in developing economies where infrastructure development continues to accelerate.\n\nThreats\n\nMacroeconomic Risks: Caterpillar's business is highly sensitive to economic fluctuations. Factors such as government investment levels, business confidence, and commodity price volatility can significantly impact the demand for Caterpillar's products. A prolonged economic downturn or unfavorable economic conditions in key markets could adversely affect the company's financial performance.\n\nIncreased Information Technology Security Threats: As reliance on information technology systems grows, Caterpillar faces heightened risks from cybersecurity threats. Any significant breach or failure in IT security could disrupt operations, lead to data loss, and damage the company's reputation, potentially resulting in financial losses and eroding stakeholder trust.\n\nIn conclusion, Caterpillar Inc (CAT, Financial) stands as a formidable player in the manufacturing industry, with a strong brand, a diversified product portfolio, and a strategic focus on sustainability and expanded offerings. However, the company must navigate a highly competitive market, remain vigilant against macroeconomic risks, and bolster its defenses against increasing IT security threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Caterpillar Inc (CAT) is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats, ensuring its continued success in the global marketplace.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(CAT), headquartered in Irving, Texas, manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. Valued at $170 billion by market cap, the company produces excavators, loaders, and motor graders for construction, as well as mining trucks, shovels, and autonomous solutions.\n\nShares of this machinery giant have underperformed the broader market over the past year. CAT has gained 9.5% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 20.5%. In 2025, CAT stock is down 3%, compared to SPX\u2019s 2.9% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nNarrowing the focus, CAT\u2019s underperformance is also apparent compared to iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 17.6% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF\u2019s 3.9% gains on a YTD basis outshine the stock\u2019s losses over the same time frame.\n\nCAT's shares declined amid concerns over new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, reflecting potential trade disruptions and the expected negative impact of stricter trade policies on its operations. Additionally, ongoing uncertainty under the Trump administration, coupled with the consistent rise in interest rates, has driven up borrowing costs for dealers, further adding to its challenges.\n\nOn Jan. 30, CAT shares closed down more than 4% after reporting its Q4 results. Its adjusted EPS of $5.14 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $4.97. The company\u2019s revenue was $16.2 billion, falling short of Wall Street forecasts of $16.6 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect CAT\u2019s EPS to decline 8.8% to $19.98 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.\n\nAmong the 21 analysts covering CAT stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on eight \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d 10 \u201cHolds,\u201d one \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is less bearish than a month ago, with three analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 5, Bernstein analyst Chad Dillard maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating on CAT with a price target of $360, implying a potential upside of 2.3% from current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $397 represents a 12.8% premium to CAT\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $490 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 39.2%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Caterpillar (CAT) looks like a potential bearish candidate after breaking below the 200-day moving average Wednesday.\n\nThe 50-day moving average is declining and sitting around 375, which could provide some short term resistance.\n\nWith the stock under pressure, I'm willing to bet that it will trade sideways at best over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I'm looking at a bear call spread. It assumes Caterpillar will struggle to get above the 380 level between now and the end of March.\n\nA bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.\n\nThe strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways. It may even work if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.\n\nCaterpillar Stock Trade Can Return $125\n\nA March 21 expiry bear call spread on Caterpillar using the 380-390 strike prices can be sold for around $1.25.\n\nTraders selling the spread would receive $125 in option premium. That's also the maximum possible gain. The maximum loss would be $875.\n\nThat represents a potential return of 14.3% between now and March 21.\n\nThe spread will achieve the maximum profit if Caterpillar closes below 380 on March 21. In this case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $125 option premium.\n\nThe maximum loss will occur if Caterpillar closes above 360 on March 21. That would see the premium seller lose $875 on the trade.\n\nWhile some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.\n\nManaging Caterpillar Stock Option Trade\n\nA stop loss could be set if Caterpillar trades above 370, or if the spread value rises from $1.25 to $2.50.\n\nBecause this is a bearish position, traders who think Caterpillar could move higher from here should not enter this trade. The position starts with a delta of -7, meaning it is roughly equivalent to being short seven shares of Caterpillar.\n\nA bear call spread can also act as a small hedge for long stock holders.\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, Caterpillar stock is ranked No. 2 in its industry group. It has a Composite Rating of 51, an EPS Rating of 73 and a Relative Strength Rating of 50.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

            "content": "Caterpillar (CAT) stock was a bearish candidate that came up on one of my Barchart Stock Screeners having broken below the 200-day moving average.\n\nHere are the full parameters for the screener and the results.\n\nToday, we\u2019re going to look at a Bear Call spread trade that assumes CAT will struggle to get back above the 50-day moving average in the next few weeks.\n\nA Bear Call spread is a bearish trade that also can benefit from a drop in implied volatility.\n\nThe maximum profit for a Bear Call spread is limited to the premium received while the maximum potential loss is also capped. To calculate the maximum loss, take the difference in the strike prices of the long and short options, and subtract the premium received.\n\nCAT BEAR CALL SPREAD\n\nTo create a Bear Call spread, we sell an out-of-the-money call and then by another call further out-of-the-money.\n\nSelling the March 21 call with a strike price of $380 and buying the $390 call would create a Bear Call spread.\n\nThis spread was trading for around $1.25 yesterday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $125 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $875.\n\nThat represents a 33% return on risk between now and March 21 if CAT stock remains below $380.\n\nIf CAT stock closes above $390 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $875.\n\nThe breakeven point for the Bear Call spread is $381.25 which is calculated as $380 plus the $1.25 option premium per contract.\n\nCOMPANY DETAILS\n\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 24% Sell with a Average short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\n\nThe market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nFor nearly 100 years, they've been helping customers build a better, more sustainable world and are committed and contributing to a reduced-carbon future.\n\nTheir innovative products and services, backed by their global dealer network, provide exceptional value that helps customers succeed.\n\nCaterpillar does business on every continent, principally operating through three primary segments: Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation.\n\nThey provide financing and related services through their Financial Products segment.\n\nCaterpillar is showing implied volatility of 24.63% and an IV Percentile of 42%.\n\nCaterpillar had already reported Q4 earnings, so this trade should have no earnings risk if held to expiration.\n\nConclusion And Risk Management\n\nOne way to set a stop loss for a Bear Call spread is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $125, so we could set a stop loss equal to the premium received, or a loss of around $125.\n\nAnother stop loss level could be if the stock broke above $370.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against other best manufacturing stocks to buy now.\n\nThe manufacturing sector stands as a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, significantly contributing to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and technological innovation. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector contributed approximately $2.3 trillion to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 10.2% of the total U.S. GDP. Additionally, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that as of January 2025, the manufacturing sector employs approximately 12.76 million individuals.\n\nReshoring and Strategic Shifts:\n\nIn recent years, the sector has experienced notable trends that are reshaping its landscape. One prominent development is the movement towards reshoring\u2014the practice of bringing manufacturing operations back to the United States. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, ongoing trade frictions with China, and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reconsider the risks of offshoring. The decline in China\u2019s factory activity and the country\u2019s economic slowdown have also contributed to this shift, as firms seek to reduce their dependency on a single manufacturing hub. In fact, according to a report by CNBC, mentions of \u201creshoring\u201d in the broader market\u2019s earnings transcripts surged by 128% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, outpacing even the rise in discussions about artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Trends:\n\nManufacturing stocks have shown resilience over the past year. Despite challenges like inflation and shifting interest rates, the sector has benefited from strong domestic demand and strategic investments in technology. In 2024, greater asset price dispersion across securities, sectors, and countries created strong alpha opportunities for hedge funds. This market dynamic coincided with a significant increase in corporate profits within the U.S. manufacturing sector, which experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11.1%, as reported by NIST.\n\nOutlook and Future Growth Prospects:\n\nThe outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector is cautiously optimistic. Despite ongoing challenges, a focus on innovation and supportive policies position the sector for steady growth. According to a report by Reuters, in January 2025, manufacturing expanded for the first time since 2022, with the ISM manufacturing PMI rising to 50.9\u2014the highest reading since September 2022. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best manufacturing stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting manufacturing companies across various sub-sectors within the industry, including industrial equipment, automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. From this pool of companies, we identified the 10 best manufacturing stocks and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) leadership in heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing is bolstered by its strategic initiatives aimed at innovation and operational excellence. The company continues to invest in technology and process improvements that help it navigate supply chain challenges and cyclical downturns inherent in the industrial sector. As global infrastructure development and construction activities gain momentum, Caterpillar is well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for its products.\n\nAs of February 10, 2025, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has delivered a total return of approximately 200.78% over the past five years, significantly outperforming the broader market\u2019s return of 80.97% during the same period. As of the third quarter of 2024, 50 hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database owned stakes in CAT.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) reported sales and revenues of $16.2 billion. The company achieved earnings per share of $5.14 in the fourth quarter, surpassing expectations. J.P. Morgan analyst Tami Zakaria maintains an Overweight rating on the stock, with a price target of $435, citing the company\u2019s improved profitability and efficiency.\n\nOverall, CAT ranks 10th on our list of best manufacturing stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:CAT) stands against other best infrastructure stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nDoug Rachlin, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 on January 27 to discuss why he believes that the current opportunity set in infrastructure is the best he has seen in three decades. Managing this strategy since the summer of 1996, Rachlin pointed to several factors driving his optimism. One major aspect is the role of midstream infrastructure companies in supporting energy dominance in the US. The US leads globally in propane exports, accounting for 46% of worldwide supply.\n\nRachlin emphasized that these investments align with principles from investors like Charlie Munger. He advocates for concentrated investing based on strong conviction rather than spreading bets thinly across many stocks. Regarding recent developments that might impact pipeline companies involved in natural gas transmission, such as news related to deep sea activities, Rachlin noted that natural gas prices reaching $4 were due to cold winter weather rather than AI-driven data center buildouts. He highlighted growth prospects for LNG exports over the next decade, which could reach up to 35 billion cubic feet per year under favorable policies initiated during Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nThis growth aligns well with Neuberger Berman\u2019s focus on midstream infrastructure within their broader energy transition strategy. The firm emphasizes utilities, renewables, and Master Limited Partnerships alongside traditional energy assets like pipelines critical for transporting natural gas. This is a vital component in powering data centers across the country. As LNG exports are set to double over four years (from ~13 billion cubic feet today to potentially over 25 billion cubic feet by end-2028) and possibly reach even higher levels thereafter, the demand for robust midstream infrastructure will continue growing. This scenario underscores why Rachlin views current opportunities as compelling within his long-standing career managing this sector-focused investment strategy.\n\nThe infrastructure asset management (IAM) market is booming. It was worth $37.65 billion in 2022 and is predicted to grow by 8.9% each year until 2030. This is because companies are using these services to save money on infrastructure maintenance. Industries like manufacturing and oil and gas use IAM to optimize existing assets and ensure upkeep, especially since upgrading older designs is expensive. For example, much of the US\u2019s energy infrastructure is 25+ years old, and Europe struggles with water waste due to leaky pipes. IAM helps maximize return on assets, improving quality and productivity.",

Among the objectives are increased focus on productivity and innovation, including carbon reduction initiatives.\n\nThe companies also reaffirmed their commitment made in April 2024 to cooperate towards development of a dual-fuel haul truck, powered by diesel and ethanol. Vale also intends to test a battery electric haul truck and the Cat Dynamic Energy Transfer System (DET) under development by Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cThe framework agreement represents an evolution in our relationship with Caterpillar, amplifying our focus on maximising the performance of Vale\u2019s assets and allowing us to advance on our decarbonisation path in an economically responsible way,\u201d says Marco Braga, Vale\u2019s Procurement Director.\n\n\u201cThe agreement with Vale reflects our commitment to developing solutions that support our customers\u2019 operational and sustainability goals,\u201d says Denise Johnson, Group President of Caterpillar\u2019s Resource Industries segment.\n\n\u201cThis strategic collaboration reinforces our commitment to deliver solutions that improve Vale\u2019s operations, with a focus on safety, productivity and operational excellence,\u201d says Marcelo Ribeiro, Executive Vice-President of Sotreq, a Cat dealer in Brazil.\n\nOn average, diesel fuel use in Vale\u2019s operations is responsible for 15% of the company\u2019s direct CO\u2082eq emissions. The adoption of more sustainable technologies is part of a strategic plan to mitigate environmental impacts while maintaining competitiveness.\n\nThe dual-fuel haul truck to be powered by ethanol and diesel that is under development by Caterpillar would initially equip trucks capable of carrying 240 tons of ore. In the future, the technology may be extended to trucks with a capacity of 320 tons. In total, there are more than 150 of both models in operation at Vale. Initial testing is to be completed at Caterpillar\u2019s facilities in the US followed by additional validation and testing of dual-fuel trucks at Vale\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cDecarbonisation is a major challenge today, which will only be overcome by investing in solutions such as alternative fuels and electrification to reduce emissions without compromising efficiency and safety,\u201d explains Jo\u00e3o Turchetti, Vale\u2019s Decarbonization Engineering Director.\n\n\u201cAs global industry leaders, Vale and Caterpillar are seeking not only to meet the demands of the mining sector but also to anticipate technological and environmental trends,\u201d says Marc Cameron, Senior Vice President of Resource Industries Sales, Services & Technology at Caterpillar.",

And for many people, 55 years seems a long time to work for the same employer. Back in 1969, it felt the same way for Sherley \u2013 one of 12 children born to a Caton, Mississippi, sharecropper and his wife.\n\nAs an adolescent growing up on the farm, Sherley made $3 a day working from sunrise to sunset in the unforgiving cotton fields of the Deep South. Yet she managed to squeeze in an education around her family responsibilities. Soon after finishing high school, Sherley headed to Decatur, Illinois, to live with her sister and a few other young women seeking prosperous lives. Not long after she arrived, one of the church deacons took Sherley to Caterpillar to apply for a job.\n\nToday, sitting at a breakroom table in the Decatur facility on a chilly winter day, her quick, genuine smile warms the room, and her eyes are as bright and clear as we imagine they were in her youth. She\u2019s respectfully known in this community as Miss Sherley \u2013 a reflection of the care and affection with which others view her.\n\nMiss Sherley loves people and has never met a stranger. Her life is open for all to see.\n\n\u201cMy first thought coming into the job interview back then was, \u2018I probably won\u2019t get the job anyway,\u2019\u201d Sherley says of her first interaction with the company. \u201cAt that time, you came to the plant and filled out an application. But afterward, I had a face-to-face interview with a man in HR, Dave Matthews, and I thought it went pretty well.\u201d\n\nMatthews said he\u2019d call her in a week or two, but within three days, the phone rang. Sherley had landed the job.\n\n\u201cI was thrilled, but the surprising aspect was that the job was on third shift,\u201d she continues, \u201cI had never before stayed up all night. Not once in my entire life. I was a sharecropper\u2019s daughter. You worked during the day and, at night, you slept.\u201d\n\nBut work at night she did. It was the beginning of a 14-year stint on Caterpillar\u2019s third shift. And Sherley started building machines.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Industrial Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against other best industrial stocks to invest in now.\n\nIndustrial stocks were on a roll in 2024 as the overall sector ended the year up 26% on navigating deteriorating economic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and heightened inflation. At the same time, a slowing Chinese economy was expected to hurt sentiments in the sector, but that was not the case.\n\nFast forward, the outlook in the industrial sector remains optimistic despite growing concerns about trade tariffs that could affect deals and operations. US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a new 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade policy overhaul would involve a significant increase in tariffs on top of the current metals duties. According to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute and the government, South Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, and Canada are the top three countries from which the United States imports steel. As a result, the tariffs have the potential to shake the nation\u2019s industrial sector.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Multibagger Penny Stocks to Buy Now and Michael Burry Stock Portfolio: Top 8 Stock Picks.\n\n\u201cCanadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defense, shipbuilding and auto. We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries,\u201d Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X.\n\nNevertheless, there is growing optimism that a return of manufacturing to the US from other countries amid the trade tariffs would be a boon for the sector. Activities in the industrial sector are expected to improve significantly amid the growing push to reinvest in domestic infrastructure.\n\nThe need to bring supply chains onshore to avert the ever-growing geopolitical risk is another factor that should bolster sentiments in the industrial sector. Additionally, heightened investments in electrification and the development of artificial intelligence should also have a positive impact. The fact that only a quarter of the $1.9 trillion worth of projects announced since 2020 have entered into the construction phase underscores the tremendous opportunities around industrial stocks.\n\nThe expected surge in spending on domestic manufacturing under the new administration should greatly benefit equipment rental specialists\u2019 electrical equipment companies, among others. The commercial aerospace sector is another segment expected to be on a roll after years of slowdown following the COVID-19 pandemic. A shortage of new planes as travel recovers is presenting tremendous opportunities for companies in the aerospace segment.\n\nInterest rate cuts as part of an effort to steer the economy into a soft landing is another tailwind that should positively impact the industrial sector in 2025. Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the housing sector on mortgage dropping, therefore attracting more home buyers. The net effect should be a strong demand for building materials and equipment that benefit construction companies and those in the repair and remodeling business.\n\nAdditionally, the industrial sector could receive a significant boost from China coming through on a new economic stimulus and major structural changes. Such a move is expected to boost activities in the sector and increase demand for raw materials and equipment, which should bolster the industrial sector.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment around the China market obviously has been pretty poor, not just recently, but for some time now. I think investors are ignoring some of these positive developments,\u201d said Andrew Swan, head of Asia equities at Man Group\n\nTrump\u2019s trade policies, lower interest rates, and China\u2019s economic stimulus are some of the tailwinds likely to impact the global industrial sector positively. A resilient US and global economy that steers clear of recession amid low interest rates are some of the reasons to be optimistic about the overall industrial sector outlook.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned the US stock market using a screener and analyzed online rankings to compile the list of the 10 best industrial stocks to invest in now. We filtered out those with high hedge fund holdings from an initial list of 25-30 stocks. The final stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge fund sentiments as of Q3 2024. We also focused on stocks with strong fundamentals and significant long-term investment potential.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is an industrial company that manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives worldwide. As a cyclical investment play, the company benefits whenever spending on construction, mining, energy, and transportation equipment increases.\n\nLikewise, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) finds itself on edge with Donald Trump threatening a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, whereby it maintains significant operations. Restrictive trade tariffs have the potential to affect Caterpillar\u2019s core business. However, chief executive officer Donald Umpleby believes the company is well positioned to shrug off the negative trade policies given that the company maintains the largest manufacturing presence in the US. Additionally, it generates nearly half of its revenues in North America.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has shown excellent margin performance in spite of difficulties with sales volume, suggesting superior cost control and operational efficiency. In comparison to earlier projections, analysts are projecting a 60 basis point boost in margins for the second half of 2025, which would help the full-year EPS. Significant destocking initiatives are also being pursued, with plans to cut inventory by $1 billion by the second half of 2025.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cLarge Cap Strategy\u201d third-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cOther top Q3 contributors included HCA Healthcare and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT). Heavy construction machinery manufacturer Caterpillar has held up better than industry peers against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and a generally slowing construction environment.\u201d\n\nOverall, CAT ranks 9th on our list of best industrial stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Export Competitiveness:\n\nChina, being one of Caterpillar\u2019s key markets, has imposed higher tariffs on U.S. industrial machinery. This has made Caterpillar\u2019s products less competitive compared to local and other foreign manufacturers.\n\n\n\n2. Higher Production Costs:\n\nThe U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other industrial components have increased Caterpillar\u2019s production costs. The company reported paying USD 70 million in tariffs during a single quarter and projected annual costs ranging between USD 250\u2013350 million.\n\n\n\nIn response, Caterpillar has employed cost-mitigation strategies, such as redesigning its machines to require fewer parts and passing increased costs to customers through price adjustments. While this has helped, the tariff impact remains a substantial drag on profitability.\n\n\n\nInvesting is all about making informed decisions, and now you can do it for less.

While the company has taken steps to manage rising costs and retain global competitiveness, the uncertainty surrounding U.S.\u2013China trade relations continues to cast a shadow on its long-term growth prospects.\n\nInvestors are advised to monitor how Caterpillar\u2019s export strategies, pricing adjustments, and global diversification efforts play out in this challenging environment.",

Can you tell our readers a bit about yourself?\n\nHello! My name is Annabelle Slator and my debut novel is out so soon ahhh! I spent over a decade working in marketing and growth for tech brands and exciting start-ups. A lot of my experiences during this time inspire my writing. When I\u2019m not hunched over a laptop in my author cave I\u2019m usually found at vintage fairs with my husband and two mini dachshunds Gruffalo and Gryffin, or obsessing over some niche internet drama. I hope you enjoy reading The Launch Date, the story has been in my head for years and I\u2019m thrilled to be releasing Grace and Eric out onto the world!\n\nWhen did you first discover your love for writing and stories?\n\nI think it\u2019s always been in me; as soon as I learned to read I wanted to write my own stories. I wrote my first manuscript when I was 8 years old, it was 20 pages and I\u2019m still chasing the high of handing it over to my unsuspecting English teacher. I also wrote Friends fanfiction for my schoolmates when I was meant to be doing homework \u2013 so writing a full manuscript felt inevitable, whether it was published or not!\n\nQuick lightning round! Tell us:\n\nThe first book you ever remember reading: The Hungry Caterpillar was a childhood banger and frankly, still hits.\n\nThe Hungry Caterpillar was a childhood banger and frankly, still hits. The one that made you want to become an author: I always loved writing stories but the books that really cemented the idea for me were The Spiderwick Chronicles by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi and A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket \u2013 still read anything Holly Black and Lemony Snicket (AKA Daniel Handler) put out. When I was old enough I moved onto romance and \u2018chicklit\u2019; reading Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary by Helen Fielding and Undomestic Goddess by Sophie Kinsella. These books solidified my love for romantic comedies and I still reference them to this day!\n\nI always loved writing stories but the books that really cemented the idea for me were The Spiderwick Chronicles by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi and A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket \u2013 still read anything Holly Black and Lemony Snicket (AKA Daniel Handler) put out. When I was old enough I moved onto romance and \u2018chicklit\u2019; reading Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary by Helen Fielding and Undomestic Goddess by Sophie Kinsella. These books solidified my love for romantic comedies and I still reference them to this day! The one that you can\u2019t stop thinking about: Book Lovers by Emily Henry has a forever home in my heart. It\u2019s the book I would aspire to be as high quality as in every aspect.\n\nYour debut novel, The Launch Date, is out February 11th! If you could only describe it in five words, what would they be?\n\nKeeps you up all night\n\nWhat can readers expect?\n\nAn unputdownable exploration of love, dating and self worth.\n\nWhere did the inspiration for The Launch Date come from?\n\nThe inspiration came from my own experiences working in London for brands and starts up. I unfortunately never had a will they wont they relationship with a rival colleague however there are so many crazy scenarios and wild stories I have still to tell!\n\nWere there any moments or characters you really enjoyed writing or exploring?\n\nI really enjoyed writing the big spicy scene haha! It was first scene I wrote for The Launch Date. Not necessarily because sex scenes are fun to write, but because it\u2019s an emotional crux in the book. The moment the swords are dropped, even if just for the night.\n\nDid you face any challenges whilst writing? How did you overcome them?\n\nOne aspect of The Launch Date that I was debating throughout the entire writing and editing process was the flashbacks. In The Launch Date, the reader experiences moments of Grace and Eric\u2019s former friendship before things fell apart. Ultimately, I chose not to have one continues linear timeline because I felt it was important for the reader to understand how deep the hurt went.\n\nThis is your debut novel! What was the road to becoming a published author like for you?\n\nI was incredibly lucky in my journey. I gave myself a year to query agents with The Launch Date, and found my dream agent in 6 months. We worked on refining the story for publishing houses and offers from the Penguin UK and HarperCollins US within a couple of months! The road to becoming a published author is not for the faint of heart, and I still had to maintain some seriously thick skin despite it being a relatively smooth journey.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nMy second book! I\u2019m so excited to be able to announce it very soon. I\u2019m in the editing process now with my fantastic teams at Bantam and Avon, and looking forward to putting book no 2 out into the world next year.\n\nLastly, what books are you looking forward to picking up this year?\n\nThere are so many amazing debuts in 2025! I\u2019m particularly looking forward to Georgia Stone\u2019s Friendship Fling, Crash Landing by Annie McQuaid, Work Trip by Chloe Ford and Passion Project by London Sperry.\n\nWill you be picking up The Launch Date?

            "content": "When the 'wood-wide web' was first described in the journal Nature in 1997, our view of plant life took on a utopian glean. But a new paper suggests this communication network between plants might not be so altruistic after all \u2013 and could even be used for sabotage.\n\nPlants can send and receive chemical signals, aided by the mycorrhizal fungal networks that connect their roots below ground. This phenomenon was described by forest ecologist Suzanne Simard and her colleagues nearly three decades ago, and is now known affectionately as the 'wood-wide web'.\n\nWhen a caterpillar takes a bite out of a tomato leaf, for instance, scientists have observed that a neighboring plant, connected to the first by a mycorrhizal network, will ramp up production of the bug-repellent enzymes in its genetic arsenal.\n\nIt's easy to assume the plant under attack is actively emitting a warning signal to its neighbors, like a horror movie character stuck in a trap: \"forget about me \u2013 save yourselves!\" And that's how many have interpreted this phenomenon.\n\nBut a trio of biologists from the University of Oxford and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) suspect this view of plant communications may be a little too rosy.\n\n\"There is no dispute that information is transferred. Organisms are constantly detecting and processing information about their environment,\" says VU evolutionary biologist Toby Kiers.\n\n\"The question is whether plants are actively sending signals to warn each other. Maybe just like gossiping neighbors, one plant is simply eavesdropping on the other.\"\n\nThe team used mathematical models to unpick the possible evolutionary drivers of the supposed warning signal system.\n\nIt makes sense that plants might evolve to pick up on signs of distress among their kin and respond with defenses: the physical ability to do so helps them to ward off their own caterpillar attack before it even happens.\n\nBut the plant issuing that signal doesn't necessarily benefit from this interaction. The team's modeling showed that giving its neighbors such an advantage could actually do the plant more harm than good. Evolutionary pressures in their modeling, like competition with neighboring plants for nutrients and sunlight, actually selected against such an altruistic trait.\n\n\"Indeed, selection is often more likely to push plant behavior in the opposite direction \u2013 with plants signaling dishonestly about an attack that has not occurred, or suppressing a cue that they have been attacked,\" the authors write.\n\n\"For instance, plants may signal that a herbivore attack is occurring, even when no herbivore is present,\" says University of Oxford evolutionary theoretician Thomas Scott.\n\n\"Plants can gain a benefit from dishonest signaling because it harms their local competitors, by tricking them into investing in costly herbivore defense mechanisms.\"\n\nHowever, nature might select against crying caterpillar too often. If the lies are prolific enough, plants may stop 'trusting' messages from their neighbors altogether.\n\nEither way, we still see examples of what is often interpreted as 'honest signaling' again and again in the plant world. Based on their models, the authors reason that there must be some other evolutionary benefit, besides altruism, at play.\n\nOne option is that it's too difficult for a plant under siege to silence the chemical cry that inadvertently warns their neighbors of the attack at hand.\n\n\"For instance, in nature, it may be too costly or even impossible to suppress all cues of herbivore attack, given the sheer volume and diversity of such cues, passed through the air or fungal networks,\" the authors write.\n\nAnother option is that the fungi \u2013 not the plants \u2013 are sending the warning signals, pulling the lever in a kind of subterranean trolley problem. They have a vested interest in ensuring the survival of as many host plants as possible, rather than protecting just one.\n\nPerhaps, in a way, the 'wood-wide web' has more in common with our internet than we'd like to admit: it may also be beset by misinformation and selfish interests.\n\nThe new research was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).",

            "content": "Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has released updated research revealing that local government pensions scheme (LGPS) funds, administered by local councils across Britain, invest over \u00a312 billion in companies enabling Israel\u2019s genocide, military occupation, and apartheid against Palestinians.\n\nLGPS: funnelling money to Israel\n\nThe research, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, details the investments of 81 LGPS funds in companies which: produce weapons and military technology used in Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestinians; provide services or infrastructure that supports Israel\u2019s unlawful military occupation; or conduct activity in Israel\u2019s illegal settlements on stolen Palestinian land.\n\nCollectively, LGPS funds invest over \u00a3450 million in BAE Systems, which manufactures components for Israel\u2019s F-15, F-16, and F-35 fighter jets used to bomb Gaza. Over \u00a380million is invested in Caterpillar, which manufactures bulldozers used by Israel to demolish Palestinian homes, schools and hospitals. While over \u00a390 million is invested in RTX Corporation, formerly Raytheon, which produces 4000-pound GBU-28 bombs used by the Israeli military.\n\nFor the first time, PSC\u2019s research identifies investments in Amazon and Alphabet Inc (Google). This totals \u00a34.7 billion, nearly 40% of the value of all investments listed. Both companies work together to provide cloud computing infrastructure to the Israeli military and government, dubbed Project Nimbus. In addition, the research shows LGPS funds hold over \u00a328 million in Israel government bonds, therefore lending Israel money to carry out its atrocities.\n\nDivestment must happen\n\nThe new research comes as campaigns calling for the divestment of LGPS funds from companies enabling Israel\u2019s human rights abuses continue to gather momentum. Earlier this month, Tower Hamlets Council passed a motion committing to divest its pension fund from arms companies, following a strong local campaign. While Bristol City Council has called for Avon Pension Fund to divest from arms companies, and companies active in Israel\u2019s illegal settlements.\n\nLewis Backon, campaigns officer at Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said:\n\nThe scale of LGPS fund investments in companies that are complicit in Israel\u2019s grave abuses of Palestinian rights is shocking. The deferred wages of millions of local government workers are going into companies enabling Israel\u2019s war crimes, without their consent. But workers and residents are making it increasingly clear that they won\u2019t accept their pension funds being used to fund companies complicit in genocide and apartheid. We\u2019re only one month into 2025 but already Tower Hamlets Council has committed to divest from arms companies, while Bristol City Council has voted to call on Avon Pension Fund to divest from companies enabling Israel\u2019s crimes. This year will see the LGPS Divest campaign grow as a force for justice for Palestine \u2013 divestment from Israel\u2019s crimes is a moral and legal imperative that cannot be ignored.\n\nYou can search your local authority here.\n\nFeatured image via the Canary",

            "content": "On the slopes of the Himalaya grows something which is worth its weight in gold. It\u2019s called Yarsagumba and looks like a small, yellowish-brown tuber, about the length and width of a pinky finger, but more gnarled.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a root at all, however, but the body of caterpillar which has been infected with a cordyceps fungus. The fungus consumes the innards of the caterpillar, killing it, then grows out of its forehead, causing a small stem-like structure to emerge from the ground.\n\nFor 1,500 years, the Yarsagumba has been an integral ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. In addition to promoting general health, it\u2019s especially prized as an aphrodisiac. It\u2019s so desirable \u2014 and so difficult to obtain\u2013 that prices are high, and rising daily.\n\nInvoking both melancholy and whimsy, the film explores the odd reality of the Yarsagumba and the lifestyle its trade has created. It introduces us to the strange dual makeup of the Yarsagumba\u2013 both insect and fungus\u2013 and the desperate desire it commands.\n\nThe gold hunters\n\nEvery spring, thousands of poor Nepalese men, women, and children leave their homes for the mountains. Some of them, the film tells us, will not return. Breathtaking shots of the scenery also provide all that is needed to explain the danger. The slopes are very high up, very steep, and very cold.\n\nThe film follows the family of Suga Lal, an impoverished farmer who is training his 12-year-old son Raj to harvest Yarsagumba. After the long journey from their village, they crawl together along the steep slopes, looking for the small brown \u201cstems\u201d of fungus.\n\nOver the course of the film, Raj goes from novice to master, his keen young eyes allowing him to make a good harvest, even after his father loses much of their take in a dice game. But, as Suga Lal himself tells the filmmakers, the young man\u2019s future is unknown.\n\n\u201cIn fifteen years\u2019 time,\u201d Suga Lal predicts, \u201cthere will be no more Yarsagumba left.\u201d\n\nStrange markets\n\nThe film also follows Dhanchandra, a young man on a dangerous round-trip journey from Kathmandu to the slopes. An agent for a wealthy buyer, he goes from tent to tent, collecting a full kilo of Yarsagumba, and taking pictures of the people who harvest it.\n\nDepending on quality, each Yarsagumba is bought for between 100 and 300 rupees (about $0.70 to $2). This is only the first of several exchanges before it finally reaches Hong Kong medicine shops. With each exchange, the value rises.\n\nThe agent gathers enough of the fungus to fill a large trunk before turning back, hiring soldiers to guard him along the way. This much Yarsagumba, the film tells us, is worth 300,000 euros in Hong Kong, the equivalent of 300 years\u2019 pay for the average Nepalese.\n\nStark contrast\n\nFollowing Dhanchandra and his treasure, the film moves from the slopes of the Himalaya to the busy streets of Kathmandu. An exporter takes the precious cargo off Dhanchandra. The film follows it to a wealthy Hong Kong neighborhood. The contrast between the lives of the harvesters and the buyers could not be more stark.\n\nThis odd juxtaposition is allowed to settle heavily on the viewer as the film draws to a close. We return for a last time to the isolated village of Suga Lal, who worries about the future of the trade. Every year, he and his loved ones risk their lives on the mountain. But without the Yarsagumba, they have no way to make money. As the camera pulls out, the mountains, at least, remain.",

In creating a haven for bumblebees and monarchs, the OP is doing more than just creating a great landscape to look at.\n\nThere is fear that the monarch butterfly could disappear in the next 60 years if federal protections like designating the species as threatened don't go into place. The iconic butterfly faces threats from changes in weather patterns, pesticides, and habitat loss through increased development.\n\nThe reality is also bleak for bumblebees, which are imperiled by both rising temperatures and herbicides.\n\nFortunately, there is some help on the way in the form of a vaccine that will help the bees fight off lethal doses of Neonicotinoids, one class of pesticides. Both bumblebees and monarchs are important pollinators that help pollinate plants and many of the crops we rely on for food sources.\n\nGrowing native plants, as the OP did, is a great way to help stem the tide and provide an attractive food source for monarch caterpillars and bumblebees alike. It comes with other benefits, including reducing water usage, cutting down on yard maintenance, and decreasing your use of pesticides and fertilizers, as native plants are more resilient to local conditions.\n\nRedditors were equal parts impressed and jealous of the OP's garden.\n\n\"I'm envious,\" a user admitted. \"None on my milkweeds so far this year (last year I easily had a dozen).\"\n\n\"This is beautiful and happiness epitomized,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I squealed when I saw it,\" the OP revealed in response.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

As the national association of environmental health companies Anecpla has said, previously the caterpillars would emerge from their nests in March and April, at the beginning of spring. \"Many regions with their mild temperatures, have already seen this plague in the middle of February,\" they said.\n\nBoth the Guardia Civil and the National Police have also echoed this warning on their social media. \"Be very careful if you are walking with your dog and you see a processionary caterpillar. It has stinging hairs that can cause a very serious reaction,\" said the Guardia Civil on TikTok. The National Police added on X: \"The processionary caterpillar has come early this year and we must be vigilant in places where there are pine trees.\"\n\nAnecpla recommends that local authorities incorporate annual prevention campaigns into their actions in autumn. Jorge Galv\u00e1n, the association's general director, says: \"Once we have seen that the processionary plague is coming earlier and earlier due to the effects of climate change, it is essential that we are the ones who anticipate the dangers that this may cause.\"\n\nLa #procesionaria \ud83d\udc1b se ha adelantado este a\u00f1o y debemos estar atentos en los lugares donde hay pinos\ud83c\udf32\n\n\n\nY si tu #mascota contacta con alguna de estas orugas\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/9xGlxVjrRO \u2014 Polic\u00eda Nacional (@policia) February 4, 2025\n\nAnecpla points out that even the slightest contact with the processionary caterpillar can cause dermatitis, eye lesions and allergic reactions. \"Direct contact with the caterpillars is not even necessary. Just the touch of one of their hairs (which these insects release as a defence strategy when they feel threatened) is enough to cause irritation and allergies, especially if they reach the eyes,\" explained Galv\u00e1n.\n\nThese hairs have the scientific name of \"trichomes\" and it is estimated that each individual caterpillar has around 500,000 of them \"ready to act as poisoned darts the moment they feel they are in danger\", according to Anecpla. In the case of pets, especially dogs, this contact can even lead to death, said Galv\u00e1n.\n\nDogs may sniff a caterpillar out of curiosity. \"At that moment, it is easy for the trichomes to get stuck in the animal's nose or eyes, causing symptoms such as inflammation, intense itching and abundant salivation. If they eat them (which is not uncommon if they have previously touched one with their paws and lick them because they are itching), the ingestion of the toxic substance that carries their trichomes can cause necrosis of the tongue or throat,\" Anecpla adds.",

The company\u2019s Energy & Transportation segment is well-poised for growth, driven by strong demand across all applications, particularly data centers. The Construction Industries segment will benefit from rising construction activity in the United States and globally.\n\nThe mining sector is expected to see strong commodity demand fueled by the energy transition, supporting growth for the Resource Industries segment. The company has been witnessing growth in aftermarket parts and service-related revenues, which generate high margins. It plans to double services revenues to $28 billion in 2026.\n\nCaterpillar has paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 30 consecutive years, with higher yields than its peers. A strong liquidity position and investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will lead to exceptional returns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here >>>)\n\nNVE\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (-5.1% vs. +50.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $343.10 million is facing product sales declined 22% year over year due to inventory gluts and weak semiconductor demand.\n\nRising costs pressure margins, while higher inventories risk write-downs. The dependence on large customers and semiconductor cycles heightens revenue volatility. New product adoption and macroeconomic risks create uncertainties.\n\nNevertheless, NVE Corp. maintains exceptional profitability despite a 25% year-over-year revenue decline in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, with the gross margin rising to 84%, driven by high-margin direct sales. A debt-free balance sheet, $50.1 million in liquidity and $1.6 million in total liabilities provide financial stability.\n\nStrategic R&D investments fuel innovation in miniaturized medical devices and robotics. Capacity expansion supports growth, and stable demand in medical and defense markets ensures revenue resilience.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)\n\nShares of bioAffinity Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (-52.4% vs. -9.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $11.57 million faces liquidity risks, with cash declining to $0.8 million and a $6.1 million net loss for the first nine months of 2024. Reliance on CyPath Lung, regulatory uncertainty, competitive pressures and scalability challenges persist.\n\nNevertheless, bioAffinity\u2019s CyPath Lung orders surged 1,300% in the first nine months of 2024, driving third-quarter 2024 revenues to $2.4 million year over year. Expansion into 11 states, inclusion in the FSS and a successful Texas pilot position CyPath Lung for further growth.\n\nThe acceptance of an Australian patent strengthens IP protections, complementing 17 awarded patents and 38 pending applications. Cost efficiencies improved, with declines in R&D and clinical expenses. CyPath Lung\u2019s 92% sensitivity, 87% specificity, and potential $1.3 billion in annual healthcare savings enhance its competitive edge.\n\n(You can read the full research report on bioAffinity Technologies here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum, owing to ultrafast delivery services and its strong content portfolio.\n\nStrengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive. Growing adoption of AWS services portfolio is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance.\n\n\n\nRobust advertising business is also contributing well. Amazon\u2019s strong global presence remains a key growth driver. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds.\n\n\n\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. The company issued positive Q4 2024 guidance fueling investor enthusiasm. The Zacks analyst expect 2024 net sales to increase 10.7% from 2023. However, macroeconomic challenges remain and rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Bank of America have gained +45% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry\u2019s gain of +57.8%. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 results reflected the impacts of relatively high rates. The volatile nature of the trading business is a woe. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it will normalize going forward. This is likely to hurt fee income growth.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep costs high. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% in 2025. While elevated funding costs are still a woe, its net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer. We project NII to witness a CAGR of 5.3% by 2027.\n\n\n\nPlans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line.

The company has been witnessing growth in aftermarket parts and service-related revenues, which generate high margins. It plans to double services revenues to $28 billion in 2026.\n\n\n\nCaterpillar has paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 30 consecutive years, with higher yields than its peers.

            "content": "Tariff Concerns Overshadow Recent Manufacturing Rebound : The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index had been in contraction for consecutive 26 months until January 2025, when it saw a modest increase to 50.9%. Over the past 12 months, the index has averaged 48.4%. The New Orders Index has expanded for the past three months, following seven consecutive months of contraction. However, sustained growth remains uncertain as the index has not delivered consistent growth since the end of its 24-month expansion streak in May 2022.\n\nTheir products are varied, including loaders, pavers, dozers, excavators, concrete mixer trucks, crushing, pulverizing and screening equipment, tractors and cranes. Industry participants support oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications through their reciprocating engines, generator sets, gas turbines and turbine-related services.\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry comprises companies that manufacture and sell construction, mining and utility equipment. They support customers using machinery in the construction of commercial, institutional and residential buildings, and infrastructure projects. Their equipment is also utilized in underground mining, drilling, mineral processing and surface mining to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold, and other minerals and ores.\n\nDespite this ongoing weakness, increased infrastructure investment in the United States and demand from the mining sector, driven by the energy transition trend, will buoy the industry. Caterpillar Inc. , Komatsu , Hitachi Construction Machinery and Hyster-Yale, Inc. are poised to benefit from these trends. These companies\u2019 emphasis on introducing technologically advanced products, productivity and efficiency enhancements will aid growth.\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry has been bearing the brunt of the prolonged contraction in the manufacturing sector. Even though there has been a recent uptick, the imposition of new tariffs could jeopardize this recovery.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Production Index also moved into expansion territory in January, registering 52.5% and breaking an eight-month contraction streak. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Trump on Canada, Mexico and China triggers concerns that it could disrupt supply chains and derail this recent recovery in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nEnergy Transition Trend, Construction Spending to Aid Industry: The intensifying global focus on shifting from fossil fuels to zero emissions will require a large number of commodities, which, in turn, will support mining equipment demand in the years to come. The U.S. government's plans to increase investment in infrastructure construction, particularly in critical subsectors, such as transportation, water and sewerage, and telecommunications, should support demand in the coming years.\n\nHigher Pricing, Cost Cuts to Boost Margins: The industry is facing input cost inflation, and transport and logistic costs. Industry players are focusing on pricing and other actions to improve productivity and efficiency. They are constantly implementing cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins in this scenario. The companies are focused on streamlining their operations and realigning around high-growth key markets or customer segments to enhance their performances.\n\nInvestments in Digital Initiatives Act as a Key Catalyst: Industry participants are investing in digital initiatives like AI, cloud computing, advanced analytics and robotics. Digital transformation aids organizations in boosting productivity and increasing efficiency, reliability and safety, thereby enriching customer satisfaction. With the pressing need to cut carbon emissions, companies worldwide are relying more on autonomous machinery. Thus, players in the industry are stepping up their research and technological capabilities to bring products equipped with the latest technology into the market.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak Prospects\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim prospects in the near term. The Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Industrial Products Sector currently, carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it at the bottom 18% of 249 Zacks industries.\n\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past four years, the industry's earnings estimates for 2025 have moved down 13%.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Versus Broader Market\n\nThe Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry has outperformed the sector but lagged the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.\n\nOver this period, the industry has grown13.3% compared with the sector\u2019s growth of 11.9%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has moved up 23.8%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nThe forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Manufacturing, Construction and Mining companies, shows that the industry is currently trading at 10.92 compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 13.96 and the Industrial Products sector\u2019s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 19.85.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry traded as high as 14.37 and as low as 7.36, with a median of 10.43.\n\nFour Manufacturing - Construction & Mining Stocks to Watch\n\nCaterpillar: The company ended 2024 with an impressive backlog of $30 billion, which will support its top line in the upcoming quarters. Solid long-term demand prospects, backed by infrastructure spending and energy-transition trends, should help it maintain an upbeat performance. In the Energy and Transportation segment, strong order rates in most applications are expected to support revenues.\n\nAs technology companies establish data centers globally to support their generative AI applications, the company is witnessing robust order levels for reciprocating engines for data centers. It is planning to double its output with a multi-year capital investment. CAT has been seeing growth in aftermarket parts and service-related revenues, which generate high margins. The company is on track to double its service revenues from $14 billion in 2016 to $28 billion in 2026. CAT stock has gained 14.1% in the past six months.\n\nCaterpillar has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.53%, on average. CAT has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nKomatsu: The company has been witnessing higher demand for mining equipment. The industrial machinery and others business is gaining, supported by increased sales of large presses for the automobile manufacturing industry and higher maintenance sales in the excimer laser-related business for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe company is strengthening its underground hard rock mining equipment business through an enhanced lineup, development of latest mining methods and strategic acquisitions. KMTUY recently showcased its construction equipment designed to withstand extreme environments such as on the moon and underwater, which also demonstrates technological innovation efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting its advanced technology and future potential. The company\u2019s shares have gained 13.3% in the past six months.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Komatsu\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained unchanged over the past 60 days. KMTUY has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of around 2%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery: HTCMY aims to achieve revenues of more than 300 billion JPY in fiscal 2025 from independent business expansion in the Americas alone. Other core strategies of the plan include delivering innovative solutions for customer needs and enhancing value chain business.\n\nThe company is, thus, strengthening its focus on value-chain businesses other than new machinery sales, such as parts and services, rentals, used equipment, and parts recycling. It is utilizing digital technologies to provide solutions at all points of contact with customers. The company plans to begin full-scale production of dump trucks in fiscal 2026, aiming to capitalize on strong demand in the market.\n\nNotably, the Americas (North, Central and South America) account for approximately 40% of the global markets for dump trucks, totaling more than 150 tons. This aligns with one of HTCMY\u2019s core strategies of \u201cexpanding business in the Americas\u201d under its medium-term management plan \u201cBUILDING THE FUTURE 2025.\u201d Its shares have gained 8.6% in the last six months.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HTCMY\u2019s current-year earnings has been unchanged over the past 60 days. Hitachi currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nHyster-Yale: The company is executing key strategies to drive substantial longer-term profitable growth. As part of this, its product development and process improvement efforts are leading to more efficient lift truck production and reduced operational costs, while maximizing operational efficiency and factory utilization among others.\n\nHyster-Yale continues to make progress toward its goal of generating 7% operating profit margins across each business cycle in the Lift Truck and Bolzoni businesses. Bookings are expected to accelerate in the second half of 2025 and the company expects improved production levels in 2026. In the meantime, strategic actions to reduce costs, improve productivity and deliver high-quality, highly customizable products should enable the company to be more profitable in all phases of the business cycle.\n\nHyster-Yale continues to focus on cash generation and follows a disciplined capital allocation framework to reduce leverage, make strategic investments to support profitable business growth and generate strong returns for its shareholders.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hyster-Yales\u2019s 2025 earnings has been unchanged over the past 60 days. HY currently has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.3% and a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

It was an exceptional quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue and adjusted operating income estimates.\n\nIs Terex a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Terex\u2019s revenue to be flat year on year at $1.23 billion, in line with its flat revenue from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.75 per share.\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Terex has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Terex\u2019s peers in the heavy machinery segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Caterpillar\u2019s revenues decreased 5% year on year, missing analysts\u2019 expectations by 2%, and Cummins reported a revenue decline of 1.1%, topping estimates by 4.7%.

            "content": "In the remote Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a rare fungus grows inside dead caterpillars. In traditional Chinese medicine, this parasitic fungus is prized for its purported medicinal effects. Known as Ophiocordyceps sinensis \u2013 colloquially, caterpillar fungus or \u201cHimalayan gold\u201d \u2013 it can fetch astronomical prices on the herbal medicine market: up to US$63,000 per pound.\n\nOphiocordyceps sinensis fungus is a parasite that targets the caterpillar that is the larva of the ghost moth. The process begins in late summer to early fall, when fungal spores infect the caterpillars. Over time, fungal filaments called mycelia slowly spread out and consume the caterpillars from within, turning them into hardened, mummified shells by winter. When spring arrives, the fungus enters its final stage: A grasslike fruiting body sprouts from the preserved caterpillar\u2019s head and pushes up through the soil.\n\nWhile many traditional Chinese/herbal medicine consumers are drawn to the fungus for its supposed health benefits, my interest lies in a darker side of its harvest: the deadly relationship between caterpillar fungus collection and lightning strikes. As a meteorologist, I study lightning and its impacts around the world. A few factors come together to make the situation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau so dangerous.\n\nA deadly harvest\n\nPeople hunt for this fungus during late spring and summer, exactly when lightning strikes are most common in these mountains. Villagers often spend weeks scouring the rugged mountains for this precious resource, sometimes up to 16,400 feet (5 kilometers) above sea level. That\u2019s an altitude of more than 3 miles.\n\nAt these heights, the weather can change in an instant, and there\u2019s nowhere safe to hide from storms. While this area doesn\u2019t get as many lightning strikes as some parts of Asia, it\u2019s still dangerous enough to be a serious threat during these crucial harvesting months.\n\nTragically, caterpillar fungus hunting has led to at least 31 lightning-related deaths and another 58 lightning-related injuries in the past decade, according to the yearbooks of Chinese meteorological hazards (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u707e\u5bb3\u5e74\u9274) and government websites, including the China Meteorological Administration and the National Disaster Reduction Center of China.\n\nIn May 2022, seven villagers from China, including a young child, were killed by lightning while harvesting the fungus. The following year, three people from Nepal were injured by lightning when collecting the fungus and had to be rescued by helicopter after spending days stranded in the mountains.\n\nIn our recent study, my colleague Ronald Holle and I found that the population-weighted lightning fatality rates in the fungus-collection hotspots of Yushu and Garze counties, located in the Sichuan Province of China, are staggering \u2013 10 to 20 times higher than the already elevated rates in China overall. These numbers are on par with some of the most lightning-prone regions of Africa, where there is little lightning-safe infrastructure or safety education.\n\nBut lightning isn\u2019t the only threat these villagers face in the mountains. They could encounter hail, heavy rains, strong winds and other severe weather. The complex terrain makes weather patterns highly dramatic and unpredictable. Making things even worse, cellphone signals and other communication options are limited or nonexistent, leaving villagers cut off from weather hazard alerts.\n\nThey could also face threats from wild animals and risky mountain slopes. In one tragic case, a collector was struck by lightning and fell to his death on steep terrain. Medical care is rarely available. When accidents occur, it may be days before help arrives.\n\nWhy take the risk?\n\nIt all comes down to the high-risk, high-reward nature of caterpillar fungus collection.\n\nFor local villagers, the potential rewards of harvesting caterpillar fungus are significant. With limited income opportunities in this remote region, many see the fungus trade as their best hope for survival. They face a tough choice: risk their lives or sink into poverty.\n\nImproving lightning safety education and infrastructure are important but far from easy. Any real change would take a lot of investment.\n\nWhile the local government does organize some lightning safety education, these mountain communities are isolated and the information is often outdated. And there\u2019s simply no practical way to install adequate lightning protection across the vast, rugged terrain where the fungus is collected.\n\nA fragile pursuit\n\nThe environment is suffering, too. With so many people hunting for the fungus, they\u2019re damaging the delicate mountain soil, cutting down trees for firewood and leaving trash at their camps.\n\nYears of overharvesting have forced collectors to spend more time in the mountains to find enough fungus, increasing their exposure to lightning and the fungus\u2019s decline. Scientists warn that if this aggressive harvesting continues, the fungus might disappear completely in the next few decades.\n\nThere might be some hope. Researchers are exploring ways to cultivate the fungus as a possible substitute for the wildly harvested variety. Meanwhile, governments in China, India, Nepal and Bhutan have implemented regulations to protect the sustainability of caterpillar fungus.\n\nBut any solution will need to address the underlying economic and educational inequities in this remote region, opening up new opportunities for these communities to make a living so they don\u2019t need to risk their lives chasing \u201cHimalayan gold.\u201d\n\nDaile Zhang is an assistant professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of North Dakota.

            "content": "As it enters its centennial year, US construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar last week revealed that its total sales and revenue in 2024 were US$64.8 billion, down 3% from $67.1 billon in 2023, the best financial year in the company\u2019s history.\n\nIn an earnings conference call, Caterpillar executives set out their expectations for the company\u2019s performance over the coming year, and CEO Jim Umpleby explained why the company is bullish on its ability to ride out the impact of any tariffs imposed on imported goods by the US government.\n\nHere are 5 things we learned about Caterpillar\u2019s performance and its expectations for the year ahead:\n\n1) CEO Jim Umpleby bullish on tariffs\n\nAlthough he was making the comment ahead of the US government\u2019s move this week to press ahead with tariffs on China and suspend proposed hefty tariffs on Canada and Mexico, Cat CEO Jim Umpleby struck a confident tone when asked what contingency plans and strategies the company is developing.\n\nNoting that it would take time to see how the situation plays out and what ultimately gets put into place, he stressed that Cat is nonetheless in a good position given that the bulk of its manufacturing capacity is on home soil.\n\n\u201cWe are a global manufacturer but our largest manufacturing presence is in the United States and we are a net exporter outside of the US. That positions us pretty well against many other companies out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do tend to try to produce in region for region but some products and components move around. As you can imagine, it is something we keep a close eye on and we will deal with it. We have been around 100 years and we have seen many different administrations and different attitudes on these issues but the fact that we have such a large US manufacturing presence positions us pretty well.\u201d\n\n2) Sales and revenue to dip in 2025\n\nCaterpillar said it expects its sales and revenues to be slightly lower in 2025, compared to 2024. In its construction industries division, it anticipates \u201cmoderately lower\u201d sales in North America, although construction spend remains healthy, driven by multi-year projects and government-backed infrastructure investments. It also expects lower dealer rental fleet loading compared to 2024, although dealer revenue is expected to grow.\n\nOverall, the company remains positive on the medium- to longer-term outlook for North America. Umpleby said that in Asia-Pacific outside of China, the business expected \u201csoft\u201d economic conditions to continue, while China is also set to remain at low levels for the above 10-ton excavator industry. It also expects a moderate decline in construction activity in Latin America and weak economic conditions in Europe. But in Africa and the Middle East, healthy levels of construction activity are expected.\n\n3) Cat hopes to grow services business further\n\nCaterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby (Image: Caterpillar)\n\nA bright spot for the company was its services division, where revenue increased 4% in 2024 to $24bn, albeit growth in the fourth quarter of the year was slightly slower than expected. The company has an \u201caspirational target\u201d to increase annual revenue further to $28 billion.\n\nUmpleby said, \u201cWorking with our dealers, we are leveraging over 1.5 million connected reporting assets and digital tools. Our Cat digital tools allow customers to more efficiently improve uptime, manage their fleets, and transact on our e-commerce platforms. For example, this year we launched an internal generative AI solution, designed to optimize the creation of intelligent leads, which we call prioritized service events, or PSEs. This tool significantly reduces the time and effort required for service recommendations, helping customers avoid unplanned downtime by clearly identifying the recommended repair options and timing for customers.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that in 2024, the business delivered more than two-thirds of new equipment with a customer value agreement and experienced better-than-expected growth in its e-commerce platforms.\n\n4) Trump\u2019s deregulation plans positive?\n\nAsked for views on policies affecting construction that could be introduced by President Donald Trump, Umpleby suggested that efforts to reduce the regulatory burden on industry would likely benefit Caterpillar. He said, \u201cIf the push for deregulation and other kinds of changes from a regulatory perspective helps increase economic growth, particularly in the US, that should be a positive. We\u2019ll have to see how that all plays out but it certainly has the potential to be positive for us.\u201d\n\n5) Cat set for an unusually sluggish Q1\n\nCat executives explained that they are expecting lower sales in the first quarter of 2025 than in the prior year.\n\nIn a typical year, it does see lower sales over that period than in the rest of the year but the trend this year is set to be \u201cmore pronounced\u201d. But they explained that this isn\u2019t down to lower underlying demand from users \u2013 rather it is to do with the levels of machine inventory dealers have. Better sales levels later in the year are expected to make up for the Q1 decline.\n\nCat\u2019s CFO Andrew Bonfield explained, \u201cAlthough dealers did reduce machine inventory significantly in the fourth quarter, they remain around the top end of the range as we enter 2025. This compares with dealer inventories in construction industries being towards the middle of the range at the beginning of 2024. As a result, we expect them to build correspondingly less inventory during the first quarter than the $1.1 billion that they built in the first quarter of 2024. As we expect machine dealer inventory to be about flat by year end, we should see a tailwind for sales in the fourth quarter as we don\u2019t expect similar machine dealer inventory change as we have seen in the last two years.\u201d\n\nHe added that underlying sales to users \u201cwill be pretty much aligned throughout the whole of the year and will be down slightly for the full year\u201d.\n\nForm placeholder",

Those weighed on the stock market generally, and Caterpillar specifically, as the multinational company is heavily dependent on the global supply chain.\n\nAs of 12:17 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) was down 0.8%, and Caterpillar stock was down 1.9% at the same time.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nCaterpillar's tariff risk\n\nThe maker of mining and construction equipment has several manufacturing facilities in China and Mexico. Over the weekend, the White House announced a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, though the tariff on Mexico was suspended for a month after an agreement between the two countries. The U.S. also imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China.\n\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs, which could impact sales of Caterpillar products in the country, and China is reportedly planning \"necessary countermeasures.\"\n\nIn its risk factors, Caterpillar acknowledges that more restrictive trade policies could negatively impact its business. A majority of Caterpillar's employees are based outside the U.S., and approximately half of its revenue comes from North America, showing it has significant exposure to global trade.\n\nAsked about tariffs during the company's earnings call last week, Caterpillar CEO Donald Umpleby said, \"Our largest manufacturing presence is in the United States, and we are a net exporter outside of the U.S., and that positions us pretty well versus many other companies out there.\" It aims to manufacture in the same region that sells, limiting tariff exposure, but it does move some components around the world.\n\nWhat's next for Caterpillar?\n\nCaterpillar stock pulled back 5% last week as the company missed the mark in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Revenue fell 5% to $16.2 billion, below the consensus at $16.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share fell from $5.23 to $5.14, beating estimates at $5.03.\n\nThe company said it expects a slight decline in revenue in 2025 and a lower adjusted operating profit margin due to weak demand in many of its international markets.\n\nA trade war, especially if it spreads, is only going to make a return to growth more difficult for Caterpillar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Caterpillar wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "In a world that\u2019s moving towards more sustainable energy solutions, a new type of marine engine is creating a buzz in the maritime industry. Caterpillar Marine is set to debut its revolutionary dual-fuel Cat 3500E engines in 2026, which could change the way tugboats and other vessels operate. With a combination of diesel and methanol as fuel sources, these engines promise high efficiency, reduced emissions, and greater operational flexibility. However, as the industry explores the potential of this new technology, questions abound about its feasibility and impact.\n\nA groundbreaking engine technology\n\nCaterpillar Marine\u2019s dual-fuel 3500E engines, which integrate both diesel and low-pressure methanol fuel systems, offer a powerful and sustainable solution for maritime operators. The methanol dual-fuel engine, a part of Caterpillar\u2019s 3500E platform, is poised to deliver the same power output as the existing diesel engines which range from 2800 to 3000 bkW while meeting stricter emission standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leveraging our deep dual-fuel expertise to help reduce emissions in the maritime industry,\u201d said Brad Johnson, vice president and general manager of Caterpillar Marine. The dual-fuel Cat 3500E engines aim to meet International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III emissions standards, which are more stringent than the current IMO Tier II standards met by the diesel version. The engines are designed to operate with high methanol substitution rates, even at low load conditions, a crucial factor for vessels like tugs that often operate at low speeds.\n\nAndres Perez, Caterpillar\u2019s global tug segment manager, further highlighted the importance of fuel flexibility, saying: \u201cThis technology will enable owners to adopt their fuel of choice when the conditions are right without having to build a new asset or face cost-prohibitive retrofits.\u201d\n\nThe methanol advantage\n\nMethanol is gaining attention as an alternative marine fuel. It exists in liquid form at ambient conditions, making it easier to store and handle than gases like hydrogen. Additionally, methanol has a lower carbon intensity and good energy density. This makes it a promising option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector. Caterpillar expects to deploy the first methanol dual-fuel 3500E engines in tugboats by 2026. This will allow operators to run their vessels on diesel for now, but retrofit them to run on methanol when it becomes more widely available.\n\n\u201cMethanol has a promising future in the industry as it is in the liquid phase for storage at ambient conditions, it has low carbon intensity and good energy density,\u201d said Perez. Caterpillar is betting that methanol will become a major part of the marine fuel mix in the coming years, and this dual-fuel engine could help pave the way for its wider adoption.\n\nWhy this engine could be a game-changer\n\nThe flexibility of the Cat 3500E engine is its key selling point. These engines are optimized for high methanol substitution rates across a wide range of load factors. For instance, a 28-meter tug operating at 8 knots and requiring 600 kW of propulsion power could achieve more than 70% methanol substitution on an energy basis. This would significantly reduce the tug\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing power or performance.\n\nWhat makes this technology even more attractive is its potential for retrofitting. Tugboats already equipped with the dual-fuel 3500E engines can easily transition to methanol when it becomes available in their regions, without the need for costly and complex modifications. \u201cFuel flexibility is key to future-proofing assets,\u201d said Perez, underscoring the ability to use whichever fuel is most viable without having to invest in entirely new vessels.\n\nWhile competitors like Rolls-Royce and MAN Energy Solutions are also exploring alternative engines in the maritime industry, including methanol-diesel engines for tugboats, Caterpillar\u2019s move to offer high methanol substitution rates and the possibility of retrofitting existing vessels gives it an edge in the race to decarbonize the maritime sector.",

            "content": "Shares of Caterpillar (CAT -1.61%) were pulling back on concerns around new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Those weighed on the stock market generally, and Caterpillar specifically, as the multinational company is heavily dependent on the global supply chain.\n\nAs of 12:17 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.35%) was down 0.8%, and Caterpillar stock was down 1.9% at the same time.\n\nCaterpillar's tariff risk\n\nThe maker of mining and construction equipment has several manufacturing facilities in China and Mexico. Over the weekend, the White House announced a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, though the tariff on Mexico was suspended for a month after an agreement between the two countries. The U.S. also imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China.\n\nCanada responded with retaliatory tariffs, which could impact sales of Caterpillar products in the country, and China is reportedly planning \"necessary countermeasures.\"\n\nIn its risk factors, Caterpillar acknowledges that more restrictive trade policies could negatively impact its business. A majority of Caterpillar's employees are based outside the U.S., and approximately half of its revenue comes from North America, showing it has significant exposure to global trade.\n\nAsked about tariffs during the company's earnings call last week, Caterpillar CEO Donald Umpleby said, \"Our largest manufacturing presence is in the United States, and we are a net exporter outside of the U.S., and that positions us pretty well versus many other companies out there.\" It aims to manufacture in the same region that sells, limiting tariff exposure, but it does move some components around the world.\n\nWhat's next for Caterpillar?\n\nCaterpillar stock pulled back 5% last week as the company missed the mark in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Revenue fell 5% to $16.2 billion, below the consensus at $16.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share fell from $5.23 to $5.14, beating estimates at $5.03.\n\nThe company said it expects a slight decline in revenue in 2025 and a lower adjusted operating profit margin due to weak demand in many of its international markets.\n\nA trade war, especially if it spreads, is only going to make a return to growth more difficult for Caterpillar.",

I think Jason Robins [CEO of a sports betting company] he runs a better operation than these clowns who are doing this stuff.\"\n\nAnother thing that he noted was that the gap left behind by institutional investors fleeing away from data center and GPU stocks on Monday was being filled by retail traders. Cramer maintained a strong position against daily traders. He shared:\n\n\"I mean Carl, the most substantive thing that people are hanging their hat on Trump and felt that they had to order. Now that\u2019s almost conspiratorial. I think that they have more in mind, than just doing ChatGPT in an advanced way.

He\u2019s talking about making the sewing machine. And I think that people don\u2019t realize that he is a visionary and he is well ahead of everything we\u2019re talking about.\"\n\nAfter having done his research, the TV show host shared some uses of the GPU firm's latest Blackwell chips that DeepSeek cannot use. According to him \"Okay so here's uses that DeepSeek can't do. That you can do on Blackwell. Alright. Alright, multi-modal memory, spatial intelligence, physical actuation, vision, and touch. So those are the things that you need Blackwell for.\" These are use cases that are involved in developing humanoid robots, and in a previous appearance, Cramer shared additional details.\n\nIn the latest episode of CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer couldn't stop talking about the DeepSeek selloff, the AI models themselves, and how stocks are behaving after a trillion dollars of market value was wiped out on Monday. Cramer maintained that while DeepSeek's ability to potentially reduce costs was impressive, it might not make the latest GPUs from Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock any less important.\n\nWe recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & DeepSeek's Limitations . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCramer wasn't done commenting on the retail traders who are in it for daily profits. He shared \"I mean look they let this happen because everybody wants to make a lot of money.\" He believes that such trading is akin to gambling. \"That's, it is a bad thing. It is bad gambling. It's like gambling on the line itself,\" Cramer stated. He added \"I bet the line's gonna go from two to one. I bet that, if I, that if I create a new line, I'm going to do even better. That's what these people are doing. And they should just go to [a sports betting platform], and have more fun, and lose less money!\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 31st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).\n\nA construction crew operating a hydraulic shovel during a nighttime project.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 50 Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the largest heavy equipment and industrial machinery companies in America. Its shares are up by a modest 23% over the past year as the overall industrial and construction environment has remained slow in the US. The shares surged by 10.7% after the November Presidential Election and added another 16% in the second and third weeks of January. However, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)'s shares soon lost momentum as they dipped by 3% after the firm warned that an uncertain economic environment could lead to a sales drop this year. However, Cramer thought the market read too much into Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)'s earnings:\n\n\"I felt Caterpillar shouldn't have been down as much. I think that Caterpillar had a good quarter.\"\n\nOverall CAT ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Caterpillar's theme for the show will be \"The Next 100 Years,\" which will highlight how technology is advancing in construction heavy equipment.\n\nThe company said its bauma Munich exhibit will encompass more than 9,000 m2, and will feature 48 machines, including 17 new introductions or upgrades. These include enhancements to the battery electric line-up, expansions to the Next Generation line-up, and additions to the demolition, waste handling and recycling portfolios.\n\nThe Cat Performance Centre will exhibit a range of solutions for jobsites, as well as the latest 301.9 Mini Hydraulic Excavator and 906 Compact Wheel Loader from the battery electric product offerings, both are available through select Cat dealer rental fleets. The newest updates to the 320 and 950 GC prototypes will also be showcased, along with associated charging options and services. Attendees can experience an electrified jobsite simulation, showing data insights and energy flows.\n\nCaterpillar employees will demonstrate advancements to VisionLink, an integrated Cat solution for equipment management, operations management and safety management. The expanded Cat Detect Portfolio, including people detection, seatbelt monitoring, Driver Safety System (DSS) and collision mitigation, will demonstrate how technologies can improve safety and performance.\n\nCat Grade offerings will be presented, including Cat Grade with 3D and Cat Payload for Excavators. Cat Command technology will enable remote machine operation from a safe distance, with a demonstration of machines operating remotely from sites across Europe including at the Caterpillar Demonstration and Learning Centre in Malaga, Spain.\n\nJoining the compact equipment offering are three recently introduced Next Generation Compact Track Loaders offering upgrades in engine power and torque, lift and tilt breakout forces, stability, operator comfort and technology.\n\nThe new D8 dozer will be featured, based on the Next Generation platform. It includes a new high-end operator station that is common with the D5-D7 platforms and comes with a 15-degree angled seat for enhanced comfort. Additionally, it introduces a full suite of Assist features and is Cat Grade 3D ready ex-factory, with the option to upgrade to Cat Command Remote Control.\n\nMaking its first appearance at bauma is the 140 AWD Next Generation Motor Grader. Still in prototype stage, this 20-tonne operating weight prototype machine consolidates two existing platforms into a common next generation platform for motor graders, providing customers more choices of features, technologies and configurations.\n\nThe launch of the new MH3032 further expands the Material Handler line-up. Ideally suited to serve the scrap segment with a near 15 m reach and up to 1 m3 grapple, this machine is equipped with ease-of-use features, including 2D E-fence with Cab Avoidance, Cat Payload and Swing Assist for improved safety, production and efficiency.\n\nFurther introductions to the demolition, waste handling and recycling portfolios include the new 330 UHD Ultra High Demolition Hydraulic Excavator. Standard features include the Stability Monitoring System with light and sound indicators in the cab on the ultra-high front, Cat Payload and Cat Grade Control with 2D for the retrofit front parts. Also joining the lineup is the introduction of the Variable Angle Boom option on the 340 VAB designed for demanding demolition sites.\n\nCaterpillar plans to display two M323 Next Generation Wheeled Excavator machines, configured specifically for the railroad industry. The new M323 railroad excavator from Caterpillar offers hydrostatic, friction or hybrid transmission options, providing maximum versatility for customers. It features both long and short radius options addressing specific application needs, while maintaining consistent lifting capacities across both configurations.\n\nA new prototype Cat 775 Off-Highway Truck and the reintroduced 395 Front Shovel will be on display. The 775 transitions to the Next Generation platform with increased truck body volume. The 395 Front Shovel features a Cat C18B engine, improved durability and extended service intervals.\n\nAs part of Caterpillar's Services Commitment, available with a Customer Value Agreement, the company is offering next-day maintenance and second-day common repair parts. If parts are not available as promised, costs may be offset by reimbursing customers for the value of the late part up to a specific amount (depending on the country/dealer). Additionally, the program offers a second-day technician response time to fix unplanned repairs.\n\nThe Cat Certified Rebuild Programs and Cat Certified Used products will highlight how end-of-life machines can be restored to like-new condition by skilled dealer technicians, who can also provide support beyond the standard machine warranty with Equipment Protection Plans. According to Cat, these offerings can reduce the cost of buying new equipment while also being a sustainable choice by reducing waste and consumption of raw materials.\n\nA range of Caterpillar Industrial Engines that are compatible with renewable fuels such as 100% hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) will be on display in Hall A4, stand 336, including the new C13D and a new high power C3.6 delivering 106 kW (142 hp).

            "content": "Shareholders might have noticed that Caterpillar Inc. ( ) filed its full-year result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 6.0% to US$371 in the past week. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$65b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Caterpillar surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$22.05 per share, modestly greater than expected. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Caterpillar after the latest results.\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Caterpillar's 16 analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$64.5b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to dip 7.4% to US$20.69 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$65.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$22.08 in 2025. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a minor downgrade to earnings per share estimates.\n\nDespite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the US$394 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Caterpillar analyst has a price target of US$493 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$250. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Caterpillar's past performance and to peers in the same . These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 0.5% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 9.0% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 4.2% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Caterpillar is expected to lag the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$394, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

This photo is of our kitchen window one day when it was around 5 degrees and we didn\u2019t go out. Violet the Dog and I missed about five days of walking this January. One day it was about 9 above and we went out and shortly into our walk Violet the Dog let me know her feet were bothering her by lifting one of her paws up, walking a few steps, and then putting it down, lifting another paw up and then walking for a few steps, then putting it down until I saw the pattern. We weren\u2019t 50 feet up the trail before we turned back to the truck and went home.\n\nThis day was in the 20\u2019s and she was fine.\n\nThen a few days later it was 50 degrees and I found this wooly bear on the back deck of our house. There is high drama in this video! Wooly bears are Pyrrharctia isabella, or the Isabella tiger moth. Theirs is an amazing adaptation:\n\nThe Isabella tiger moth can be found in many cold and temperate regions. The banded woolly bear larva emerges from the egg in the fall and overwinters in its caterpillar form, by allowing most of its mass to freeze solid. First its heart stops beating, then its gut freezes, then its blood, followed by the rest of the body. It survives being frozen by producing a cryoprotectant in its tissues.[5] This freezing occurs outside of body cells, but not within. In the spring, it thaws.\n\nYou can see the temperature swings in the National Weather Service data above for January as recorded in Johnston.\n\nWe wandered off of the path and found what looks like some kind of monster in this fallen tree. Do you see it? I wonder what stories it has to tell us?\n\nSomeone curated these lost gloves and three walking sticks. They have been there for about a week. I hope the gloves find their way home. First, there was one walking stick, then two, then three, curated for the next person to use.\n\nI think this is very kind of people\u2014to leave walking sticks for the next person to use. Even a good walk is made better with a walking stick.\n\nOne day someone(s) moved the walking sticks into this arrangement. I wondered why? Was it an art installation? Or kids goofing around? Or maybe an ancient symbolic warning?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do with them at first, but decided that since I\u2019m the volunteer park steward my job was to keep the path clear, so I returned them to where they would be better kept and ready for someone to borrow and return.\n\nIt looks to me that this plant is getting ready to flower.\n\nWhen nothing flowering is there to catch my attention I\u2019m always comforted by the beauty of fungi.\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the beauty of the ice on the crick to ponder!\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThanks for reading!

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nMaxine Kumin (born June 6, 1925, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died February 6, 2014, Warner, New Hampshire) was an American Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, novelist, essayist, and children\u2019s author. Kumin\u2019s novels were praised in literary circles, but she was best known for her poetry, written primarily in traditional forms, on the subjects of loss, fragility, family, and the cycles of life and nature.\n\nAfter graduating from Radcliffe College (A.B., 1946; M.A., 1948), Kumin taught English at several colleges. In the 1950s she met the poet Anne Sexton, who influenced her stylistic development and with whom she collaborated on several children\u2019s books. Kumin\u2019s first book of poetry, Halfway, was published in 1961. The Privilege (1965) and The Nightmare Factory (1970) address issues of Jewish identity and family and of love between men and women. Kumin\u2019s New Hampshire farm was the inspiration for her collection Up Country: Poems of New England, New and Selected (1972; Pulitzer Prize, 1973). Critics compared Kumin to Robert Frost and Henry David Thoreau for her precise, unsentimental evocations of rural New England and the rhythms of daily life.\n\nAdditional works include the acclaimed The Retrieval System (1978) and Our Ground Time Here Will Be Brief (1982), which continued her reflections on nature and death, including Sexton\u2019s 1974 suicide. Kumin\u2019s use of metre, rhyme, and structure became increasingly sophisticated. From the 1980s she began to address social issues in her poetry; some critics thought this weakened her work. Her Selected Poems, 1960\u20131990 was published in 1997. Later collections such as Jack and Other New Poems (2005), Still to Mow (2007), and Where I Live (2010) continue to mine Kumin\u2019s abiding interests in country life and family while expanding to encompass seemingly disparate topics, from the Iraq War to the deaths of beloved pets.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nKumin\u2019s numerous children\u2019s books, including When Grandmother Was Young (1969) and Mites to Mastodons: A Book of Animal Poems, Small and Large (2006), also reflect her love of family and the natural world. The short-story collection Why Can\u2019t We Live Together Like Civilized Human Beings? (1982) further explores issues of loss and relationships between men and women. Kumin again demonstrated her ability to buck genre constraints in her 1999 animal-rights mystery Quit Monks or Die!\n\nIn 1998 Kumin was in a severe carriage-driving accident. She chronicled that experience in her memoir Inside the Halo and Beyond: The Anatomy of a Recovery (2000). Kumin also penned several collections of essays, among them Women, Animals, and Vegetables (1994) and Always Beginning: Essays on a Life in Poetry (2000), that contain prose meditations on many of the recurrent themes of her poetry: womanhood, nature, and family. Kumin served as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress (now poet laureate consultant in poetry) from 1981 to 1982 and poet laureate of New Hampshire from 1989 to 1994.",

The term isn\u2019t much used in the UK \u2013 we just call everything broccoli, but there are several different types. They are all members of the brassica family \u2013 Brassica oleracea to be precise.\n\nCalabrese is the large-headed type often sold encased in a tight plastic sheath; broccoli is the sprouting type, whether that\u2019s purple, green or white sprouting.\n\nTenderstem is a trademark name for sprouting broccoli (it even has its own website).\n\nChinese kale, another cultivar of B. oleracea, which has small broccoli-like florets on thick stems with more leaves than sprouting broccoli.\n\nYou may also come across broccoli raab, or rapini, a turnip relative whose seed is sold as Cima di Rapa, which translates as turnip tops.

The seedlings were grown on until planting out in mid-May. Harvesting of the earlier varieties began in the last week of June.\n\nWe picked side shoots from our plants twice a week, recording the number and weight for each variety.

Offer ends 13 April 25. Buy now\n\nHow to grow sprouting broccoli\n\nSowing\n\nSow the seeds singly in small pots or modular trays, indoors from March or sow direct from April. You can sow in small batches from March to May to prolong the harvest period. Alternatively, buy plug plants if you want only a few.\n\nPlanting\n\nThe seeds should germinate in 7-10 days and be ready to plant out a month after sowing. Be sure to harden them off beforehand. Work a balanced fertiliser such as Growmore or pelleted chicken manure into the soil. Take care not to disturb the rootball and push the soil in around the roots firmly, but don\u2019t compress the top of the soil, as this can compact it and prevent water getting to the roots. We spaced our plants 45cm apart each way; closer spacing will reduce the number of side-shoots.\n\nCaring for sprouting broccoli\n\nGive plants a good soaking once a week in dry spells. Grow them under netting to keep off pests.\n\nMake things easier with the best watering cans from our tests\n\nHarvesting\n\nHarvest in: June to August\n\nSome sprouting broccoli varieties produce a small terminal head and then the smaller side-shoots after this is harvested. Coming up to harvest time, check the plants at least twice a week, as the tight green buds may quickly open into yellow flowers, ruining your crop. Some varieties last longer before bolting, so grow these if you want to avoid gluts. However, temperature, rainfall and time of year can all affect how long the plants will last before starting to form flowers. Pick the shoots regularly when the buds are fully formed. As a precaution, soak your harvest in salty water before cooking to get rid of any caterpillars that may be on them.\n\nCommon broccoli growing problems\n\nLeaf spot\n\nThere are several fungal leaf spots that attack brassicas causing discoloured spots to develop on the leaves. Remove any infected leaves promptly.\n\nClubroot\n\nYou can recognise clubroot damage as swollen roots with 'finger and thumb'-like projections are the typical signs. The plants wilt, appear stunted and go grey/blue as their roots are destroyed. They typically recover from the wilting at night. Infected roots soon rot into a foul-smelling mass, discharging spores into the soil.\n\nGalls vary from lumps covering the swollen bulbs on turnips and swedes to finger-like projections on fibrous-rooted brassicas. Some of the most spectacular galls occur on Chinese cabbage and other oriental greens.\n\nOnce your plants are attacked, there is no cure. However, you can earth up the plants in the hope that new roots will be formed further up the stem. These roots may then escape infection for long enough for the plants to produce a crop.\n\nWet and acid soil are the favoured conditions of clubroot. Improving drainage will help. Making raised beds is a good way of doing this. Use treated boards, for example, to make beds 1-1.5m wide and at least 15cm higher than surrounding soil. Acid soils can be made more alkaline and much less prone to clubroot infection by the addition of lime or chalk. Lime is cheap, so this is the most economic way to keep down clubroot.\n\nCabbage root fly\n\nThe first sign of attack is when the foliage turns a blue/red colour and appears stunted. Plants also wilt in hot weather. When you pull a plant, it comes up easily: most of its roots will have been eaten, and they will often be covered in maggot-like larvae. Typically, the fibrous roots will have been destroyed, and sometimes the plant will produce more fibrous roots from the base of the stem.\n\nThe maggots are usually too deep in the soil or inside plants for the insecticide to get at them. Earthing up affected older plants will sometimes let them root above the damaged areas, and may save the plants. Giving affected plants plenty of water with some liquid feed may also help overcome the damage.\n\nClosely sown crops in seedbeds, or sown where they are to crop (eg swedes, turnips and radish), can be protected by covering them with horticultural fleece or insect-proof mesh. This should be done before the first hatch of the pests in April. Fleece traps so much warmth that it is likely to \u2018cook\u2019 the crop after the end of May.\n\nInsect-proof mesh, being more ventilated, is a better option to protect plants after this. Although mesh can be laid straight over the plants, it is best supported on hoops. Make sure it is buried at least 5cm deep all round, as the flies can get in through any gaps. These covers will get young plants safely through the spring attacks, which are often the worst.\n\nTransplanted plants can be protected by discs of tarred paper, or, better still, squares of carpet underlay, fitted closely round the base of the stem. These stop the adults laying eggs close to the stem, and protect the plant. Their disadvantage is that putting them on can take a long time, and they will not work if they get blown away by strong winds, moved by the swelling stem of the growing plant or covered in soil when weeding.\n\nTo make your own barriers, cut squares of rubber carpet underlay or cardboard, about 15cm square, and cut a slit from the edge to the centre. At the centre make a small hole. The hole should fit snugly round the plant's stem.\n\nThese barriers not only exclude the pest, but act as mulches to keep roots cool and moist, keep down weeds and even shelter the predatory beetles that feed on the cabbage-root fly. Alternatively, use plastic drinking cups with the bottoms cut off and fit them over the plant at planting-out time. Push them into the soil so the plastic will stop the insects getting close to the plants.\n\nCaterpillars\n\nCaterpillars strip foliage, tunnel into the hearts of cabbages and spoil produce with their droppings or frass. There are two cabbage-white butterflies that do serious damage: the large white and the small white. Damage is also caused by moth caterpillars.\n\nLarge whites emerge in the spring and seek out cabbage plants, laying as many as 200 eggs in clumps beneath the leaves. Two weeks later, the eggs hatch and caterpillars emerge. They feed in a colony at first then disperse, but not far, so if you find one, you will find others. Once fully grown, they pupate away from plants, soon hatching into butterflies. The second generation in July and August are numerous and very damaging.\n\nThe small white is similar, emerging a little earlier in the spring, laying eggs and producing caterpillars that feed singly. The chrysalids form on the plants. There is also a second generation of small whites, which cause damage into the autumn. The second generation of both types will not hatch until spring.\n\nCabbage moths are on the wing at night during May and June, laying batches of round eggs on the leaf undersides that will hatch after two weeks. The caterpillars feed for at least a month before they mature. They pupate in the soil and generally hatch the following spring. But a few will hatch in late summer and into the autumn. They can be found in early winter if it\u2019s mild. The chrysalids of the second generation hatch in the spring.\n\nOnce the caterpillar is inside the heart or head, it is almost impossible to kill. Treat early, before the pest has a chance to get inside. Once caterpillars are inside, salvage whatever leaves you can by cutting out the damaged parts. The best way to avoid attack is to grow your plants under insect-proof mesh. Otherwise, inspect them regularly and squash any eggs or caterpillars you find. Alternatively, you can spray with the caterpillar.",

Sales and revenue came in at $16.2 billion, down about 5%.\n\nFor the year, sales and revenues were at $64.8 billion, down 3% from $67.1 billion in 2023.

Fifty-two editions in 52 weeks.\n\nWhile the newsletter about the graphic adaptation of Dead Man Walking turns one today, our work on the book itself is about to turn six.\n\nSo it seems like a good time to look back over the terrain traversed in those six years. Come with me back to\u2026\n\nThe egg\n\nThe idea for a graphic version of Sister Helen Prejean\u2019s Dead Man Walking was hatched on February 3rd, 2019, when Helen was recording the audiobook version of the original Dead Man Walking. The audio producer asked Helen whether a graphic version was available.\n\nThat\u2019s all it took\u2014which is often the way with Helen. She phoned me that day with the idea and I said \u201cOn it!\u201d\n\nWe plunged into learning about graphic books and searching for an illustrator. As you can see from my early \u2018sketches\u2019 of story flow, we were in dire need!\n\nSome early sketches of story flow.\n\nOn March 17, 2019, we unearthed a treasure in Catherine Anyango Gr\u00fcnewald, a Kenyan Swedish artist who we discovered by way of a website with broken links and a conversation carried out through Twitter messaging.\n\nWhat a find! Catherine\u2019s not only an extraordinary artist, she\u2019s also dedicated to using her art to illuminate issues of justice.\n\nTo give you a taste of her work, here\u2019s her version of one of the panels I had sketched out:\n\nA panel from graphic Dead Man Walking, illustrated by Catherine.\n\nWith Catherine on board, we submitted a proposal to Julia Masnik at the Watkins/Loomis Agency and signed a contract with Random House on September 25, 2019.\n\nThe caterpillar\n\nFor a creature that has an abundance of legs, caterpillars are surprisingly lacking in pace. Our little caterpillar of a book was no exception.\n\nWe\u2019d made a good start before signing the contract with Random House, with draft scripts of chapters 1-3, plus rough sketches of the first chapter. By early 2020, we had the first three chapters roughed out. And then\u2026\n\nCovid.\n\nEverything slowed, including the publishing industry. Our contract had included an estimated completion date of March, 2021. That was tossed out and we were given a generous amount of elbow room to finish the job.\n\nThe pupa\n\nDuring Covid, our caterpillar entered the pupa stage, with a whole lot of gestating going on inside but not much to show for it on the surface.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until November, 2023 that I completed the script of the final chapter and the epilogue. Catherine had all chapters illustrated by April, 2024.\n\nCopyediting began in June, 2024, and then it was over to the design team for page layout, lettering, font choices, speech bubbles, and a whole lot more.\n\nWhile the design team was at work, we refined and polished, worked through copyright issues, and knocked off tidbits such as acknowledgements and bios.\n\nThe butterfly\n\nNow, at the end of January, 2025, the butterfly has emerged, but it\u2019s yet to take wing.\n\nWe\u2019ve finished our reviews of the completed manuscript, and it is something to behold!\n\nCatherine is at work on the cover while we wait for back-cover blurbs to come in. We\u2019ll get one last look at the book before it heads off to China for printing.\n\nFor the next nine months or so, we\u2019ll be working on the marketing side of the book, building out what\u2019s known as our \u2018author platform.\u2019 (You, dear readers, are part of that.) I\u2019m working on an accompanying website, that I\u2019ll give you a peek at in a forthcoming newsletter.\n\nOur butterfly is scheduled for its first public flight in November, 2025, a little shy of seven years from when the idea for it was first hatched.

            "content": "A Sphinx Moth caterpillar munches on a flower on land where the hundreds of mining claims are staked recently by Rover Critical Minerals on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, in Amargosa Valley. (L.E. Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @Left_Eye_Images\n\nIn the heart of the Amargosa Valley, the Amargosa River quietly winds its way through the hottest and driest desert in North America. Though invisible on most maps, this rare desert river is nothing short of miraculous. To the rural communities that call the Amargosa Valley home, it is essential.\n\nAs elsewhere in the Southwest, and especially in the Mojave Desert, water is the lifeblood of our communities. But due to the unique geology of the Amargosa Valley, the benefits the Amargosa River provides to our communities are fragile. That is why the proposed Amargosa Valley \u201cmineral withdrawal\u201d is a necessity, both to protect against immediate threats and to secure our future.\n\nThis initiative seeks to withdraw approximately 309,000 acres of public land in the Amargosa Valley from mineral exploration and new mining, with valid existing mining rights and operations remaining intact. While mineral extraction has played a role in the history of our region, the stakes today are far too high. The pressure on our water resources has never been greater. New mining in this fragile area would pose a significant risk of depleting, diverting and contaminating the Amargosa River, which is already stretched to its limits.\n\nThe communities of the Amargosa Valley have lived in the shadow of resource extraction for decades. And yet, this time is different. The threat of widespread mining and renewable energy development has united us, as it must. Our communities are rallying behind this proposal because we understand that water transcends boundaries, ideologies and political divides. Without water, there is no agriculture, no economy, no wildlife and no future.\n\nThe Amargosa River\u2019s reach is astonishing. For our rural towns, the river is the source of drinking water, irrigation for crop and a draw for ecotourism, which is an increasingly vital part of our local economy. Without the river, Amargosa Valley and our neighboring communities will become ghost towns.\n\nThe river also feeds Ash Meadows, an incredible desert oasis that is prized by locals, sought after by visitors from around the world and home to 26 species of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. It helps maintain the delicate balance of Death Valley\u2019s ecosystems, where even the smallest disruption can have cascading effects. These interconnected concerns have forged an unprecedented coalition: local governments and federal agencies, conservationists and tribes, scientists and small-business owners. We are all standing together, urging the Department of the Interior to act swiftly and decisively by withdrawing these lands from new mineral exploration.\n\nThe stakes could not be clearer. Protecting the Amargosa Valley through this mineral withdrawal is not just an act of good stewardship, it is an act of common sense, of community survival. We cannot afford to wait. Every delay puts this fragile system and my town closer to irreversible harm.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Interior Department has the power to make this vision a reality. By finalizing the proposed Amargosa Valley mineral withdrawal, they can help ensure that current and future generations of Nevadans that cherish their rural way of life can continue to not just survive, but prosper.\n\nLet\u2019s leave a legacy that proves we understand the value of both our natural resources and of the storied and unique rural communities like mine that are part of the fabric of the American West. Time is of the essence. Our community is calling for help, and we look to our leaders to answer.\n\nCarolyn Allen is the chair of the Amargosa Valley Town Board.",

            "content": "Analysts Divided On Caterpillar's Outlook Amid Pricing Pullback And Market Volatility - Details\n\nBofA Securities analyst Michael Feniger cut the price forecast on Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT) from $452 to $414 while retaining a Buy rating.\n\nYesterday, the company reported mixed fourth-quarter FY24 results. Total sales and revenue were $16.215 billion, missing the consensus of $16.411 billion, and adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share came above the consensus of $4.99.\n\nFor 2025, sales are expected to decline ~1% due to unfavorable pricing, with a slight headwind in other income from lower interest income and currency effects.\n\nThe analyst noted that adjusted EPS was better than expected, but underlying operating profit performance underwhelmed.\n\nFeniger says that CAT is facing a pricing pullback after strong gains in favorable supply-demand conditions.\n\nConstruction pricing fell 4.6% in the fourth quarter (vs. -2.1% in the third quarter), with similar headwinds expected in the first quarter of 2025. The analyst adds that dealers reduced machine inventory by $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, creating a headwind in the first half of FY25.\n\nFeniger adjusted the estimates based on the softer 2025 guidance, with the EPS estimate cut to $19.25 from $21 for 2025 and $23 from $25 for 2026.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen maintained a Perform rating and says that although CI and RI demand remain challenges into 2025, the positive contribution from data centers is helping offset the impact on the EPS outlook and supporting valuation.\n\nThe key risk is margin performance, as negative pricing and under-absorption leave little room for error if demand softens, adds the analyst. Owen expects a volatile 2025 amid policy uncertainty, AI advancements, and a stronger commodities backdrop.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Jerry Revich reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, as the company is well-positioned to grow unit profitability cycle over cycle. The analyst raised the price forecast from $442 to $456.\n\nThis growth will be driven by increasing content, a market shift toward CAT\u2019s high-return products in Energy & Transportation, and expanding technology-enabled service growth, per the analyst.\n\nPrice Action: CAT shares are down 0.79% at $372.02 at the last check Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nLatest Ratings for CAT\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Wells Fargo Initiates Coverage On Equal-Weight Mar 2022 Jefferies Upgrades Hold Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CAT\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings",

            "content": "Cat Financial Announces 2024 Year-End Results\n\nFull-Year 2024 vs. Full-Year 2023\n\nCat Financial reported revenues of $3.49 billion for 2024, an increase of $241 million, or 7%, compared with $3.25 billion for 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to favorable impacts from higher average financing rates of $153 million and higher average earning assets of $127 million, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment of $34 million. Profit was $598 million for 2024, an increase of $35 million, or 6%, compared with $563 million for 2023.\n\nProfit before income taxes was $533 million for 2024, a decrease of $227 million, or 30%, compared with $760 million for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a loss on divestiture of a non-U.S. entity of $210 million. Excluding the loss on divestiture, the decrease of $17 million over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in general, operating and administrative expenses of $55 million and an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment of $34 million, partially offset by a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of $54 million and an insurance settlement of $33 million.\n\nThe benefit from income taxes was $66 million for 2024 compared with $192 million expense for 2023. The benefit from income taxes for 2024 includes a non-cash tax benefit of $224 million from a tax law change related to currency translation. The benefit to the tax rate was partially offset by the loss on divestiture of a non-U.S. entity with no related tax benefit during 2024.\n\nDuring 2024, retail new business volume was $13.24 billion, an increase of $1.14 billion, or 9%, compared with $12.11 billion for 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in North America.\n\nAt the end of 2024, past dues were 1.56%, compared with 1.79% at the end of 2023. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $115 million for 2024, compared with $65 million for 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses totaled $267 million, or 0.91% of finance receivables, compared with $331 million, or 1.18% of finance receivables at December 31, 2023.\n\nFourth-Quarter 2024 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2023\n\nCat Financial reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenues of $883 million, an increase of $42 million, or 5%, compared with $841 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to favorable impacts from higher average earning assets of $29 million and higher average financing rates of $11 million. Fourth-quarter 2024 profit was $357 million, an increase of $191 million, or 115%, compared with $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFourth-quarter 2024 profit before income taxes was $140 million, a decrease of $41 million, or 23%, compared with $181 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to higher provision for credit losses of $17 million and an unfavorable impact from lower margin of $17 million.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, retail new business volume was $3.69 billion, an increase of $97 million, or 3%, compared with $3.60 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in North America.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the performance of our business and health of our global portfolio during 2024. Retail new business volume was strong, and we ended the year with the lowest past due percentage since 2005,\u201d said Dave Walton, President of Cat Financial and Senior Vice President with responsibility for the Financial Products Division of Caterpillar Inc. \u201cThe global Cat Financial team remains focused on executing our strategy and providing financial services solutions to Caterpillar customers and dealers worldwide.\u201d\n\nAbout Cat Financial\n\nCat Financial is a subsidiary of Caterpillar, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives.

(NYSE: CAT) announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2024.\n\nSales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $16.2 billion, a 5% decrease compared with $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating profit margin was 18.0% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with 18.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with 18.9% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth-quarter 2024 profit per share was $5.78, compared with $5.28 profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $5.14, compared with fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted profit per share of $5.23.\n\nFull-year sales and revenues in 2024 were $64.8 billion, down 3% compared with $67.1 billion in 2023. The decrease reflected lower sales volume of $3.5 billion, partially offset by favorable price realization of $1.2 billion. Lower sales volume was primarily driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. Operating profit margin was 20.2% in 2024, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Adjusted operating profit margin was 20.7% in 2024, compared with 20.5% in 2023. Full-year profit was $22.05 per share in 2024, compared with profit of $20.12 per share in 2023. Adjusted profit per share in 2024 was $21.90, compared with adjusted profit per share of $21.21 in 2023.\n\n\"I'm proud of our global team's strong performance in 2024 as they delivered record adjusted profit per share and strong ME&T free cash flow,\" said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. \"As we kick off our centennial year, we remain committed to serving our customers, executing our strategy and continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth.\"\n\nIn 2024, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs. 2024 adjusted profit per share also excluded a discrete tax benefit for a tax law change related to currency translation and excluded mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans. In 2023, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs, which included the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business and other restructuring costs. 2023 adjusted profit per share also excluded a benefit for certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments and mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans. Please see a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the appendix on pages 14 to 16.\n\nFor the full year 2024, enterprise operating cash flow was $12.0 billion, and the company ended the fourth quarter with $6.9 billion of enterprise cash. During the year, the company deployed $7.7 billion of cash for repurchases of Caterpillar common stock and $2.6 billion of cash for dividends.\n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\nConsolidated Sales and Revenues\n\nConsolidated Sales and Revenues Comparison\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 vs. Fourth Quarter 2023\n\nTo access this chart, go to https://investors.caterpillar.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx for the downloadable version of Caterpillar fourth-quarter 2024 earnings.\n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2023 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2024 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $16.215 billion, a decrease of $855 million, or 5%, compared with $17.070 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of $859 million. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower sales of equipment to end users. Dealer inventory decreased by $1.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a decrease of $900 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSales were lower across the three primary

Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected increased period manufacturing costs.\n\nFINANCIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT (Millions of dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues by Geographic Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter 2024\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter 2023\n\n$ Change\n\n% Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth America\n\n$ 680\n\n$ 645\n\n$ 35\n\n5 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin America\n\n103\n\n100\n\n3\n\n3 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEAME\n\n128\n\n127\n\n1\n\n1 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia/Pacific\n\n113\n\n109\n\n4\n\n4 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues\n\n$ 1,024\n\n$ 981\n\n$ 43\n\n4 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment Profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter 2024\n\nFourth\n\nQuarter 2023\n\nChange\n\n% Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment Profit\n\n$ 166\n\n$ 234\n\n$ (68)\n\n(29 %)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Products' segment revenues were $1.024 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $43 million, or 4%, compared with $981 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of $29 million driven by North America, and a favorable impact from higher average financing rates across all regions except North America of $11 million.\n\nFinancial Products' segment profit was $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $68 million, or 29%, compared with $234 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities of $23 million, an unfavorable impact from lower margin of $17 million and higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial of $17 million.\n\nAt the end of 2024, past dues at Cat Financial were 1.56%, compared with 1.79% at the end of 2023. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $115 million for 2024, compared with $65 million for 2023. As of December 31, 2024, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $267 million, or 0.91% of finance receivables, compared with $331 million, or 1.18% of finance receivables, at December 31, 2023.\n\nCorporate Items and Eliminations\n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $227 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $257 million from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by decreased expenses due to timing differences, a favorable change in fair value adjustments related to deferred compensation plans and lower restructuring costs.\n\nNotes\n\ni.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our outlook, projections, forecasts or trend descriptions. These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\n\nCaterpillar's actual results may differ materially from those described or implied in our forward-looking statements based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve; (ii) commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of material; (iii) government monetary or fiscal policies; (iv) political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate; (v) international trade policies and their impact on demand for our products and our competitive position, including the imposition of new tariffs or changes in existing tariff rates; (vi) our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers' needs; (vii) the impact of the highly competitive environment in which we operate on our sales and pricing; (viii) information technology security threats and computer crime; (ix) inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers; (x) a failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures; (xi) union disputes or other employee relations issues; (xii) adverse effects of unexpected events; (xiii) disruptions or volatility in global financial markets limiting our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers; (xiv) failure to maintain our credit ratings and potential resulting increases to our cost of borrowing and adverse effects on our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets; (xv) our Financial Products segment's risks associated with the financial services industry; (xvi) changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions; (xvii) an increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial's customers; (xviii) currency fluctuations; (xix) our or Cat Financial's compliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in debt agreements; (xx) increased pension plan funding obligations; (xxi) alleged or actual violations of trade or anti-corruption laws and regulations; (xxii) additional tax expense or exposure, including the impact of U.S. tax reform; (xxiii) significant legal proceedings, claims, lawsuits or government investigations; (xxiv) new regulations or changes in financial services regulations; (xxv) compliance with environmental laws and regulations; (xxvi) catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and (xxvii) other factors described in more detail in Caterpillar's Forms 10-Q, 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.\n\nThe company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of six significant items in order for the company's results to be meaningful to readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024, (ii) other restructuring income/costs, (iii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iv) a discrete tax benefit for a tax law change related to currency translation in 2024, (v) restructuring costs related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 and (vi) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments in 2023. The company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.\n\nReconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are as follows:\n\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\n\nOperating\n\nProfit\n\nOperating\n\nProfit\n\nMargin\n\nProfit\n\nBefore\n\nTaxes\n\nProvision\n\n(Benefit) for\n\nIncome\n\nTaxes\n\nProfit\n\nProfit per\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 2,924\n\n18.0 %\n\n$ 3,243\n\n$ 463\n\n$ 2,791\n\n$ 5.78 Other restructuring (income) costs\n\n37\n\n0.3 %\n\n37\n\n10\n\n27\n\n0.05 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n(154)\n\n(43)\n\n(111)\n\n(0.23) Tax law change related to currency translation\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n\u2014\n\n224\n\n(224)\n\n(0.46) Three Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted\n\n$ 2,961\n\n18.3 %\n\n$ 3,126\n\n$ 654\n\n$ 2,483\n\n$ 5.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 3,134\n\n18.4 %\n\n$ 3,249\n\n$ 587\n\n$ 2,676\n\n$ 5.28 Other restructuring (income) costs\n\n92\n\n0.5 %\n\n92\n\n27\n\n65\n\n0.13 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n(97)\n\n(26)\n\n(71)\n\n(0.14) Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n\u2014\n\n18\n\n(18)\n\n(0.04) Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted\n\n$ 3,226\n\n18.9 %\n\n$ 3,244\n\n$ 606\n\n$ 2,652\n\n$ 5.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 13,072\n\n20.2 %\n\n$ 13,373\n\n$ 2,629\n\n$ 10,792\n\n$ 22.05 Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities\n\n164\n\n0.2 %\n\n164\n\n54\n\n110\n\n0.22 Other restructuring (income) costs\n\n195\n\n0.3 %\n\n195\n\n46\n\n149\n\n0.32 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n(154)\n\n(43)\n\n(111)\n\n(0.23) Tax law change related to currency translation\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n\u2014\n\n224\n\n(224)\n\n(0.46) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted\n\n$ 13,431\n\n20.7 %\n\n$ 13,578\n\n$ 2,910\n\n$ 10,716\n\n$ 21.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 12,966\n\n19.3 %\n\n$ 13,050\n\n$ 2,781\n\n$ 10,335\n\n$ 20.12 Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture\n\n586\n\n0.9 %\n\n586\n\n\u2014\n\n586\n\n1.14 Other restructuring (income) costs\n\n194\n\n0.3 %\n\n194\n\n48\n\n146\n\n0.30 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n(97)\n\n(26)\n\n(71)\n\n(0.14) Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 %\n\n\u2014\n\n106\n\n(106)\n\n(0.21) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted\n\n$ 13,746\n\n20.5 %\n\n$ 13,733\n\n$ 2,909\n\n$ 10,890\n\n$ 21.21\n\nThe company believes it is important to separately disclose the annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for the results to be meaningful to readers. The annual effective tax rate is discussed using non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of amounts associated with discrete items recorded fully in the quarter they occur. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, these items consist of (i) pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (ii) the decrease in the annual effective tax rate, (iii) a discrete tax benefit for a tax law change related to currency translation in 2024, (iv) a settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense, (v) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024, (vi) the impact of changes in estimates related to prior years in 2024, (vii) restructuring costs related to divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 and (viii) deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments in 2023. The company believes the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.\n\nA reconciliation of the effective tax rate to annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items is below:\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nProfit Before\n\nTaxes\n\nProvision\n\n(Benefit) for\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nEffective Tax\n\nRate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 3,243\n\n$ 463\n\n14.3 % Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n(154)\n\n(43)\n\n\n\nTax law change related to currency translation\n\n\u2014\n\n224\n\n\n\nDecrease in annual effective tax rate\n\n\u2014\n\n33\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n8\n\n\n\nAnnual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items\n\n$ 3,089\n\n$ 685\n\n22.2 % Decrease in annual effective tax rate\n\n\u2014\n\n(33)\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n(8)\n\n\n\nOther restructuring (income) costs\n\n37\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted\n\n$ 3,126\n\n$ 654\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 3,249\n\n$ 587\n\n18.1 % Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n(97)\n\n(26)\n\n\n\nDecrease in annual effective tax rate\n\n\u2014\n\n112\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n3\n\n\n\nAnnual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items\n\n$ 3,152\n\n$ 676\n\n21.4 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecrease in annual effective tax rate\n\n\u2014\n\n(112)\n\n\n\nDeferred tax valuation allowance adjustments\n\n\u2014\n\n18\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nOther restructuring (income) costs\n\n92\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted\n\n$ 3,244\n\n$ 606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 13,373\n\n$ 2,629\n\n19.7 % Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities\n\n164\n\n54\n\n\n\nPension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n(154)\n\n(43)\n\n\n\nTax law change related to currency translation\n\n\u2014\n\n224\n\n\n\nChanges in estimates related to prior years\n\n\u2014\n\n47\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n57\n\n\n\nAnnual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items\n\n$ 13,383\n\n$ 2,968\n\n22.2 % Changes in estimates related to prior years\n\n\u2014\n\n(47)\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n(57)\n\n\n\nOther restructuring (income) costs\n\n195\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted\n\n$ 13,578\n\n$ 2,910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\n\n$ 13,050\n\n$ 2,781\n\n21.3 % Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture\n\n586\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nPension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses\n\n(97)\n\n(26)\n\n\n\nDeferred tax valuation allowance adjustments\n\n\u2014\n\n88\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n57\n\n\n\nAnnual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items\n\n$ 13,539\n\n$ 2,900\n\n21.4 % Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments\n\n\u2014\n\n18\n\n\n\nExcess stock-based compensation\n\n\u2014\n\n(57)\n\n\n\nOther restructuring (income) costs\n\n194\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted\n\n$ 13,733\n\n$ 2,909\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Consolidating Data\n\nThe company is providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis.

The warning comes as Caterpillar reported fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates due in part to higher-than-anticipated construction demand.\n\nShares of the Irving, Texas-based company fell 4.6% during premarket trading in New York.\n\nCaterpillar is viewed as a bellwether for global economic growth since it supplies heavy equipment to the construction, mining and energy industries around the world. Among the challenges ahead, Caterpillar also faces economic headwinds across China and Europe. Caterpillar Q4 2024\n\nStill, the company could benefit this year from efforts by the Trump administration to bring back manufacturing to the U.S. as well as any potential rise in global infrastructure projects.\n\nShares of Caterpillar had climbed more than 9% from the start of January to Jan. 29 amid optimism for an uptick in the company\u2019s energy and transportation business, as well as its role as a leading producer of backup power for data centers.\n\nInvestors, though, have been concerned by elevated inventories of Caterpillar machines at dealerships that sell to consumers. Such stockpiles provide an insight into demand \u2014 high inventories suggest customers aren\u2019t buying machines off dealer lots and low levels indicate strong consumption. Caterpillar said Jan. 30 that it isn\u2019t expecting a significant change in dealer inventories this year.\n\nFourth-quarter adjusted earnings were $5.14 per share, beating the $5.05 average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.\n\nWant more news?

            "content": "Caterpillar expects a weaker 2025, but you shouldn't panic-sell the stock.\n\nShares of Caterpillar (CAT -1.72%) slumped a little over 5% Thursday morning and were still trading around 4.8% lower as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nAlthough the construction and mining giant beat earnings estimates for its fourth quarter, its revenue fell short of analysts' estimates yet again. Caterpillar's outlook, however, spooked investors, raising concerns about whether the stock will be able to maintain momentum after rallying 23% in 2024.\n\nDecelerating sales but steady cash flows\n\nHere are some key numbers from Caterpillar's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report (all changes are year over year):\n\nRevenue: Down 5% in Q4 and 3% in 2024\n\nOperating margin: 18% in Q4 and 20.2% in 2024. Full-year margin was up from 19.3%\n\nEarnings per share (EPS): Up around 10% each in Q4 and the full year\n\nMachinery, energy, and transportation (ME&T) free cash flow (FCF): Down from $10 billion in 2023 to $9.4 billion in 2024\n\nCaterpillar reports ME&T cash flows separately since it also has a financial arm. While sales from Caterpillar's construction industries and resource industries (mining) segments declined 8% and 9% respectively in the fourth quarter, its energy and transportation (E&T) business was a saving grace. Sales from E&T were flat thanks to higher pricing, and it also reported profit growth, unlike Caterpillar's other two segments.\n\nAlthough Caterpillar's FCF fell in 2024, it was still near the top end of the company's guidance of $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nWhy is Caterpillar stock falling, and what's next?\n\nCaterpillar's 2024 numbers weren't nearly as bad, but it expects \"slightly lower\" revenue in 2025 versus $64.8 billion generated last year. Management doesn't foresee a major change in dealer inventory by the end of the year. Caterpillar sells equipment through its extensive global dealership network, and no or a small change in inventory on the dealers' end would mean fewer equipment purchases.\n\nUncertainty under the Trump administration is one of the reasons Caterpillar anticipates softer sales this year, especially amid persistently high interest rates that have already made borrowing costly for dealers.\n\nGiven the backdrop, Caterpillar stock could remain under pressure in the short term. For the long term though, Caterpillar remains a top blue chip stock to own given its leadership in construction, mining equipment, and off-highway engines, as well as its financial fortitude and earnings and dividend track record.",

            "content": "Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.9% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Caterpillar\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 4.4% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was consistently weak.\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Caterpillar grew its sales at a sluggish 3.8% compounded annual growth rate. This fell short of our benchmark for the industrials sector, but there are still things to like about Caterpillar.\n\nAutomation that increases efficiencies and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new sales opportunities for construction machinery companies. On the other hand, construction machinery companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the commercial and residential construction that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.\n\n\"I'm proud of our global team's strong performance in 2024 as they delivered record adjusted profit per share and strong ME&T free cash flow,\" said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby.\n\nIs now the time to buy Caterpillar? Find out in our full research report .\n\nConstruction equipment company Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales falling 5% year on year to $16.22 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $5.14 per share was 2.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nCaterpillar has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Caterpillar\u2019s operating margin rose by 9.3 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has meaningfully improved.\n\nCaterpillar Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nThis quarter, Caterpillar generated an operating profit margin of 18%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 14% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 3.8% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nCaterpillar Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into Caterpillar\u2019s earnings quality to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Caterpillar\u2019s operating margin was flat this quarter but expanded by 9.3 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 13.2%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.\n\nCaterpillar Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor Caterpillar, its two-year annual EPS growth of 25.7% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base.\n\nIn Q4, Caterpillar reported EPS at $5.14, down from $5.23 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 2.2%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Caterpillar\u2019s full-year EPS of $21.90 to stay about the same.\n\nKey Takeaways from Caterpillar\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many resounding positives in these results. Its revenue missed, and its EBITDA also fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Management said that \"lower sales volume was primarily driven by lower sales of equipment to end users.\" Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 4.4% to $376.12 immediately following the results.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s latest earnings report disappointed. One quarter doesn\u2019t define a company\u2019s quality, so let\u2019s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.",

These companies have a strong market share and offer diverse sets of excavators in the Colombian industry. Bobcat, LiuGong, and Develon are niche players in the Colombia crawler excavator market. These companies offer low product diversification and have a strong presence in the country's industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium-size excavators accounted for the largest market share of the Colombia crawler excavator market in 2024. 101 HP-200 HP range crawler excavators accounted for the largest share in 2024. Significant investment in the country's infrastructure sector is driving the growth of several excavators in the Colombia crawler excavator market.\n\nLarge crawler excavators are also gaining good industry share due to their extensive uses in large construction & mining projects across the country. Several large excavators are presently operating in coal, nickel & Lithium mining projects. The crawler excavators utilization in the construction industry holds a significant share of the Colombia crawler excavator market. The crawler excavator is majorly used in road construction & renovation projects across the country. The crawler excavator demand is expected to grow gradually in the mining sector due to rising government focus on increasing metal production such as copper, nickel, & lithium for energy transition.\n\nColombia's construction industry was impacted by the sluggish performance of the housing sector in 2024. The sector is expected to improve in 2025 due to improvements in economic conditions & government policies supporting the housing industry.\n\nMARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS\n\nRise in the Use of Automation Technology in Excavators\n\nThe use of automated technology such as IOT & AI has increased in the Colombia crawler excavator market.\n\nTechnology offers several benefits to operators. It allows to detection of faults and the storage of relevant information. It offers greater safety to the operator, improves productivity, and generates efficiency. Technologies reduce labor dependency and help avoid large projects getting delayed.\n\nSeveral OEMs in the country such as Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Volvo Construction Equipment focus on adopting automated technologies that provide them the competitive edge over other companies.\n\nGrowing Use of Digital Platforms for Equipment Supply\n\nAlthough the supply of machinery has increased, a major hurdle continues to be the logistics and prompt access to equipment.\n\nIn various parts of the country, particularly in regions distant from large metropolitan areas, the costs of transport and delivery times can pose a considerable challenge.\n\nIn addition, the availability of spare parts and maintenance services also influences the machinery supply. To address these difficulties, digital platforms like Equipesados have surfaced as creative solutions.\n\nSurge in Infrastructure Investment Projects\n\nThe Colombian government will increase its investment in infrastructure projects in 2025. For instance, improvement of river port facilities - the government plans to improve port facilities located in river areas. This is likely to facilitate water transport & trade and promote greater connectivity.\n\nDevelopment of regional, local, and ancestral roads - priority is to be given to improving these secondary and tertiary roads, as they are essential to accessibility and connectivity in the most remote areas of the country that have limited state presence.\n\nInvestment in 4G & 5G Road Development Plan\n\nThe 4G and 5G road development plan is the main strategy to modernize the road network of the country. The government initiated a project to construct fourth and fifth-generation highways with the primary goal of reducing travel times and enhancing road safety. The development plan is projected to support the Colombia crawler excavator market growth.\n\nAt present, according to the National Highway Administration (ANI), 47 road projects are being carried out across the country, of which 39 belong to the fourth and fifth-generation categories. According to the ANI, the initial investment in these projects is expected to reach USD 16.2 billion in 2025.\n\nINDUSTRY RESTRAINTS\n\nIncrease in Construction Cost\n\nIn 2024, there was a surge in steel and iron prices across the region. The rise in prices was due to the rapid emergence of demand and the limited response of supply. There was a high demand for building materials such as steel, iron, and cement in 2024 due to a spike in infrastructure development projects across the globe.\n\nAccording to DANE, housing construction costs increased by 7.5% in October 2024. The increasing price of iron and steel can discourage the launch of new projects under the social housing scheme due to the increase in overall prices of house construction.\n\nGrowing Demand for Rental Equipment\n\nThe Colombian market witnesses an increasing preference for machinery rental rather than outright purchases. This trend is driven by the variability in construction projects, prompting companies to minimize expenses and avoid the long-term upkeep of equipment.\n\nRenting provides the advantage of flexibility, enabling contractors to utilize machinery solely for the duration needed. The machinery rental sector is projected to keep expanding in the upcoming years, particularly within the infrastructure construction industry.\n\nKEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED\n\nHow big is the Colombia crawler excavator market?\n\nWhat is the growth rate of the Colombia crawler excavator market?\n\nWho are the key players in the Colombia crawler excavator market?\n\nWhat are the trends in the Colombia crawler excavator market?\n\nWhich are the major distributor companies in the Colombia crawler excavator market?\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 147 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value in 2024 2378 Units Forecasted Market Value by 2030 3070 Units Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.3% Regions Covered Colombia\n\n\n\nMarket Landscape\n\nPESTLE Analysis\n\nEconomic Scenario\n\nMarket Dynamic\n\nKey Economic Regions\n\nImport & Export Analysis\n\nSupply Chain Analysis\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nProminent Vendors\n\nCaterpillar\n\nKomatsu\n\nSANY\n\nZoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nVolvo Construction Equipment\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery\n\nJCB\n\nKobelco\n\nXuzhou Construction Machinery Group (XCMG)\n\nHyundai Construction Equipment\n\nOther Prominent Vendors\n\nLiebherr\n\nCase Construction\n\nLiuGong\n\nDEVELON\n\nBobcat\n\nDistributor Profiles\n\nNewman Maquinaria Pesada\n\nCENTRAL S.A.S\n\nImportadora Casa Colombia\n\nSegmentation by Crawler Excavator\n\nSize\n\nMini Excavator\n\nSmall Excavator\n\nMedium Excavator\n\nLarge Excavator\n\nGross Power\n\nLess Than 60 HP\n\n60 HP -100 HP\n\n101 HP-200 HP\n\nAbove 200 HP\n\nSegmentation by End Users\n\nConstruction\n\nMining\n\nAgriculture\n\nForestry\n\nOthers (Power Generation, Utilities Municipal Corporations, Oil & Gas, Cargo Handling, Power Generation Plants, Waste Management)\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/ukm33y\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

            "content": "Caterpillar\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue fell 5% to $16.2bn due to weaker volumes. This was driven by declines across all three of the group\u2019s core divisions, with the drops in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation being 4-5% worse than market forecasts.\n\nOperating profit fell at a slightly faster pace of 7% to $2.9bn, with lower volumes being the key driver.\n\nThe core construction business generated free cash flow of $3.0bn, down from $3.2bn.\n\nCaterpillar expects first-quarter revenue to be \u201clower\u201d than 2024\u2019s level of $15.8bn. Underlying operating profit margins are also expected to weaken.\n\nThe shares were down 4.9% in pre-market trading.\n\nOur view\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s fourth-quarter numbers were a touch softer than markets had hoped for. Lower volumes were the main driver due to weak end demand, although there was some slight pullback in prices too. The group\u2019s outlook for 2025 points to a further decline on the top line so we could see Caterpillar come under further pressure in the near term.\n\nFor nearly a century, the company's built mission-critical heavy machinery, which has led to its position as one of the world's most valuable brands. Three key pillars underpin the business model; Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation.\n\nDespite some softening in the near-term outlook, we see longer-term positives in all three. Infrastructure spend has tailwinds from government-related investment in the US. For mining equipment, commodity prices have come down, but remain high enough for continued investment. Longer term, we see increased demand for materials that help support the global energy transition and Caterpillars products help make that a reality.\n\nThe AI wave is touching everyone and with huge investment in data centre buildouts, Caterpillar looks set to benefit. It\u2019s increasing investment in some of its products that help support the buildout which we think is a smart move.\n\nIn Energy & Transportation, demand for oil & gas related products could well be peaking. It's in the more environmentally friendly offerings that we see longer-term potential, innovations like green hydrogen generators can help end customers meet their climate-related objectives.\n\nRunning across all three segments is the services offering, where Caterpillar offers repairs and upgrades throughout its products' life cycles. This helps support revenue streams and is an offering that's gone from strength to strength.\n\nStrong free cash flow was welcome news and helps to ease the pressures that the heavy debt load brings. As a mature business, it can stomach a higher debt load, and levels relative to profits have been steady over time. That cash flow also supports shareholder returns, with $10.3bn delivered in 2024 through dividends and buybacks \u2013 though no returns are guaranteed.\n\nCaterpillar offers indirect exposure to a range of end markets. Looking further out, we remain confident in the longer-term industry growth drivers, and like Caterpillar as a business leader. We do see some uncertainty in the near term as the level of demand finds a level to settle at.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) risk\n\nGeneral Industrial companies are medium risk in terms of ESG but can trend up to the higher end of the spectrum depending on subindustry. The primary risks can include labour relations, emissions (either product or production-based), business ethics and product governance. Other concerns are waste and health & safety.\n\nAccording to Sustainalytics, Caterpillar\u2019s management of material ESG issues is average.\n\nCaterpillar prohibits bribery, requiring employees to complete yearly code of conduct training. While its audit committee oversees compliance, the company recently faced a U.S. investigation into tax and export practices, resulting in a settlement with the IRS in late 2022 without penalties. Caterpillar highlights its efforts in talent recruitment and development but lacks disclosures on employee turnover and the scope of its product quality certifications across manufacturing operations.",

(NYSE:CAT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that\u2019s when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we\u2019re not gonna have any idea what the heck we\u2019re doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can\u2019t possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed\u2019s decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It\u2019s too hard and I don\u2019t want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nAhead of Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:CAT) announcement of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results on January 30, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cThursday morning starts with Caterpillar, which is a conference call stock, meaning you can\u2019t make a decision until you hear the call because that\u2019s where you learn about the future. I think the stock\u2019s had an amazing run, but CAT\u2019s no longer a cyclical, it\u2019s a secular grower because CEO, Jim Umpleby has maneuvered its business into more consistent end markets.\u201d\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leading global manufacturer and seller of heavy machinery and equipment, focusing on industries like construction, mining, and transportation. Previously, Cramer has called CAT a \u201cGreat Fed rate cut stock\u201d. On January 13, analysts at financial services firm Evercore ISI upgraded the company stock from an Underperform rating to In Line following a survey of dealers in the construction equipment and heavy machinery sectors.\n\nDavid Raso, managing director and analyst at Evercore ISI, noted in a January 12 report that \u201cCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is somewhat relying on price to move equipment, but it\u2019s generally working.\u201d He added that Caterpillar dealers\u2019 six-month sales and purchasing forecasts are above the industry survey\u2019s average. Additionally, Evercore ISI found that while new inventory remains above the industry average, it is gradually declining. However, used inventory has increased, which they attribute to weaker pricing for both new and used equipment compared to the industry survey\u2019s average.\n\nOverall CAT ranks 10th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "An official report on January 27, 2025 reveals Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's recent purchase of Caterpillar CAT stock, valued between $3,003 and $45,000. The transaction took place on January 27, 2025, as per the January filing.\n\nAt this time, Caterpillar shares are trading down 1.08% at $390.71.\n\nWhat Representative Has Been Trading Recently\n\nOver the previous three years, Marjorie Taylor Greene conducted 163 trades, totaling more than $1.14 million. The largest of these were in Costco Wholesale and Home Depot stock. Some of the most notable transactions the Rep. has executed recently include:\n\nAdobe ADBE : $1,001 - $15,000 Purchase\n\n$1,001 - $15,000 Purchase Amazon.com AMZN : $1,001 - $15,000 Purchase\n\n$1,001 - $15,000 Purchase Applied Mat AMAT : $1,001 - $15,000 Purchase\n\nHere's a summary of Marjorie Taylor Greene's most recent trades:\n\nCompany Ticker Stock Type Amount Transaction Type Transaction Date Adobe ADBE STOCK $1,001 - $15,000 P 2024-12-24 Amazon.com AMZN STOCK $1,001 - $15,000 P 2024-12-24 Applied Mat AMAT STOCK $1,001 - $15,000 P 2024-12-24 Caterpillar CAT STOCK $1,001 - $15,000 P 2024-12-24 Duke Energy DUK STOCK $1,001 - $15,000 P 2024-12-24\n\nIf you want to stay updated on Marjorie Taylor Greene's trades and other congressional members, check out our government trades tool to track their activity in real time!\n\nThe Importance of Congressional Transactions\n\nA congressional transaction is when any representative or senator either buys or sells an individual stock.\n\nAnyone working in Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report to inform the public of their recent transaction within 30 days of being notified of the transaction and within 45 days of the transaction date.\n\nIn April 2012, Former President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act into law. The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure.\n\nWhy Congressional Transactions Matter\n\nCongressional transactions shouldn't be the primary reason for an investing decision, but they can be an important factor for an investor to consider.\n\nWhen a senator or representative makes a new purchase, it could be an indication they expect the stock to rise.\n\nA sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean the seller thinks the stock will go down.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

The first treatments began recently in Calasparra and will continue through January, covering towns such as Mula, Bullas, Lorca, Ricote, and other parts of Murcia.\n\nTargeting public forests and popular outdoor spots\n\nThe treatments are being carried out in public forests that are widely used for outdoor activities like hiking and cycling. Key areas include Cresta del Gallo and the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Esperanza in Calasparra.\n\nWhy the Pine Processionary Caterpillar is dangerous\n\nThe pine processionary caterpillar is a harmful pest to Mediterranean ecosystems. In their larval stage, the caterpillars develop toxic hairs that can cause severe allergic reactions in humans and animals. These caterpillars move down to the ground in long \u2018processions\u2019 during winter, increasing the risk of contact. Reactions include skin rashes, eye inflammation, and even serious respiratory problems. To animals, the symptoms can be fatal.\n\nGovernment measures to control the caterpillars\n\nThe regional government\u2019s plan includes a mix of methods to address the infestation:\n\nSpraying insecticides in affected areas.\n\nManual removal of caterpillar nests.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly solutions, such as installing bird nests and bat shelters to encourage natural predators.\n\nDespite challenges like ongoing droughts, these treatments have proven effective, with the affected areas steadily decreasing over the years.\n\nAdvice for staying safe\n\nResidents are advised to avoid areas with visible nests or caterpillars, especially on sunny or windy days when caterpillar hairs are more likely to spread. The government emphasises caution and urges people to report sightings to help manage infestations more effectively.\n\nRead more Costa Calida news, articles and events here",

            "content": "Genome sequencing and assembly\n\nThe grassland caterpillar G. qinghaiensis were collected in Yushu County (33\u00b045\u2032N/95\u00b048\u2032E), Qinghai province, China. Total genomic DNA from a male adult was extracted for genome sequencing using a Qiagen DNA purification kit (Qiagen, USA). The genome was sequenced using a combination of short and long-read strategies. Short-read sequencing library was constructed using a Truseq Nano DNA HT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA), and sequenced on MGISEQ-2000 platform (BGI, China). After quality-filtering using fastp v0.20.010, 28.17 Gb clean short reads were obtained. For long-read sequencing, library was generated using the DNA Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, England) and sequenced on PromethION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, England). A total of 129.06 Gb Nanopore reads were attained after quality-filtering using Guppy v3.2.2 + 9fe0a7811, which covered 149.9 folds of G. qinghaiensis genome.\n\nGenome size and heterozygosity rate of G. qinghaiensis were inferred by kmerFreq12 using BGI short reads, based on 17-mer frequency distribution. The estimated genome size was 844.04 Mb and the heterozygosity was 1.3%. For de novo genome assembly, genome was initially assembled with NextDenovo v2.3.113 using Nanopore long reads. The preliminary assembly was then polished with NextPolish v1.3.014 using both long reads (three iterations) and short reads (four iterations). Redundant contigs was eliminated using Purge Haplotigs15. The final assembly is 861.04 Mb in size, encompassing 107 contigs, with a contig N50 of 18.65 Mb, and the GC content of 35.23% (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 Statistics of Gynaephora qinghaiensis genome assembly. Full size table\n\nTranscriptome sampling and sequencing\n\nFor transcriptome sequencing, eggs, first instar larvae, late instar larvae, female pupae, female adults of G. qinghaiensis were collected separately with three replicates. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol\u00ae Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Shanghai, China) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, USA). The reads with adaptors and low-quality reads were filtered using fastp v0.20.010.\n\nGenome prediction and functional annotation\n\nThe repeat elements in the genome were identified with a combination of de novo and homology approaches. De novo predictions for long terminal repeat element (LTR) and non-LTR repeat sequences were performed using LTR_Finder16 and RepeatModeler v2.0.117, separately. The results from two softwares combined with RepBase library v2017012718 and Dfam v3.119 database were used as the library for RepeatMasker v4.0.720 to identify and classify repeat elements in genome. The repeat annotation result showed that repetitive elements sequences account for 67.4% of the genome sequence (Table 2). Among them, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) (22.37%), Rolling-circles (9.95%) and LTRs (8.21%) represented the three most abundant repeat types.\n\nTable 2 Annotation of repeat elements in the Gynaephora qinghaiensis genome. Full size table\n\nProtein-coding gene prediction was performed using a combination of ab initio, homology, and transcriptome-based approaches. For ab initio prediction, Braker2 v2.1.221 were used. For homology-based predictions, we downloaded the protein sequences of nine closely related species including Arctia plantaginis (RefSeq assembly accession: GCA_902825455.1), Bombyx mori (GCF_014905235.1), Helicoverpa armigera (GCF_023701775.1), Manduca sexta (GCF_014839805.1), Spodoptera litura (GCF_002706865.2) and Trichoplusia ni (GCF_003590095.1) from the NCBI database, Euproctis similis (GCA_905147225.2), Lymantria monacha (GCA_905163515.2) and Orgyia antiqua (GCA_916999025.1) from the Darwin Tree of Life Data Portal database (https://portal.darwintreeoflife.org/). The protein sequences were matched with the G. qinghaiensis genome using tblastn v2.13.022 with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5, and the matched proteins were then mapped against the homologous genomic sequences using Exonerate v2.2.023 and GenomeThreader v1.7.124. For transcriptome-based prediction, RNA-Seq data were aligned with genome assembly using Hisat v2.2.125 and gene structures were predicted using Stringtie v2.1.726. The non-redundant reference gene set was generated by integrating genes predicted from three methods using EvidenceModeler v1.1.127. Eventually, 16,618 protein-coding genes were predicted (Table 3). To unravel the functions of protein-coding genes in G. qinghaiensis, we annotated the official gene set against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (Nr, https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) and SwissProt databases (https://www.uniprot.org/) using blastp v2.13.022 with an E-value cutoff of 1e\u22125. In addition, Protein domains were predicted using HMMER v3.3.228. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) were predicted using BlastKOALA29 (https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) and PANNZER230 (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/sanspanz/), respectively. Eventually, 15,649 genes (94.17%) were successfully annotated by at least one public biological function database.\n\nTable 3 Functional annotation of Gynaephora qinghaiensis proteins. Full size table\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\n\nFor comparison analysis between different genomes, the longest protein of each gene locus was retained and the orthologous genes across G. qinghaiensis and 13 other lepidopteran insects were identified with Orthofinder v2.5.431. The 13 lepidopteran insects including Amyelois transitella (GCF_001186105.1), Danaus plexippus (GCF_009731565.1), Operophtera brumata (http://v2.insect-genome.com/Organism/590), Plutella xylostella (GCF_905116875.1) and nine former mentioned species, whose protein sets were used for homology-based prediction. Finally, 15,090 orthogroups (OGs) were identified, among which 8,807 OGs were present in all 14 lepidopteran insects and 2,741 were single copy OGs. The 2,741 single-copy OGs were used for phylogenetic tree construction. All protein sequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.123b32 and poorly aligned regions were removed by trimAl v1.4.rev2233. Alignments were concatenated into a supergene sequence and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method by IQ-TREE v2.1.4-beta34 software with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. The best-fit substitution model Q.insect + F + R6 was determined by ModelFinder35 implemented in IQ-TREE and the diamondback moth P. xylostella was used as an outgroup36. Phylogeny of 14 lepidopteran insects shows that G. qinghaiensis is a sister taxon to O. antiqua (rusty tussock moth), forming a lineage together with three other Erebidae insects: the yellow-tail moth E. similis, the black-arched tussock moth L. monacha, and the wood tiger moth A. plantaginis (Fig. 1). Divergence times between species were estimated using r8s v1.8137 software. Four calibration points were applied according to a former study: 67\u201388.6 million years ago (Mya) for Noctuoidea, 70.1\u201389.9 Mya for Bombycoidea, 105.6\u2013132.1 Mya for Apoditrysia and 154.7 Mya for Ditrysia36. G. qinghaiensis and O. antiqua were estimated to be diverged approximately 18.3 Mya.\n\nFig. 1 Comparative genomics analysis of the Gynaephora qinghaiensis genome. To the left is the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree displaying gene family expansion and contraction in G. qinghaiensis compared with other 13 lepidopteran species. The green and red numbers indicate the numbers of expanded and contracted gene families, respectively. Branch lengths represent divergence times. All nodes received 100% bootstrap support, except for the nodes in blue, whose bootstrap support value is 90%. To the right is the gene counts for different types of orthologous groups in the genomes. \u201cSingle copy\u201d indicates universal one-to-one orthologs present in all species; \u201cUniversal\u201d indicates other universal genes; \u201cSpecies specific\u201d indicates species-specific genes with more than one copy. \u201cUnassigned genes\u201d indicates species-specific genes with only one copy in the genome; \u201cOthers\u201d indicates remaining genes. Full size image\n\nGene family expansion and contraction analysis\n\nGene family expansion and contraction of G. qinghaiensis were analyzed using CAF\u00c9 v5.038 software. The gene family results inferred from OrthoFinder and estimated divergence time by r8s were used as inputs. CAF\u00c9 results suggested that 608 and 535 gene families were expanded and contracted in G. qinghaiensis, respectively (Fig. 1). And 173 (130 expanded and 43 contracted families) gene families were rapidly evolved (P-value < 0.01). The significantly expanded gene families were associated with various molecular functions and biological processes, including, zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 1 (ZBED1), core histones (histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4), fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR), copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), (Fig. 2, Table S139). The contracted gene families include UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B13 (UGT2B13), membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase-like (mALP), zinc finger CCHC domain-containing protein 3 (ZCCHC3), juvenile hormone esterase-like (JHE-like) and so on. Variations of characterized gene families were illustrated with the Superheat40 R package.",

            "content": "Overall, lower volumes and pricing are expected to have weighed on CAT\u2019s top-line performance in the quarter under review.\n\nAlso, CAT\u2019s substantial backlog of $28.7 billion at the beginning of the quarter, and higher aftermarket parts and service-related revenues are likely to have supported its fourth-quarter top line. This is expected to have been negated by lower dealer inventories in the quarter. Volumes are expected to have been impacted by weak demand in some of its markets.\n\nWhile the New Orders Index initially contracted in October with a 47.1% reading, it inched up to 50.4% in November and 52.5% in December. The index averaged 50% in the quarter. The impacts of this are expected to get reflected in Caterpillar\u2019s fourth-quarter order levels.\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued to experience weakness in the October-December quarter. This was evident from the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index remaining below the 50% level for the period, averaging 48.1%. Demand has been subdued as companies have been refraining from making capital investments.\n\nZacks Rank : The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nEarnings ESP : CAT has an Earnings ESP of -6.29%. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Caterpillar this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing once, the average surprise being 6.14%. This is depicted in the following chart.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAT\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings has moved down 0.6% over the past 60 days to $4.97 per share. The consensus mark implies a 5% dip from the year-ago actual. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.64 billion, suggesting a 2.5% year-over-year decline.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. CAT is anticipated to witness top and bottom-line declines when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 30, before the opening bell.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCaterpillar has been witnessing moderate input cost inflation lately. We expect the company\u2019s cost of sales to decline 6.1% in the fourth quarter due to favorable manufacturing costs. We also expect lower selling general and administrative (SG&A), and research and development (R&D) expenses, reflecting the benefits of lower short-term incentive compensation contrary to high expenses in the prior-year quarter. The projected year-over-year decline in SG&A and R&D expenses are at 0.7% and 3.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. Savings from Caterpillar\u2019s cost-control measures and restructuring actions are likely to have negated some of these setbacks.\n\nOur model projects a 2.8% year-over-year decrease in operating income to $3.1 billion. This factors in the expected decline in revenues, somewhat offset by lower costs and expenses. We expect the operating margin to be 19.1% in the fourth quarter, implying a slight improvement from the 18.9% reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. The impacts of lower volumes on margins are expected to have been offset by favorable costs.\n\nOur Projections for CAT's Segments in Q4\n\nOur model projects the Resource Industries segment's external sales at $2.87 billion for the fourth quarter, indicating a 9% year-over-year decline. We expect a 9.6% dip in volume for the segment and an unfavorable 0.2% currency impact to be partially offset by a 0.8% increase in pricing. The projection for lower volumes primarily reflects the ongoing weakness in demand. The segment is expected to report an operating profit of $603 million, suggesting a 0.5% year-over-year increase. The segment\u2019s operating margin is projected to be 21%, indicating an improvement from the 19% reported in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nThe Construction segment\u2019s external sales are projected at $5.86 billion, indicating a decline of 9.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual, led by a 7.4% drop in volume, a 1.5% dip in pricing and a 0.8% unfavorable currency impact. A lower level of rental fleet loading in North America, and weak demand in the Asia Pacific and Europe are expected to have weighed on volumes. The above-10-ton excavator market in China has been impacted due to the slowdown in its real estate industry. Modest demand in Latin America is expected to have negated some of the weakness in other areas. The Construction segment\u2019s operating profit is projected to be $1.37 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 11%. We project the segment\u2019s margins to be 23.3%, implying a dip from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual of 23.7%.\n\nFor the Energy & Transportation segment, we expect external sales to be $6.84 billion, suggesting a 3.9% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. Volume growth is projected to be 1.3%, implying improved demand across Oil & Gas, Power Generation, and Transportation, offset by weak demand in industrial. Pricing is expected to contribute 2.5% to the segment\u2019s sales growth, while currency translation is anticipated to contribute a positive 0.1%. The consensus estimate for the segment\u2019s operating profit is pegged at $1.57 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, suggesting 10% year-over-year growth. The operating margin is projected to be 23% for the fourth quarter, implying a rise from the 21.7% reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nCAT\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\n\nCaterpillar has appreciated 34.4% in the past year, outperforming its industry\u2019s 30.9% growth. It has also outpaced the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector\u2019s 16.2% rise and the S&P 500\u2019s climb of 24.8%.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s Price Performance Vs Industry & Broader Market\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s Price Performance Vs Peers\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe CAT stock\u2019s performance has been upbeat compared with its peers. Shares of Komatsu KMTUY have risen 8.6%, while Terex TEX and The Manitowoc Company MTW have declined 22.5% and 40.1%, respectively.\n\nCaterpillar is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 18.75, at a premium compared with the industry\u2019s 17.77X. The stock is also not cheap when compared with Komatsu, Terex and Manitowoc, all of which are trading at 11.57, 9.11 and 12.24, respectively, which are below the industry\u2019s average.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis on CAT\n\nDespite the current market weakness, CAT\u2019s strong market presence, diverse product portfolio and focus on innovation position it for an improved performance, going forward. Its long-term demand prospects are well-supported by increased infrastructure spending and the ongoing shift toward clean energy. Focus on growing service revenues, which generate higher margins, is a strategic move. A strong financial position enables it to invest in its businesses and return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. However, the weakness in the 10-ton and above excavator market in China, which had been one of its largest markets previously, remains concerning.\n\nHow Should You Play CAT Pre-Q4 Earnings?\n\nCaterpillar's performance has always been closely watched by investors, as it serves as a key economic barometer for the sector. CAT\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues are expected to have been dampened by weaker volumes in the Construction and Resource Industries segments, somewhat offset by improved volumes in the Energy & Transportation segment. Earnings are anticipated to have declined due to weak volumes despite favorable manufacturing costs, and lower SG&A and R&D expenses. This is likely to have been the second quarter of a decline in earnings for the company after an enviable stint of positive earnings growth for 14 straight quarters.\n\nNo matter how the upcoming quarterly results play out, investors who already own CAT shares should retain the stock in their portfolios to benefit from its solid long-term fundamentals. However, given its premium valuation and the ongoing decline in revenues and earnings, new investors can wait for a better entry point.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Caterpillar ( ) we really liked what we saw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Caterpillar:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.25 = US$14b \u00f7 (US$86b - US$32b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThus, Caterpillar has an ROCE of 25%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Caterpillar compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Caterpillar Tell Us?\n\nCaterpillar is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 59% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.\n\nOur Take On Caterpillar's ROCE\n\nAs discussed above, Caterpillar appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And a remarkable 249% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nCaterpillar does have some risks though, and we've spotted that you might be interested in.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

He became a freelance writer and journalist and contributed to the British Broadcasting Company as a radio interviewer, critic, and author of radio plays and features. From 1976 he was a professor of writing at Hampshire College, Amherst, Mass.\n\nSalkey\u2019s first novel, A Quality of Violence (1959), is set in a remote area of Jamaica about 1900, when a prolonged drought leads Christians to turn toward the older, \u201cdarker\u201d ways of voodoo and obeah. Like many of his other books, it is narrated in a distinctive Jamaican patois that is rich with folk-speech rhythms. After a second novel, Escape to an Autumn Pavement (1960), Salkey spent several years writing stories for children. His popular short-story collection Anancy\u2019s Score (1973) featured the trickster Anancy, an engaging character in traditional Caribbean culture to whom Salkey returned in the story collection Anancy, Traveller (1992). In addition to his later novels and several volumes of poetry, Salkey edited anthologies of Jamaican and Caribbean short stories and folktales.",

            "content": "Two decades later, that's 'Dr.' MacDonald, please!\n\nIn Jan. 17's 20 Years Ago This Week, we met Fenwick's Alannah MacDonald, age 11 in 2005, proud recipient of a certificate acknowledging her contribution to the study of Monarch butterfly migration. Where, we wondered, was Alannah today, two decades later. Still bonkers over bugs? Off in a rain forest tracking an elusive arachnid? Or had she taken the MBA/CPA route, now happily crunching numbers for Enbridge or RBC.\n\n\n\nThis time the Google search gods were benevolently generous, and a couple of readers reached out as well, including a colleague of Alannah's parents. But it's her story to tell, so without further ado, here's Alannah's 20-year update:\n\n\n\nWhen my mom sent \u201ccheck messenger!\u201d to our family WhatsApp chat, I definitely didn\u2019t expect to click on the article that popped up\u2014 finding 11-year-old me staring back. My mom is always checking her emails, often to read and pass on health tips, so kudos to her for catching this article that I would have otherwise missed!\n\nI quickly responded to her saying that I didn\u2019t remember it being published 20 years ago, but then the memories started to slowly come back, of shy little me being so nervous about what questions the paper was going to ask me about my butterflies.\n\nI sent the article to my partner, Abbas, who said \u201cThis is so cute!\u201d and then laughed because the original picture looked like a mugshot, especially in black and white, and now I laugh every time I look at it. I promise you I was ecstatic holding that certificate, I\u2019m just not very photogenic. (Updated mugshot above!)\n\nMy sister, Caitlin, and I spent so many of our summers running around our property in Fenwick looking for bugs, spending a large amount of that time searching the milkweed plants for monarch eggs and caterpillars, so that we could raise them and eventually tag and release the butterflies. To this day, if I see a patch of milkweed, I almost always flip a few leaves over checking for monarchs.\n\nI still remember receiving the notice that one of my monarchs was found in Mexico, as it was a goal I was determined to fulfill, and when it happened, I was over the moon. That certificate is still framed, living somewhere in my parents\u2019 house in Fonthill, so I\u2019ll have to dig it out next time I visit.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d argue that if I had to pick a favourite bug today, I\u2019d likely still say the praying mantis, having so many fond memories searching for that elusive bug, getting over-the-top excited if I ever found one. I tell friends today that I didn\u2019t watch whatever TV shows were popular in the early 2000s because I was busy running around looking for bugs (or tadpoles, or frogs, or toads). I\u2019m not kidding!\n\nUnfortunately, despite my love of insects, I didn\u2019t follow my planned path to become an entomologist. However, Caitlin did!\n\nI always joke that it was my influence that led her down that path, as there\u2019s a home video of her as a baby, and me (about two-and-a-half years older) showing her an insect field guide book excitedly saying \u201cLook! Insects, Caitlin, insects!\u201d She went to the University Guelph for undergrad as well as her Master\u2019s in Biodiversity and Environmental Science. There, and also when she worked at the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre, she completed projects in insect biological control, which in very simple terms is using \u201cgood\u201d bugs to control \u201cbad\u201d bugs for crop protection. She\u2019s now continuing her education, in the process of completing her Graduate Certificate in Ecosystem Restoration at Niagara College, where both of our parents teach and my mom is also a Lab Technologist.\n\nI always had an interest in science, math and research, flipping between wanting to become a vet, entomologist or maybe kinesiologist. In high school, once we started learning about biochemistry and genetics in biology class, I quickly knew that was what I wanted to pursue. Like Caitlin (and both our parents), I went to the University of Guelph and completed my undergrad in Biochemistry, after which I moved to Toronto to do my PhD at the University of Toronto and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Medical Biophysics (read: cancer research).\n\nAlannah MacDonald with her foster dog last summer, Wombat. | Courtesy Alannah MacDonald\n\nIn my bug-catching days in rural Fenwick, never in a million years did I see myself moving to the big city, but here I am, and I love it! I just completed my PhD at the end of December, after seven years, during which I studied a gene highly involved in cancer, which currently has no drugs targeting it. My lab (and many labs around the world) are exploring ways to target this \u201cdifficult\u201d gene to hopefully develop a cancer therapeutic in the near future. I\u2019m currently still in the lab finishing up some of these projects, with the hopes of moving onto a career in medical affairs, which is a department within a pharmaceutical or life sciences company that communicates scientific and clinical data to the medical community.\n\nI was recently back home over the holidays, after I defended my PhD, and found my Grade 12 Crossley yearbook. I opened it to the graduates page to double check that I had remembered my \u201cten year plan\u201d correctly. It said, \u201cFinding the cure to cancer, still running\u201d. I am happy that (12 years later) I have at least done my small part to further cancer research, with the running part technically still true, but a bit more loosely.\n\nI ran track and field and cross country competitively throughout elementary school, high school and undergrad, and now just run when I find the time or need some stress relief. My goal this year is to get back into it a bit more, having just convinced my dad to run with me in the 8k Spring Run-Off in High Park in April (well, it didn\u2019t take that much convincing, considering he signed up the instant I mentioned it, before I had even registered myself).\n\nMy dad, who coaches at the Niagara Olympic Club, where I trained in high school (and who was my coach for a while) told me I better start training so I \u201cdon\u2019t get beat by a senior citizen!\u201d as he turned 65 just last week. He has been running much more consistently than me, and so now this is a real fear of mine\u2014 I am more than likely to get beaten by a Boomer.\n\nThe other thing that has stayed consistent throughout my life is my love of animals. Ours was always known as the family with all the pets\u2014we had multiple cats (up to five at once, or more when a stray cat we took in had kittens, plus our greenhouse cats), hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, fish, a gecko, and on occasion guinea pigs when we babysat the classroom pets for the summer. We even had a red squirrel for eight months when a family friend dropped off an orphan at our house, assuming we\u2019d know what to do with a baby squirrel that didn\u2019t even have its eyes open yet. It worked out\u2014Cheeko survived and was one of the best pets we had, who we eventually released once spring came. I always wanted a dog and begged my parents for one, but looking back I definitely can\u2019t blame them for saying no.\n\nAlthough I still don\u2019t own a dog, I do spend a lot of my free time volunteering for a local foster-based dog and cat rescue, New Collar Collective, as a member of the management team, and have fostered many dogs over the past three years. It has been a very rewarding experience, although also very heartbreaking at times. If anyone reading this has thought about fostering a dog or cat, I highly recommend it; rescues are desperate for fosters right now!\n\nAnd with that I think I\u2019ve given a thorough enough 20-year update. I told myself when I sat down to write this that it would likely be fairly short, as I don\u2019t have that much to say. But then again, I did just hand in my 164-page thesis and don\u2019t have a tendency to keep things short, so here you go!",

            "content": "Exploring the Future of Quantum Computing and Investment Potential\n\nQuantum computing is setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in data processing, which could ultimately transform artificial intelligence, weather forecasting, and medical research. The market for quantum technology is projected to grow significantly, with McKinsey estimating potential growth to as high as $2 trillion by 2035.\n\nIn the bustling race for quantum supremacy, IonQ stands out as a leading player. This innovative company employs a novel approach by utilizing trapped ions to create its quantum computers, which could potentially lead to machines capable of operating with over 100 qubits. This method promises reduced error rates compared to traditional quantum systems.\n\nIonQ is making strides in securing important partnerships, counting major corporations like Hyundai, Caterpillar, and even the U.S. military among its clientele. The company is particularly focused on applications within biopharmaceuticals and engineering through its collaborations, notably a recent venture with AstraZeneca aimed at accelerating drug discovery.\n\nDespite these advancements and a significant increase in sales, caution is advised for potential investors. IonQ\u2019s stock comes at a premium, with a staggering forward price-to-sales ratio of 217, reflecting the uncertainties and risks in this emerging field. While it recorded impressive third-quarter revenue growth, substantial losses pose challenges that may deter risk-averse investors.\n\nIn light of these factors, it may be wise for investors to consider more established tech giants involved in quantum computing for a more stable investment.\n\nThe Broader Implications of Quantum Computing\n\nThe fast-developing field of quantum computing promises to not only reshape technological landscapes but could also have profound societal and cultural impacts. As quantum systems become more powerful, they are expected to enhance fields such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, creating transformative solutions for industries ranging from finance to healthcare. This transformation heralds a potential disruption of job structures, as repetitive tasks may be automated with unprecedented efficiency, leading to shifts in workforce dynamics and necessitating a reevaluation of education and skills training.\n\nThe global economy stands to gain significantly from quantum advancements, with estimates suggesting that quantum technologies could contribute up to $450 billion in increased economic value by the mid-2030s. However, this potential also raises concerns about economic disparity. As advanced technologies are predominantly developed in affluent nations, there is a risk of widening the gap between developed and developing regions, making equitable access to these innovations a critical issue.\n\nEnvironmental considerations are equally important. Quantum computers have the potential to optimize resource management, thereby addressing pressing climate issues. For example, simulations could lead to breakthroughs in renewable energy technologies and improved models for climate change predictions.

It\u2019s the first time in nearly 20 years Caterpillar has created a new line of lifts, but the company is confident they\u2019ll reach high expectations.\n\nThe Caterpillar TH1255 telehandler on display for a global premiere at World of Concrete in Las Vegas, Nevada, US. (Image: Mitchell Keller)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a minute,\u201d Kevin Coleman told Construction Briefing at World of Concrete on 21 January regarding the last time the company launched a line of telehandler lifts. Coleman, a senior product specialist for Caterpillar, noted it\u2019s been nearly 20 years since the company launched its first line. \u201cSo, we\u2019re very excited to have four models launching here.\u201d\n\nCaterpillar will manufacture the machines themselves in their Leicester, UK, facility. The prior telehandler models, which first launched in 2005, were build by JLG, a US-based access machine manufacturer owned by Oshkosh Corporation.\n\nThe latest line is launching first in the North and South American markets.\n\nThe four new machines \u2013 named TH0642, TH0842, TH1055 and TH1255 \u2013 have a respective maximum load capacity of 6,000, 8,000, 10,000 and 12,000 lbs. The respective maximum lift height for the TH0642 and TH0842 is 42 ft, while the largest two max out at 55 ft.\n\nColeman told Construction Briefing the priority in developing the new line was safety and end-user input. Stylistically, he noted a few changes, as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going with what we call a two-piece C-type boom instead of the four-plate fabricated boom design,\u201d Coleman explained.\n\nSafety upgrades include an improved cabin, including operator presence technology that prevents machine movements if the operator isn\u2019t seated.\n\n\u201cSo, you have to be in the chair, and that\u2019s standard,\u201d Coleman said. He also highlighted improved alarm and messaging programmes on the in-cab monitor, an upgraded telematics systems and a load stability indicator (LSI) as major safety improvements.\n\nThe LSI shows operators if the weight they\u2019re handling fits within the machine\u2019s range of acceptable stability. If it indicates in the red, it\u2019s an indication that the weight being lifted is too much for the current site and application.\n\nCaterpillar reveals next-gen telehandlers Caterpillar has announced the release of its new line of telehandlers\n\n\u201cIt tells the operator, I\u2019m in a situation where the machine is about to tip,\u201d Coleman added. \u201cMaybe return the load back down and reassess what the weight of the load is, maybe I extended more than I thought\u2026 [LSI] keeps you safer as an operator, [and] we\u2019ve had really, really positive feedback on that from operators using these machines in real-life applications.\u201d\n\nOther features include a pilot-control joy stick, a large and comfort-improved cabin, and optional service tool for chain maintenance.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s Kevin Coleman shows the Cat TH1255 at World of Concrete 2025. (Image: Mitchell Keller)\n\nColeman is confident, based on Caterpillar\u2019s close development with customers, that the telehandlers will perform well in the market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so overly complex,\u201d he said. \u201cPilot control joysticks, mount stabilisers, little things like tilt, steering wheel, standard rear camera\u2026 it gives the customer exactly what they\u2019re looking for out of a telehandler.\u201d\n\nPersonally for Coleman, whose been with Caterpillar in some capacity for more than 30 years, it\u2019s an exciting launch for the OEM.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve launched a lot of great products, [but] this one\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an air of excitement.\u201d\n\nSales of the new line of Caterpillar telehandlers are expected to start in the second quarter of this year for both rental and retail customers.",

These companies have a strong market share and offer diverse sets of equipment in the Poland construction equipment market.\n\nTerex, Tadano, Jungheirich, Manitou, Merlo Spa, Mecalac, Wacker Neuson, Yanmar, Takeuchi, and Ammann are niche players in Poland's construction equipment market. These companies offer low product diversification and have a strong presence in the country's market.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMaterial handling equipment accounted for the largest market share in the Poland construction equipment market in 2023. Forklifts & Telescopic Handlers in the material handling segment accounted for the largest share in 2023. Significant investment in the country's industrial sector is driving the growth of a number of logistics infrastructures across the country.\n\nDemand for material handling equipment is growing due to the rising investment in port expansion projects and the development of warehouses and logistics parks across the country.\n\nIn 2023, the earthmoving segment accounted for a significant share of the Poland construction equipment market.\n\nRoad rollers sales are high in Poland in response to the rising renovation and expansion of roads. For instance, in 2024, Budimex secured a USD 195.2 million contract to construct Section 3 of the S17 expressway, an 18.8 km segment between Krasnystaw Polnoc and Izbica, near Poland's border with Ukraine.\n\nConstruction equipment utilization in the Poland construction equipment market by end-user (volume) has the largest industry share in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, the government published a draft budget for 2025, allocating more than USD 2.2 billion to support mining. Hard coal production in the region has fallen by over 17% and sales by almost 18% compared to previous years.\n\nTherefore, the Polish construction industry is witnessing significant growth due to economic recovery and considerable government investments in industrial facility development, resulting in a heightened demand for high-quality construction equipment.\n\nRecent Developments in the Poland Construction Equipment Market:\n\nIn June 2024, Terex Self-Erecting Tower Cranes appointed the Elevating Work Platform Association (EWPA), based in the Poznan region as its distributor for Poland. EWPA has placed an initial order for a 4-ton CBR 40H crane, featuring a 40-meter jib with a 1-ton jib tip capacity, and a 4.4-ton CSE 32 with a 32-meter jib and a 1.05-ton jib tip capacity.\n\nIn August 2024, Poland's Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (Central Communication Port) initiated a tender for constructing a 4.6-kilometre tunnel for High-Speed Rail in Lodz, Poland. This megaproject, overseen by the Polish government, aims to build a new airport from the ground up approximately 40 km southwest of Warsaw.\n\nIn July 2024, Sinoboom announced to production of European-specific boom and scissor lifts at its plant in Poznan, Poland. This move aims to build machines closer to their end markets, reducing reliance on imports. By 2025, Poznan-built machines will largely use European components.\n\nMARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS\n\nPoland's Hydrogen Strategy to Boost the Polish Construction Equipment Market\n\nThe country has been focusing on energy diversification and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Hydrogen technology represents a path to greater energy independence. Construction companies may be encouraged to invest in hydrogen-powered machinery to stay competitive, stimulating demand.\n\nMany construction firms in the region may need to upgrade their machinery to meet the new emission standards. The shift to hydrogen fuel cells presents an opportunity to modernize fleets, leading to a surge in demand for new hydrogen-powered construction equipment in the Poland construction equipment market.\n\nIncreasing Trend for Prefabricated Construction in Poland to Boost the Sales of Cranes\n\nPoland's modular construction sector has seen substantial growth, with market value rising nearly 50% over the last two years, driven by material variety and rising costs of materials and labor.\n\nPrefabrication allows for faster construction times, reducing projects' timelines by up to 50% compared to traditional buildings. This is crucial in the country, where urbanization has increased demand for both residential and commercial spaces.\n\nIncreasing Investment in the Construction Sector in Poland\n\nPoland's construction sector started 2024 with optimism, boosted by USD 12.2 billion from the EU for the National Reconstruction Plan (KPO). By mid-year 2024, USD 2.2 billion in grants had already been disbursed from the USD 12.2 billion grant, mainly benefiting the energy sector.\n\nAdditionally, a major upcoming project the Central Communication Port (CPK) near Warsaw is underway, designed as a multimodal hub integrating air, rail, and road transport. Construction is expected to be completed in 2031.\n\nGrowing Development of the Nuclear Power Plants\n\nPoland is making major strides in its Nuclear Energy Strategy, aimed at reducing its coal dependency and enhancing energy security. The strategy aims to accomplish its target to have between 6-9 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear power by 2043.\n\nIn 2024, the government selected Westinghouse Electric Company, in partnership with Bechtel, to develop Poland's first nuclear power plant at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in northern Poland, with the AP1000 reactor technology.\n\nINDUSTRY RESTRAINTS\n\nSlow Economic Growth Is Impacting the Construction Industry\n\nPoland's industrial recovery has slowed, with industrial production in September down by 0.3% year-on-year, against a forecasted 0.8% decline Seasonally adjusted output decreased around 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in Q3. Strong domestic consumption, estimated at 4.0% year-on-year in Q3, isn't sufficient to drive expansion in the industrial sector.\n\nAdditionally, residential construction in Poland is declining, partly due to the expiration of the previous government's mortgage subsidy program at the end of 2023. A new program has yet to be approved within the government coalition.\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage in the Country\n\nAccording to a government survey report of 2024, almost 80% of construction companies operating in the residential construction segment are struggling with rising costs, and over 75% are suffering from delays caused by labor shortages.\n\nDespite having one of the strongest labor markets in the EU and a very low unemployment rate, Poland continues to face considerable labor shortages in various sectors. As of May 2024, the registered unemployment rate in Poland was 5%, the lowest since November 2023.\n\nVENDOR LANDSCAPE\n\nProminent Vendors\n\nCaterpillar\n\nKomatsu\n\nVolvo Construction Equipment\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery\n\nLiebherr\n\nJCB\n\nSANY\n\nXuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co.

And here's a fun detail - the scenic railway route takes about 3 hours to complete and a one-way ticket costs just 6-7 BGN (less than 4 euro). \"The Rhodope Caterpillar\" - that's what they call the train that winds along the slopes of the Rhodope Mountains on the route Dimitrovgrad - Haskovo - Kardzhali - Podkova village. And no, this is not the legendary narrow-gauge railway - it runs in a different part of the mountain. The Caterpillar is just an ordinary diesel engine with modern railcars. The comparison with a caterpillar is no coincidence!, seemingly enjoying every moment of the journey. And here's a fun detail - the scenic railway route takes about 3 hours to complete and a one-way ticket costs just 6-7 BGN (less than 4 euro).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most enchanting part of the journey begins after Most station, where the train crosses a scenic pass as it enters the Kardzhali region. \"From there, passengers are treated to incredible panoramic views of the Studen Kladenets reservoir, the medieval fortress of Monyak and the majestic rock formations soaring over the tracks,\" says Bozhidar Cholakov - a journalist from BNR Kardzhali, a passionate fan of Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) and the creator of the as it enters the Kardzhali region. \"From there, passengers are treated to incredible panoramic views of the Studen Kladenets reservoir, the medieval fortress of Monyak and the majestic rock formations soaring over the tracks,\" says Bozhidar Cholakov - a journalist from BNR Kardzhali, a passionate fan of Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) and the creator of the Facebook page celebrating The Rhodope Caterpillar . \"There is a gem waiting to be explored at almost every stop, starting from the southernmost point of the railway - the village of Podkova,\" Bozhidar says, adding:\n\nthe wooden Mosque of the Seven Maidens in the village of Podkova has become very popular and well visited. It is only 700 metres from the station. And now, with the new \"Recently,. It is only 700 metres from the station. And now, with the new BDZ timetable for 2025 , with the midday train to Podkova, people can make a day trip to the Eastern Rhodopes to enjoy these delightful sites and come back with the 'Caterpillar' at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next interesting stop is Momina Skala, where travellers can get to the longest rope bridge in Bulgaria, leading to the village of Lisitsite - an isolated village with only 15-20 inhabitants, accessible only on foot or by train,\" says Bozhidar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rhodope Caterpillar is not just a train - it is a bridge to history.

During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has gained 9.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCaterpillar is expected to post earnings of $5 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.64 indicates a change of -0.2% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Caterpillar is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

Her original story can be found on The Conversation\u2019s website.\n\n* * *\n\nBy Daile Zhang\n\nAssistant professor of Atmospheric Sciences, UND\n\n\n\nIn the remote Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a rare fungus grows inside dead caterpillars. In traditional Chinese medicine, this parasitic fungus is prized for its purported medicinal effects. Known as Ophiocordyceps sinensis \u2013 colloquially, caterpillar fungus or \u201cHimalayan gold\u201d \u2013 it can fetch astronomical prices on the herbal medicine market: up to US$63,000 per pound.\n\nOphiocordyceps sinensis fungus is a parasite that targets the caterpillar that is the larva of the ghost moth. The process begins in late summer to early fall, when fungal spores infect the caterpillars. Over time, fungal filaments called mycelia slowly spread out and consume the caterpillars from within, turning them into hardened, mummified shells by winter. When spring arrives, the fungus enters its final stage: A grasslike fruiting body sprouts from the preserved caterpillar\u2019s head and pushes up through the soil.\n\nWhile many traditional Chinese/herbal medicine consumers are drawn to the fungus for its supposed health benefits, my interest lies in a darker side of its harvest: the deadly relationship between caterpillar fungus collection and lightning strikes. As a meteorologist, I study lightning and its impacts around the world. A few factors come together to make the situation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau so dangerous.\n\nA deadly harvest\n\nPeople hunt for this fungus during late spring and summer, exactly when lightning strikes are most common in these mountains. Villagers often spend weeks scouring the rugged mountains for this precious resource, sometimes up to 16,400 feet (5 kilometers) above sea level. That\u2019s an altitude of more than 3 miles.\n\nAt these heights, the weather can change in an instant, and there\u2019s nowhere safe to hide from storms. While this area doesn\u2019t get as many lightning strikes as some parts of Asia, it\u2019s still dangerous enough to be a serious threat during these crucial harvesting months.\n\nTragically, caterpillar fungus hunting has led to at least 31 lightning-related deaths and another 58 lightning-related injuries in the past decade, according to the yearbooks of Chinese meteorological hazards (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u707e\u5bb3\u5e74\u9274) and government websites, including the China Meteorological Administration and the National Disaster Reduction Center of China.\n\nIn May 2022, seven villagers from China, including a young child, were killed by lightning while harvesting the fungus. The following year, three people from Nepal were injured by lightning when collecting the fungus and had to be rescued by helicopter after spending days stranded in the mountains.\n\nIn our recent study, my colleague Ronald Holle and I found that the population-weighted lightning fatality rates in the fungus-collection hotspots of Yushu and Garze counties, located in the Sichuan Province of China, are staggering \u2013 10 to 20 times higher than the already elevated rates in China overall. These numbers are on par with some of the most lightning-prone regions of Africa, where there is little lightning-safe infrastructure or safety education.\n\nBut lightning isn\u2019t the only threat these villagers face in the mountains. They could encounter hail, heavy rains, strong winds and other severe weather. The complex terrain makes weather patterns highly dramatic and unpredictable. Making things even worse, cellphone signals and other communication options are limited or nonexistent, leaving villagers cut off from weather hazard alerts.\n\nThey could also face threats from wild animals and risky mountain slopes. In one tragic case, a collector was struck by lightning and fell to his death on steep terrain. Medical care is rarely available. When accidents occur, it may be days before help arrives.\n\nWhy take the risk?\n\nIt all comes down to the high-risk, high-reward nature of caterpillar fungus collection.\n\nFor local villagers, the potential rewards of harvesting caterpillar fungus are significant. With limited income opportunities in this remote region, many see the fungus trade as their best hope for survival. They face a tough choice: risk their lives or sink into poverty.\n\nImproving lightning safety education and infrastructure are important but far from easy. Any real change would take a lot of investment.\n\nWhile the local government does organize some lightning safety education, these mountain communities are isolated and the information is often outdated. And there\u2019s simply no practical way to install adequate lightning protection across the vast, rugged terrain where the fungus is collected.\n\nA fragile pursuit\n\nThe environment is suffering, too. With so many people hunting for the fungus, they\u2019re damaging the delicate mountain soil, cutting down trees for firewood and leaving trash at their camps.\n\nYears of overharvesting have forced collectors to spend more time in the mountains to find enough fungus, increasing their exposure to lightning and the fungus\u2019s decline. Scientists warn that if this aggressive harvesting continues, the fungus might disappear completely in the next few decades.\n\nThere might be some hope. Researchers are exploring ways to cultivate the fungus as a possible substitute for the wildly harvested variety. Meanwhile, governments in China, India, Nepal and Bhutan have implemented regulations to protect the sustainability of caterpillar fungus.\n\nBut any solution will need to address the underlying economic and educational inequities in this remote region, opening up new opportunities for these communities to make a living so they don\u2019t need to risk their lives chasing \u201cHimalayan gold.\u201d\n\nDaile Zhang, assistant professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of North Dakota\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Most of the time, medical care is unavailable, and it can take days for help to arrive.\n\nFor the local villagers, the potential rewards that come with harvesting caterpillar fungus are worth the high risk. In the remote region, there are few ways to earn an income.\n\nAs a result, many people see the fungus trade as the best option for their survival. They can either put their lives at risk or plunge into poverty.\n\nThe local government organizes some lightning safety education, but these mountain communities are isolated, and the information is typically outdated. There\u2019s also no way to install proper lightning protection in such rugged terrain.\n\nIn addition, the environment is suffering from overharvesting and human activity. When people are hunting for the fungus, they tramp roughly through the delicate soil, cut down trees for firewood, and leave trash behind. The fungus could disappear within the next few decades if the aggressive harvesting continues.\n\nThe economic and educational disparities in this remote area must be addressed in order to preserve the caterpillar fungus and help these people make a safer living.\n\nYou can see the study here.\n\nEmily Chan By Emily Chan is a writer who covers lifestyle and news content.

Credit: Shutterstock, Stian Alsaker Larsen.\n\nThe humble caterpillar boasts some venomous species. While many are harmless, a few carry venoms potent enough to permanently injure or even kill humans, creating a small yet significant public health concern.\n\nYet, scientists believe these toxic creatures might hold the key to groundbreaking medical treatments. Here\u2019s how venomous caterpillars are attracting the attention of researchers worldwide.\n\nCaterpillar venom\n\nVenoms are specialised toxins injected into other organisms, often for self-defence or predation. According to Andrew Walker, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Queensland, Australia, only about 2 per cent of caterpillar species are venomous. However, their venom contains a diverse arsenal of chemical compounds, each fine-tuned over millions of years to target specific biological processes.\n\n\u201cNo two species have the same venom arsenal,\u201d explains Mand\u00eb Holford to Knowable Magazine. Holford is a venom scientist at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This diversity, combined with their targeted nature, makes venoms an ideal starting point for developing new drugs.\n\nWhile most venomous caterpillars are harmless unless provoked, some are lethal. The Lonomia genus, found in South America, is infamous for its venom, which disrupts blood clotting and can cause fatal haemorrhaging. Other caterpillars\u2019 venoms have been linked to chronic inflammation, miscarriages in animals, and severe pain requiring opioid-level painkillers.\n\nIn regions where venomous caterpillars are prevalent, their public health impact is comparable to that of spiders, says Walker. Antivenoms have been developed to combat the effects of Lonomia venom, but most other venomous species remain under-researched.\n\nCaterpillar venoms could transform medicine\n\nUnlike lab-designed compounds, venoms already have a proven biological function, making them promising candidates for drug development.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve evolved over millions of years, they\u2019ve been tested in nature, and we know they work,\u201d notes Holford.\n\nExamples of how caterpillar venom could be used in medicine:\n\nPain relief: Many caterpillar venoms cause pain, which scientists can use to study pain pathways and develop more effective painkillers.\n\nBlood disorders: Venoms like those from Lonomia interfere with blood clotting, offering insights into treating clotting disorders.\n\nSimilar studies on venoms from snakes and lizards have already led to groundbreaking drugs for high blood pressure and diabetes, such as the semaglutide-based weight-loss drug Ozempic.\n\nThanks to advancements in molecular biology and bioinformatics, the study of animal venoms is becoming more accessible. \u201cIt\u2019s like a treasure trove that\u2019s still sitting out there for us to understand,\u201d says Nicholas Casewell, a venom biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nWhile caterpillar venoms are still a largely untapped resource, scientists are optimistic that further research will unlock their full potential, paving the way for new therapies.\n\nAs Walker puts it, \u201cWill we get to the stage where we\u2019ll be taking things from their venoms that are useful? Definitely.\u201d\n\nTalking of deadly caterpillars, watch out for the dog-killing caterpillar species in Spain.\n\nView all quirky news.",

            "content": "Caterpillar (CAT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis construction equipment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $16.64 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "A remote-controlled Caterpillar D8 bulldozer has been deployed for extensive marine filling work at Frier Vest in Grenland, Norway\n\nThe remote-controlled bulldozer has been utilised in Norway\u2019s largest earthmoving operation to build an industrial park, housing and port facility spanning 370 hectares in Frier Vest, Grenland.\n\nThe port terminal will connect the local area with shipping routes to the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThe remote-controlled bulldozer reduces risk and increases efficiency at the site\n\nThe remote-controlled bulldozer is used to manage material from up to 14 dump trucks at the marine filling site. The Caterpillar 772G, 775G, and electric Sany trucks unload their loads inland, and the dozer pushes the material outwards.\n\nThe dozer operator works approximately half a kilometre away from the machine, eliminating the risks associated with landslides and collapse.\n\nTechnology company Steer Remote, who supplied the remote-controlled bulldozer to civil engineering contractor H\u00e6hre for the Frier Vest project, have integrated Trimble machine control into the system, enabling the dozer blade to be automatically controlled via GPS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much safer method than equipping operators with life vests, oxygen tanks, and mechanisms for automatic window breaking,\u201d says Nj\u00e5l Gjermundshaug, CEO of Steer.\n\nThe operator is located around 500m away from the machinery, reducing the risks of collapses or landslides.\n\nThe operator chair uses joysticks and two or three control panels with touch screens. The control panels are:\n\nSteer monitor- Operator is able to configure the Steer Remote system, machine ignition, handbrake, rpm etc.\n\nManufacturer monitor- This is the monitor from the cabin of the machine. This is typically used to turn on lights, activate GradeAssist, display fuel level, warning/error messages from the machine etc.\n\nMachine control monitor- For machine control and GPS Support. (Leica, Topcon, Trimble etc.)\n\nThe technology could become standard in large earthmoving operations\n\nSteer hopes that the success of the Caterpillar D8 bulldozer on the Frier Vest industrial park will set remote-controlled bulldozers as the standard for marine filling projects.\n\nThe technology could also be applied to quarry and mining operations, with a single operator managing multiple loaders and bulldozers.\n\nSteer have already tested automated solutions at the Eikefet and Seljestokken quarries, retrofitting Caterpillar 772G dump trucks to move rock from various blast sites to the crusher for processing.\n\n\u201cThis technology allows us to efficiently deliver on demanding projects without jeopardizing operator safety,\u201d says Asle St\u00e5land, project director at H\u00e6hre.\n\n\u201cThe experience has been very positive so far. Operators find the solution easy to use and comfortable.\u201d\n\nSteer, H\u00e6hre, and RG have collaborated on developing the dozer and the operator station.\n\nEspen Holte, technical lead at H\u00e6hre, reported that only minor adjustments remain to meet operator preferences, including fine-tuning the seat and controls.",

            "content": "TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - The commercial real estate company hired by Wamego Caterpillar, Colliers, is reportedly working with approximately five to seven highly qualified leads for the Wamego Caterpillar facility.\n\nThe Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corporation told 13 NEWS in a statement that \u201cthey are optimistic about securing a buyer before the facility\u2019s closure, as it garnered significant and almost immediate interest from regional, national, and international parties.\u201d\n\nThe Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corporation said they have had numerous discussions with companies about workforce availability, utilities, and potential incentives. Their local economic development team collaborates regularly - often daily - with Caterpillar, Colliers, and the Kansas Department of Commerce to facilitate the sale.\n\nThe Corporation said the facility is a tremendous value at an incredible price and its highly strategic location offers seamless connections to major routes likes I-70, US 24 and KS-99 as well as the newly constructed Industrial Commercial Route in Pottawatomie County. With Manhattan Area Technical College satellite location and welding lab less than a mile from the facility, the new owners will be able to train employees quickly and efficiently to their own processes and procedures.\n\n\u201cWhile Caterpillar\u2019s closure announcement was disappointing, the company\u2019s commitment to being a strong community partner and supporting the transition for a new business has been reassuring,\u201d said Shanna Goodman, Executive Director, Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWe are also encouraged by the unwavering support from the community and our regional partners. Although we are saddened to see Caterpillar leave, we are excited about future opportunities and the potential for growth that can make our community stronger and more prosperous than ever.\u201d\n\nThe Wamego Caterpillar facility is on the market, with the listing going live in mid-November through Colliers.\n\nOfficials said Caterpillar announced that operations at the facility will cease in mid-2025, likely around June or July. Since the closure was announced to employees last June, they have partnered with community organizations to provide support. A key initiative was the Community Career Fair in late August, where 34 employers showcased diverse regional job opportunities. Kansas\u2019 Rapid Response team was on-site in December to help employees navigate the next few months, answering questions on unemployment benefits, medical assistance, retirement and health care coverage.\n\nPottawatomie County officials noted the current Caterpillar workforce is highly skilled and represents a valuable asset for any potential buyer. Retaining this workforce has been the Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corporation\u2019s top priority throughout the process.\n\n13 NEWS reached out to Caterpillar Corporate and is waiting on a response.\n\nCheck wibw.com for more information as it becomes available.\n\nCopyright 2025 WIBW.

But caterpillars also contain a potential windfall of medically useful compounds within their toxic secretions.\n\n\"Will we get to the stage where we'll be taking things from their venoms that are useful? Definitely,\" says Andrew Walker, an evolutionary biologist and biochemist at the University of Queensland, Australia. \"But there's a lot of foundational work to do first.\"\n\nCaterpillars are the larval stages of the insect order Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. It's just one of many animal groups with little-known venomous members. (Venoms are toxins that are deliberately injected into another animal, while poisons sit passively in an organism's body, waiting to sicken a potential predator.) By biologists' best estimate, venoms have evolved at least 100 times across the animal kingdom.\n\nMany venoms are complex, some containing more than 100 different compounds. And they're also strikingly diverse. \"No two species have the same venom arsenal,\" says Mand\u00eb Holford, a venom scientist at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. \"That's why it's important to study as many species as we can find.\"\n\nAlamy Venom like that found in the fire caterpillar are far less studied than snakes and scorpion venom (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIndeed, studying venoms could be a better way to find new drug candidates than starting from scratch, because they contain molecules fine-tuned over aeons to target specific biological processes in the victim. \"They've evolved over millions of years, they've been tested in nature, and we know they work,\" says Holford. \"When we try to devise them ourselves in the lab, the success rate is a lot less.\"\n\nMost groups of venomous organisms, however, are barely on scientists' radar. \"We have a huge wealth of knowledge about snake venoms and scorpion venoms and spider venoms,\" says Nicholas Casewell, a venom biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. \"But there are lots of groups of venomous animals out there that are largely unstudied.\"\n\nCaterpillars, in particular, deserve more attention, says Walker, who wrote about venomous Lepidoptera in the 2025 Annual Review of Entomology. Though only about 2% of caterpillar species are venomous, by Walker's estimate, they're widely scattered across the lepidopteran evolutionary tree. That pattern means venom likely evolved independently several times within the group, potentially yielding an unusual diversity of chemicals.\n\nThose nasty few are enough to make venomous caterpillars a significant public health issue, in at least some parts of the world\n\nThe deadly caterpillars \u2013 within the South American genus called Lonomia \u2013 have a snakelike venom that interferes with blood clotting. Others have venoms that cause chronic, lifelong inflammatory problems, and a couple cause miscarriages in horses.\n\nThose nasty few are enough to make venomous caterpillars a significant public health issue, in at least some parts of the world, says Walker. \"They're not killing many people regularly like scorpions and snakes do, but compared to spiders there's not much difference in the impact of the health hazard.\" The concern has led some researchers to work on understanding the biological effects of the potentially lethal Lonomia venom, and to develop antivenom to treat affected people.\n\nAlamy The venom in such caterpillars could be used to create new anti-clotting drugs or blood pressure medicine (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThough a few other caterpillar venoms have been studied at least a little, most remain almost entirely unstudied, says Walker \u2013 and medicine may be missing out. For example, he notes, most lepidopteran venoms cause pain, sometimes intense enough to require opioid painkillers. That's not surprising, since pain is an excellent way to deter predators \u2013 but it also allows researchers to use the venom as a probe to identify pain pathways in the body and pain receptors in lab animals and, potentially, in people. That, in turn, could lead to new drugs.\n\nResearch on caterpillar venoms is still sparse enough that no new drugs have resulted yet, but venoms of other organisms have yielded some important therapies. There are blood-pressure and anticlotting medications that were inspired by snake venoms, for example, and a forerunner to the new blockbuster drug semaglutide \u2013 better known by brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy \u2013 was based on a molecule extracted from a venomous lizard, the Gila monster.\n\nThanks to advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics, venoms of all animals, including caterpillars, are increasingly easy to investigate \u2013 and that should mean big steps forward soon, says Casewell. \"It's like a treasure trove that's still sitting out there for us to understand.\"\n\n* This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\n--\n\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.",

            "content": "During our mild thaw, a trip to the Meramec River\n\nGreetings, Dear Reader! It\u2019s been a very long time since I\u2019ve found my way into your inbox. For those who may not remember \u2014 Hi! My name is Megan, I\u2019m a neurodivergent sensitive soul and I am here to help you embrace your God-given sensitivity and find ways to thrive. I do plan to write a bit about my break sometime in the near future. But today I wanted to share some winter encouragement for any other antsy souls awaiting spring.\n\nAt the end of November we found a woolly bear caterpillar in our basement. How they found their way there, I'm not sure (they were taken to a big pile of leaves to make a den so they can become an Isabella Tiger Moth. This is why it\u2019s important to leave the leaves, folks!). Seeing this beautiful creature immediately took me back to my grandmother telling me how they predicted winter weather. We know they foretell winter coming as they are active just before cold weather sets in as they search for a place to overwinter. Though my grandmother's claim their banding foretells how harsh winter will be is debated (there is no proof of this), I took note that this caterpillar was telling me that winter would start out harsh and end early. So far, especially compared to recent winters, the caterpillar was right. It was going to turn quite cold and windy, a bit earlier than usual, that coming weekend. Then, right after the new year we had a big ice and snow storm with more snow than we've had in years. Immediately following the storm came the bitterly cold temps which left the snow to stick around for a long while (our north facing backyard still has a coating of snow). It's been the snowiest January in my recent memory. The extended forecast on my weather app shows a lot of 50 degree days in February, so we'll see if the caterpillar's forecast stays true! Only time will tell whether or not winter ends early this year, but after a bit of a thaw we're back to frigid temps today and I'm finding myself itching for spring. So, I remind myself that Imbolc is in less than 2 weeks!\n\nImbolc is the Gaelic festival marking the beginning of Spring. This festival is celebrated at the halfway point between the Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox, when sheep typically give birth-one of the season\u2019s first signs of life. The word Imbolc translates to \u201cin the belly of the mother\u201d, signifying the seeds that are in the earth waiting to burst forth in spring, and possibly linked to lambing season being around this time-quite literally in the belly of the mother.\n\nImbolc is coming, so I remind myself that Spring is coming. But, for now, we continue to rest. The plants are resting, seeds are in the process of stratification so they can germinate and grow. And we humans are Earth and have similar patterns. For now, we continue to rest. For soon, we too, will sprout life so to speak!\n\nBut, I must admit I\u2019ve struggled this season with this part. Not so much the resting (my nervous system requires a lot of that these days), but with the waiting. Waiting to not have to turn the overhead light on to cook dinner. Waiting for the Dawn Chorus to start again. Waiting for the day when I don\u2019t have to bundle up to go feed the birds. And waiting for the day the native flowers bloom. I wonder, do the seeds get impatient while underground? Do the trees bemoan the cold, sharp wind waiting for longer sunlight and warmer temperatures to begin their budding? I doubt it. As the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said, \u201cNature doesn\u2019t hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\u201d\n\nSo, I continue to rest and tend my antsy, wintering soul. I find joy in watching the winter birds, I soak up the winter sunshine when it makes an appearance, I read cozy fantasy books in the evenings because without this pause, without the rest, I won\u2019t have the energy to bud in spring.\n\nImbolc is coming, spring is on her way, but for now we continue to rest.\n\nHow are you tending your antsy, wintering soul this winter, Dear Ones?

And of course generator behemoth Generac (NYSE: GNRC) always sees a boost in valuation in times like these.\n\n\n\nThe Best Free Investment You\u2019ll Ever Make Our analysts have traveled the world over, dedicated to finding the best and most profitable investments in the global energy markets.

Something that probably makes far more sense than waiting for everything to burn to the ground, then shelling out billions to rebuild.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m talking about building materials that are fireproof and even new wildfire detection technologies. Consider this startup Pano, for instance. Pano has developed a connected, intelligent platform for fire professionals that helps them detect threats, confirm fires, and disseminate information to responders, faster than ever before.\n\nThe company speeds response time by empowering detection specialists with enhanced visual equipment and rapid data analysis supported by AI.\n\nSpecialists have a single, unified view combining ultra-high-definition cameras, geo satellite data, field sensors, legacy cameras, emergency alerts, and other data feeds. They also have the ability to share everything in real-time with their extended team. Altogether, this makes it possible to quickly identify and contain wildfires.\n\nFire Investing: Be Prepared!\n\nMaybe because I was once a boyscout, but I truly believe it makes far more sense to be prepared than to wait until the damage is done, and then rebuild. And then, of course, wait for the next natural disaster to do the same thing.\n\nUnfortunately, Pano is not a public company. But I do believe that we will start to see more of these types of \u201cpreparedness\u201d companies go public in the coming years. Particularly as the world is forced to adapt to an increase in extreme weather events across the globe.\n\nOf course, there are other ways to profit from preparedness. Ways that have nothing to do with natural disasters. Like AI for instance. An industry that is preparing for a massive increase in growth. Growth that can only be facilitated by securing more energy supplies.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular reader of these pages, you know that the rapid development of the AI industry is instigating a bull market in energy. In particular, energy companies that provide electricity solely to operate these AI data centers.\n\nLast year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced a deal to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power its data centers. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) signed a contract with Kairos Power to develop a fleet of SMRs to power its data centers.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, data center operator Switch inked a deal with Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) to deploy 12 GW of SMR projects.\n\nIndeed, we will see more of these deals in 2025 as the world\u2019s biggest tech giants race to secure enough power to meet demand for AI applications. And while these data centers can be powered with anything from natural gas to solar, the advantage of SMRs is their siting flexibility. These things can be built practically anywhere and without the need for a large, established infrastructure. As well, they\u2019re far cheaper and faster to build than traditional power plants.\n\nSo clearly, we\u2019re taking full advantage by loading up on shares of an SMR company that insiders are now calling the AI Master Key. This, because the AI Master Key is the link between escalating power needs from AI data centers and the cheap energy required to power them.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this is going to be a home run for us in 2025. Which is why our Energy & Capital research team put together this short report which explains exactly how the AI Master Key works. And of course, how you can start profiting from it right now.",

Officials use a biological insecticide that kills the LDD caterpillar when ingested.\n\nLDD doesn't follow much of a pattern in New Jersey. In 2023, there were 5,100 acres recommended for treatment.

A few others on that list remain open and are now stalwarts: Tei Tei Robata Bar, The Mercury and Al Biernat\u2019s. It seems 1998 was quite a year in Dallas food.\n\nThe Blue Fish grew in North Texas, with restaurants on Greenville Avenue, on the Dallas North Tollway near Frankford Road, and in Irving, Carrollton and Allen. When I visited Breckenridge, Colo., a few weeks ago, skiers wearing puffy coats and gloves made a steady entry into The Blue Fish there, a few blocks off of Main Street.\n\nRestaurant News Get the scoop on the latest openings, closings, and where and what to eat and drink. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nToday, two Blue Fish restaurants remain: in Allen and in Breckenridge. Those are owned by founder Julie Lee Osborn, who got married since she opened the original.\n\nThe other locations were sold in 2019, she confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, The Blue Fish had an iconic stainless steel interior and neon lights, a look called \u201ctechno-razzle\u201d in a 2004 review. That was the era of tuna towers and raw yellowtail spiced with jalape\u00f1os.\n\nBy the 2020s, Japanese food in Dallas had changed dramatically. Omakase restaurants, or those with $165+ price tags and a fixed menu of a dozen courses or more, were starting to pop up. Case in point: By late 2024, just one restaurant in Dallas earned a Michelin star, and it was unaffiliated Japanese spot Tatsu.\n\nThe Blue Fish\u2019s franchise owners opened a higher-end Japanese restaurant, Blue Maki in Carrollton, in 2023. The restaurant sells temaki, or handrolls, in addition to sashimi, crudo and rolls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blue Fish, on the other hand, seemed emptier on Greenville Avenue in the past few years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives from the franchise company did not return an immediate request for comment on why the Greenville Avenue restaurant closed. The phone has been disconnected.\n\nFounder Julie Lee Osborn said she has no relationship with the franchisees of the restaurant she started, but she has interest in taking over the lease from her original Blue Fish on Greenville Avenue. More to come on that.\n\nThe Blue Fish was at 3519 Greenville Ave., Dallas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more food news, follow Sarah Blaskovich on X at @sblaskovich.",

Wirtgen Group to premiere SP 33 in two variations\n\nWirtgen Group\u2019s SP 33 slipform paver. (Image: Wirtgen Group)\n\nWirtgen Group announced it will showcase its SP 33 slipform concrete paver in two configurations: Offset and Crosspave.\n\nDue to the fully modular construction concept, the unit can pave monolithic concrete profiles such as curbs and berms, rectangular profiles, concrete safety barriers up to a height of 1.3m (52 in), and drainage and gutter profiles.\n\nIn the Offset paving configuration, it can pave concrete slabs with a pave width of up to 2.2 metres (7 feet), also in combination with a Trimmer up to 2.4 metres (8 feet) wide.\n\nWirtgen to show world premiere at World of Concrete Slipform paver in two configurations to be shown for the first time at Las Vegas, US, show in January\n\nThe Crosspave version can pave slabs up to a width of 3 metres (10 feet) transversely to the direction of travel of the machine. Both solutions can be controlled by the operating concept with an event-driven graphic display.\n\nThe ECO mode detects every working situation without the need for manual intervention by the operator and ensures automatic, load-optimised regulation of engine output for what Wirtgen says is, \u201coptimum engine efficiency, maximum fuel economy, and low noise emissions.\u201d\n\nThe operator is further assisted by the AutoPilot 2.0 control system. The two crawler units with parallelogram swing legs at the front and a laterally adjustable crawler unit at the rear enable zero-clearance installation and maximum flexibility, meaning it can be used on construction sites that demand a high degree of maneuverability and the paving of tight radii.\n\n5. Bobcat to showcase versatile equipment line-up\n\nThe Bobcat B760 backhoe loader, which will be on display at World of Concrete 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, US.

Now is the time to destroy them while they are in their cocoons.\n\nThe caterpillars are named chenilles processionnaires in French due to their tendency to walk in lines along the ground and were officially categorised as a harmful pest in April 2022.\n\nTheir characteristic spiky hairs can cause irritation, inflammation, and rashes, as well as breathing difficulties for some.\n\nThey can also be dangerous to pets - for example if a dog eats one from the ground - and have been known to cause necrosis of the tongue or mouth.\n\nThese reactions can be fatal if not treated.\n\nThere are two main species in France, pine and oak (pin and ch\u00eane). They each live in trees of their respective types.\n\nSince they were categorised as a pest, communes and departmental prefectures can issue a decree mandating that homeowners destroy any processionary caterpillars on their property.\n\nRead more: Processionary caterpillars in French forest blamed for sick dogs\n\nDestroy the cocoons in winter\n\nLines of processionary caterpillars can be observed descending trees or walking along the ground from May to June.\n\nAd\n\nThey are in their cocoons, which look like balls of cotton wool and can be seen high in tree branches, during the winter months.\n\nTo prevent processionary caterpillars from becoming a problem in spring and summer, start by inspecting your trees to spot these nests.\n\nRemove the cocoons by cutting off infested branches.\n\nThis operation must be performed using suitable protective equipment, including masks and gloves, to avoid any contact with the stinging hairs, which can come off and spread in the wind when the caterpillars are disturbed.\n\nThen place the branches with the cocoons directly in a garden waste bin to be mulched or taken to the dump.\n\nRead more: How should garden waste be disposed of in France if bonfires are not allowed?\n\nIf the nest is too high up in the tree, it is advisable to call in a professional who can use specialist equipment to prune the affected branches or douse the tree with insecticide. This service typically costs around \u20ac50 per tree.\n\nYou can also favour a natural alternative by putting up bird boxes nearby to attract blue tits, which eat processionary caterpillars.\n\nTraps are also available that attract the bugs as they descend from infested trees.\n\nThese traps, which are fitted around the tree trunk, work by funnelling the caterpillars into a plastic bag or pouch.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of exposure to processionary caterpillars?\n\nSymptoms of irritation (including in pets) are:",

            "content": "Home gardens can provide vital habitat for Australian birds. But there\u2019s more to it than just planting certain types of shrubs and flowering trees.\n\nAfter decades of encouragement to include native plants in home gardens, urban environments have come to favour certain species and neglect others including some of our most loved birds, such as fairy-wrens.\n\nBirds that thrive on nectar such as honeyeaters, and bossy birds with bold personalities such as noisy miners, some parrots and magpies, tend to dominate the scene. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nWe wanted to explore how urban gardens can best support a wider range of Australian birds. Our new review of research on this topic revealed seven key considerations. These fall into two themes: reducing threats and improving habitat.\n\nWe found there\u2019s no point doing just the good things (such as plantings) if we don\u2019t stop doing the bad things (such as killing insects, poisoning owls and letting cats hunt). It\u2019s like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.\n\nSo let\u2019s acknowledge the complexity of nature and take a broader approach to attracting birds to our gardens, by ticking off the items on this shopping list.\n\n1. Secure pets\n\nDomestic cats kill millions of Australian birds every year. So no matter how innocent your cat looks, it remains a highly evolved predator.\n\nThe only guaranteed way to protect birds and other wildlife from cats is to keep them contained inside or in purpose-built enclosures, 24 hours a day. You can find out about building your own cat enclosure from government and retail experts online.\n\nDogs can also stop birds taking up residence in your garden. The mere presence of a dog can deter some birds. Keeping dogs contained at night can reduce the level of disturbance to nocturnal birds. But if you really want to attract birds to your garden, you may choose to keep your dog inside more.\n\nR. Steven\n\n2. Avoid using insecticides and outside lights\n\nMany flying and ground-dwelling insects are in decline. This is bad news for many birds including fairy-wrens, willie wagtails, fantails and robins who rely almost entirely on insects for food. But we can avoid using insecticides or any other form of lethal control such as bug zappers in our own gardens.\n\nIdeally, accept insects as a natural part of your garden. Don\u2019t try to deter them, unless they pose a risk to public safety, such as swarming European honeybees or hordes of European wasps. You can also consider favouring native plants that naturally are resisitant to unwanted insect attack.\n\nExcess artificial light is also taking a toll on insects. Consider whether you really need to leave that outdoor light on all night. Review your existing outdoor lighting using the five principles for responsible outdoor lighting, ensuring all artificial light is useful, targeted, low-level, controlled and warm-coloured.\n\nR. Steven\n\n3. Stop poisoning raptors\n\nThe use of rat poison, especially those labelled as \u201cfast action\u201d, is killing native owls and other birds of prey at an alarming rate due to secondary poisoning. In other words, raptors are dying after eating rats and mice that have taken the bait.\n\nMany countries have regulated the sale and use of these products for this reason, but Australia is lagging behind. So if you \u201cgive a hoot\u201d about our owls, switch to snap traps. There are also various other effective, humane and efficient options available, including removing unwanted fruit from the ground, keeping sheds tidy, and securing compost bins to keep rodents under control.\n\n4. Prevent window strikes\n\nBirds can fly into windows when they\u2019re unable to differentiate between the glass and the surrounding environment. Strikes may be lethal upon impact or result in injury. A stunned bird is also more vulnerable to predators.\n\nIn Australia, bird lovers can reduce the risk by using decals which are decorative stickers intended for windows. Screens, hanging plants or mobiles can also be placed in front of windows to help the birds avoid collisions.\n\n5. Create an inclusive garden\n\nThe diversity in Australian birds extends to their diets. Beyond honeyeaters, the nation is home to huge numbers of insectivores, carnivores, seed-eaters and fruit peckers.\n\nAustralian gardens typically have plenty of bottlebrush and grevilleas, which stacks the deck in the bold honeyeaters\u2019 favour. So when buying new garden plants, try catering for a wider variety of bird species.\n\nChoose dense shrubs with small white, yellow or blue flowers to attract insects. These bushy plants also make excellent habitat for small birds. Retaining trees ensures our larger birds have nesting sites too.\n\nIf you get the garden design right, with a variety of plants to suit all tastes, there is no need to feed the birds.\n\nR. Steven\n\n6. Encourage insects\n\nNative bees and flies play a crucial role in ecosystems, both as pollinators and food for birds.\n\nYou can provide insects with nesting habitat in the form of insect \u201chotels\u201d, food (namely flowers and other insects) and safety from pesticides. These small gestures can make a huge difference.\n\nR. Steven\n\n7. Water the birds too\n\nWith the urban heat island effect and growing frequency of extreme heat waves, birds are in need of reliable sources of fresh water. Offer this crucial resource in a water feature such as a bird bath or pond.\n\nWhole neighbourhoods for birds\n\nYour garden has never been more important for birds. Doing your bit in your own backyard can make a visible difference \u2013 you will see the birds for yourself. But true conservation gains can only be made when people work together at a larger scale.\n\nWhy not start a conversation with your neighbour about attracting birds to your garden? Creating one garden for birds is great, but when we start talking about whole neighbourhoods for birds, that\u2019s magic!",

The program focused on fostering international collaboration, boosting production capabilities and exploring strategies for oilfield development and energy sector growth. Discussions underscored the importance of regulatory reform, technological innovation and strengthened UK-Libya ties in achieving Libya\u2018s ambitious goal of increasing oil production to two million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030.\n\nLibya British Business Council (LBBC): Peter Millett, Chairman of the LBBC, opened the session with a presentation on improving commercial relations between Libya and the UK. He emphasized knowledge transfer, best practice sharing and institutional reform as critical steps toward enhancing Libya\u2019s economic governance. \u201cAs far as Libya\u2019s relationship with the UK is concerned, we would like to look at the present and the future. The future of Libya is very strong. The potential for GDP growth is among the highest in the world. Focusing on the potential is important,\u201d Millett stated.\n\nWaha Oil Company: Prof. Edris A. Abualkhair, Exploration Department Manager at Waha Oil Company, outlined the company\u2019s plan to increase production to 600,000 bpd by 2027.

Plus, wintry precipitation is looking more likely in the Austin, San Antonio and Houston metros.\n\nAn extreme cold watch has been issued for all of the Texas Panhandle, down into the plains and west toward El Paso. Forecasters are expecting the coldest temperatures of winter overnight Monday into Tuesday. Wind chills will be below 0 degrees throughout those parts of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a rare winter storm watch has been issued for portions of Southeast Texas from 6 p.m. CT Monday until 6 p.m. CT Tuesday. Scattered precipitation is possible after 6 p.m. CT Monday with widespread precipitation after midnight CT. The heaviest precipitation will be during the morning and early afternoon Tuesday in that part of the state.\n\nIt\u2019s looking more likely that the Houston area could see snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches, accompanied by a mix of sleet and freezing rain, particularly in areas closer to the coast. Potential heavy bands of snow could result in snowfall totals up to 5 inches, but it remains uncertain where those bands will develop.\n\nThe winter storm watch also extends into South Texas, the Interstate 35 corridor covering Austin and San Antonio and the Hill Country. Heavy mixed precipitation is expected Monday evening into Tuesday afternoon.

The Texans are now winless in six tries in the divisional round. It didn\u2019t help that C.J. Stroud was sacked eight times by Kansas City or that Travis Kelce torched the Texans for 117 yards and a score. Houston also had a pair of missed field goal attempts and an extra point sail wide right in the second half that would have tied the game. All those mistakes were too much to overcome against the two-time defending Super Bowl champions.\n\nJasmine Crockett drops \u2018Chile Collection\u2019 merch\n\nU.S. Rep.

Benjamin Holt came from a family of wagon wheel manufacturers, even managing his family\u2019s wagon wheel plant as a teenager after his brothers left, Peter Holt said. Eventually, he followed his brothers west to California for the Gold Rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen he got there, the Gold Rush was not days over, it was years over,\u201d Peter Holt joked.\n\nBenjamin Holt decided to return to his roots making agriculture equipment, eventually inventing a steam-powered tractor with treads, not wheels, at the turn of the 20th century. Though many patents for a similar design had already been filed, they all failed field tests. Holt\u2019s was the first to work.\n\nHolt\u2019s company, Holt Manufacturing, grew significantly during World War I, replacing horses to haul supplies and inspiring the development of British and French tanks.

equipment, the company has its roots seated deep in the farming community of the American western states where two pioneers in the mechanisation of agriculture were busy developing machinery to help with the wheat harvest.\n\nThe two men were Benjamin Holt and Daniel Best and they had both arrived in California in the late 1800s and got themselves into the combined harvester business, as they were then known.\n\nAlthough best known for construction equipment, Caterpillar has its roots in agriculture and still produces farm orientated machines\n\nIt is a little known feature of California\u2019s history that the state played host to the birth and early development of today\u2019s combine harvester.\n\nMuch of the action was based in and around Stockton, a town in which several early manufacturers had based themselves.\n\nIt was here that Benjamin Holt became a leading player in the machine\u2019s development, adapting the machines to run on hillsides and building the first self-propelled combine powered by an internal combustion engine in 1910.\n\nBenjamin Holt pioneered the development of the combined harvester in the late 19th century\n\nOver in San Leandro, Daniel Best had made his first batch of \u2018traveling combined harvesters\u2019 in 1885 and gradually built up the business via the introduction of a steam-powered unit in 1889.\n\nPrairie tractors\n\nTractors were also produced by the two companies; at first these were steam powered but internal combustion engines were also used as the technology became available and both offered tracked machines guided by a tiller wheel at the front.\n\nA Holt \u2018steamer\u2019 pauses for a photograph as it ploughs a western prairie\n\nHitherto they had been pulled by teams of up to 40 mules and animal power did not disappear completely until WW2, long after manufacturers had switched to engines for both threshing and locomotion.\n\nHolt, which leaned towards combine production, and Best which orientated more towards tractors, were in fierce competition during the first few years of the 20th century, not just in the field, but also in the courts as they disputed various patent applications.\n\nThis antagonism between the two companies all came to an end, sort of, when upon his retirement, Daniel Best sold two thirds of his company to Holt in 1908 and gifted the remainder to his son, Clarence Leo Best.\n\nBest Jnr starts again\n\nHowever, that was not quite the end of it, because Clarence Leo, who had stayed on as plant manger for Holt, was restless in this new position where Holt had full say in the running of his father\u2019s company, that he still owned a third of.\n\nC.L Best, as he was known, eventually left to form his own company in 1910, focusing on the manufacture of engine-driven wheeled, and eventually, tracked tractors.\n\nC.L Best tractors were offered in either tracked or wheeled form with the former being steered by a front-mounted tiller wheel\n\nThe company suffered after the First World War as sales dropped alarmingly and so it was restructured and renamed the C.L Best Tractor Company, refocusing on smaller farm scale tractors, whereas Holt was still wedded to the production of larger military machines.\n\nThe Holt Manufacturing Company had done well during the conflict, selling a large number of crawlers to the allied forces as tractors for the movement of guns and supplies across the otherwise impassable fields of France.\n\nDebt burden forces consolidation\n\nThis success had led the company to invest heavily at home in production facilities for tractors that, come November 1918, were not needed by the armies.\n\nNot only were new ones not needed, but older ones returned from Europe, further depressing demand and prices.\n\nBest Jnr. had also carried on with his father\u2019s passion in fighting over patents with Holt, one estimate putting the total legal expenditure of the two companies at $1.5 million, quite a sum in those days.\n\nClarence Leo Best formed the C.L Best Tractor Company in 1910 to carry on in his fathers pioneering spirit\n\nIn the early 1920s, the companies found themselves weakened and struggling, and so the decision came about to merge them into one single entity in 1925.\n\nIt was Holt that was by far the the larger concern, but thanks to Best focusing on smaller farm tractors, it was in a stronger financial position and so they were merged rather than the one taking over the over.\n\nThe union of the two companies brought into existence what we now know as Caterpillar Inc., a company that adopted the trademark of Holt\u2019s track-laying machines as its own corporate identity.\n\nCaterpillar trademark\n\nDespite Holt developing the track-laying vehicle into a commercial success, the mechanism was designed and patented by Richard Hornsby and Sons of Grantham in Lincolnshire.\n\nDavid Roberts was the company\u2019s chief engineer and managing director and it was he that patented the idea in 1904.\n\nRichard Hornsby & Sons original track-layer was trialled by the British War Office in 1907 and 1908\n\nAfter failing to interest the British Army in the design, the company sold the rights to Holt in 1911, the American company having already registered the name Caterpillar in 1910 after its photographer had observed that is what it looked like through the lens of his camera, which in those days would have inverted the image.\n\nThe idea was far from new but what Hornsby & Sons had done was include a separate drive to each track with its own clutch, thus enabling the machine to be steered without the use of a forward guide wheel.\n\nBenjamin Holt had already started to steer his company towards the use of tracked machines in the construction industry as the American federal government started to create a road network across the country.\n\nHolt had already started to steer his company towards construction equipment by the time of the merger\n\nWith the range of Caterpillar machines confined to large tracked models, there arose the problem of dealers not being able to offer both tracked and wheeled tractors.\n\nThis became ever more acute as both Allis-Chalmers and International Harvester added tracked models to their respective line-ups, meaning that their dealers could offer both, while Cat could only offer the one type.\n\nJohn Deere deal\n\nThe answer came in the form of a partnership with John Deere by which the two would share the distribution of their machines, enabling a Deere or Cat dealer to sell both types of machine in America and abroad, particularly South America.\n\nThere were reservations on both sides. Deere wondered whether a Cat dealer would ever try to sell a wheeled tractor while Caterpillar, which had a large trade in vertical multi-cylinder engines, expressed doubt about the two-cylinder horizontal format still being used by John Deere.\n\nThe Caterpillar Challenger of the late 1980s was the company\u2019s last foray into the agricultural tractor market\n\nDespite these concerns, the deal lasted over 20 years, from 1935, all the way through the war until the late 1950s and early 1960s when the dealers themselves began to dissolve the joint venture as the focus and products of the two manufacturers drifted further apart.\n\nThere was one more foray by Caterpillar into the agricultural market in 1986 when it created the Challenger brand of rubber-tracked tractors.\n\nThis was eventually sold off to AGCO in 2002 which still produces tracked machines up to 673hp.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nDick Bruna (born August 23, 1927, Utrecht, Netherlands\u2014died February 16, 2017, Utrecht) was a Dutch illustrator and writer who was best known as the creator of the beloved children\u2019s character Nijntje (Miffy in English), a sparingly drawn white bunny that featured in 32 books. The Miffy books were translated into more than 50 languages.\n\nBruna\u2019s father headed the publishing company A.W. Bruna & Zoon and expected that his son would also become a publisher. Dick Bruna was sent to work in bookshops in Utrecht and in London and at a publishing company in Paris in order to learn that business. He was more interested in art than in publishing, however, and in 1948 he enrolled in the State Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam. He joined the family publishing company in 1951 as a designer of book covers and posters.\n\nHis first children\u2019s book, De Appel (1953; The Apple) showcased his illustration style and his use of a palette of a few bright colours. Miffy debuted in 1955 in a book simply entitled Nijntje. Miffy was drawn in simple black outlines with two dots for eyes and a sideways X for a mouth; subtle variations conveyed Miffy\u2019s emotional state as she experienced the sorts of adventures that many toddlers would find familiar. Each of Bruna\u2019s books consisted of 12 page spreads, with the illustrations on the right side and the text, a four-line rhymed couplet, on the left. Bruna created the illustrations that told the story first and only afterward filled in the text. He wrote 124 children\u2019s books in all, many featuring different animal characters.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nOther Miffy titles included Nijntje in de dierentuin (1955; Miffy at the Zoo), Nijntje aan zee (1963; Miffy at the Seaside), Nijntje in het ziekenhuis (1975; Miffy in the Hospital), Njintje in de tent (1995; Miffy in the Tent), and Lieve oma pluis (1996; Dear Grandma Bunny), which dealt with the death of Miffy\u2019s grandmother. The last two were awarded the Dutch children\u2019s literature Silver Brush for illustration and the Silver Slate for writing, respectively. In addition, a children\u2019s television show was built around Miffy, and Nijntje de film (Miffy the Movie) appeared in 2013.\n\nBruna was honoured in 2015 with a showing of his illustrations and book cover designs at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and in 2016 he received the Max Velthuijs Award for his body of work as an illustrator. In 2006 the Centraal Museum in Utrecht opened the Dick Bruna Huis, a permanent collection of his work, and in 2015 it was converted into the Nijntjemuseum (Miffy Museum), a children\u2019s museum.",

PHOTO: SUPPLIED\n\nFarmer, contractor, quarryman.\n\nParkside Quarry owner Joe Mitchell, who died in Oamaru recently, leaves \"an awesome legacy\" after a lifetime of work in the North Otago landscape.\n\nMr Mitchell died on January 2, four days short of his 93rd birthday.\n\nHis daughter, Judy Mitchell-Oats, described her father as \"a private man\" who was fundamentally practical.\n\n\"He amazed me \u2014 nothing was a problem.\n\n\"He would think about things and say \u2018yep, right, this is how we\u2019re going to do it\u2019.\"\n\nMr Mitchell was the fourth of six generations of family continuously planted in the North Otago landscape.\n\nWhile he was bought up on the Parkside property bearing the quarry name, Mr Mitchell was the first generation of the family since taking up the land in 1874 to be directly involved.\n\nLong before he assumed ownership of the quarry in 1974 from long-time operator GT Gillies, he had wondered at the potential value lying beneath the pasture land of Parkside.\n\n\"The lease came up in 1974 and Dad thought, right, I\u2019ll take it on,\" Ms Mitchell-Oats said.\n\nSomewhat ironically, Joe Mitchell\u2019s great grandfather Henry Mitchell, who first bought the 650 acre (263ha) block of rolling tussock land on Airedale Rd had not realised the stone \"gold\" beneath the ground now so identified as Oamaru Stone, Ms Mitchell-Oats said.\n\nThe property took its name from the Parkside Hotel at Carisbrook.\n\nHenry Mitchell, an immigrant from Cornwall, who arrived in Dunedin from Melbourne in the 1860s, was its proprietor for 10 years before arriving in North Otago.\n\nA saw blade re-imagined at the entrance to Parkside. PHOTO: BRENDON MCMAHON\n\nParkside Quarry first opened in 1906 when Joe Mitchell\u2019s grandfather brokered an arrangement with Dunedin businessman John Gray, who began operations.\n\nThe Oamaru Opera House was built of Parkside stone in the same year and Parkside became the principle source of Oamaru stone from the 1920son.\n\nThat legacy is seen in buildings such as the Waitaki Girls\u2019 High and Waitaki Boys\u2019 high school complexes, the Oamaru police station, Oamaru Public Library, and more recently Riverstone Castle.\n\nMr Mitchell\u2019s tenure saw him innovate and expand over more than 40 years.\n\nHe bought the adjoining Taylors Lime in 1991, now known as Parkside Agricultural Lime, and expanded the business which now employs about 15 staff.\n\nMore modern mechanised cutting techniques arrived and the quarry, now managed by the sixth generation of the family, uses computerised digital cutting technology as the premier supplier of Oamaru stone nationally.\n\n\"We\u2019re the only limestone block factory in New Zealand,\" Ms Mitchell-Oats said.\n\nRaw-cut Oamaru stone at Parkside. PHOTO: BRENDON MCMAHON\n\nMr Mitchell\u2019s pedigree was already well established by the time he became a quarryman.\n\nTypical of his generation, he was well schooled in farm machinery operation before he left school on his 15th birthday.\n\nHe farmed at Parkside then worked as an agricultural and building salvage contractor, among other things, across North Otago.\n\n\"He\u2019s had a really interesting life,\" Ms Mitchell-Oats said.\n\n\"He was a hard-working man \u2014 did it his way. It was his way or the highway.\"\n\nAs a youth, the arrival of a new Caterpillar crawler tractor at Parkside sparked a lifelong love of the brand.\n\nHowever, his life was very nearly cut short.\n\nOne day in 1949, while operating a post-hole digger, Mr Mitchell very nearly died when his coat was caught in the power take-off drive.\n\nWell into his 80s, he could be found working on one of his beloved Caterpillars around the Parkside property.\n\n\"He\u2019s had a wonderful life in doing what he wanted to do,\" Ms Mitchell-Oats said.\n\n\"He was a real trouper. He\u2019s left an awesome legacy.\"\n\nbrendon.mcmahon@odt.co.nz",

Amid this backdrop, investors could scoop up shares of fundamentally stable industrial equipment stocks, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Crane Company (CR), and Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC) for potential gains.\n\nThe demand for industrial equipment is surging due to rapid industrialization and the expansion of manufacturing in emerging economies. Countries like China and India are primed for urbanization, and as their industrial sectors scale up, the need for advanced machinery is poised to grow even further in the coming years.\n\nSectors such as mining, energy, construction, and manufacturing are driving the demand for more advanced machinery. To meet stringent environmental regulations and reduce carbon footprints, companies are increasingly introducing electric and hybrid equipment. This shift is transforming the sector, focusing on sustainability while enhancing equipment efficiency and performance.\n\nThe advent of Industry 4.0 is further revolutionizing the industrial equipment sector. Advanced technologies like robotics, automation, machine learning, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being integrated into equipment and operations. These innovations are streamlining processes, reducing labor costs, boosting overall efficiency, and reshaping the landscape of industrial production in profound ways.\n\nMarket projections indicate substantial growth in the industrial equipment sector. According to a study by market.us, the global Industry 4.0 market is forecasted to reach $482 billion by 2032, growing at an impressive CAGR of 20.7%.\n\nMoreover, as per a report by Cognitive market research, the global industrial equipment market is expected to reach $347.40 billion, growing at a CAGR of 4.2%.\n\nNow let us dive deep into the fundamentals of three Industrial \u2013 Machinery stocks, starting with #3.\n\nStock #3: Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)\n\nCAT manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company has five segments: Construction Industries; Resource Industries; Energy & Transportation; Financial Products; and All Other.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, CAT unveiled Cat\u00ae Dynamic Energy Transfer, an innovative OEM-designed solution aimed at solving the energy management aspect of the mining industry\u2019s energy transition. The release could enhance the company\u2019s market presence in the mining industry and bring in stronger growth prospects.\n\nFor the fiscal 2024 third quarter that ended September 30, CAT\u2019s total sales and revenues came in at $16.11 billion. Its operating profit was reported to be $3.15 billion. Additionally, the company\u2019s profit and profit per common share amounted to $2.46 billion and $5.06, respectively.\n\nAnalysts expect CAT\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year ending December 2025 to increase 1.1% year-over-year to $65.32 billion. Its EPS for the same period is expected to rise marginally from the prior year\u2019s value to $21.98. The company surpassed consensus EPS estimates in three of the four trailing quarters.\n\nShares of CAT surged 5.5% over the past six months and 32.5% over the past year to close the last trading session at $380.55.\n\nCAT\u2019s POWR Ratings reflect its fundamentals. It has a B grade for Stability and Quality. The POWR Ratings assess stocks by 118 different factors, each with its own weighting.\n\nWithin the A-rated Industrial \u2013 Machinery industry, CAT is ranked #48 out of 78 stocks. In addition to the POWR Rating highlighted above, you can check CAT\u2019s ratings for Value, Growth, Sentiment, and Momentum here.\n\nStock #2: Crane Company (CR)\n\nCR manufactures and sells engineered industrial products globally. The company has three segments: Aerospace & Electronics; Process Flow Technologies; and Engineered Materials. It offers parts for commercial and military aerospace, engineered fluid handling equipment, fiberglass-reinforced plastic panels and coils and more.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, CR announced a definitive agreement to sell its Engineered Materials business to KPS Capital Partners, LP for a total transaction value of $227 million. The divestiture allows the company to focus on its two strategic growth platforms: Aerospace & Electronics and Process Flow Technologies and drive profits through capital gains.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, CR announced the completion of the acquisition of Technifab Products, Inc., a provider of vacuum-insulated pipe systems and valves for cryogenic applications, for $40.5 million. The acquisition allows CR to enhance its existing capabilities in cryogenics and could provide a broader suite of solutions across highly attractive end markets.\n\nFor the fiscal 2024 third quarter that ended September 30, CR\u2019s net sales increased 12.7% year-over-year to $597.20 million. Its adjusted operating profit rose 35.2% from the year-ago value to $109.10 million.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share grew 36.1% and 34% from the prior year\u2019s quarter to $80.30 million and $1.38, respectively.\n\nStreet expects CR\u2019s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year ending December 2025 to increase 5.7% and 14.1% year-over-year to $2.27 billion and $5.52, respectively.

The stock has an overall rating of B, equating to a Buy in our proprietary rating system.\n\nCR has a B grade for Quality. It is ranked #31 out of 78 stocks within the Industrial \u2013 Machinery industry.\n\nClick here to access CR\u2019s ratings for Momentum, Sentiment, Stability, Value, and Growth.\n\nStock #1: Generac Holdings Inc.

The company\u2019s offerings include residential automatic standby generators, automatic transfer switch, air-cooled engine residential standby generators, Mobile Link, residential storage solution, smart thermostats and more.\n\nOn January 6, GNRC unveiled its Smart Thermostat Essential, a new smart thermostat that offers incredible value, comfort, and convenience features at a low cost. This addition to the company\u2019s smart thermostat lineup could enhance the company\u2019s sales figures.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter that ended September 30, 2024, GNRC\u2019s net sales increased 9.6% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.

The company also surpassed consensus EPS estimates in three of the four trailing quarters.\n\nShares of GNRC have surged 24.2% over the past nine months and 38% over the past year to close the last trading session at $160.28.\n\nGNRC\u2019s stable fundamentals are mirrored in its POWR Ratings.

            "content": "TIRUPATTUR: Coconut cultivation spanning across 10,500 acres in Tirupattur district is severely affected by black-headed caterpillars, as per farmers. As many as 75,000 farmers are affected due to the infestation. Farmers say while some of the fields are entirely damaged, a few of them are 25% impacted. The district administration has confirmed that 480 hectares (1,186 acres) are the worst hit.\n\nFarmers explained that the pest spreads rapidly during the summer. As one of the major crops of the district, coconuts are critical to the livelihoods of these farmers. In affected villages like Kundanimedu, Ambalur, Sammandhikuppam, Eklaspuram, and Sankarapuram, numerous coconut farms have dried, with fronds turning brown from the pest attack.\n\nK Nagarajan, a farmer from Kundanimedu, which is one of the worst-hit areas, shared that the pest had been spreading across the district for three years and reached his farm recently. \u201cThe horticulture department gave us packets of parasitoid wasps that kill the caterpillar, but we are unsure about how many wasps to release,\u201d said Nagarajan, who cultivates coconuts on two acres.\n\nS Anandan, another farmer with one and a half acres, said that infested trees stop yielding for up to three years. Similarly, M Babu, a farmer from Ambalur with a two-acre farm, said coconut farming requires `40,000 per acre annually for ploughing, pesticides, and fertilizers. \u201cIn normal years, we earn `1 lakh per acre, but this pest reduces yield by 90%, leaving us in financial distress,\u201d he said. The fronds from affected trees cannot even be used for roofs, brooms, and husks cannot be used as fuel for firewood, they said.\n\nCoconut farming is a sole source of income for many. M Devaraj (74) of Kundanimedu, who has been farming since he was 16-years-old said, \u201cAt 74 years of age I cannot switch my profession. If my farm doesn\u2019t earn, I am left with nothing.\u201d Stating that many farmers did not know how to use the parasitoid wasps, Babu said awareness needs to be created for the farmers on the ground.\n\nA Ashokan, an activist who was also a farmer recalled a similar infestation from 1986-1988, when local centres in Ambalur and Periyapettai supplied wasps to control the pest. These centres were later closed, forcing farmers now to source wasps from Krishnagiri, about 130 km away. \u201cMost wasps die during transport, making this solution less effective,\u201d he said, urging authorities to establish local wasp production centres, provide free pesticides, and compensate farmers with `1 lakh per tree. He noted that it takes up to five years for affected trees to recover.\n\nTiruvannamalai MP C N Annadurai brought the issue to the National Bureau of Agriculture, last month. Following his efforts, a team of scientists from Bengaluru, Kochi, and the Coconut Development Board inspected the region and suggested measures. Annadurai noted the pest is spreading to neighbouring districts like Krishnagiri and Tiruvannamalai and assured to push for swift solutions. S Deepa, Deputy Director of Horticulture, explained that the infestation is concentrated in Natrampalli, Madhanur, and Alangayam blocks.\n\n\u201cWe are sourcing braconid parasitoids from Dharmapuri to provide to farmers. We have also sent a proposal requesting the establishment of an Integrated Pest Management for controlling black headed caterpillar in Tirupattur,\u201d she said.\n\nThe proposed centre would employ methods like light traps, which attract and kill adult caterpillars, and parasitoid wasps, which lay eggs on the caterpillar larvae. \u201cWhen the eggs hatch, the caterpillars\u2019 larvae are killed,\u201d said R Seeniraj Joint Director of Agriculture. He added that the pest spreads through the air and damages leaves 80 to 90 ft high on trees, making control efforts challenging.\n\nAddressing a query about delayed action, Deepa said, \u201cCoconut farming came under the horticulture department only seven months ago. We have been taking measures since.\u201d Collector K Tharpagaraj assured that awareness campaigns are going on and would intensify in coming days.",

So far, the largest electric excavator available to North America from a major manufacturer is the 57,000-pound Volvo EC230, not quite in this category.",

The agency says it is the worst damage noted since 1961.\n\nBut the spruce budworm, on the other hand, has impacted more than 2,000 square miles since 2021, mostly in St. Louis, Lake and Cook counties. Some small populations outside the Arrowhead, such as in Itasca County, also seem to be persisting.\n\nThe DNR stated that the resulting fir and spruce death have caused major concerns with wildfire potential and the inability to efficiently manage the forest.\n\nThe agency received funds last year from the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council to diversify and regenerate budworm-impacted land. But according to the agency, a number of factors and the sheer extent of the outbreak are making dealing with spruce budworm a big challenge. These factors include limited staffing, limited market demand, not enough loggers and contractors and diverse land ownership patterns.\n\nContributed / Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Typical feeding damage from spruce budworm on fir in late June. Note the caterpillar at the base of new shoot.\n\nOutbreaks of spruce budworm occurred in the past and now may be exacerbated by 20th and 21st century fire suppression. Fire suppression allows forests to grow denser and older, benefiting spruce budworm.\n\nOutbreaks in a specific area typically last six to 10 years, which is about the amount of time balsam fir and white spruce can withstand feeding. After outbreaks subside, budworm will cycle back about 30-60 years later.",

            "content": "Readers hoping to buy Caterpillar Inc. ( ) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Caterpillar's shares before the 21st of January in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of February.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.41 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Caterpillar has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of US$374.89. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Caterpillar's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Caterpillar paying out a modest 25% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 27% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Caterpillar's earnings per share have been growing at 16% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Caterpillar has delivered 8.9% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nShould investors buy Caterpillar for the upcoming dividend? Caterpillar has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.\n\nOn that note, you'll want to research what risks Caterpillar is facing. In terms of investment risks, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend\n\nIf you're looking to trade Caterpillar , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

Along the way, they\u2019ll discover the ways caterpillars move, what they eat, and how other creatures help them achieve their transformation.\n\n\u201cThis interactive exhibit will transform your learning of butterflies in a fun and engaging way. Visitors will leave inspired to discover more about the fascinating lives of caterpillars and butterflies in our local ecosystem,\u201d said Swaner\u2019s Visitor Experience Coordinator Brianna Cencak.\n\nThe adventure in this maze begins as visitors look through eggs to see caterpillar friends climbing on leaves and beginning to feed. Families can learn to crawl like a caterpillar by slipping into a set of caterpillar legs and using teamwork and locomotion to sprint for the finish line. Visitors will feed a caterpillar its lunch through team games and contests. They\u2019ll discover why carpenter ants in Panama defend metalmark caterpillars from predators.\n\nOnce the transformation from pupa to butterfly is complete, kids can practice flapping giant butterfly wings while avoiding spider webs that lurk around every turn. The \u201cNectar Food Path Puzzle\u201d and \u201cSqueeze and Sniff\u201d stations explain how butterflies find food by sight and smell. Children and adults can find a butterfly mate by creating a wacky dance and then learn how butterflies select a specific plant on which to lay their eggs.\n\nVisitors can mark their progress as a butterfly by stamping a souvenir garden card at eight stations before zooming out of the maze as a butterfly on \u201cThe Monarch Monorail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love an opportunity for learning through play and this exhibit is all about it,\u201d said Swaner Director of Exhibits Hunter Klingensmith. \u201cNot only does the maze make for a fun challenge, but there are interactive elements at every turn to help guests experience the life cycle and challenges of being a butterfly. We have been looking at these exhibits from Minotaur Mazes for a few years and I\u2019m so excited to bring one to Park City.\u201d\n\nSwaner Preserve and EcoCenter will pair this exhibition with additional programming to provide the community with ways to learn and engage with butterflies found right here in Utah. From butterfly-themed story times to a \u201cButterflies of Utah\u201d display to a behind-the-scenes tour of the butterfly collections at NHMU, there will be something for everyone.\n\nRegular entry for Amazing Butterflies is $7 for ages 3-64, $6 for those 65 and older or with a valid military ID, and free for ages 0-2. Members of Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter receive free admission to the exhibit.\n\nOr anyone can visit for free on Jan. 18, Feb. 20, March 14, and April 13 thanks to generous sponsors.

            "content": "When you think of venomous animals, caterpillars probably aren\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind. Snakes, of course. Scorpions and spiders, too. But caterpillars?\n\nYes, indeed. The world turns out to be home to hundreds \u2014 perhaps thousands \u2014 of species of venomous caterpillars, and at least a few of them pack a punch toxic enough to kill or permanently injure a person. That alone is reason for scientists to study them. But caterpillars also contain a potential windfall of medically useful compounds within their toxic secretions.\n\n\u201cWill we get to the stage where we\u2019ll be taking things from their venoms that are useful? Definitely,\u201d says Andrew Walker, an evolutionary biologist and biochemist at the University of Queensland, Australia. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of foundational work to do first.\u201d\n\nCaterpillars are the larval stages of the insect order Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. It\u2019s just one of many animal groups with little-known venomous members. (Venoms are toxins that are deliberately injected into another animal, while poisons sit passively in an organism\u2019s body, waiting to sicken a potential predator.) By biologists\u2019 best estimate, venoms have evolved at least 100 times across the animal kingdom.\n\nMany venoms are complex, some containing more than 100 different compounds. And they\u2019re also strikingly diverse. \u201cNo two species have the same venom arsenal,\u201d says Mand\u00eb Holford, a venom scientist at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to study as many species as we can find.\u201d\n\nIndeed, studying venoms could be a better way to find new drug candidates than starting from scratch, because they contain molecules fine-tuned over eons to target specific biological processes in the victim. \u201cThey\u2019ve evolved over millions of years, they\u2019ve been tested in nature, and we know they work,\u201d says Holford. \u201cWhen we try to devise them ourselves in the lab, the success rate is a lot less.\u201d\n\nMost groups of venomous organisms, however, are barely on scientists\u2019 radar. \u201cWe have a huge wealth of knowledge about snake venoms and scorpion venoms and spider venoms,\u201d says Nicholas Casewell, a venom biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. \u201cBut there are lots of groups of venomous animals out there that are largely unstudied.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: ISTOCK.COM / MARCIN WOJCIECHOWSKI\n\nCaterpillars, in particular, deserve more attention, says Walker, who wrote about venomous Lepidoptera in the 2025 Annual Review of Entomology. Though only about 2 percent of caterpillar species are venomous, by Walker\u2019s estimate, they\u2019re widely scattered across the lepidopteran evolutionary tree. That pattern means venom likely evolved independently several times within the group, potentially yielding an unusual diversity of chemicals. The deadly caterpillars \u2014 within the South American genus called Lonomia \u2014 have a snakelike venom that interferes with blood clotting. Others have venoms that cause chronic, lifelong inflammatory problems, and a couple cause miscarriages in horses.\n\nThose nasty few are enough to make venomous caterpillars a significant public health issue, in at least some parts of the world, says Walker. \u201cThey\u2019re not killing many people regularly like scorpions and snakes do, but compared to spiders there\u2019s not much difference in the impact of the health hazard.\u201d The concern has led some researchers to work on understanding the biological effects of the potentially lethal Lonomia venom, and to develop antivenom to treat affected people.\n\nThough a few other caterpillar venoms have been studied at least a little, most remain almost entirely unstudied, says Walker \u2014 and medicine may be missing out. For example, he notes, most lepidopteran venoms cause pain, sometimes intense enough to require opioid painkillers. That\u2019s not surprising, since pain is an excellent way to deter predators \u2014 but it also allows researchers to use the venom as a probe to identify pain pathways in the body and pain receptors in lab animals and, potentially, in people. That, in turn, could lead to new drugs.\n\nStay in the Know\n\nSign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\nResearch on caterpillar venoms is still sparse enough that no new drugs have resulted yet, but venoms of other organisms have yielded some important therapies. There are blood-pressure and anticlotting medications that were inspired by snake venoms, for example, and a forerunner to the new blockbuster drug semaglutide \u2014 better known by brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 was based on a molecule extracted from a venomous lizard, the Gila monster.\n\nThanks to advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics, venoms of all animals, including caterpillars, are increasingly easy to investigate \u2014 and that should mean big steps forward soon, says Casewell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a treasure trove that\u2019s still sitting out there for us to understand.\u201d",

Released for retail and rental customers, the Cat TH0642, TH0842, TH1055 and TH1255 models replace the previous TL642, TL943, TL1055 and TL1255 machines.\n\n\u201cOur goal with the next gen Cat Telehandlers is to deliver a safe, reliable, smooth and comfortable range of machines that are easy to use and maintain,\u201d said Kevin Coleman, Caterpillar senior product consultant. \u201cWe\u2019ve received extremely positive feedback from operators on how stable and easy to control the telehandler feels when they are handling and placing heavy loads at height as well as the smooth ride when navigating uneven terrain.\u201d\n\nThe new Cat Telehandlers are powered by the Cat C3.6TA (turbocharged and aftercooled) engine that meets U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final/EU Stage V emissions standards. The 74 hp (55 kW) engine includes a zero-service diesel particulate filter (DPF) and does not require diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). A 115 hp (86 kW) option for the TH0842, TH1055, and TH1255 models also uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology.\n\nOperator comfort and safety\n\nThe telehandlers offer three operator station options: open canopy, enclosed cab with heat and enclosed cab with heat and air conditioning. The redesigned interior features an ergonomic control layout, standard tilt steering column, and a new full color LCD monitor that provides machine information in a choice of four languages \u2013 English, French, Spanish or Portuguese. The monitor also shows the standard rearview camera feed when in reverse and depressing the camera soft key enables continuous viewing of the camera image. Additional standard equipment includes the standard operator presence seat switch to prevent machine operation when the operator is not seated. The optional Load Stability Indication (LSI) system provides visual and audible alerts to the operator regarding forward machine stability while handling a load.\n\nPerformance and security\n\nThe pilot-controlled joystick ensures a smooth, predictable multi-function performance and feel of the boom extend/retract and lift/lower functions. Customers now have a choice of coupler interface; the IT or Standard TH. Smaller and lighter weight than the IT style coupler, the new Standard TH quick coupler offering delivers improved fork visibility and enhanced load capacity when used with the boom extended. The next generation Cat Telehandlers also feature standard auxiliary hydraulics to support hydraulically powered Cat attachments.\n\nTo assist with fuel economy and minimizing idle time, Cat Telehandlers are equipped with a configurable engine idle shutdown feature.\n\nThe monitor in the Cat Telehandlers features a standard multi-operator code security system, supporting up to 50 operator codes to protect against machine theft and unauthorized use at the jobsite.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe new TH models feature extended service intervals and a patent-pending service tool for quick inspection of chains and boom wear pads. The boom sections, mainframe, stabilizer frame and stabilizer legs are covered by a 5-year, 5,000-hour warranty.\n\nTelematics\n\nEquipped with Product Link\u2122 Elite standard telematics, the system provides critical machine operating information for fleet managers. Remote flash capability allows for software updates without a trip to the dealer\u2019s shop, and remote troubleshooting provides real-time diagnostics, along with remote machine parameter and setting changes.\n\nCaterpillar will display the next generation Cat Telehanders at World of Concrete 2025 in booth C6061.\n\nTarget availability for these next generation telehandlers is Q2 2025. More information on the new Cat Telehandlers can be found by contacting a Cat dealer or visiting cat.com.",

            "content": "In the remote Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a rare fungus grows inside dead caterpillars. In traditional Chinese medicine, this parasitic fungus is prized for its purported medicinal effects. Known as Ophiocordyceps sinensis \u2013 colloquially, caterpillar fungus or \u201cHimalayan gold\u201d \u2013 it can fetch astronomical prices on the herbal medicine market: up to US$63,000 per pound.\n\nOphiocordyceps sinensis fungus is a parasite that targets the caterpillar that is the larva of the ghost moth. The process begins in late summer to early fall, when fungal spores infect the caterpillars. Over time, fungal filaments called mycelia slowly spread out and consume the caterpillars from within, turning them into hardened, mummified shells by winter. When spring arrives, the fungus enters its final stage: A grasslike fruiting body sprouts from the preserved caterpillar\u2019s head and pushes up through the soil.\n\nWhile many traditional Chinese/herbal medicine consumers are drawn to the fungus for its supposed health benefits, my interest lies in a darker side of its harvest: the deadly relationship between caterpillar fungus collection and lightning strikes. As a meteorologist, I study lightning and its impacts around the world. A few factors come together to make the situation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau so dangerous.\n\nA deadly harvest\n\nPeople hunt for this fungus during late spring and summer, exactly when lightning strikes are most common in these mountains. Villagers often spend weeks scouring the rugged mountains for this precious resource, sometimes up to 16,400 feet (5 kilometers) above sea level. That\u2019s an altitude of more than 3 miles.\n\nAt these heights, the weather can change in an instant, and there\u2019s nowhere safe to hide from storms. While this area doesn\u2019t get as many lightning strikes as some parts of Asia, it\u2019s still dangerous enough to be a serious threat during these crucial harvesting months.\n\nTragically, caterpillar fungus hunting has led to at least 31 lightning-related deaths and another 58 lightning-related injuries in the past decade, according to the yearbooks of Chinese meteorological hazards (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u707e\u5bb3\u5e74\u9274) and government websites, including the China Meteorological Administration and the National Disaster Reduction Center of China.\n\nIn May 2022, seven villagers from China, including a young child, were killed by lightning while harvesting the fungus. The following year, three people from Nepal were injured by lightning when collecting the fungus and had to be rescued by helicopter after spending days stranded in the mountains.\n\nIn our recent study, my colleague Ronald Holle and I found that the population-weighted lightning fatality rates in the fungus-collection hotspots of Yushu and Garze counties, located in the Sichuan Province of China, are staggering \u2013 10 to 20 times higher than the already elevated rates in China overall. These numbers are on par with some of the most lightning-prone regions of Africa, where there is little lightning-safe infrastructure or safety education.\n\nBut lightning isn\u2019t the only threat these villagers face in the mountains. They could encounter hail, heavy rains, strong winds and other severe weather. The complex terrain makes weather patterns highly dramatic and unpredictable. Making things even worse, cellphone signals and other communication options are limited or nonexistent, leaving villagers cut off from weather hazard alerts.\n\nThey could also face threats from wild animals and risky mountain slopes. In one tragic case, a collector was struck by lightning and fell to his death on steep terrain. Medical care is rarely available. When accidents occur, it may be days before help arrives.\n\nWhy take the risk?\n\nIt all comes down to the high-risk, high-reward nature of caterpillar fungus collection.\n\nFor local villagers, the potential rewards of harvesting caterpillar fungus are significant. With limited income opportunities in this remote region, many see the fungus trade as their best hope for survival. They face a tough choice: risk their lives or sink into poverty.\n\nImproving lightning safety education and infrastructure are important but far from easy. Any real change would take a lot of investment.\n\nWhile the local government does organize some lightning safety education, these mountain communities are isolated and the information is often outdated. And there\u2019s simply no practical way to install adequate lightning protection across the vast, rugged terrain where the fungus is collected.\n\nA fragile pursuit\n\nThe environment is suffering, too. With so many people hunting for the fungus, they\u2019re damaging the delicate mountain soil, cutting down trees for firewood and leaving trash at their camps.\n\nYears of overharvesting have forced collectors to spend more time in the mountains to find enough fungus, increasing their exposure to lightning and the fungus\u2019s decline. Scientists warn that if this aggressive harvesting continues, the fungus might disappear completely in the next few decades.\n\nThere might be some hope. Researchers are exploring ways to cultivate the fungus as a possible substitute for the wildly harvested variety. Meanwhile, governments in China, India, Nepal and Bhutan have implemented regulations to protect the sustainability of caterpillar fungus.\n\nBut any solution will need to address the underlying economic and educational inequities in this remote region, opening up new opportunities for these communities to make a living so they don\u2019t need to risk their lives chasing \u201cHimalayan gold.\u201d",

Most gardeners are keen observers of what is going on in their yards, and we\u2019ve noted the decrease in bird populations.\n\nGardeners are also aware of the pests they have to deal with in their gardens, with caterpillars being especially noticeable due to the damage that they cause. But here\u2019s the rub: If you care about birds, you need to garden for caterpillars. Yes, caterpillars!\n\nRaise your awareness about caterpillars and take a bird\u2019s-eye view of the situation. This is going to be a tough sell, but birds need those caterpillars, so don\u2019t be in a hurry to squish, stomp, or spray every single one that you see. In spring, when they have a nest full of hatchlings, bird parents are busy delivering food to their babies. Soft, squishy caterpillars are digestible by baby birds and provide the right proteins, lipids, and carotenoids for good nutrition.\n\nFor example, chickadees have one brood each spring that can stay in the nest for up to 16 days and require as many as 9,000 juicy caterpillars, depending on the number of chicks. That\u2019s a lot of caterpillars! Over the summer, caterpillars and other insects make up most of an adult chickadee\u2019s diet, too. How many chickadees do you think your yard can support?\n\n\u2192 Learn more about chickadees and hear their song!\n\nAlthough some of the caterpillars that the chickadees and other birds eat are the larvae of butterflies, most are from moths. As observant as gardeners are, there are many different species of moths living in your yard that you may never notice due to the fact that they are nocturnal and their larvae are small and unobtrusive. Some, such as the Esther moth larvae, hang off of a branch like twigs, while the pug moth larvae look like sticks. Only a sharp-eyed bird is going to find them.\n\nNative Trees That Support Caterpillars (and Birds)\n\nA single native tree can support hundreds of different species of moths and butterflies. Importantly, birds go to native trees where the caterpillars are. To further complicate matters, different caterpillars and insects often co-evolved with very specific plants. The quintessential example is the Monarch butterfly; its caterpillars only eat milkweed plants. Rather than get into all the specific pairings of plants and wildlife, the important thing to know is that a yard or landscape with a diversity of plants is important (versus a monoculture).\n\nAnd consider which trees attract the most species of moths and butterfly larvae (caterpillars).\n\nOaks: can host 534 species of moth and butterfly larvae. Imagine the difference one oak might make!\n\ncan host 534 species of moth and butterfly larvae. Imagine the difference one oak might make! Willows, cherries, and plums: 456\n\n456 Birches: 413\n\n413 Poplar and cottonwood: 368\n\n368 Maples and box elder : 285\n\n: 285 Elms: 213\n\n213 Pines: 203\n\n203 Hickory: 200\n\n(These numbers are from Bringing Nature Home by Douglas Tallamy)\n\nIf you would like to help the birds, please consider planting one of these native trees in your yard. Native plants will not only play host to caterpillars and birds, but also support bees and other wildlife. They will absorb and filter rainwater, improve air quality, and make a beautiful addition to your landscape. When tree shopping, be sure to purchase a native species rather than an exotic. A native variety can support 35 times more caterpillars than a non-native variety of the same species!\n\nIf the trees are providing an adequate supply of food for your birds, then you can go back to squishing those caterpillars that are eating your veggies without feeling guilty!\n\nRead more about \u201cGardening for the Birds.\u201d",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nJon Scieszka (born September 8, 1954, Flint, Michigan, U.S.) is an American children\u2019s author and educator perhaps best known for his book The Stinky Cheese Man, and Other Fairly Stupid Tales (1992).\n\nScieszka, an avid reader in his youth, said that he found such schoolroom staples as the Dick and Jane readers\u2014a series of illustrated books presenting simple narratives intended to instruct young children in reading\u2014to be akin to \u201cbad castor oil medicine.\u201d He sought out his own pleasure reading; one of his favourite books was the whimsical Go, Dog, Go! by P.D. Eastman. Scieszka attended high school at Culver Military Academy. He entered Albion College with the intention of studying medicine; after graduating in 1976, however, he studied creative writing at Columbia University, earning an M.F.A. in 1980. While attempting to forge a career as a novelist, Scieszka found work teaching at a private elementary school on the Upper East Side of New York City. His experiences there inspired him to try writing for children.\n\nAs a writer and teacher, Scieszka noticed that boys were less likely than girls to read, and the boys who did read tended to favour nonfiction, humour, or other forms not typically assigned by their mostly female teachers. Scieszka founded an Internet-based literacy movement called Guys Read, which encouraged boys to read and men to serve as reading role models. He based the movement on the belief that the key to producing more adult male readers was to let boys read what engaged them rather than forcing them to read specific selections.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nScieszka teamed with illustrator Lane Smith in the late 1980s to create The True Story of the Three Little Pigs!, a parody of the classic children\u2019s tale, told from the perspective of the wolf, who believes he has been unjustly accused of wrongdoing. Several publishers rejected the work on the grounds that it was too sophisticated for its intended audience, but Viking Press published it in 1989, and the book received citations from The New York Times and the American Library Association. The Stinky Cheese Man, and Other Fairly Stupid Tales (1992, also illustrated by Smith), a wacky twist on some familiar fairy tales, was named a Caldecott Honor Book.\n\nScieszka then quit teaching and devoted himself full-time to writing. Numerous successful titles followed, including Math Curse (1995), Baloney (Henry P.) (2001), and the Time Warp Trio series, which was adapted into an animated program for television. Two other notable series were Trucktown and Frank Einstein. In addition, Scieszka wrote the autobiographical Knucklehead (2008) and Robot Zot! (2009), illustrated by David Shannon.\n\nIn 2008 the Library of Congress appointed Scieszka to serve as national ambassador for young people\u2019s literature, a two-year appointment that entrusted him with the task of raising national awareness of the importance of children\u2019s books. Scieszka was chosen for the post on the basis of his extensive efforts to promote reading among young people, but his approach included methods that some educators found problematic\u2014he embraced such traditionally \u201cnonliterary\u201d forms as comic books, graphic novels, and the Internet.",

While it is a natural part of the ecosystem, contributing to organic matter recycling and serving as a food source for birds, it can also cause significant damage to pine trees.\n\nAdditionally, its stinging hairs pose a potential health risk to humans and animals, capable of triggering allergic reactions.\n\nPreventative measures, such as keeping pine trees healthy through proper pruning and watering, are recommended to minimise infestation. Professional treatments, such as those being conducted by Lokimica on behalf of the council, can effectively halt the animals\u2019 spawning activity.\n\nHowever, even after successful treatment, the caterpillars\u2019 distinctive tent-like nests may remain visible. These structures, while inactive, can present an aesthetic issue but are not a threat to the tree.\n\nMazarr\u00f3n council has highlighted that removing the nests is often discouraged, as this can weaken the tree and increase its susceptibility to future infestations.\n\nNot only that, but nests located on high branches may be in areas critical to the tree\u2019s growth, and removal could cause additional harm.\n\nResidents are advised to exercise caution and ensure pets avoid contact with the caterpillars during the treatment period.",

He now believes it is worthy of an in-line (read: hold) designation, rather than its previous underperform (sell), at a price target of $365 per share.\n\nAccording to reports, Raso's new take on Caterpillar is based on a combination of factors outlined in his latest update on the stock. He pointed out that construction equipment stocks, a group of which it's something of a leader, have fallen at double-digit rates in the past month and a half to two months alone. At the same time, Evercore ISI's surveys for the sector indicate better potential than some investors anticipate.\n\nThe recommendation change was only the latest shift in its view of Caterpillar. Exactly two months ago, it did the reverse by downshifting to in line from the preceding underperform.\n\nIncautious optimism\n\nI'd be cautiously optimistic for both Caterpillar, and the wider universe of construction and construction-adjacent stocks. Interest rates have been coming down lately, and the clear goal of the Federal Reserve (Fed) is to enact more cuts if inflation growth continues to shrink. Meanwhile, demand for housing in this country remains strong despite high costs, so these businesses enjoy a measure of bottom-up support.",

This would have been the 10-year full outbreak.\u201d\n\nAs for the odds of both a fungus and virus occurring at the same time-\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite common,\u201d says Mech. \u201cIt\u2019s Mother Nature\u2019s way of making sure that nothing gets out of control for too long. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been anxiously crossing our fingers for, for this right recipe that would result in the browntail moth population starting that decline.\u201d\n\nBut just because the numbers are going down, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re out of the woods yet.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly possible that they could make a rebound,\u201d says Schmeelk, smiling. \u201cWe have been very surprised before.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now we have to remain diligent with looking at those winter web nests,\u201d adds Mech. \u201cNow that the leaves are off the trees, we have all these sunny days. And so it\u2019s really the right time to look for those winter nests and clip them if you do see them.\u201d\n\n+++++\n\nFor more information on how to clip winter browntail moth caterpillar nests and dispose of them properly, log onto maine.gov.\n\nSchmeelk notes that while the browntail moth population is decreasing in a majority of of Maine, there are still some areas with elevated levels according to the Maine Forest Service.\n\nThose include north of the Bangor area, Northern Knox County, Belgrade Lakes and some areas outside of Lewiston and Auburn.\n\nCopyright 2025 WABI.

            "content": "As the year kicks off, many HR leaders are laser-focused on rolling out 2025 agendas\u2014and striving to meet the goals contained within. However, SC Johnson CHRO Kimberly Hauer says it\u2019s important for HR strategy to have a broad foundation\u2014to be built not just around what\u2019s to come in the next few months but rather the next few years.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve evolved my approach to planning and problem-solving, I now focus on longer time horizons, looking beyond 2025 to the years leading up to 2035,\u201d says Hauer, a recently inducted Fellow of the National Academy of Human Resources.\n\n3 top issues that will shape HR strategy\n\nHauer, who joined SC Johnson in 2016 after a nearly 20-year career at Caterpillar, says the transition represented a shift from a public company \u201cfocused on quarterly results and investor expectations\u201d to a privately held company with a \u201clong-term vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Caterpillar, the focus was on short-term results, which often involved cost-cutting. At SC Johnson, we prioritize doing what is right for the long term,\u201d she says. This can mean making \u201cshort-term sacrifices\u201d to do what\u2019s best for the organization 20 or even 30 years down the road. \u201cThis long-term perspective allows us to stay true to our values, foster a strong culture, care for people and remain dedicated to our mission of creating a better world.\u201d\n\nTaking this long-term perspective, Hauer identifies three primary shifts in the world of work that will most impact HR strategy as leaders plan for the next 10 years:\n\n1. Changing employee skills\n\nThe still-materializing post-pandemic workplace will continue to shift in the coming years, creating the \u201cbiggest challenges\u201d HR will face, Hauer says. Among them will be a talent pool that is less adept at interpersonal communication, potentially impacting the leadership pipeline.\n\n\u201cWith so many people in hybrid roles coming out of the pandemic, it\u2019s going to continue to be challenging to find individuals who know how and are willing to lead and handle difficult in-person conversations,\u201d she says.\n\n2. Work location preferences\n\nAs remote and hybrid work settings have risen in the last few years, so too has employees\u2019 resistance to commuting or relocating for work. These shifts, Hauer says, will continue to challenge talent leaders in the coming years.\n\n\u201cOvercoming this challenge, especially when seeking individuals with global experience, will be essential,\u201d she says.\n\n3. The need for values-driven leadership\n\nWhile HR leaders of the future will need to stay keyed in to industry trends, especially as these trends rapidly shift in the next decade, Hauer says, principles can\u2019t get lost in the pursuit of success.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d she says, \u201cthis means staying true to SC Johnson\u2019s culture and values, clearly positioning them as unique and desirable to attract the right talent that makes our company special.\n\nRelated: Read more HR strategy insights from the 2024 Fellows of the National Academy of Human Resources.",

The organizers had to delay the weekend\u2019s opening race, originally set to feature the women\u2019s novice category. The new start time for the youngest women\u2019s group is now scheduled for 11 AM, with their race taking place alongside the juniors.\n\nIt was a freezing cold night in Heusden-Zolder. As a result, the track is currently covered in such a thick layer of ice that it\u2019s impossible for the earliest category of riders to hold a proper race. Specifically, the section of the circuit where the start and finish area is located has turned into an ice rink. The organizers are currently working to clear the ice. \" Efforts are currently being made to clear the start/finish area of ice,\" said the organizers in a press statement.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it should be possible to clear the asphalt so that the race can continue. \"The organization doesn\u2019t want to take any risks,\" reported Sporza. \"The overall slipperiness isn\u2019t too bad,\" but caution is being prioritized. To ensure safety, time is being taken to spread salt so that the riders can safely race in their quest for the Belgian title.\n\nRead more below the X message!\n\n\"We\u2019ve organized a World Cup here in worse conditions\"\n\nThe course was already extremely slippery on Friday. A Sporza reporter on site shared that several minor accidents had occurred. \"It\u2019s really very slippery. I\u2019ve nearly slipped several times and have already fallen once. Right now, it\u2019s impossible to cycle on.\" Course builder Koen Monu elaborated on the issue. \"The problem is that the tarmac of the race circuit is very porous. So, we can only use biological granules for de-icing. Traditional road salt is a no-go here. If we use it, it seeps too deeply into the surface and causes the asphalt to bulge. The Zolder circuit was completely resurfaced a few years ago, and we want to respect that.\"\n\nAs a result, the organizers were already working from 5 AM to prepare the circuit, with plans to finish by 9 AM. \"That shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\" Monu said at the time. However, things are not going according to plan. \"We\u2019ve organized a World Cup here in worse conditions before. At that time, all races across all categories went ahead as scheduled. It\u2019s dangerous now, but everyone working here knows how slippery it is and is being cautious.\" Earlier this week, images of a snow-covered track were already making the rounds.",

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCaterpillar Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Andrew R. Bonfield, for US$6.4m worth of shares, at about US$333 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$361, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of Andrew R. Bonfield's holding.\n\nIn the last twelve months insiders purchased 1.15k shares for US$391k. But insiders sold 49.96k shares worth US$17m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Caterpillar shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nCaterpillar Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Caterpillar recently. In total, insiders sold US$5.6m worth of shares in that time. On the other hand we note Independent Director Gerald Johnson bought US$40k worth of shares. The share price has moved a bit recently, but it's hard to argue that the selling is a positive.\n\nDoes Caterpillar Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Caterpillar insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$333m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Caterpillar Tell Us?\n\nThe stark truth for Caterpillar is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Caterpillar is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Caterpillar. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Best as the essence of a ceremony Thursday morning at the company\u2019s visitors\u2019 center in downtown Peoria.\n\n\u201cWhat he said was, \u2018While we constantly look towards the future to the innovations of tomorrow, an occasional reflective pause to pay tribute to the work of the past regenerates our determination to succeed in the task yet undone,\u2019\u201d said Fosburgh, the company\u2019s manager of the corporate archives.\n\nMore than 300 people were on hand at the ribbon-cutting for the new interactive Heritage Gallery exhibit as Caterpillar kicked off its celebration of its 100th year in business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about our people, and our people have been innovating for 100 years. That ends up in customer success, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d said Henry Vicary, CAT\u2019s director of guest and community relations. \u201cThere\u2019s so many memories unlocked here, so many people can come here now and through our technology, interactive screens, connect with something that\u2019s important to them.\u201d\n\nVicary said the exhibit serves as a tour through CAT\u2019s history, from the 1920s through today.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to trace Caterpillar all the way back to the Holt [Manufacturing] and Best [Tractor] companies when they merged in 1925 all the way through today. And what\u2019s neat about this exhibit now it\u2019s changeable, because we can grow as our history grows right with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFosburgh said his team spent more than a year assembling the state-of-the-art exhibit, which includes \u201cover 20 three-dimensional artifacts\u201d and many more images and documents from the company archives in Mossville.\n\n1 of 3 \u2014 250109 CAT exhibit 2.jpg Guests at a ribbon-cutting ceremony gather in front of the giant wheels of a Caterpillar equipment vehicle on display in the Heritage Gallery at the company's Visitors' Center in downtown Peoria.

Joe Deacon / WCBU 3 of 3 \u2014 250109 CAT exhibit 4.jpg Caterpillar manufacturing equipment vehicles are on display in the Heritage Gallery at the company's visitors' center in downtown Peoria. Joe Deacon / WCBU\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s over 200 digital assets that kind of fall under five themes: One is people, CAT milestones, also the great projects that our machines have worked on, to employee innovation,\u201d said Fosburgh. \u201cAnd my favorite one is what we\u2019re calling \u2018From the Vault,\u2019 which are kind of sub-collections from our archives that show anything from images from companies that we\u2019ve acquired and their history, to things like building the Panama Canal.\u201d\n\nJohn Morris, president and CEO of the neighboring Peoria Riverfront Museum, praised the new CAT exhibit as another draw to the area.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of one of the greatest manufacturers in the history of the world, and no matter where their headquarters is located, they are always going to have Peoria as their hometown,\u201d said Morris. \u201cSo to have this story told here at the Caterpillar Visitors\u2019 Center and juxtapose with the next door neighbors of the Riverfront Museum, it\u2019s just really an honor.\n\n\u201cThis company has been extraordinarily important for not only the jobs, but the culture of invention here, the amount of intellectual property, the breakthroughs that are literally helping the world build its infrastructure that helps lift up the global population. It\u2019s really a remarkable story.\u201d\n\nCAT retirees Roger Birky and Rosemary McCullough, who both started working as hosts when the visitors\u2019 center opened in 2012, had the honor of cutting the ribbon to open the exhibit.\n\nVicary said the visitors\u2019 center attracted more than 46,000 visitors from all 50 states in 2024, and they\u2019re expecting to top that this year with centennial-themed events planned for each month.\n\n\u201cPeoria is an important place to us, and we really, really feel like this is an important part of the fabric and the DNA of Caterpillar,\u201d said Vicary, whose sentiments Fosburgh echoed.\n\n\u201cWhat I think this says to Peoria is, a lot of the people who built this [company] \u2013 right? \u2013 they\u2019re documented in this exhibit,\u201d said Fosburgh. \u201cI think people will be very excited to see the many things, like maybe the equipment they worked on building, to some of the projects they were part of.\n\n\u201cWe always say that artifacts tell great stories, and great stories inspire. And I think that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s experience will be.\u201d",

Through it all, we\u2019ve learned that true disaster relief isn\u2019t just about removing debris or restoring power. It\u2019s about helping communities come back stronger.\n\nThe Right Tools and Commitment\n\nIn the wake of a disaster, Caterpillar machines are often the first on the scene, helping make way for residents and rescue teams. But it\u2019s the people behind those machines\u2014our customers\u2014who push forward, often in the very communities where their own lives have been disrupted. When China\u2019s Chunthang River dam failed during severe flooding in 2021, a Cat customer used our equipment not only to control the waters but also to reinforce the structure, building a stronger defense for nearby villages in future storms.\n\nPowerful Protection for Communities\n\nPlanning ahead can make all the difference when catastrophe strikes. Through Cat Rental Power solutions, we help communities keep vital services operational\u2014so even if the power grid fails or critical infrastructure is damaged, people can rely on hospitals, water treatment plants, schools and other crucial operations to keep running. Our dealer network collaborates with local leaders to plan for emergencies, ensuring their community is ready to face the next storm with confidence.\n\nLocal Presence, Global Support\n\nWith more than 150 Cat dealers across 190 countries, support is close by whenever and wherever it\u2019s needed. Our dealers aren\u2019t just passing through\u2014they\u2019re rooted in the communities they serve and committed to helping their neighbors in need. A deep local presence means our dealers understand each community\u2019s unique needs, so they can respond quickly and appropriately to deliver essential support.\n\nPurposeful Philanthropy\n\nOur commitment to disaster recovery is a financial one as well. Through the Caterpillar Foundation, we support communities with critical funding that encompasses both immediate response and long-term resilience. Over the years, we\u2019ve contributed millions to initiatives like the American Red Cross\u2019s Annual Disaster Giving Program, which helps prepare communities long before adversity strikes. This proactive support helps ensure that people have the resources to recover more quickly and rebuild with confidence.\n\nBuilding Back Better\n\nFor 100 years, Caterpillar has stood alongside communities in crisis. As natural disasters grow more frequent and intense, that commitment remains steadfast. We\u2019ll continue to provide the tools, resources and support that help people regain hope, rebuild their lives and create stronger, more resilient communities. Because we know recovery isn\u2019t just about restoring what was lost \u2014 but about building back better.",

I am your guy at griffin@rvamag.com.\n\nThe Camel\n\nFriday, January 10th\n\nTennishu, Marshall Family Values, Dropheads, Caterpillar Trap\n\nI first became hip to Tennishu through his feature on MFV\u2019s 2024 record, Chateau de Marshall (more on that later). He wields an impressively captivating ambiance, blending the fluidity, expression, and freedom of jazz with the power, directness, and righteousness of hip hop. With each listen, I continue to uncover complex strengths born from such defined influences. The result is living and breathing\u2014each song has a hip-hop heartbeat with fluid, jazzy blood bringing life to the ends of skilled fingertips.\n\nBack to Chateau de Marshall. This was one of the most interesting records to come out of 2024. The second MFV album details a fascinating and intricate world condensed into a grand lodge, where relationships, time, and life are explored through heartbreakingly relatable characters. Sonically, the album is a promised land of milk and honey, with incredible diversity in genre and influence, wholeheartedly leaning into a bit of everything.\n\nDropheads are three releases deep and have earned a well-deserved, great response. Their most recent tune, \u201cHigh Roller,\u201d is a moody surf rocker that makes you feel like a sexy detective\u2014and if that isn\u2019t the sign of good music, I couldn\u2019t tell you what is.\n\nCaterpillar Trap is new to me, but after just a minute of listening, I was hooked. My initial thought while listening to Millennium SB was of a modernized Taxi Driver soundtrack, which I mean as high praise, as it\u2019s one of my favorite scores of all time. \u201cConniption Fit\u201d is another standout track, with an almost Vulfpeck-esque bounce.\n\nGallery5\n\nSaturday, January 11th\n\nRoughshod, Shagwuf, Rikki Rakki, Girlspit\n\nFrom the mountaintops: new Roughshod. Immediately, the vocals are going to grab you on this one. I really like the line, \u201cyou cannot ignore,\u201d as it perfectly sums up this new track. It\u2019s all intensely unavoidable\u2014you cannot look away from the mesmerizing roll of the bass or the hypnotizing effect of the vocals. Roughshod has become a significant part of the college rock scene, and I think Ocean Deep is going to solidify that reputation even further. This is easily my favorite track of theirs so far, and with the strong reputation they have live, this will be a show worth seeing.\n\nShagw\u00fcf was the first band I ever saw live in RVA, so they\u2019ll always hold a special place in my heart. I\u2019ve talked about them before, so I won\u2019t harp, but they remain one of the most dynamic, exciting, and, above all, fun groups to play the area.\n\nRikki Rakki isn\u2019t folk, but they almost maintain a folk-like identity in my mind. Sonically, they land somewhere between Courtney Barnett and Goat Girl, but so much of their presence is rooted in spirit, and you can\u2019t deny that after even a quick listen to the life in their vocals.\n\nAs for Girlspit, I\u2019ve got one word: sick. I have more than that, but this trio is just so sick. I love the subtle synth and the steady march of the rhythm section. I\u2019ve heard great things about their live shows, and I\u2019m excited to hopefully confirm all the good rumors.\n\nThe Broadberry\n\nSaturday, January 11th\n\nThe Mitras, Twin Films, Dayfiction, Flora and the Fauna\n\nNew Mitras is always a good time. The Mitras at the Broadberry is always a good time. This is my favorite Mitras track yet\u2014put simply, it rips. This one is truly anthemic, with a punchy, staccato chorus. They\u2019ve nailed that early punk sound, almost reminiscent of the Buzzcocks, but without feeling dated. It\u2019s clear they were raised on bands like Jimmy Eat World and similar influences. This is their fifth single in the past year, so I dare ask\u2014when are we getting an album?!\n\nTwin Films has also been on a roll with great releases, including Bleary-Eyed Township, which dropped at the start of December. Their last few songs have felt very down-to-earth and personal. This track takes an almost stripped-back, kick-focused turn around the two-minute mark, creating one of my favorite Twin Films moments.\n\nWe are still talking about releases as we turn to Blurry World by Dayfiction, the first LP by the young sticks of dynamite. They are off that post-Brexit core of post-punk groups like Shame, Just Mustard, and Idles. They have held a consistent place in my Spotify recently listened list.\n\nFlora and the Fauna have hunkered down a nice selection on Bandcamp, where they have compiled some real bangers. I don\u2019t think college radio is its own genre anymore, but I think they fit along the legends of R.E.M. and the tail eras of The Replacements.\n\nBrand New MUSIC Videos FROM RICHMOND\n\n\u2018Beauty & The Beast\u2019 by milesisbae\n\nRichmond-based artist milesisbae has released the video for Beauty & The Beast, a track that\u2019s already racked up over 14,000 streams on SoundCloud. Produced by WegoneBeOk, known for collaborations with Nettspend and Glokk40spazz, recorded in a home studio on Clay Street.\n\nThe video, out now on YouTube and Instagram, mirrors the song\u2019s unpolished intensity, capturing the restless, underground energy that defines Miles\u2019s new updated sound. Catch the stream of Beauty & The Beast on SoundCloud and be on the look out for the new album later this year. \u2014 Anthony\n\n\u2018NUMBER THREE\u2019 by Fan Ran\n\nRichmond producer and foundation cast member of Gritty City Records, Fan Ran has been quietly dropping dimes for a while now, and this week he hit us with another. Laced with his signature touch, this introspective throwback track dives into a relationship hitting the wall\u2014hard, like NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Sr. It\u2019s raw, reflective, and exactly the kind of storytelling Fan Ran does best. \u2014 Anthony\n\nTracks We\u2019re Spinning\n\n\u2018Lucky Stars\u2018 by Doc Straw and the Scarecrows\n\nI will always appreciate adding a nice little string section. This driving track meets indie and folk with one man\u2019s perception on it all. The lyrics express all the hardship of the past and the gratefulness of making it to this point in life, and the driving chord progression matches that semi sweet feel.\n\nRICHMOND SHOW LIST!\n\nJANUARY 2025\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nALLIANZ AMPHITHEATER\n\nSaturday, 6/21 Dwight Yoakam BUY TICKETS\n\nSaturday, 7/19 Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit BUY TICKETS\n\nWednesday, 8/6 Styx & Kevin Cronin + Don Felder BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 8/29 Alison Krauss & Union Station Featuring Jerry Douglas BUY TICKETS\n\nMonday, 9/22 \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic: Bigger & Weirder 2025 Tour BUY TICKETS\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nRICHMOND FUNNY BONE COMEDY CLUB\n\n\n\nFriday, 2/14 \u2013 Saturday, 2/15 Anthony Rodia BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 2/21 \u2013 Saturday, 2/22 Steven Ho BUY TICKETS\n\nSunday, 2/23 Geoffrey Asmus BUY TICKETS\n\nTuesday, 2/25 Steve Hofstetter BUY TICKETS\n\nThursday, 2/27 Brad Upton BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 2/28 \u2013 Saturday, 3/1 Funny Marco BUY TICKETS\n\nWednesday, 3/5 Calimar White aka Agent Ratliff BUY TICKETS\n\nThursday, 3/6 Jermaine \u201cFunnymane\u201d Johnson BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 3/7 \u2013 Saturday, 3/8 Nick Swardson BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 3/14 \u2013 Sunday, 3/16 Godfrey BUY TICKETS\n\nWednesday, 3/26 Peter Antoniou BUY TICKETS\n\nFriday, 3/28 \u2013 Saturday, 3/29 Dave Attell BUY TICKETS\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n\n\nEMBER MUSIC HALL\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nTHE BROADBERRY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP SHOWS\n\nAll shows are at The Broadberry unless otherwise noted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nDOMINION ENERGY CENTER\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nALTRIA THEATRE",

            "content": "I recently received this update from the Maine Forest Service on the status of the browntail moth caterpillar.\n\nBrowntail caterpillars will remain in their winter webs for now\u2026\n\nThroughout the winter season in Maine, browntail caterpillars are nestled inside of their winter webs they created in late fall. These winter webs can be found on the tips of the branches of their host trees, typically oak, birch, cherry, crabapple, and other fruit and hardwood trees. Winter webs made by browntail caterpillars have a distinct white silk covering that protects them from the harsh Maine winters.\n\nNow through March is the best time to go out and begin scouting for winter webs on your property. A sunny day makes for a good scouting day, as the white silk of the winter webs will shine back at you \u2013 a good indication of a browntail winter web. Sometimes, oak and hawthorn trees hold onto marcescent leaves, which are dead leaves that haven\u2019t yet fallen off the tree, which can be confused for browntail webs.\n\nMaine Forest Service surveys cannot be exhaustive. The most important populations of browntail moth that may affect your daily life in the spring and summer may not be found by these surveys.\n\nBrowntail moth experienced a drastic population reduction in 2024. That means aerial survey only highlighted scattered small areas of concern. Trace to moderate populations may be found throughout a large area of the state. Small numbers of webs can produce enough caterpillars to cause an itchy spring and summer.\n\nBy recognizing webs in winter, you can respond to their presence and reduce impacts in spring and summer.\n\nScouting for webs is an important first step in understanding browntail moth populations your backyard.\n\nPick a sunny day for scouting to make the webs easier to spot.\n\nPrioritize trees that surround your home, driveway, porch, play areas, etc.\n\nConsider scouting for winter webs around your business, especially in areas where browntail moth caterpillars may emerge from winter webs in the spring and crawl onto vehicles (such as parking lots), or impact outdoor activities (such as picnic/break areas, near walkways and buildings, etc.)\n\nStand with your back to the sun about 50-100 ft. away from the base of the trees.\n\nYou may want to stand closer if scouting for webs on shorter, ornamental trees.\n\nCheck for clumps of leaves at the tips of branches.\n\nOn cloudy days, these leaves may appear brown or gray, but on sunny days, you\u2019ll be able to see a white silk covering on these leaves.\n\nBrowntail winter webs will not be larger than the palm of your hand (roughly 3 \u2013 5 inches long) and are typically narrow in width.\n\nIn heavily infested trees (trees with 100+ winter webs), like the ones in the enclosed photo, winter web removal may not be appropriate. Instead, pesticide applications may be considered if these trees are in a high-traffic area such as your dooryard or the front of your business building.\n\nIf you can\u2019t remove the browntail winter webs on your property, consider hiring a professional to assist with removal. Winter web removals should be completed before the end of March.\n\nWhat we\u2019re working on this winter:\n\nBrowntail populations have declined in 2024. To understand the full extent of the reduction in browntail, we will continue our winter web survey starting in January 2025. These surveys are usually completed in March. After the data is reviewed, it will appear on our interactive browntail moth dashboard, which will give you a rough idea about what browntail is doing in your community.\n\nA Patriots observation\n\nThe NFL season has ended for the New England Patriots with a 4-13 record.

            "content": "Monarch butterflies are among the most beloved insects in North America. They are brightly colored and unique, both as caterpillars and later as mature insects. Monarchs are found in every U.S. state except Alaska, so nearly everyone has seen a monarch flutter by on a warm day.\n\nDuring their incredible yearly migration, monarchs travel each fall to a few forested areas in central Mexico and coastal California to overwinter. These are special places, cool enough that butterflies don\u2019t burn too much energy, but warm enough that they don\u2019t freeze. At the sites, huge clusters of butterflies drape the trees in one of nature\u2019s most photogenic spectacles.\n\nBecause monarch butterflies are widely distributed and recognized, their conservation status often is oversimplified.\n\nOver the past 40 years, the number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico has declined by as much as 80%, and the number of monarchs overwintering in California has fallen by over 95%, probably due to multiple causes. In response, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is proposing to protect monarchs as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The agency is soliciting public comments on this proposal through March 12, 2025.\n\nWe are among the many entomologists who study the ecology of insects, including monarchs; our focus has been on the butterflies\u2019 recent health and how their numbers are changing through time. In our view, some parts of the actions that have been proposed to reverse their decline are likely to be helpful. Other aspects, however, might only make the situation worse.\n\nFewer monarchs overwintering\n\nListing a species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act means that it is nearing, but does not yet face, imminent extinction. The main basis for the proposal to list monarchs as threatened is that researchers are seeing fewer of the butterflies each year at their overwintering sites.\n\nThere\u2019s little debate that the monarch\u2019s epic yearly migration is in trouble. Analyses of fall-migrating monarchs collected through the Journey North program, in which citizen scientists report the number and location of large groups of monarchs resting in trees at night during their southward trip, show that the number of monarchs traveling to Mexico fell by 80% or more between 2007 and 2023.\n\nIt is not clear why monarchs are failing to migrate, but there are several possible culprits. They are vulnerable to a single-celled parasite called Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, or OE, which can cause wing deformation, reduced size, decreased flight endurance and impaired mating. Infection rates in monarchs have dramatically increased in recent years.\n\nStudies have also found that large numbers of migrating monarchs are killed by cars. Climate change is altering weather patterns during the monarch breeding season, producing weather extremes that can kill traveling monarchs or put them out of sync with the flowers they need to survive. Finally, with warmer weather, some monarchs are simply staying put year-round without migrating.\n\nYet there is growing evidence that monarchs are doing fine in the summer throughout much of their breeding range, where they mate, lay eggs and grow the generation that will eventually head south in the fall. In a 2022 study, we analyzed counts of monarch butterflies during the North American Butterfly Association\u2019s annual butterfly counts, when private citizens gather around the Fourth of July each year to record butterfly sightings all across North America. Surprisingly, we found no overall change in the number of monarchs over the past few decades.\n\nEchoing our finding, other scientists conducted a genetic analysis in 2023 that also found no evidence of population decline in monarchs, or in common milkweed, the butterflies\u2019 main larval host plant. They did this by comparing observed patterns of genetic variation with thousands of simulated datasets mimicking different scenarios of population growth or decline. In fact, clearing of forests for agriculture over past centuries appeared to have created more habitat for the plants and insects.\n\nHow can monarchs be doing so well in the summer but so poorly in the winter? We believe the likely answer is that monarchs have an incredible ability to rebound during the breeding season. Like many other insects, a single female monarch can lay hundreds of eggs. And because milkweed still is readily available, monarchs appear to be able to bounce back each year despite fewer numbers of overwintering butterflies.\n\nThis would explain why observers still see monarchs each summer in every state of the continental U.S. Such a broad distribution is very different from an endangered species such as the black-footed ferret, which is found in only a few isolated locations.\n\nOptions for restoration\n\nWhen a species is added to the Endangered Species List, federal regulators develop a recovery plan \u2013 effectively, a road map for recovery. It may include steps such as conserving and restoring habitat that the species uses, removing invasive species that prey on it, or breeding the threatened species in captivity and releasing it into the wild.\n\nWe see the Interior Department\u2019s proposed steps to help monarchs as a mixed bag.\n\nUsefully, the listing would legally protect the groves of trees near the California coast where western monarchs overwinter. The eastern monarch population\u2019s overwintering grounds in Mexico are already protected, and it is a sensible step to take similar action in California.\n\nOther aspects of the listing are more worrisome. The proposal notes that private citizens have a unique opportunity to help rescue a threatened species by raising butterflies \u2013 but this could be counterproductive.\n\nOne issue is that the most widely available milkweeds at local plant nurseries often are tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) and other nonnative species. Many volunteers could plant these milkweeds, intending to help create habitat for monarchs. But these exotic versions don\u2019t die back in the fall like native milkweeds, so their presence could confuse monarchs into thinking it\u2019s not yet time to migrate. And these plants\u2019 longer flowering times could allow OE parasite spores to build up on their leaves.\n\nCaptive-raising monarchs in cages also puts the butterflies at risk. The OE parasite can reach very high levels in indoor butterfly houses. And captive-raised butterflies often are too stunted to migrate, probably because they are weakened by heavy parasitic infections and questionable genetics.\n\nRestoring monarch habitat along the butterflies\u2019 migration routes, planted with native plants, can help more monarchs reach their overwintering grounds.\n\nFocus on migration routes and wintering zones\n\nIn our view, the most effective way to help monarchs would be to concentrate on the parts of their lives where the butterflies are clearly struggling: fall migration and overwintering. Conserving overwintering sites and planting appropriate types of flowering plants along fall migration routes can help more butterflies survive the journey. Private citizens can make valuable contributions to these efforts.\n\nHowever, research suggests that planting milkweed in the monarchs\u2019 summer range is not needed, and that captive rearing is likely to be harmful.\n\nFocus on migration routes and wintering zones\n\nIn our view, the most effective way to help monarchs would be to concentrate on the parts of their lives where the butterflies are clearly struggling: fall migration and overwintering.

Our concern is that the public could be encouraged to ignore scientific findings and take actions that may harm these incredible and inspiring insects.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The 74 hp (55 kW) engine includes a zero-service diesel particulate filter (DPF) and does not require diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). A 115 hp (86 kW) option for the TH0842, TH1055, and TH1255 models also uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology.\n\nThe telehandlers offer three operator station options: open canopy, enclosed cab with heat and enclosed cab with heat and air conditioning. The redesigned interior features an ergonomic control layout, standard tilt steering column, and a new full color LCD monitor that provides machine information in a choice of four languages \u2013 English, French, Spanish or Portuguese.\n\nThe monitor also shows the standard rearview camera feed when in reverse and depressing the camera soft key enables continuous viewing of the camera image. Additional standard equipment includes the standard operator presence seat switch to prevent machine operation when the operator is not seated. The optional Load Stability Indication (LSI) system provides visual and audible alerts to the operator regarding forward machine stability while handling a load.\n\nThe pilot-controlled joystick ensures a smooth, predictable multi-function performance and feel of the boom extend/retract and lift/lower functions. Customers now have a choice of coupler interface; the IT or Standard TH. Smaller and lighter weight than the IT style coupler, the new Standard TH quick coupler offering delivers improved fork visibility and enhanced load capacity when used with the boom extended. The next generation Cat Telehandlers also feature standard auxiliary hydraulics to support hydraulically powered Cat attachments.\n\nTo assist with fuel economy and minimizing idle time, Cat Telehandlers are equipped with a configurable engine idle shutdown feature.\n\nThe monitor in the Cat Telehandlers features a standard multi-operator code security system, supporting up to 50 operator codes to protect against machine theft and unauthorized use at the jobsite.\n\nThe new TH models feature extended service intervals and a patent-pending service tool for quick inspection of chains and boom wear pads. The boom sections, mainframe, stabilizer frame and stabilizer legs are covered by a 5-year, 5,000-hour warranty.\n\nEquipped with Product Link Elite standard telematics, the system provides critical machine operating information for fleet managers. Remote flash capability allows for software updates without a trip to the dealer\u2019s shop, and remote troubleshooting provides real-time diagnostics, along with remote machine parameter and setting changes.\n\nCaterpillar will display the next generation Cat Telehanders at World of Concrete 2025 in booth C6061.\n\nTarget availability for these next generation telehandlers is Q2 2025.",

            "content": "A video of bugs coming out of strawberries submerged in saltwater became a viral sensation on TikTok. The video raised a lot of questions, including: What are these wormy bugs? Why are they crawling out of strawberries, and is fresh fruit safe to consume?\n\nThe bugs are technically a type of fly maggot that infest ripe berries and go unnoticed because they feed on the berries from the inside. However, you won't find worms in all strawberries; if you do, washing your fruit may only eliminate a few of the worms. Here's what else you need to know.\n\n\n\nWhy Are Bugs in Berries?\n\nStrawberry and small fruit crop entomologist Sriyanka Lahiri, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, told Health that the tiny whitish worms are the maggots of a fly, commonly known as spotted wing drosophila (SWD). \"It's an invasive species from East Asia that infests berry crops and has been in the USA since 2008,\" explained Lahiri.\n\nThe SWD is attracted to yeast and sugar water solution, which is used as a monitoring device in berry production, said Lahiri. Also, what sets the SWD fly apart from the common fruit fly is its ability to lay eggs inside undamaged ripe berry fruits. The SWD fly has a serrated egg-laying device called an ovipositor.\n\nAfter the female SWD lays eggs inside ripening fruit, the eggs will hatch, allowing the maggots to feed on the fruit. As a result, they can go undetected and sometimes make fruit unsellable.\n\n\n\nIn addition to strawberries, SWD is a common pest for blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and cherries. While most berry crops are susceptible to SWD, this doesn't mean all berries\u2014strawberries included\u2014are hosts for SWD.\n\nHow Common Is It?\n\nThere isn't an exact or estimated percentage of how often worms are found in strawberries, but the occurrence is common enough. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has contamination guidelines for each type of food\u2014including how many bugs or how much mold is allowed to be inside the foods. However, there doesn't seem to be anything on the FDA website concerning bugs inside strawberries.\n\n\n\nWhat Other Types of Bugs Are in Berries?\n\nIn addition to the SWD fly and its maggots, several other pests can be found in strawberries and other berries.

As a result, pest management focuses on monitoring and preventative control tactics to get rid of the adult flies. Management recommendations vary depending on the type of infestation but often involve clearing away infested plants and using insecticides to protect the fruit, as necessary.\n\n\"The goal is not to let the females lay eggs on the fruit,\" said Lahiri. \"Timely picking of ripe fruits, removal of rotting fruits, and burial of damaged fruits are good cultural practices to control SWD because these flies are attracted to a fermenting fruity smell.\"\n\n\n\nAlso, an excessive amount of pesticides would be needed to follow a zero maggot/grub tolerance policy in food, \"which is neither environmentally friendly nor beneficial for human health,\" explained Lahiri. \"Having pesticide residue on our food versus having to ingest some extra animal protein can be considered as a fair trade-off.\"\n\nThe bulletin on SWD management said to monitor fields with traps and check the traps weekly, starting from the development of fruit until the end of harvest. If SWD is detected, the recommended management strategies include:\n\n\n\nCultural control methods, such as pruning\n\nHarvest interval decreases\n\nLeftover fruit removal to keep the plant clean\n\nUse of exclusion netting to physically block pests from fruit\n\nUse of insecticides (National Organic Program compliant for organic fruits) as needed\n\nHow Do You Remove Bugs From Strawberries?\n\nLahiri strongly recommended washing strawberries\u2014and all other fresh fruits and vegetables\u2014before eating them. However, since the maggots live deep inside the fruit, washing won't get rid of them entirely.\n\n\"Staying submerged in water might force a few of them out,\" said Lahiri. Incidentally, Lahiri isn't aware of any benefits of adding salt to the water like in the TikTok video, though Lahiri hasn't conducted any research to that end. \"Also, I am not sure the fresh strawberry taste will remain the same after being submerged in saltwater for too long,\" added Lahiri.\n\nAre There Any Health Risks if You Eat the Bugs?\n\nThere's no proof that consuming a few maggots with your fruit has any negative health effects\u2014and people have probably been doing it for centuries. \"Although the sight of translucent worms crawling out of a fresh strawberry fruit might not be appealing, there are no known ill effects of eating them,\" said Lahiri. \"In fact, if you accidentally consumed some maggots, all you did was get some extra animal protein in your salad or fruit shake.\"\n\n\n\nA Quick Review\n\nIt is common for bugs to make their way into fruits. However, that doesn't mean bugs in fruit will harm you; there is no evidence that worms in strawberries have any negative impact on your health. The reality is that in most cases, fresh market produce and stored grains have some amount of insect infestation that is impossible to get rid of. Yet, preventative measures can help reduce bugs in produce.",

Some of the toys are available for purchase on Amazon. Petco also sells pet supplies, food, services, and companion animals in the United States. The company was founded in 1965 and has its headquarters in San Diego, California.\n\nA Quick Look at Leaps & Bounds Cat Toys\n\nPros Cats love the toys\n\nCats love the toys Made from durable materials so cats can\u2019t destroy them\n\nMade from durable materials so cats can\u2019t destroy them Not overly loud or disturbing\n\nNot overly loud or disturbing Wide variety of options Cons Expensive\n\nExpensive Batteries are hard to install in certain toys\n\nBatteries are hard to install in certain toys Batteries don\u2019t last long\n\nBatteries don\u2019t last long Many toys don\u2019t work on carpet\n\nRecall History\n\nTo date, there are no documented recalls or injuries from Leaps & Bounds cat toys.\n\nReviews of the 3 Best Leaps & Bounds Cat Toys\n\n1. Leaps & Bounds Wiggle Bug Cat Toy \u2013 Our Favorite\n\nThis battery-powered cat toy moves and vibrates to encourage active play and stimulate your cat\u2019s natural hunting instincts. The toy requires two batteries to operate and is best used on flat floors or hard surfaces. It is made from a rubber material, so it is quite durable. The Wiggle Bug Cat Toy stands up to scratching, chewing, and pouncing. While it can\u2019t be immersed in water, it is easily wiped off for cleaning.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wiggle Bug does not move much, even on a flat floor. It mostly vibrates in place. It seems to be hit or miss for cats. Some love the toy, while others are scared of it. The batteries last a reasonable amount of time and only require changing every few months, as long as you are diligent about shutting the toy off after playtime is over. However, some customers report that the battery compartment requires an eyeglass repair screwdriver to open and that the batteries are difficult to change out.\n\nPros Interactive toy\n\nInteractive toy Easy to clean\n\nEasy to clean Batteries last a long time Cons Batteries are hard to change\n\nBatteries are hard to change Some cats are scared of it\n\nSome cats are scared of it Doesn\u2019t move much\n\n2. Leaps & Bounds Pounce & Play Bell of the Ball\n\nThis bumpy-textured bell cat ball is a bell enclosed in a rubber cage frame. It comes in multiple colors to suit your preferences and bounces unpredictably to keep your cat guessing.\n\nThe Leaps & Bounds Pounce & Play Bell of the Ball is a great choice if you are looking for a simple but durable toy for your cat. The rubber outside stands up to extensive amounts of rough play, and the bouncing offers exercise and mental stimulation, as no two play sessions are the same. The price of this toy is reasonable too, so you won\u2019t have to break the bank to get it.\n\nThe only complaint is that this ball gets lost easily. Since it bounces in any and every direction, it easily goes under furniture and hides in the most unexpected places.\n\nPros Durable\n\nDurable Offers exercise and mental stimulation\n\nOffers exercise and mental stimulation Inexpensive Cons Easy to lose\n\nEasy to lose Can be noisy\n\n3. Leaps and Bounds Caterpillar Cat Teaser\n\nThe Leaps and Bounds Caterpillar Cat Teaser is a great way to get your cat some exercise via swatting and pouncing at this toy. Being a cat teaser, it does require you to play with your cat, so it is not a hands-off toy. But most cats seem to love teasers, especially squirmy ones like this caterpillar.\n\nIt\u2019s made from non-toxic materials as well and is super affordable. The teaser is 33 inches long and has feathers on the end which will further entice your cat to play. However, over time, the feathers are likely to come off which may not make it as exciting for cats anymore.\n\nPros Encourages your cat to swat and pounce\n\nEncourages your cat to swat and pounce Made from non-toxic materials\n\nMade from non-toxic materials Squirmy motion and feathers entice play Cons Feathers can come off over time\n\nWhat Other Users Are Saying\n\nWalmart: \u201cLeaps & Bounds toys are extremely expensive when ordering outside of the Petco website.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaps & Bounds toys are extremely expensive when ordering outside of the Petco website.\u201d Petco: \u201cLeaps & Bounds electronic toys don\u2019t stand up the way that they should, and the toys are cheaply made.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaps & Bounds electronic toys don\u2019t stand up the way that they should, and the toys are cheaply made.\u201d As pet owners, we always double-check Amazon buyers\u2019 reviews before buying something. You can read these by clicking here.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we give Leaps & Bounds cat toys a 3.0/5-star rating. The Petco brand has innovative ideas for its toys and a wide range of products that are designed to encourage exercise and mentally stimulate your cat. Unfortunately, most of the products fall short in terms of durability and functionality. Customer reviews indicate that some toys are worth the money, while others aren\u2019t, so it is important to shop carefully. The Leaps & Bounds interactive and electronic toys in particular seem to be lacking.",

ConsMin stated: \u201cThis incredible achievement reflects the dedication, expertise, and teamwork across our procurement, asset management, health & safety, load & haul, and mobile maintenance teams.\u201d\n\nThe XCMG trucks join the existing fleet of Caterpillar 6020B excavators, 992K wheel loaders, 16M graders, D10t & 854K dozers, plus 777G dump trucks & 777F water carts. The mine has also just added a 400 t class mining excavator to further boost productivity.\n\nConsMin is a mid-sized mining company headquartered in West Perth, Western Australia. The key asset is the Woodie Woodie manganese mine located in the Pilbara Region, approximately 400 km south east of the town and port of Port Hedland. Woodie Woodie is owner-operated. The operation consists of open-pit mining across several pits and a 1.6 Mt/y processing plant.\n\nSince May 2017, the Consolidated Minerals Group has been privately owned by Ningxia Tianyuan Manganese Industry Co (TMI). The Group has operating assets in Ghana and Australia and trading companies in Jersey, supplying approximately 11% of the world\u2019s manganese ore production and approximately 19% of the demand for Chinese imports of manganese ore.\n\nConsMin is also rolling out a new tier-one Oracle ERP system, a significant move to support the operations and position them for future growth. The company states: \u201cWe\u2019re calling it Project Mangrove, inspired by the resilient mangrove tree, which thrives in challenging conditions while anchoring and sustaining its environment. This project is all about building a strong foundation for business stability, adaptability, and long-term success. The transition to Oracle will bring many benefits, including streamlined processes, improved data accuracy, and enhanced financial management, all while aligning us more closely with our global colleagues.\u201d",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nTwo rare female whales have been documented off the coast of Florida, each with a calf, marine surveyors said.\n\nThe 20-year-old whale mothers, named Blackheart and Caterpillar, were seen Dec. 30 near Ponte Vedra Beach, a suburb of Jacksonville, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Research Institute.\n\nIt's Caterpillar's first baby and the second for Blackheart, who last gave birth 12 years ago, the FWC said.\n\nWhile biologists celebrate the calves of the highly endangered species, with an estimated 370 left in the wild, these births are evidence of a worrying phenomenon of right whales giving birth less often than in the past, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.\n\n\"Three years is considered a normal or healthy interval between right whale births,\" according to NOAA. \"But now, females are having calves every seven to 10 years, on average. Biologists believe that the stress caused by entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with boats and ships is one of the reasons that females are calving less often or not at all.\"\n\nFor years, whale watchers have been calling Caterpillar a potential mother. But she's been hit by at least one vessel, which gave her a long scar on one side that biologists worried would make it harder for her to accommodate a pregnancy. Another female with a similar scar died during pregnancy, the FWC said in 2020.\n\nCaterpillar and Blackheart have both been seen swimming in the Southeast waters for about a month before they were spotted with calves, surveyors said.\n\nBut they're not the first whales to travel to Florida with their babies this calving season. Another female right whale with a calf was documented near Amelia Island on Dec. 9, McClatchy News previously reported.\n\nThis time of year, the FWC advises boaters to look out for right whales, which keep a \"low profile\" and sometimes don't make much disturbance on the surface of the water.\n\n2025 The Charlotte Observer.

            "content": "GUJARAT : Fifteen years ago, in the humble town of Talaja, Gujarat, a group of schoolgirls from Navkar Mantra Girls High School embarked on a unique journey of environmental education. On their way to school, they would collect caterpillars from local agricultural fields and bring them to the classroom to raise and observe.\n\nOnce the caterpillars hatched into butterflies, the girls would release them into the wild, all the while learning valuable lessons in plant conservation and wildlife protection. This was more than a simple school project\u2014it was the seed of a profound passion for nature, planted by their dedicated teacher, Ruchi Dave.\n\nToday, Ruchi is a beacon of environmental conservation, serving as the Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) with the Gujarat Forest Department. The journey of Ruchi Dave, a teacher turned forest officer, is a testament to how one individual\u2019s commitment can inspire a community and ignite significant change.\n\nAfter dedicating 12 years to teaching, Ruchi made a bold decision in 2016 to leave the classroom behind and join the Gujarat Forest Department.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, her love for nature and education found expression in a new endeavour: she has published Aapna Patangiya (Our Butterflies), a book about butterflies, in Gujarati. Packed with over 700 images and illustrations, this 424-page masterpiece has become an instant success, captivating the hearts of readers and furthering her mission of nature conservation.\n\nFor Ruchi, the core of environmental protection lies in community engagement. \u201cConservation is only possible when people understand the importance of nature and are actively involved in its preservation,\u201d she explained in an interview with TMS.\n\nRuchi\u2019s work in education laid the foundation for her future conservation efforts. After completing her doctoral research on the endangered Gyps vulture species of Gujarat\u2019s Saurashtra region, Ruchi began working on vulture conservation in the coastal areas of Bhavnagar and Amreli districts.\n\nIn 2016, Ruchi\u2019s transition to the Gujarat Forest Department marked a new chapter. She was trained at the Central Academy for State Forest Services (CASFOS) in Coimbatore, where she deepened her understanding of environmental conservation.",

            "content": "Proliferation of a fungus caused browntail moth populations to crater in 2024, which likely means that Maine residents will get relief from the forest pest this spring and summer, scientists said.\n\n\u201cI am cautiously optimistic about a less itchy summer,\u201d said Angela Mech, a University of Maine assistant professor of forest entomology who studies the browntail moth.\n\nWhen they come into contact with people, the microscopic hairs of the browntail moth caterpillars cause a red, itchy rash that can last for weeks. The hairs can also cause respiratory problems, especially in people with chronic conditions such as asthma.\n\nIn areas of high infestations \u2014 which in past years included Yarmouth, Brunswick, Freeport and cities and towns further up the Midcoast \u2014 the hairs, which can penetrate clothing, were difficult to avoid, as the wind dispersed them widely. Deering Oaks park in Portland also experienced heavy infestations in the early 2020s.\n\nTypically, the worst part of the year for contracting the rash is mid-May to late June. Maine pharmacies make homemade anti-itch compounds to try to provide relief.\n\nThomas Schmeelk, Maine Forest Service entomologist, said that the state tracks defoliation caused by the caterpillars, and saw it plummet from 46,000 acres in 2023 to 2,000 acres in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchmeelk said weather conditions in both those years \u2014 primarily rainy springs \u2014 helped boost the population of the fungus, entomophaga aulicae, and also a virus that attacks the caterpillars.\n\nSchmeelk said the extent of the population plunge was a \u201clittle bit surprising,\u201d but the pathogens had ideal weather conditions to attack the caterpillars over the past two years.\n\n\u201cSometimes it can take multiple years in order to crash the population,\u201d Schmeelk said.\n\nMech said faculty and students have been monitoring and researching browntail moth populations in Orono for years, and this summer they saw the fungus devastate local populations.\n\n\u201cThe fungus ruined our experiments because we ended up with a lot of dead caterpillars,\u201d Mech said.\n\nUMaine was trying to study how long the caterpillars could go without feeding. Mech said there was some evidence that caterpillars avoid eating leaves from trees treated with BTK, a biological, environmentally-friendly insecticide. If they avoid eating the leaves, would they die of starvation? Or could they survive and go back to eating the leaves once the BTK had dissipated from the leaves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrowntail moth caterpillars tend to feed on leaves of fruit, oak, birch, elm and poplar trees.\n\nMech had also previously pointed to how \u201czombie caterpillars\u201d from fall 2023 could have helped reduce populations in spring 2024. Caterpillars infected with the fungus in the fall become carriers, and it \u201czombifies\u201d them. The \u201ccrawling dead\u201d will then carry the fungus to winter nests that are being built. When a new population of caterpillars emerges in the spring, those that come into contact with the dead caterpillars may pick up the fungus.\n\nThe university is also researching whether a pheromone can be used to disrupt the mating patterns of browntail moths, another way to control the population.\n\nBrowntail moth populations typically go through a boom-bust cycle that lasts 10-12 years, and 2024 was considered the ninth year of the current outbreak. So in year 10, 2025, it appears likely that Maine will enter a \u201cbust\u201d cycle for the browntail moth.",

Collodi that first appeared in serial form in 1881 in the Giornale dei bambini (\u201cChildren\u2019s Magazine\u201d) and was published as a book in 1883. It tells the story of the little marionette who wants to be a real boy, and it is perhaps best known as the basis for the 1940 Disney film .\n\nSummary\n\nA poor man named Geppetto wants to carve himself a marionette in order to make a living as a puppeteer. He is given a piece of enchanted wood, and as soon as Geppetto carves the puppet, which he names Pinocchio, it begins abusing the old man. Once its feet are made, Pinocchio runs away, and Geppetto is arrested when he seizes the puppet. Pinocchio returns to Geppetto\u2019s home alone, and when the Talking Cricket admonishes him, Pinocchio kills the cricket. Going his own way, and ignoring all advice, Pinocchio soon falls in with a variety of bad characters, particularly the Fox and the Cat, who scheme to steal the five gold pieces Pinocchio was given for Geppetto. Eventually, the Fox and the Cat, disguised as Assassins, hang Pinocchio in order to get the gold pieces.\n\nHowever, the Fairy with Azure Hair saves Pinocchio at the last moment. When Pinocchio lies to the Fairy about the gold pieces, his nose grows comically long. Later, Pinocchio again falls in with the Fox and the Cat, who trick him out of his gold pieces. Eventually, Pinocchio finds the Fairy again and comes to live with her as her son. Twice he begins attending school, and twice he allows himself to be led astray, the second time resulting in his becoming a donkey. After further adventures, Pinocchio is swallowed by the Terrible Shark and finds Geppetto living in the shark\u2019s belly. Pinocchio rescues his father and thereafter takes care of him. The Fairy then turns Pinocchio into a real boy.",

In comparison, the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the S&P 500 have risen 11.5% and 25.9%, respectively, in the same period.\n\nCAT\u2019s 1-Year Price Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCaterpillar has also outpaced peers Komatsu KMTUY, Terex Corporation TEX and The Manitowoc Company MTW.\n\nOngoing Challenges Faced By Caterpillar\n\nWeak Volumes Trends in Construction & Resource Industries: Caterpillar had been witnessing a decline in overall volumes in four consecutive quarters, reflecting subdued consumer spending amid the inflationary scenario. Both Construction Industries and Resource Industries have faced volume declines recently due to lower equipment sales to end users, dragging their revenues and profits. This has been somewhat offset by improved performance in the Energy & Transportation segment.\n\nCaterpillar expects 2024 revenues to be slightly lower than its prior expectations. It had initially forecasted revenues to be \u201cslightly lower\u201d than the record $67 billion reported in 2023. Despite the tepid revenue expectations, the adjusted operating margin is expected to be higher than CAT\u2019s targeted range, aided by its cost-saving and restructuring actions.\n\nThe company maintains its revenue guidance at $42-$72 billion. According to the revenue levels, margins are expected between 10% and 22%, as shown in the chart below.\n\nWeak Demand in China: Due to the slowdown in China's real estate industry, its construction industry has taken a hit. Caterpillar is expected to continue to see weak demand for the 10-ton and above excavator market in China, which had previously been one of its largest markets.\n\nProlonged Contraction in the Manufacturing Sector: The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index registered 48.4% in November, marking its eighth month in the contraction territory (with a reading below 50%).\n\nThe New Orders Index was 50.4% in November, crossing the 50% mark for the first time since March 2024. It remains to be seen whether this will be sustained as the Index has struggled to deliver consistent growth since the end of its 24-month expansion streak in May 2022.\n\nCAT Sees Downward Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nReflecting the abovementioned headwinds, earnings estimates for Caterpillar have moved down for 2024 and 2025 over the past 60 days.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nKey Factors That Will Drive Caterpillar\u2019s Future Growth\n\nDespite current market weakness, CAT\u2019s strong market presence, diverse product portfolio and focus on innovation position it improved performances going forward. The U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act presents significant opportunities for Caterpillar\u2019s construction equipment. The transition to clean energy is expected to drive demand for commodities, boosting sales of Caterpillar\u2019s mining equipment. Miners are now shifting toward autonomy to increase productivity, safety and efficiency. CAT\u2019s focus on enhancing its autonomous fleet will provide a competitive edge.\n\nIn Energy & Transportation, strong order rates in most applications are expected to support revenues. In the Oil & Gas sector, the increased focus on sustainability will drive the demand for CAT equipment. As technology companies establish data centers globally to support their generative AI applications, Caterpillar is witnessing robust order levels for reciprocating engines. It is planning to double its output with a multi-year capital investment.\n\nCAT has also witnessed growth in aftermarket parts and service-related revenues, which generate high margins. It is on track to double its service revenues from $14 billion in 2016 to $28 billion in 2026.\n\nCAT has a projected long-term EPS growth rate of 9.3%, higher than the industry\u2019s 2%.\n\nCAT Offers Sector-Leading Dividend Yield & Returns\n\nThe company has a five-year dividend growth rate of 6.9%. CAT's 1.57% dividend yield is higher than the sector\u2019s yield of 1.41% and the S&P 500\u2019s 1.22%. CAT has a payout ratio of 24.15%, higher than the industry\u2019s 23.51%. The company has paid higher dividends to shareholders for 30 straight years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index.\n\nCAT\u2019s Return on equity \u2014 a profitability measure of how prudently the company is utilizing its shareholders\u2019 funds \u2014 is 59.1%, higher than the sector\u2019s average of 22.2% and the S&P 500\u2019s 30.15%.\n\nHow to Play the Caterpillar Stock?\n\nCAT\u2019s long-term demand prospects remain supported by increased infrastructure spending, energy-transition trends and growth in data centers. Focus on growing service revenues should help it maintain an upbeat performance. The company is also returning value to shareholders through consistent dividend payments.\n\nThe average price target on CAT suggests a 9% increase from its last closing price of $359.77. The highest target of $515, representing a potential gain of almost 43%. This indicates that current shareholders holding onto their shares could see significant benefits if the stock trends upward as projected.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile Caterpillar remains an attractive investment for long-term investors, its efforts to combat the challenging landscape will be crucial. Prospective investors may need to carefully evaluate the current valuation, but for existing shareholders, retaining this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in their portfolio will be a wise decision.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

(more)\n\nKushner grew up in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and attended Columbia University and New York University. His early plays include La Fin de la Baleine: An Opera for the Apocalypse (1983), A Bright Room Called Day (1985), Yes, Yes, No, No (1985), and Stella (1987). His major work, Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, consists of two lengthy plays that deal with political issues and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s while meditating on change and loss\u2014two prominent themes throughout Kushner\u2019s oeuvre. The first part, Millennium Approaches (1990), won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for best play; the second, Perestroika (1991), also won a Tony Award for best play. Angels in America proved to be extremely popular for a work of its imposing length (the two parts run seven hours in total), and it was adapted for an Emmy Award-winning television film that aired in 2003.\n\nKushner\u2019s subsequent plays include Slavs! (1994); A Dybbuk; or, Between Two Worlds (1995), an adaptation of S. Ansky\u2019s Yiddish classic Der Dibek; Henry Box Brown; or, The Mirror of Slavery (1998); and Homebody/Kabul (1999), which addresses the relationship between Afghanistan and the West. He also wrote the book for the musical Caroline, or Change (1999). His unfinished Only We Who Guard the Mystery Shall Be Unhappy, written in response to the Iraq War, was performed in a number of readings in 2004, and his translation of Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children was staged in New York City in 2006. Kushner\u2019s The Intelligent Homosexual\u2019s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures (2009) is a naturalistic drama about an extended family of intellectuals dealing with their patriarch\u2019s desire to die by suicide.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Children\u2019s Books Quiz\n\nIn addition to his work for the stage, Kushner contributed screenplays to Steven Spielberg\u2019s films Munich (2005; cowritten with Eric Roth), Lincoln (2012), and The Fabelmans (2022; cowritten with Spielberg), all of which earned Kushner Academy Award nominations. He also wrote the script for Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story (2021).

During the pitch, Laura and Rose presented their innovative tortilla chips made from a mix of corn, beans, and cricket flour, highlighting the sustainability and nutritional benefits of their product.\n\nAd\n\nThe entrepreneurs sought a $100,000 investment in exchange for 7% equity, but ultimately secured a deal with Mark Cuban for $100,000 in exchange for 15% equity. However, not all Sharks were convinced with Chirps' potential. Lori Greiner questioned the use of cricket flour. Rose explained that the cricket flour added protein and healthy ingredients to the chips.\n\nShark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary expressed concerns about Chirps' ability to compete in the multi-billion-dollar snack industry. He warned that established companies would \"crush\" them, likening them to insects.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n\"The snack business is a multi-billion dollar franchise... I really am concerned. And I say this on deals where you're trying to steal share from a very old, established market. They're gonna crush you like the cockroaches you are,\" stated the Shark Tank investor.\n\nHowever, Rose and Laura seemed prepared for O'Leary's reaction and remained optimistic about their product's unique selling points.\n\nAd\n\nJourney of Chirps before and after Shark Tank explored\n\nAd\n\nBefore appearing on Shark Tank, Laura D'Asaro, co-founder of Chirps, had a life-changing experience while studying abroad in Tanzania. According to the brand's website, Laura was an African Studies major back in collage and was introduced to entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, when she tried a fried caterpillar from a street vendor.\n\nDespite initial hesitation, she was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, likening it to lobster. She told Verdict UK during an interview released on January 22, 2019:\n\nAd\n\n\u201cIt was a fried caterpillar, by a street vendor. So I bought the fried caterpillar, was a little hesitant, because you know I\u2019d never eaten a bug before and I grew up a vegetarian. But I ate it and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it tasted like lobster.\"\n\nD'Asaro's encounter with the caterpillar sparked her curiosity about why insects were not commonly consumed in the US. She began researching the sustainability and health benefits of entomophagy, determined to find a way to make insect-based food more palatable to American consumers. Through her research, D'Asaro identified the \"ick factor\" as a major barrier to adoption.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nShe sought to develop a product that would allow consumers to reap the benefits of insects without having to confront the reality of eating whole bugs. The solution came in the form of cricket flour, which enabled consumers to conceptually understand the benefits of insects without being confronted by their physical form.\n\nDuring their appearance on Shark Tank, Chirps' founders emphasized that their product stood out in a crowded market, with no other cricket-based chips available. They also highlighted the free press they received due to their use of cricket flour. When Sharks inquired about their funding history, Rose revealed that they had bootstrapped their business by winning pitch competitions, securing over $200,000.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nMark Cuban seemed intrigued by this prospect, likening it to a protein mix or shake. Ultimately, he extended an offer to Chirps, investing $100,000 in exchange for a 15% stake in the company, which Laura and Rose accepted.\n\nCurrently, Chirps seems to be functioning as their official website (eatchirps.com) is still running and offering products like cookies, protein powder, apparel, and books. Even though the company has 18.4k followers on Instagram and 5.8k followers on Facebook, they are not active on these platforms as their last post was uploaded on December 1 and February 28, 2022, respectively.\n\nAd\n\nShark Tank is currently airing season 16 on ABC.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Could this be a consequence of global change, including climate change, the intensification of agriculture, and urbanisation?\n\nWe need more citizen scientists to monitor what is really going on. Insect populations, even species that seemed impervious, are in decline globally. Monarch butterflies exemplify the problem. Once a very common species, numbers have declined dramatically in North America, engendering keen public interest in restoring populations.\n\nThe monarch butterfly is an iconic species. It is usually the species people recall when drawing a butterfly and observations are shared frequently on the online social network iNaturalist.\n\nThis is partly because monarch images are used in advertising, but the butterflies are also a species of choice for school biology classes and television documentaries on animal migration.\n\nMonarchs in the southern hemisphere\n\nThe monarch butterfly\u2019s ancestral home in North America is noted for an annual mass migration and spectacular overwintering of adults in fir forests in a few locations in Mexico, at densities of 50 million per hectare, and at multiple sites in Southern California. These sites are monitored to track the decline.\n\nWhat is not as well known is that this butterfly greatly extended its range, spreading across the Pacific in the mid-1800s to reach Australia and New Zealand by riding on storms that blew in from New Caledonia.\n\nThe species is now part of the roadside scene in these countries and was once known as \u201cthe wanderer\u201d \u2013 reflecting its propensity to fly across the landscape in search of milkweed plants (known as swan plants in New Zealand). In both countries, monarchs lay eggs on introduced milkweed species for their caterpillars to feed and develop. They take up the plant\u2019s toxins as part of their own defence.\n\nInterestingly, in their expanded range in the southern hemisphere, monarchs have adapted their migration patterns to suit local conditions. They have established overwinter sites \u2013 places where large numbers of adults congregate on trees throughout winter.\n\nNeed for citizen science\n\nIn Australia, the late entomologist Courtenay Smithers organised people to report these sites and participate in a mark-recapture programme. Essentially, this involves attaching a small unique identifying tag to the wing, noting the age and condition of the butterfly and the date and location of capture.\n\nIf the same individual is then recaptured sometime later and the information shared, it provides valuable data on survival and the distance and direction it moved, and even population size. This volunteer tagging programme enabled many aspects of the monarch\u2019s ecology in Australia to be documented, but it was discontinued a few years ago.\n\nMoths and Butterflies Australasia now hosts the butterfly database and has become an umbrella group for encouraging everyone with a mobile phone to get involved and report and record sightings.\n\nA similar programme is run in New Zealand by the Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand Trust. Monarch overwintering sites and local breeding populations have been documented over the years. Alas, these data sets have been short term and haphazard.\n\nWhat is intriguing is that populations appear to have declined in Australia and New Zealand, perhaps reflecting climate variability, expanding cities gobbling up local breeding habitats, and the intensification of agriculture.\n\nWhat we need is reliable long-term data on adult numbers. Hence the call to reinvigorate interest in mark-recapture and reporting. We need the help of people who love the outdoors and love the monarch butterfly to become citizen scientists.\n\nThe Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand Trust is asking individuals, groups and schools to tag monarch butterflies late in the autumn when the butterflies head for their overwintering habitat. This is a great project for schools, involving students in real science and addressing an environmental issue.\n\nEach tag has a unique code. A computer system calculates the distance the monarch has flown and the time it took to get there. This information can then be collated with weather data to get a clearer picture of what is happening.\n\nWe hope people will spot tagged monarchs in their gardens and record where the butterfly was sighted, together with its tag number.\n\nMyron Zalucki, Professor in Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The calf later died from injuries in a December vessel collision.\n\nPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Two new right whale calves were spotted off the coast of Ponte Vedra Beach on Monday, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.\n\nTwo female whales and their newborn calves were spotted swimming off the coast of the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve on Dec. 30 by aerial survey teams.\n\nNamed \"Caterpillar\" and \"Blackheart,\" the whales are both 20 years old, FWC said. For \"Caterpillar,\" the calf is her first.\n\nBoth were sighted in the Southeast US calving grounds earlier this winter, FWC said. Both were pegged as \"potential mothers,\" and have been swimming around the area for the last month.\n\nEarlier in December, another right whale, named \"Minus One,\" and her newborn calf were spotted off the coast of Amelia Island.\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale is among the most endangered of the world's large whales, according to marine life experts. There are only about 500 of them that remain in the western North Atlantic population. It's not unusual for right whales to be spotted this time of year in Florida waters, with sightings typical between November and April.\n\nSo far this year, there haven't been many sightings in Florida, but researches believe them to be present or moving into the area. They maintain a \"low profile and are often difficult to spot despite their enormous size.\"\n\nTwo additional adult females have been sighted in Florida recently near Mayport. Four other sightings have occurred around the border of Georgia and Florida.\n\nProtecting right whales: After Georgia deaths, feds advance broadened protection for North Atlantic right whales\n\nFrom 2023: Whale, hello there! Florida researchers spot first right whale calf of the season off SC\n\nMarine life conservationists have a special interest in these whales because their only known calving ground is located off the coasts of Georgia and Florida. Expecting mothers travel from northern feeding grounds to this area to give birth.\n\nThese waters are designated by the National Marine Fisheries Service as a right whale critical habitat.\n\n\"This designation provides more protection for right whales while they are in calving grounds,\" FWC's website says. Because of this, national researchers, along with scientists from Florida, Georgia and New England, conduct aerial surveys to locate the whales during calving season.\n\nThe information collected during these surveys are then relayed to mariners \"in an attempt to prevent vessel-whale collisions.\"\n\nFloridians and beach visitors can play a role in preserving these animals. Because of their coastal nature, they're often visible from the beach. Citizen sightings can also help researchers relay information to mariners.\n\nIf you ever see a right whale, you're urged to report it to the Marine Resources Council hotline (1-888-97-WHALE or 1-888-404-FWCC).\n\nHow to spot a right whale\n\nRight whales do not have a dorsal fin and instead have a \"large, flat back.\"\n\nThey're dark gray or black and have \"bumps\" called callosities on their head, according to FWC.\n\n\"The callosities appear white due to the presence of cyamids, or whale lice, that often congregate on the callosities,\" officials said.\n\nThey can get up to 55 feet long, and an adult can weigh up to 50 tons. A newborn calf can measure 15 feet at birth and weigh up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nWhat boaters should know about right whale calving season\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife provides these tips for mariners:\n\nUse WhaleMap.org to monitor the seasonal presence of right whales in your area.\n\nCheck for signage at your local boat ramp or marina as a reminder of what to look for and how to identify and report right whale sightings.\n\nAvoid boating in the dark, when visibility is poor, or in rough seas.\n\nGo slow, which can give you time to react.\n\nPost a lookout to watch for black objects, unusual or persistent whitewater, and splashes.\n\nIf a whale is spotted, slow down, operate at a slow speed or put your engine in neutral if possible. Assess the scene and slowly leave the area while keeping watch. Never pursue or follow a whale.\n\nThis story was first published by First Coast News.",

Become one.\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale is among the most endangered of the world\u2019s large whales, historically depleted by commercial whaling, vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglements. Just about 370 North Atlantic right whales remain, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOne of the calf sightings was with Caterpillar, a 20-year-old adult whale. The calf is believed to be her first.\n\nThe other mother, named Blackheart and also 20, was seen with her second calf. She last gave birth 12 years ago during the 2013 calving season.\n\nThe right whale Blackheart and her calf were sighted on Monday, Dec. 30, 2024, off Ponte Vedra Beach. This is the second calf for the 20-year-old whale. | Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\n\nThe two adults had been sighted earlier this winter in the Southeast U.S. calving grounds and were identified then as \u201cpotential mothers,\u201d FWC says. Right whales have been sighted all along the Eastern Seaboard in recent weeks, the agency said.\n\nCoastal waters off Florida and Georgia are the only known calving area for them. The area is designated as a right whale critical habitat, and aerial surveys track the huge mammals\n\nWind and water conditions can hamper those efforts, however, so scientists are increasing efforts to track the whales in other ways, especially in the Southeast, where the whales migrate to give birth this time of year, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the weather in December, January, February doesn\u2019t always let flights happen,\u201d said Catherine Edwards, a researcher at the University of Georgia\u2019s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. So she and her team are using tools to listen for whales underwater, which can happen no matter the weather or time of day.\n\n\u201cThe biggest success we had from last year is we have the very first confirmed passive acoustic detection of right whales south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nAnyone who spots a right whale is asked to report it to (877) 942-5343 (WHALE-HELP), or to whalemap.org.",

            "content": "The shipping industry has been watching the dual-fuel engine choices made for newbuildings as an indicator of what many see as an uncertain fuel future.\n\nIn December, DNV\u2019s Alternative Fuels Insights platform counted 27 ammonia and 322 methanol-fueled vessels currently on the orderbooks.\n\nMethanol has raced ahead of ammonia, which currently lags in both engine and regulatory development.\n\nAs the years tick by, 2025 is here and 2030 is rapidly approaching, eyes are now turning to the existing fleet \u2013 to the potential for engine retrofits.\n\nAgain, methanol is ahead of ammonia. The high-profile retrofit of the Maersk Halifax to a dual-fuel methanol vessel last year led Maersk to pre-orderthe conversion of an additional 10 vessels.\n\nAlso last year, Hapag-Lloyd and Seaspan Corporation announced plans to retrofit five container ships to dual-fuel methanol for a total investment of around $120 million.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the internationally trading fleet acting on retrofits. Caterpillar Marine plans to offer an upgrade kit for its methanol-fueled, dual-fuel Cat 3500E series engines. In a recent interview with Rhonda Moniz, Will Watson, global product manager at Caterpillar Marine, said methanol is more diesel-like than other fuels and requires less modification than hydrogen or LNG. This makes it perfect for small ships with space limitations, like tugs.\n\nMore engine options are on the way as part of the Netherlands-based MENENS project. TNO has begun methanol testing on its one-cylinder test bench as part of the development of NIM\u2019s methanol retrofit solution which is being designed to fit a wide variety of engine brands and types.\n\nStill, ammonia's appeal is that it is carbon free and could be zero-emission if made from hydrogen produced with renewable electricity. It has been chosen by companies such as NYK, MOL, Berg Bulk and MISC.\n\nAnd in September 2024, the world\u2019s first ship-to-ship transfer of ammonia between vessels at anchorage in a working port environment took place. Yara hailed it as a significant step towards realizing ammonia as a shipping fuel and enabling bunkering worldwide.\n\nOrders are increasing. In 2025, the first ammonia-fueled marine engines will be delivered, with a further surge in orders likely as the industry gains experience, says Lloyd\u2019s Register.\n\nAmmonia can be used directly as a fuel, cracked to produce hydrogen or blended with other fuels such as hydrogen and methane.\n\nStill, both methanol and ammonia engines are behind LNG in the race for market share. Speaking to Greg Trauthwein in the December issue of Maritime Reporter magazine, Sameer Kalra, President, Marine, Alfa Laval, said: \u201cTwo years ago, everyone was clamoring for solutions around methanol and ammonia. But today, everyone recognizes that in the short to medium term, clean fuels, green methanol, green ammonia, are not available at scale.\u201d The industrial supply chain behind ammonia is not ready, and the narrative has shifted back to LNG as a fuel.\n\n\u201cNeither I, nor you, nor anyone has this crystal ball to say which fuel is going to be the future fuel in the world,\u201d said Kalra. \u201cQuite possibly there will not be a one-size-fits-all (fuel solution). I don\u2019t see ammonia going on a cruise ship which is carrying 3,000 passengers; nor do I see small product tankers going to Sandakan in Malaysia and having green methanol available in the storage tanks.\u201d\n\nIn a recent editorial for Maritime Reporter, Robert Kunkel, President of naval architect and marine engineering firm Alternative Marine Technologies, noted that, on the larger US domestic blue water deep draft fleet, the choice continues to be LNG for recent container ship contracts and deliveries, both foreign and domestic.\n\n\u201cWe determined early on that LNG was a transition fuel. That said, the transition period was difficult to predict and still is. With global alternative fuel infrastructure still in question, LNG will be here and available well beyond the near future,\u201d said Kunkel.\n\n\u201cWith the federal election and a change in the administration, many are wondering what direction the U.S. maritime sector will take as voluntary carbon credits are discussed and fossil fuels move back into the driver\u2019s seat. We may see ammonia being discussed only on the back of a household clean agent bottle and not being burned in your internal combustion engine.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

The Flexmobile - affectionately called \"Old Flex\" - has been a key part of Braemar Mountain Rescue Team efforts since 1985. Over the years, it has helped to rescue numerous hillwalkers and climbers, as well as providing shelter for its crews during treacherous conditions. It was also called in to help recover casualties after the Lockerbie bombing claimed 270 lives four days before Christmas in 1988, when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up while flying from London to New York.\n\nThe rescue vehicle is affectionately called \"Old Flex\"\n\nFor four decades, the flexmobile has played a crucial role in the work of the Braemar Mountain Rescue Team. Equipped with caterpillar treads, the six-tonne (6,000kg) emergency vehicle has tackled some of the toughest of terrains and weather conditions.\n\nJohn Drysdale, president of the Braemar Mountain Rescue Team, first got behind the wheel of Old Flex in 1987. \"It can make the difference between life and death for a casualty, but also the well-being of the rescuers themselves,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"If we're in deep snow - we have passed snow ploughs before - and certainly when we get up into the high mountains, she's very, very effective. \"We have a second one which we got in 2006, which is slightly bigger. But this is the old favourite \u2013 she's been through an awful lot of stuff with the team, both on the hill and off the hill. \"We've used her both on the hill in rescues and searches and I've helped rescue motorists stuck in snow. There's very little that stops her. She can handle just about everything that's thrown at her.\"\n\nJohn Drysdale, of Braemar Mountain Rescue Team, said Old Flex was very effective\n\nRecalling Lockerbie, Mr Drysdale said: \"We were called out after the disaster in Lockerbie. \"We drove down overnight and two of us went straight up to Tundergarth, where the cockpit came down. \"And later that day we recovered casualties from the hill. \"We gave them a bit of respect. It was done as professionally as we could. \"And it's like everything else in mountain rescue \u2013 we were bringing people home to their loved ones.\"\n\nBraemar Mountain Rescue Team Rescues often have to be carried out in difficult conditions\n\nEarlier this year, Old Flex was taken to South Queensferry to be filmed as part of a new drama series about the Lockerbie disaster, starring Colin Firth. However, after almost 40 years, it is now time for Old Flex to go out of service. Its place of retirement will be Glenshee Ski Centre, where manager David Patterson knows its history and says it will be well looked after.\n\nDavid Patterson is manager of the Glenshee Ski Centre",

            "content": "Polished red nails, frizzy mini braids, striped shirt on a damp skin, scented candles, reflections of a dreamy sunset on an oiled skin, rustling leaves, dancing bushes, chatty trees, vintage white wine, burning weed, lips as blush as a newly bloomed pink rose bud, whistling wind, empty eyes gradually filling up with tears, hopes, new dreams, and a round of applause replaying in my mind because my hands are too weak.\n\nEvery year I think of myself as a caterpillar who metamorphoses into a beautiful butterfly, and each butterfly is stronger and more beautiful than the one that precedes it. This year is no different. I've been in situations, met and been with people that nibbled on the edges of my sanity, forced cups of indifference down my throat and threw me into an ocean of depression. The depression came in waves, some stronger than the others. But just like every other time I scaled through.\n\nBeyond scaling through I found myself trying out new things, exhausting opportunities, and adjusting my lifestyle. Journaling, emailing, dieting, traveling, clubbing, exercising, networking, skin care, hair care, expanding my niche, and other intimate details. Even though this year was anything but tender towards me, it came with rebranding, refinement and highlights.\n\nOne of my favorite highlights was writing, emailing and receiving intimate love letters from a tight-scheduled veterinary doctor in Ibadan. A man I have no physical memory of. We have never met in person, we were connected through a volunteer project last year. Days reeled into weeks and eventually months before we started conversing informally, and then I realized how much depth he had, a refined man, my kind of man. Without concealing, he adored me, I'm certain because I could feel it my body, and see it in his warm smiles and gestures. In one of his letters he told how he had to sneak in his phone into the decontamination room because he knew I would have written back and he couldn't wait to read.\n\nI also travelled all the way down to see a lover in Owerri. It was a beautiful time filled with laughter, cooking, intimacy, eating, and relaxing. I think the first lover to match my social energy and heighten my ambition to want more out of life.\n\nAnd of course my favorite highlight of the year was signing out of school. Finishing a four year course is no small feat. Especially, considering the difficulties I had to overcome before getting a degree. I had gotten admission in 2019 to study combined arts in the University of Nigeria Nsukka even though I desperately wanted to study law. Combined arts wasn't the course I wanted but I still received it with open arms because I wanted to resume with my peers and friends. I resumed classes but had to stop and apply for a refund for my school fees because I didn't exactly qualify for the admission. It was a really trying time for me but then God in all his mercy and love helped me scale through. On 17th December I finished a four year course on History and International studies. It can only be God.\n\nOf course all of this would also be impossible without my amazing friends \u2013 Ihu baby, Chief, Egoyibo, Munny, Titi, Bimbim, Genny, Tony, Soso, Qc and a few more. And to my beautiful family who in every possible way they could, helped me. This year I experienced beautiful intimate friendships, particularly with God. Without Him nothing would be possible. My names, KOSISOCHUKWU and NWADIUTO now connotes a new definition in my life and in the way I live it.\n\nI'm so so thankful for this year, and for everything it brought, especially my loyal readers. I really can't wait to see how next year turns out.\n\nGoodbye for now \u2764 \ufe0f.\n\nRecommend Diuto's open diary to your readers\n\nAll I do is paint vivid imaginations with my storytelling.

            "content": "Proteomics and transcriptomics are complementary techniques82. Changes in immune, cytoskeleton and ECM molecules were found in both the proteomics and transcriptomics results using two different methods of assessing network connections (e.g. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and S5), giving us confidence that these networks are altered during parasitism.\n\nAs predicted, we found that: (1) systemic immune activity increased immune activity in the brain of M. sexta, and (2) immune activity within the brain increased dramatically with the change in host behaviour. These results support the hypothesis that enhanced immune activity in the caterpillar brain is playing a role in the change in host behaviour. (3) Changes in CcBV gene expression and protein abundance correlated with the appearance of the \u201cbodyguard\u201d phenotype. This correlation suggests that polydnaviruses may play a role in parasitic manipulation of host behaviour. (4) Changes in genes and proteins important for intracellular transport and the ECM suggested that synaptic transmission could be reduced in \u201cbodyguards\u201d. This hypothesis was consistent with our finding of a reduction in descending neural activity from the brain after wasp emergence.\n\nControlling the ECM and cytoskeleton may be important for parasitic manipulators. The ECM83and cytoskeleton84 contribute to neuronal homeostasis. Manipulating the ECM and neuronal cytoskeleton may be a novel method of circumventing neuronal homeostasis, leading to long term changes of neural circuits. Many manipulated hosts from different parasite-host systems exhibit altered cytoskeleton and/or ECM dynamics in the host\u2019s brain (e.g. jewel wasp/cockroach9; trematode/crustacean85; gordian worm/crustacean86; Hairworm/grasshopper87, cestode/ant88). The need to overcome homeostatic mechanisms will be especially important for parasitic manipulators that require their hosts to survive for several days in the altered state. Multi-targeted interventions appear to allow parasitic manipulators to achieve effective, predictable and long-lasting control of the host\u2019s brain.\n\nMethods\n\nAnimals\n\nAll studies were performed on Manduca sextalarvae obtained from our in-house colony, and were maintained as described previously31.\n\nCotesia congregata were obtained from an in-house colony. Mated adults were given 3rd instar M.sexta (Proteomics, transcriptomics, late-stage qPCR, and electrophysiological studies) or 4th instar (early-stage qPCR) in which to lay their eggs. Parasitized M. sexta were reared on lab-made high nutrition diet (Frontier Agricultural Sciences, (#F9783B Neward, DE) until tissue extraction.\n\nAll studies were approved by the University Committee on Laboratory Animals (Dalhousie University, I-11\u2013025) and were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n\nSample sizes followed minimum guidelines for proteomics and transcriptomics68.\n\nA Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied when multiple tests were performed on the same data set89.\n\nTissue extraction\n\nCaterpillars were cooled to induce a chill coma90and dissected over ice.\n\nMethods for proteomics, transcriptomics, immune and bracovirus qPCR\n\nFinal instar (5th ) M. sexta caterpillars were sorted into five groups based on stage of parasitism: Unparasitized (Control), Pre-emergent (3 days prior to emergence of wasp larvae), Emergent (tissue collected during the emergence of wasp larvae), 1 day post emergence (1 day after emergence of wasp larvae), and 3 days post emergence (3 days after emergence of wasp larvae).\n\nThe supraesophageal ganglion or subesophageal ganglion or ventral nerve cord (thoracic ganglia + abdominal ganglia) were extracted and washed briefly in PBS (< 10 s). For transcriptomics, the tissue was placed into an empty tube and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. For proteomics, tissue was added to a tube containing protease inhibitor and then flash frozen using liquid nitrogen (cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche, Switzerland). For the qPCR assays, tissues were added to tubes containing RNAlater (qPCR) (Invitrogen, MA, USA) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All tissues were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.\n\nMethods for early-stage RT-qPCR\n\nFourth instar M. sexta caterpillars were sorted into two groups: Unparasitized (control), or 24 h post-parasitism (i.e. after wasp oviposition).\n\nTissues were collected as described above.\n\nProteomics\n\nExtraction and quantification\n\nDue to protein concentration required, 10 individuals per group were pooled to create 3 replicates per group (i.e. CNS samples from 30 individuals in total). The tissues (supraesophageal ganglia, subesophageal ganglia, or ventral nerve cords) were suspended in 30 \u00b5l of extraction buffer containing Urea 7 M, Thiourea 2 M, TrisHCl 40 mM, CHAPS 4%, DTT 1% and protease inhibitor. Samples were then mechanically homogenized on ice using a micro pestle. Samples were further disrupted using a micro-sonicator on maximum for 3 cycles of 10 s, followed by 20 s on ice. Following homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 15 800 g at 4 \u00b0C for 12 min, after which the supernatant was collected for protein quantification.\n\nA Bradford test for total protein was conducted on the samples followed by a 1D SDS PAGE on a 10% pre-cast acrylamide gel (Biorad). Gels were stained overnight using Sypro ruby protein stain (Invitrogen, Massachusetts, USA) before being visualized under UV light.\n\nProtein identification\n\nExtracted protein samples were denatured and digested in a trypsin solution. The resulting peptide solution was suspended in 10 \u00b5l of a 0.1% formic acid solution and injected into an HPLC nano debit (RSLC U3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a nanoelectrospray mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a C18 reverse-phase capillary column (0.075 mm x 500 mm, Acclaim Pepmap 100, NanoViper, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid: acetonitrile, 2\u201340%:98 \u2212 60%, at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.\n\nResulting mass spectrographs were recorded using Xcalibur 4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). These spectrographs were then analyzed using MaxQuant v1650 and Perseus v1.6.10.43 programs using the script leading FPP v3.2. As a template for protein comparison, we created four protein databases that encompassed known proteins from the family braconidae (NCBI txid 7402), the polydnavirus genus bracoviriform (NCBI txid 2946836), the species C. congregata (NCBI txid51543) and the species M. sexta(NCBI txid 7130). These datasets have been made publicly available91. A MaxQuant database was also used to reduce proteins being identified due to contamination (contaminants_fpp_180320.FASTA)92. Protein validation was conducted with a 1% false discovery rate filter at both the peptide and the protein level.\n\nRatio analysis\n\nNormalization of protein intensity signals was required to analyze the data. Individual proteins had to have been detected in all samples (all three replicates of parasitized caterpillars per group, and all three replicates of control caterpillars) to be included in the analysis. Preliminary examination of the data found that the raw intensity values were not normally distributed, therefore these values were log2 transformed prior to statistical analysis. Furthermore, the intensity values per replicate were centered using the following procedure. For each sample, the median intensity value was established taking all detectable protein intensities into account. This overall median was then subtracted from each individual protein intensity value within that sample. This process was repeated for each of the three replicates. Once the data was centered, a ratio was calculated for each protein intensity by subtracting the control group intensities from the treatment group intensities for each protein. The median ratio of the three replicates was then Z-Scored. These Z-scores were converted to p-values, and a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to determine statistical significance89.\n\nqPCR\n\nRNA extraction\n\nRNA extraction was performed using a RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All steps adhered to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and included a DNase 1 treatment (RNase-free DNaset, Qiagen) step to remove genomic DNA. The integrity of total RNA samples was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, California, USA). The purity of extracted RNA was determined using an EPOCH spectrophotometer (BioTek, Vermont, USA) using the 260/280 ratio. Only samples with a 260/280 between 1.8 and 2.4 were used in accordance with the MIQE guidelines93. The concentration of total RNA was determined using a Qubit Fluorometer (Q32857, Invitrogen, California, USA) using a HS RNA quantification kit. cDNA was synthesized using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, California, USA) and samples were stored in \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Samples sizes are given in Table 9.\n\nTable 9 Sample Group information for RT-QPCR studies. Each sample consists of CNS from a single caterpillar (i.e. CNS tissue was not pooled). Full size table\n\nPrimers\n\nPrimer efficiency (E) and correlation coefficient (R2) were estimated from a standard curve generated with 10-fold dilutions of mixed cDNA samples (Table 10).\n\nTable 10 Forward and reverse gene primer sequences for target bracovirus genes, M. Sexta immune genes and reference genes. Full size table\n\nPrimer specificity was checked by running endpoint PCR products for each primer on a 1.5% acrylamide gel. The resulting bands were excited and sent out for Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, NJ, USA). The resulting sequences were put through a BLAST search on NCBI to confirm fragment identity.\n\nReference gene selection\n\nSix candidate reference genes were investigated to select two of the most stable reference genes in our tissues of interest. These genes were used in previous studies in M. sexta caterpillars: RpL17a95 (Rewitz et al., 2006), actin98, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)99, beta-FTZ-F1100, ubiquitin94, and ribosomal protein S3101. We used NormFinder for R (http://moma.dk/normfinder-software) to determine the stability of pairs of reference genes (Andersen et al., 2004), using C q values of five biological samples per treatment for each candidate reference gene. RpL17a and ubiquitin were found to be the most stable across treatment groups and were used as reference genes in further qPCR analysis.\n\nRT-qPCR\n\nRT-qPCR was run using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 real-time system (Bio-rad) with the following parameters: 40 cycles of (95\u2103 for 10 s; 55\u2103 for 30 s; 60\u2103 for 45 s) followed by a final extension of 60\u2103 for 10 min. After the qPCR a melt curve analysis was run to assess the specificity of the qPCR product. For each biological sample, qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate, and for each gene no-template controls were run. C q values for each sample and gene target were calculated in CFX Maestro (BioRad).\n\nThe qPCR data were analysed using the REST program102 (http://rest.genequantification.info).\n\nTranscriptomics\n\nSample Group Information\n\nFor the transcriptomic analysis there were five groups of interest: Unparasitized caterpillars, pre-emergent caterpillars, emergent caterpillars, 1-day post emergence, and 3-days post emergence (see Tissue Extraction for more details). There were 6 biological replicates per group.\n\nRNA extraction\n\nRNA extraction was performed using a RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All steps adhered to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and included a DNase 1 treatment (RNase-free DNaset, Qiagen) step to remove genomic DNA.

The concentration of total RNA was determined using a Qubit Fluorometer (Q32857, Invitrogen, California, USA) using a HS RNA quantification kit. All RNA samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until library preparation.\n\nLibrary preparation and transcriptome sequencing\n\nLibrary construction and sequencing were performed at Farncombe Metagenomics Facility (McMaster University, ON, Canada). The RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA). RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq for 2 \u00d7 50 bp paired-end reads.\n\nTrimming, mapping of sequences, and differential gene analysis\n\nRaw sequencing reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic software103(v0.39), removing low quality leading and tailing bases (Q < 3) and reads below 30 bases long. Trimmed reads were aligned using STAR (v.2.7.5a)104, to either the M. sextagenome105 (JHU_Msex_v1.0), the C. congregatagenome106, or the Bracoviriform congregataegenome107(ViralMultiSegProj14556. Uniquely mapped reads with a maximum of four mismatches were counted to genes using FeatureCounts from the Rsubread R package108 (v2.4.2). First, reads were counted to features in the M. sexta genome, which resulted in an average 32 million counted reads per sample. Next, reads were counted to features in the C. congregata genome. For the C. congregata analysis, some M. sexta reads mapped to the C. congregata genome, aligning to a handful of genes in controls (e.g. LOCUS4576). To exclude these reads, C. congregata was aligned simultaneously with M. sexta and then separated during counting. We effectively found no C. congregata reads in control samples (an average of 66 counted reads), and in parasitized samples there was an average of 420,000 reads. Finally, we counted reads to features in the Bracovirusgenomes, where control samples had on average 0 counted reads, and parasitized samples had on average 9000 counted reads. Genes were pre-filtered before differential expression analysis by removing genes with < 10 counts across all samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 (v1.40.2)109, in 4 pairwise comparisons, either using the pre-emergent condition as the reference level (Pre-emergent vs. Emergent, Pre-Emergent vs. 1-Day Post, and Pre-Emergent vs. 3-Days Post), or the control (Pre-emergent vs. Control). Statistical significance was determined using a Wald test and corrected using a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons89. Differentially expressed genes were considered for further analysis with a cut-off of an FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a fold change in expression > 2.0110.\n\nTo test the robustness of the results for the both the proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we performed a second analysis using the STRING database (https://string-db.org) to identify significantly enriched terms within the protein-protein interaction network111 (Yuan et al., 2021).",

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Caterpillar's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership\n\n\n\nA look at the shareholders of Caterpillar Inc. ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Caterpillar, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Caterpillar?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Caterpillar. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Caterpillar, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Caterpillar is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 7.3% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Caterpillar\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Caterpillar Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$336m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Caterpillar. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

However, it's not time to say goodbye to buffet food just yet, with New Year's Eve just around the corner, I wanted to put some buffet essentials to the test.\n\nFor years there's been a bit of a rivalry between M&S and Aldi food, like the Colin the Caterpillar row as a prime example. I'm a massive fan of Aldi and its ability to offer quality without the price, but let's be honest, you can't beat Marks & Spencer as a treat now and then.\n\nTo me, M&S is always considered a luxurious option, so I had really high hopes for its buffet food offering. I visited my local Food Hall on the Croft Retail Park in Bromborough and picked out what was left, which was on offer at four for the price of three.\n\nREAD MORE: I picked ten best deals from Dunelm's massive 50% off end of year sale\n\nREAD MORE: Shoppers race to buy 'beautiful' bestselling Coach bag while reduced to clear at John Lewis\n\nMarks & Spencer offer a 4 for 3 deal on buffet food, so I went for the Penguin Bao Buns (which I ended up freezing) the Prawn Toast, the Coquille St Jacques and the Onion Bhaji Chicken Bites.\n\nIn total, my bill came to \u00a322.50 - which I didn't think was too bad for the amount I got, but it definitely would've been cheaper from a frozen section from somewhere like Asda. Separately, the products all cost \u00a37.50 each with the Bhaji Bites priced at a slightly cheaper \u00a35.50, so it definitely makes sense to make the most of the deal.\n\nFor my Aldi buffet, I went for the Mini Pies, the Korean Style Chicken Sliders and the Mini Beef Wellingtons. For the three items, my bill came to \u00a39.97, and although they didn't offer a deal as such, the individual prices for the products were around \u00a33/4 each which was a fair bit cheaper than the M&S selection.\n\nBut how did the quality of the buffet food compare?\n\nM&S Collection Mini Coquille St Jacques - \u00a37.50\n\nThis was definitely one of my favourite buffet food options out of all of them, as it tasted so luxurious and creamy. On the M&S website, the full product description reads: \"Tender, responsibly sourced scallops bathed in a creamy white wine sauce, topped with vintage mature cheddar and a crunchy parsley crumb.\"\n\nEven my partner loved these, which was pretty shocking because he can be really fussy. The party food felt extra special, and reminded me of dining out at a posh restaurant.\n\nFor \u00a37..50, I didn't think the price was too bad at all considering you get ten. The scallops were a good size and gloriously tasty.\n\nYou can check out the full product here on the M&S website.\n\nM&S Collection Penguin and Polar Bear Steamed Buns - \u00a37.50\n\nFilled with crisp vegetables in a rich hoisin plum sauce, I loved the look of these adorable steamed buns. I didn't end up trying these, and have frozen them for a later date, but I wanted to make the most of the deal.\n\nThe steamed buns are vegan, vegetarian and freezable and would make an adorable addition to your New Year buffet. You can check out the full product here on the M&S website.\n\nM&S Onion Bhaji Bites - \u00a35.50\n\nThese were a second favourite for me, purely because of the very moreish taste. I absolutely love onion bhajis, and to combine them with chicken is basically my dream.\n\nThe bhaji bites were crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside, and had a lot of flavour. The onion flavour wasn't too overpowering, and didn't take away the main event of the chicken.\n\nThey came with a tikka sauce which I heated up in the microwave. To be honest, the bhaji bites didn't really need the sauce in my opinion, as they were tasty enough on their own.\n\nThe chicken bites currently aren't being displayed on the M&S website but you might be able to find them at your local store if you're lucky. Find out local store here.\n\nM&S Our Best Ever Prawn Toast - \u00a37.50\n\nWithout sounding too dramatic, this prawn toast was to die for. It was the perfect size, it wasn't greasy, and it was bursting with flavour. I'm a bit of a prawn toast fiend so I absolutely knew I was going to love this, but it had a bit of a 'premium' feel about it, as opposed to prawn toast from your local Chinese.\n\nIt came with a delicious sweet chilli sauce that really complimented the prawn toast, which had a good crunch to it. It was juicy on the inside and just enough sesame seeds on top.\n\nThe ginger really came through which gave it a 'fresh' taste. I was obsessed.\n\nOn the M&S website, the full product description reads: \"This is not just prawn toast. This is Our Best Ever Prawn Toast, because we use responsibly sourced aromatic black tiger prawns, handmade with the perfect blend of fresh spring onions, warming ginger and crispy toasted sesame seeds. Served with sweet-sour citrus ponzu dipping sauce.\"\n\nYou can check out the full product here on the M&S website.\n\nAldi Specially Selected British Steak & Ale And British Chicken & Bacon Mini Pies - \u00a32.99 (currently on offer for \u00a32.49 at the time of writing)\n\nI didn't think I'd love these pies as much as I did, but they were so tasty. My favourite flavour was the chicken and bacon which were super creamy.\n\nI loved the size of these pies, and I particularly enjoyed the pasty which was crispy on top yet fluffy surrounding the filling. Considering this party food selection is literally just a bunch of pies, it still had that extra special feel to it.\n\nFor the price, I was really impressed with the quality. My husband wasn't as bothered about the pies as I was, but I loved them!\n\nYou can check out the full product here on the Aldi website.\n\nAldi Specially Selected Korean Style Chicken Sliders - \u00a33.99\n\nWarning - avoid these if you're not a massive fan of spicy foods. These chicken sliders had a real kick to them, but they were generally quite tasty nonetheless.\n\nMy only criticism would be that the buns were quite hard after cooking. They would've been much better if they were a little softer.\n\nI'd say this one was my least favourite, but only because I think the spice overpowered the actual chicken taste. Of course, it's all subject to opinion.\n\nYou can check out the full product here on the Aldi website.\n\nAldi Specially Selected Mini Beef Wellingtons - \u00a32.99\n\nThese were definitely my favourite out of the Aldi options, despite them being a little messy to put in the oven. When taking the mini wellingtons out of the pack we found that the pastry kept crumbling off, so it lost its wellington shape.\n\nHowever, once they'd been in the oven they rose significantly to create a gorgeously soft and fluffy mini beef wellington. We added some salt onto the top of our pastry and it was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe beef chunks were tender and the wellingtons were very moreish. For the price, I'd definitely recommend these.\n\nYou can check out the full product here on the Aldi website.\n\nThe verdict\n\nI'm not even just saying this, it was generally such a close call. Both party food options were extremely delicious, with Aldi beating M&S in some ways, and M&S beating Aldi in others.\n\nFor the price, I do think that the Aldi party food was an absolute steal, and not to be sniffed at. However, for me, M&S will always be an absolute treat, and with the party food deal, it's definitely worth taking advantage of.\n\nI'll always be loyal to Aldi because it's my big shop supermarket of choice, but for a special occasion with that exquisite prawn toast, Marks & Spencer's is my winner.\n\nIt offered luxurious quality that you can have in the comfort of your own home. You can view the M&S party food selection here.",
