The buoy, a critical asset for offshore oil transfer operations, will support production continuity at the block.\n\nReplacing the aging Malongo unit, which has been in operation for over 40 years, the new CALM buoy weighs 285 metric tons, with a diameter of 16 meters and a width of 11.7 meters. Manufactured in Dubai, the buoy is currently stored at SONILS\u2019 Heavy Lift Dock, with installation scheduled for late-September or early-October 2025.\n\n\u201cThis operation represents more than just a technical achievement \u2014 it is living proof of SONILS\u2019s ability to deliver with precision, safety and excellence. The recognition from our clients reflects the competence of our teams and the quality of our infrastructure. We are ready to continue serving Angola and the oil and gas sector with increasingly robust and integrated solutions,\u201d stated Anabela Marcos, Managing Director, SONILS.\n\nAs a floating mooring system designed for durability and stability, the buoy ensures the safe and efficient transfer of crude oil and petroleum products between tankers and offshore facilities, contributing to production efficiency at Block 0.\n\nThe operation highlights SONILS technical expertise in handling large-scale projects, including the offloading, handling and secure storage of a large and heavy structure; management of specialized quay infrastructure and mobilization of heavy equipment; and effective collaboration with international clients, vessel operators and logistics suppliers. The project was executed under strict compliance with international safety and quality standards.\n\nAccording to SONILS, the project reinforces the company\u2019s position as Angola\u2019s leading integrated logistics base, trusted by global operators for critical oil and gas operations. The successful delivery of the CALM buoy strengthens SONILS\u2019 reputation as a regional benchmark for complex logistics solutions.\n\nOperated by Chevron, Block 0 is located offshore Cabinda Province in deepwaters. The concession, recently extended until 2050, comprises 21 fields and connects to associated infrastructure including the Angola LNG plant via the Congo River Crossing Pipeline. Chevron, through its Angolan subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, holds a 39.2% stake in Block 0, alongside partners Sonangol E&P (41%), TotalEnergies (10%) and Eni (9.8%).",

            "content": "Chevron Corporation CVX has had a good year so far, hitting a 52-week high of $168.96 on March 26. The stock has climbed 16.3% year to date, outperforming rival ExxonMobil\u2019s XOM 10.6% gain. This impressive run has been driven by strong production growth, attractive shareholder returns and a competitive valuation. However, headwinds such as legal hurdles surrounding its Hess Corporation HES acquisition, asset sale risks and Venezuela challenges raise the question: Has Chevron\u2019s stock run its course, or is there still upside left?\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChevron\u2019s Strong Free Cash Flow and Financial Discipline\n\nChevron is well-run and historically a profitable big oil giant. Investors should know that the company returned $27 billion to shareholders in 2024 through dividends and stock buybacks. CVX has been quite active in repurchasing shares, and management plans to buy back $10 billion to $20 billion in shares annually, reducing the share count by 3-6% each year. With capital expenditures set at a manageable $15 billion through 2026, Chevron appears well-positioned to sustain strong shareholder returns.\n\nChevron Corporation\n\nImage Source: Chevron Corporation\n\nChevron continues to be a strong dividend player, having increased its payout for 37 consecutive years. The latest dividend hike of 4.9% takes its yield to over 4%, making it a reliable income source for long-term investors.\n\nCVX\u2019s Output & Natural Gas Growth\n\nChevron\u2019s upstream portfolio remains a key strength, with strong production growth from the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan. The company is targeting a 6% annual production increase through 2026, with high-margin projects driving long-term value. The Tengizchevroil (TCO) expansion in Kazakhstan and increased efficiency in the Permian are expected to bolster output, supporting Chevron\u2019s long-term earnings growth.\n\nChevron stands to benefit from U.S. energy policy shifts that support domestic oil and gas production. The Trump administration has prioritized energy security, creating a favorable backdrop for increased drilling. Additionally, rising energy demand from AI-driven data centers is expected to boost natural gas consumption, strengthening Chevron\u2019s revenue potential.\n\nA Word on Chevron\u2019s Valuation\n\nIn addition to these tailwinds, Chevron\u2019s valuation appears reasonable. It is trading at a multiple of 6.99 based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization). This compares favorably to ExxonMobil. For value-focused investors, this could be a catalyst.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research",

Inc., a subsidiary of Chevron Corp., for $525 million.\n\nThe move, announced April 1, marks Tokyo Gas\u2019 expansion of its U.S. business at a time when President Donald Trump is seeking to boost U.S. gas exports.\n\nTokyo Gas denies the move is in response to Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 the investment was being studied long before he came to office \u2014 but an investment of this scale in the U.S. is expected to be seen favorably by the Trump administration.\n\nTGNR is a major gas producer in East Texas, jointly owned by TG East Texas Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokyo Gas America, and CCI U.S. Asset Holdings.\n\nOf the purchase amount, $75 million will be paid in cash and $450 million used as capital to fund the Haynesville development in Texas.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nThe shale gas produced on the site is for the U.S. market for now, but exporting it in the form of liquefied natural gas to Japan is an option for the future, according to Tokyo Gas.\n\nTokyo Gas is Japan\u2019s largest provider of city-area gas, primarily serving the Tokyo area. Besides Texas, it also has operations in the U.S. in the Louisiana area.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with a world-class company like Chevron on this transaction.

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.38%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.87%.\n\nThe oil company's stock has climbed by 9.28% in the past month, exceeding the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 2.26% and the S&P 500's loss of 5.59%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Chevron in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.49, down 15.02% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $47.52 billion, indicating a 2.45% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.34 per share and a revenue of $197.98 billion, representing changes of +2.89% and -2.37%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Chevron should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 4.16% downward. Chevron is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Chevron is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 16.18. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 8.4, which means Chevron is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can also see that CVX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.6. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.39.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

Why you can trust us By Amal Ahmed 6 MIN READ\n\nEvery summer in Portland, Oregon, thousands of people participate in the city\u2019s famous World Naked Bike Ride. In the two decades since its launch, the event has become something of a tourist attraction, and one of the city\u2019s many quirks that locals brag about.\n\nBut at an offshoot event in September 2024, Molly, one of the organizers, reminded the crowd that the naked bike ride wasn\u2019t just a spectacle: The event was originally started in the early 2000s as a protest against fossil fuel companies.\n\nMolly, who asked to use her first name only for privacy, spoke about how oil and gas companies aren\u2019t just worsening climate change and polluting the air in cities like Portland. In 2024, after nearly a year of watching Israel drop U.S.-made bombs on civilians in Gaza, she highlighted that at least one oil and gas company is also fueling the genocide in Palestine.\n\n\u201cThe community had been quiet about issues like Palestine,\u201d Molly says. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t a faraway place. It ties back to everything you care about.\u201d\n\nChevron supplies 70% of Israel\u2019s power, including to prisons and military facilities that are crucial to Israeli occupation and illegal settlements in the West Bank. According to news reports, Chevron\u2019s drilling platforms in the eastern Mediterranean Sea can be seen from the Gaza Strip.\n\nYet the Israeli government decides if and when Palestinians can access any of that energy. That led the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement (BDS) to call for a global boycott of Chevron\u2019s products. The movement is calling for consumers around the world to stop buying the fuel Chevron sells at gas stations, as well as its automotive coolants and engine oil. In addition, they\u2019re calling for banks, pension funds, local governments, and other institutions to divest from the company\u2019s stocks.\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of people, it was the first time they\u2019d heard about this, and it felt like a really important moment of connecting the dots,\u201d Molly says.\n\nIn the six months since that event, Molly and other organizers have continued to mobilize dozens of Portland\u2019s bike enthusiasts to protest\u2014fully clothed, and usually in the pouring rain\u2014at local Chevron stations. The BDS movement\u2019s toolkit for local organizers focuses on educational components for customers. When it comes to gas stations themselves, many gas station owners are typically locked into 25- to 30-year contracts with Chevron. So the toolkit calls for organizers to ask gas station owners to display anti-occupation flyers in their stores, or to sign letters to Chevron demanding that the company end its Israeli operations.\n\nThe Portland protests have allowed people to realize that their individual actions can create collective pressure, said Hami, another organizer of the bike protests, who is only using their first name due to safety concerns. \u201cWhen we talk about mobility freedom, there\u2019s nothing as stark as seeing how hindered Palestinians\u2019 mobility has been since 1948.\u201d\n\nA Playbook From Apartheid\n\nThe BDS movement\u2019s campaign against Chevron was inspired by a similar movement to pressure Royal Dutch Shell and BP to end their operations in apartheid South Africa, said Olivia Katbi, the co-chair of the U.S. BDS campaign. Shell and BP jointly owned the country\u2019s largest oil refinery, much like Chevron currently operates Israel\u2019s largest energy development project.\n\nUnder apartheid in South Africa, Black communities were denied access to electricity and running water. \u201cThey were relegated to impoverished homes far from urban centers,\u201d says Mattie Webb, Ph.D., a 20th-century historian and fellow at Yale. \u201cBlack South Africans accounted for 85 to 90% of the population on 13% of the land.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s main power company, Eskom, maintained its own security forces as anti-apartheid activists sabotaged its power lines and stations. After South African workers went on strike following the death of a worker at the company\u2019s coal mine\u2014and were met with private security firing tear gas and rubber bullets\u2014American labor unions supported boycotts of Shell.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at oil companies, and at the South African military and police, anti-apartheid activists were able to make those connections, and in my research, that is what made the case for divestment successful,\u201d Webb says. \u201cIt was consistently showing Americans and concerned citizens globally that companies were not just profiting off of apartheid, but were allowing the regime to conduct its violent attacks on Black South Africans.\u201d\n\nToday, the parallels to Palestine are stark. \u201cIsrael is pillaging these resources that belong to Palestinians\u2014because it is Palestinian land that Israel is occupying,\u201d Katbi says. \u201cAnd then they are selling it back to them in a really unfair way.\u201d\n\nAfter its 1967 occupation, Israel took over the existing power infrastructure in Palestine. The Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), which purchases most of its power from Chevron, has banned some Palestinian villages in the West Bank from connecting to the grid for more than 70 years. Other villages are charged different, variable rates and receive substandard service compared to nearby Jewish settlements, according to the American Friends Service Committee.\n\nIn Palestinian villages that Israel has refused to connect to the grid, the Israeli military has even destroyed solar panels. In Gaza, where Israel has imposed a siege since 2007, the military destroyed the area\u2019s only power plant\u2014making the IEC its sole source of electricity. And in the ongoing war since Oct. 7, 2023, Israel completely cut off power to Gaza.\n\nIn December, Human Rights Watch said that this amounted to \u201cacts of genocide,\u201d particularly as the lack of power meant that there was virtually no clean water for millions of civilians once the Strip\u2019s desalination plants were cut off from power. Gazans rely on treated seawater or brackish groundwater, or on water pipelines that Israel can shut off on a whim. In March, UNICEF estimated that 90% of Gazans\u2014some 1.8 million people\u2014may not have access to clean water as Israel continues to cut power and block aid trucks from entering Gaza.\n\nClimate organizations, like Oil Change International and some local chapters of Sunrise and 350, have supported the boycott and divestment campaigns, highlighting Chevron\u2019s broader history of environmental catastrophes. \u201cWe\u2019re not really inventing something new,\u201d Katbi says. \u201cBDS is most impactful when it\u2019s taken as a collective action.\n\nAnd she said the campaign is winnable: There are plenty of alternative gas stations for consumers to fill their gas tanks. And perhaps more importantly, Israel\u2019s economy has struggled over the past year, making investments in the country subject to greater risk.\n\nThat means, in addition to the consumer boycott, the movement will continue to put pressure on institutions, governments, and other organizations to stop working with, investing in, or taking money from Chevron.\n\nSo far, three U.S. cities have divested from Chevron and other companies profiting off of Israeli apartheid: Portland, Maine; Hayward, California; and Alameda, California. In February, the City Council of Portland, Oregon, announced it would drop the company\u2019s sponsorship from a series of events at City Club, a nonprofit civic organization.\n\n\u201cThese sponsorships reach the general public in ways that Palestine activism does not\u2014state fairs, sports teams, community events,\u201d Katbi says. Chevron\u2019s name is featured on exhibits at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, for example. \u201cWe are mapping those out and trying to get campaigns around this to not only impact [Chevron\u2019s] bottom line, but make them a pariah in our community spaces.\u201d\n\nHitting the Headquarters\n\nIn Houston, Chevron is something of a household name. The company has had a presence in the city for a century and has nearly 7,000 employees there. In 2024, the company moved its headquarters to Houston.\n\nLast year, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter started a campaign to get the Houston Marathon\u2019s board to drop Chevron as its main sponsor\u2014a title the company has held for 13 years.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the money the marathon makes is from the runners\u2014the people who are making it happen,\u201d said AJ Holmes, an organizer with the Houston DSA. \u201cIt\u2019s really hypocritical to plaster Chevron\u2019s image on this event. Personally, my family has run in the marathon before, and I grew up thinking this was totally normal. It\u2019s like it\u2019s in the air that we breathe, literally.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has had conversations with local running clubs and the marathon\u2019s staffers, educating people about the connections between Chevron and Israeli apartheid. They\u2019re making clear what it means to be in the \u201cbelly of the beast of imperialism,\u201d Holmes said, thinking more broadly about Houston\u2019s role in the fossil fuel industry.\n\nDespite collaborating with groups like the Sunrise Movement and the Palestine Youth Movement, the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful: The Houston Marathon renewed Chevron\u2019s sponsorship contract for five more years.\n\nStill, the work will continue: Activists will keep pressuring the Houston Marathon to cancel the new contract, Holmes said, and they will focus on Chevron\u2019s other activities, like its sponsorship of the local Pride Parade. Organizers are gearing up for major demonstrations and teach-ins ahead of CERAWeek, a major energy conference that convenes the CEOs of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies in Houston annually.\n\n\u201cThey spend a lot of money on these events, trying to make themselves seem more progressive or palatable,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cOur goal is to make sure that doesn\u2019t work, and that all their propaganda money isn\u2019t useful.\u201d\n\nShare\n\nAmal Ahmed is a freelance reporter currently based in Vancouver, Washington.

            "content": "Steps by the second Trump administration show it is taking a tougher stance against the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Trump recently issued an executive order that could levy a 25 percent tariff on countries that directly or indirectly import Venezuelan oil starting on April 2, and it has modified Chevron\u2019s oil license to operate in the South American nation. While Caracas has found workarounds to ameliorate sanctions in the past, these US measures are taking place in a different oil market and geopolitical environment. These factors could make it more difficult for Venezuela to circumvent the new US actions, and the impact of those measures could be felt in oil markets and beyond. Oil production and exports could decline, bringing additional economic and social turmoil to the Maduro regime, which is already facing rising macroeconomic instability and heightened risks of power outages.\n\nChanges to Chevron\u2019s oil license: A serious risk to Venezuela\u2019s oil outlook\n\nChevron needs licenses from the US Treasury to operate in Venezuela through its minority joint venture partnerships with the national oil company PDVSA, a sanctioned entity. Chevron JV\u2019s represent 25 percent of total production in Venezuela and an even larger share of the country\u2019s official oil export receipts. Thus, Chevron\u2019s oil license in Venezuela has become a critical metric for gauging the US foreign policy stance towards the Maduro regime.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, the Trump administration replaced Chevron\u2019s General License (GL) 41, which had existed since November 2022, with GL 41A, which orders the winding down of Chevron\u2019s operations in Venezuela by April 2, 2025, although the timing was extended to May 27 via GL 41B. One interpretation of such action is that this could signal the beginning of a pattern of short-term extensions that would be used as leverage to make the Maduro regime comply with the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants, an issue that has dominated the headlines about the US government relations with Venezuela.\n\nWhile multiple extensions of this license cannot be ruled out, this change in Chevron\u2019s original GL 41 oil license poses downside risks to oil production in Venezuela because it represents a significant change in the scope and time horizon of Chevron\u2019s operations.\n\nChevron has had licenses since 2019, which have been renewed multiple times without having any material impact on the country\u2019s oil production, even if the licenses authorized \u201ctransactions and activities ordinarily incident and necessary to operations in Venezuela involving PDVSA.\u201d But it was under Chevron\u2019s GL 41 that oil production in Venezuela saw a sustained recovery, growing by almost 200,000 barrels per day (b/d) in the 2022-2024 period to reach about 900,000 b/d in Q1 2025, according to OPEC\u2019s secondary sources. More importantly, Venezuelan exports to the United States reached 250,000 b/d in January 2025, the highest level since the oil sanctions were imposed in early 2019.\n\nThe reason for this increase was twofold. First, GL 41 was an operating license, not a wind-down oil license, that explicitly allowed Chevron\u2019s JVs with PDVSA to:\n\nProduce petroleum or petroleum products and related maintenance, repair, or servicing of operations; Export of petroleum and petroleum products to the US through Chevron; and Import diluents, condensates, petroleum, or natural gas products to Chevron\u2019s operations in Venezuela, among other activities (Venezuela imported about 50,000 b/d of petroleum products from the US in 2024).\n\nThe built-in monthly six-month renewal also reduced uncertainty and provided sufficient visibility to Chevron to increase investments.\n\nChevron\u2019s oil license cannot be seen in isolation. The threat of secondary tariffs could magnify any downside risks to oil production in Venezuela.\n\nSecondary tariffs: Hitting at Venezuela\u2019s ability to evade US oil sanctions\n\nThe threat of a 25 percent tariff on countries that import Venezuelan oil directly or indirectly through third parties is a novel use of tariffs in place of secondary sanctions to ensure compliance with US policy.\n\nThere are three potential reasons why the Trump administration could be pursuing this course of action: Trump\u2019s preferences for tariffs vs. sanctions, a desire to hit at the Maduro administration\u2019s ability to circumvent sanctions, and/or trying an alternative policy solution to reduce the administrative burden of compliance with Venezuelan sanctions in a low-stakes way.\n\nOne of the lessons from the 2019 oil sanctions in Venezuela was that there was very high compliance (bordering on over-compliance) with US government sanctions policy from US, European, and Asian companies linked to global financial markets. Therefore, without written reassurances from the US Treasury, companies like the Italian Eni and Repsol, but also Reliance, are likely to halt imports of Venezuelan oil (Repsol is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration to be able to maintain its operations in Venezuela).\n\nHowever, the 2019 oil sanctions also magnified the kleptocratic nature of the Maduro regime. Oil flows migrated into informal and illicit hands, hiding their origin even if the ultimate market was China, the leading destination for Venezuela\u2019s oil exports. This, however, came at the cost of deep price discounts and lost revenues, which caused significant damage to PDVSA and government coffers.\n\nThe secondary tariffs might target this evasion mechanism, putting countries like Malaysia in the spotlight, given their suspected role in the market for sanctioned oil. Secondary tariffs put the burden of policing on third countries, significantly increasing the cost to the governments where such activities occur and thus the incentives for compliance. The United States, for example, is the second largest export market for Malaysia after Singapore, representing 13 percent of total exports.\n\nVenezuela is unprepared for the effectiveness of tariffs\n\nThe 25 percent tariff threat on countries importing Venezuelan oil could imply an even more bearish scenario for Venezuela akin to the 2019 oil sanctions that led to a 60 percent decline in oil production in the country in the two-period after sanctions were imposed.\n\nThe likelihood of this scenario depends on how seriously the United States sustains this hawkish policy stance. It remains to be seen whether a move by the Maduro regime to repatriate migrants would be enough to satisfy the Trump administration and ease the threat of tariffs.\n\nThe effectiveness of these measures also depends on the Maduro government\u2019s ability to evade sanctions and tariff measures and whether third-party countries would risk getting caught by the United States in order to receive Venezuelan oil. However, several factors may make evasion more difficult now than in 2019.\n\nFirst off, US actions are taking place in a very different market environment for Venezuela. China\u2019s oil demand was growing then, the United States was still a net oil importer, and OPEC had just reached a deal to cut 1.2 million b/d from the markets. The situation today is much less advantageous for Venezuela\u2019s sanctioned oil for multiple reasons:\n\nThe oil market may become oversupplied as OPEC plans to unwind its production cuts starting this month.\n\nAlmost 14 percent of the world\u2019s oil production is sanctioned (33 percent of OPEC+), and Venezuela is competing with countries like Iran and Russia for market share in China, the main destination for sanctioned oil. Russia and then Iran played a key role in helping Venezuela circumvent US oil sanctions, but it is unclear whether these countries will play the same role today.\n\nChina\u2019s oil demand outlook seems less supportive of global oil markets than in 2019. The larger Chinese refiners, facing higher EV penetration in China, are increasingly focusing on expanding into petrochemicals, leaving the Chinese independent refiners as the buyers of last resort for sanctioned oil.\n\nThe US oil trade balance has shifted from 2.3 million b/d in net imports in 2018 to 2.3 million b/d in net oil exports in 2024, changing the conversation about the political impact of supply disruptions from Venezuela. Indeed, Trump has announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which are much larger oil suppliers to the United States than Venezuela. Intentional or not, tariffs or sanctions on these three major foreign suppliers of heavy oil to the US refinery system might incentivize increased use of the domestic lighter oil.\n\nIn addition to the shift in oil markets, other factors may make it difficult for Venezuela to evade the US measures and to navigate an effective US campaign of isolation in global oil markets. The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs and license announcements is already bringing additional economic turmoil to the Maduro regime. The recent devaluation of the local currency in the parallel market is causing upward revisions to the inflationary outlook with rising pessimism about economic activity. Making things more challenging, Venezuela is undergoing another cycle of power outages due to insufficient hydroelectricity. The government is reducing public sector working hours, including at PDVSA, to ration power.\n\nRising macroeconomic instability could increase social and political tensions at a time of heightened repression since the July 2024 presidential elections that have been widely condemned as fraudulent. Thus, the US government and Venezuela\u2019s neighbors might want to be prepared for a scenario where Trump\u2019s actions effectively curtail Venezuela\u2019s ability to evade sanctions.",

This financial projection underscores the company's strategic approach to maximizing returns while optimizing its asset portfolio.\n\nThe divestiture supports Chevron's previously announced plan to sell $10-15 billion in assets by 2028. This strategy aims to focus on core operations and enhance capital efficiency, allowing the company to allocate resources to high-return projects and emerging energy sectors.\n\nTGNR, the acquiring entity, will significantly expand its presence in the Ark-La-Tex region with this acquisition. The deal adds over 250 gross drilling locations to TGNR's existing Haynesville inventory, extending its inventory life beyond 20 years at the current development pace. This expanded footprint positions TGNR as a dominant player in the Haynesville shale play.\n\nCraig Jarchow, CEO of TGNR, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership with Chevron, highlighting the operational synergies between the acquired assets and TGNR's existing holdings. He anticipates realizing over $170 million in synergies during the asset's development, further enhancing the transaction's value.\n\nThe Haynesville acreage acquired by TGNR is relatively undrilled and held by shallower production, mitigating potential parent-child well interference and enhancing future production efficiency. This characteristic adds significant value to the acquired assets, ensuring long-term productivity.\n\nChevron's decision to retain a minority stake and royalty interest reflects its confidence in the long-term potential of the East Texas gas assets. The joint venture structure allows Chevron to maintain upside potential while accelerating the development of a non-core asset through a capital-efficient approach.\n\nTokyo Gas, a major player in Japan's energy sector, brings its financial strength and long-term vision to the partnership.

Fans can hear Andy Mashaw calling the action on Fox Sports Radio 1310 AM.\n\nAround the Horn\n\nThe Monarchs (8-17, 4-5 Sun Belt) avoided getting swept by App State this past weekend in Boone, North Carolina. After dropping the Sun Belt series opener 9-4 on Friday, the Mountaineers took Game One of a Saturday doubleheader, 6-1. ODU responded with a 7-6 win in the second game of the twin bill thanks to back-to-back doubles by Zach Leite and Kainen Jorge and what proved to be the deciding run on an RBI single from Tahraun Hammond.\n\nScotty Young currently leads ODU with a .360 batting average, with Leite is trailing him closely with a .351 clip. Following them are Efrain Morales (.282), Hammond (.279), and Kyle Edwards (.277). Luke Waters (.215) leads the Monarchs with 18 RBIs with Leite right behind him with 17. Edwards and Jorge (.250) have combined to score 35 runs and Jorge has drawn a team-high 18 walks. The Monarchs are 29-for-36 when attempting to steal, with Edwards at 14-for-15, good for second in the SBC in steals and steals per game (0.56). As a team, Old Dominion is batting .250 with a .383 slugging percentage and a .349 on-base percentage.\n\nJayce Park (0-2, 5.79 ERA) will make his second start in what will be a staff day for ODU. The freshman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has allowed six runs on 10 hits and four walks while striking out eight over 9.1 innings and eight appearances. The Monarchs have a team ERA of 6.69 with opponents batting .277 against them.\n\nScouting Virginia\n\nThe Cavaliers (15-11, 6-6 ACC) are coming off of an ACC series sweep of No. 20 Stanford this past weekend. UVA defeated the Cardinal 11-8 last Thursday and 13-7 on Friday. In the final game of the series, UVA secured a 9-8 walk off win when Aiden Teel doubled to send James Nunnallee home for the deciding run. The win gave head coach Brian O\u2019Connor his 900th win of his career, making him the 15th active coach to hold 900 wins.\n\nVirginia has four starters averaging over a .300 batting average with Henry Ford (.364), Eric Becker (.340), Henry Godbout (.327) and Chris Arroyo (.307). Ford also owns the team high in hits with 39, while Arroyo is first on the team with 24 RBIs, seven homeruns, and a .545 slugging percentage. The Cavs are currently batting .299 as a team while their opponents are batting .277. They have homered 23 times this season with a slugging percentage of .442 and an on-base percentage of .395. They have stolen 32 bases on 42 attempts.\n\nUVA will start left hander Bradley Hodges (0-1, 2.70 ERA). The junior has given up six runs, only two of them earned, on five hits and six walks. He\u2019s recorded 11 strikeouts through three starts and 6.2 innings pitched. Virginia\u2019s pitching has a team ERA of 4.77 with opponents batting .277 against them.\n\nThe Series\n\nODU has a slight lead in the all-times series, 30-29. The teams met three times last season: twice in Charlottesville, and once in Norfolk. The Monarchs fell to the then-No. 14 Cavaliers 8-0 on Feb. 21, then returned to The Dish on April 2 and suffered a 4-0 setback to the No. 15 Cavs. Old Dominion then defeated the No. 10 Cavs, 7-4 on April 16 in the Commonwealth Classic at Harbor Park. The Monarchs jumped out to a 4-0 lead and held the visitors to one run through eight innings.\n\nUp Next\n\nODU will host Troy for a Sun Belt Conference series this weekend at Harbor Park.

Why you can trust us By Amal Ahmed 6 MIN READ\n\nEvery summer in Portland, Oregon, thousands of people participate in the city\u2019s famous World Naked Bike Ride. In the two decades since its launch, the event has become something of a tourist attraction, and one of the city\u2019s many quirks that locals brag about.\n\nBut at an offshoot event in September 2024, Molly, one of the organizers, reminded the crowd that the naked bike ride wasn\u2019t just a spectacle: The event was originally started in the early 2000s as a protest against fossil fuel companies.\n\nMolly, who asked to use her first name only for privacy, spoke about how oil and gas companies aren\u2019t just worsening climate change and polluting the air in cities like Portland. In 2024, after nearly a year of watching Israel drop U.S.-made bombs on civilians in Gaza, she highlighted that at least one oil and gas company is also fueling the genocide in Palestine.\n\n\u201cThe community had been quiet about issues like Palestine,\u201d Molly says. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t a faraway place. It ties back to everything you care about.\u201d\n\nChevron supplies 70% of Israel\u2019s power, including to prisons and military facilities that are crucial to Israeli occupation and illegal settlements in the West Bank. According to news reports, Chevron\u2019s drilling platforms in the eastern Mediterranean Sea can be seen from the Gaza Strip.\n\nYet the Israeli government decides if and when Palestinians can access any of that energy. That led the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement (BDS) to call for a global boycott of Chevron\u2019s products. The movement is calling for consumers around the world to stop buying the fuel Chevron sells at gas stations, as well as its automotive coolants and engine oil. In addition, they\u2019re calling for banks, pension funds, local governments, and other institutions to divest from the company\u2019s stocks.\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of people, it was the first time they\u2019d heard about this, and it felt like a really important moment of connecting the dots,\u201d Molly says.\n\nIn the six months since that event, Molly and other organizers have continued to mobilize dozens of Portland\u2019s bike enthusiasts to protest\u2014fully clothed, and usually in the pouring rain\u2014at local Chevron stations. The BDS movement\u2019s toolkit for local organizers focuses on educational components for customers. When it comes to gas stations themselves, many gas station owners are typically locked into 25- to 30-year contracts with Chevron. So the toolkit calls for organizers to ask gas station owners to display anti-occupation flyers in their stores, or to sign letters to Chevron demanding that the company end its Israeli operations.\n\nThe Portland protests have allowed people to realize that their individual actions can create collective pressure, said Hami, another organizer of the bike protests, who is only using their first name due to safety concerns. \u201cWhen we talk about mobility freedom, there\u2019s nothing as stark as seeing how hindered Palestinians\u2019 mobility has been since 1948.\u201d\n\nA Playbook From Apartheid\n\nThe BDS movement\u2019s campaign against Chevron was inspired by a similar movement to pressure Royal Dutch Shell and BP to end their operations in apartheid South Africa, said Olivia Katbi, the co-chair of the U.S. BDS campaign. Shell and BP jointly owned the country\u2019s largest oil refinery, much like Chevron currently operates Israel\u2019s largest energy development project.\n\nUnder apartheid in South Africa, Black communities were denied access to electricity and running water. \u201cThey were relegated to impoverished homes far from urban centers,\u201d says Mattie Webb, Ph.D., a 20th-century historian and fellow at Yale. \u201cBlack South Africans accounted for 85 to 90% of the population on 13% of the land.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s main power company, Eskom, maintained its own security forces as anti-apartheid activists sabotaged its power lines and stations. After South African workers went on strike following the death of a worker at the company\u2019s coal mine\u2014and were met with private security firing tear gas and rubber bullets\u2014American labor unions supported boycotts of Shell.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at oil companies, and at the South African military and police, anti-apartheid activists were able to make those connections, and in my research, that is what made the case for divestment successful,\u201d Webb says. \u201cIt was consistently showing Americans and concerned citizens globally that companies were not just profiting off of apartheid, but were allowing the regime to conduct its violent attacks on Black South Africans.\u201d\n\nToday, the parallels to Palestine are stark. \u201cIsrael is pillaging these resources that belong to Palestinians\u2014because it is Palestinian land that Israel is occupying,\u201d Katbi says. \u201cAnd then they are selling it back to them in a really unfair way.\u201d\n\nAfter its 1967 occupation, Israel took over the existing power infrastructure in Palestine. The Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), which purchases most of its power from Chevron, has banned some Palestinian villages in the West Bank from connecting to the grid for more than 70 years. Other villages are charged different, variable rates and receive substandard service compared to nearby Jewish settlements, according to the American Friends Service Committee.\n\nIn Palestinian villages that Israel has refused to connect to the grid, the Israeli military has even destroyed solar panels. In Gaza, where Israel has imposed a siege since 2007, the military destroyed the area\u2019s only power plant\u2014making the IEC its sole source of electricity. And in the ongoing war since Oct. 7, 2023, Israel completely cut off power to Gaza.\n\nIn December, Human Rights Watch said that this amounted to \u201cacts of genocide,\u201d particularly as the lack of power meant that there was virtually no clean water for millions of civilians once the Strip\u2019s desalination plants were cut off from power. Gazans rely on treated seawater or brackish groundwater, or on water pipelines that Israel can shut off on a whim. In March, UNICEF estimated that 90% of Gazans\u2014some 1.8 million people\u2014may not have access to clean water as Israel continues to cut power and block aid trucks from entering Gaza.\n\nClimate organizations, like Oil Change International and some local chapters of Sunrise and 350, have supported the boycott and divestment campaigns, highlighting Chevron\u2019s broader history of environmental catastrophes. \u201cWe\u2019re not really inventing something new,\u201d Katbi says. \u201cBDS is most impactful when it\u2019s taken as a collective action.\n\nAnd she said the campaign is winnable: There are plenty of alternative gas stations for consumers to fill their gas tanks. And perhaps more importantly, Israel\u2019s economy has struggled over the past year, making investments in the country subject to greater risk.\n\nThat means, in addition to the consumer boycott, the movement will continue to put pressure on institutions, governments, and other organizations to stop working with, investing in, or taking money from Chevron.\n\nSo far, three U.S. cities have divested from Chevron and other companies profiting off of Israeli apartheid: Portland, Maine; Hayward, California; and Alameda, California. In February, the City Council of Portland, Oregon, announced it would drop the company\u2019s sponsorship from a series of events at City Club, a nonprofit civic organization.\n\n\u201cThese sponsorships reach the general public in ways that Palestine activism does not\u2014state fairs, sports teams, community events,\u201d Katbi says. Chevron\u2019s name is featured on exhibits at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, for example. \u201cWe are mapping those out and trying to get campaigns around this to not only impact [Chevron\u2019s] bottom line, but make them a pariah in our community spaces.\u201d\n\nHitting the Headquarters\n\nIn Houston, Chevron is something of a household name. The company has had a presence in the city for a century and has nearly 7,000 employees there. In 2024, the company moved its headquarters to Houston.\n\nLast year, the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter started a campaign to get the Houston Marathon\u2019s board to drop Chevron as its main sponsor\u2014a title the company has held for 13 years.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the money the marathon makes is from the runners\u2014the people who are making it happen,\u201d said AJ Holmes, an organizer with the Houston DSA. \u201cIt\u2019s really hypocritical to plaster Chevron\u2019s image on this event. Personally, my family has run in the marathon before, and I grew up thinking this was totally normal. It\u2019s like it\u2019s in the air that we breathe, literally.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has had conversations with local running clubs and the marathon\u2019s staffers, educating people about the connections between Chevron and Israeli apartheid. They\u2019re making clear what it means to be in the \u201cbelly of the beast of imperialism,\u201d Holmes said, thinking more broadly about Houston\u2019s role in the fossil fuel industry.\n\nDespite collaborating with groups like the Sunrise Movement and the Palestine Youth Movement, the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful: The Houston Marathon renewed Chevron\u2019s sponsorship contract for five more years.\n\nStill, the work will continue: Activists will keep pressuring the Houston Marathon to cancel the new contract, Holmes said, and they will focus on Chevron\u2019s other activities, like its sponsorship of the local Pride Parade. Organizers are gearing up for major demonstrations and teach-ins ahead of CERAWeek, a major energy conference that convenes the CEOs of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies in Houston annually.\n\n\u201cThey spend a lot of money on these events, trying to make themselves seem more progressive or palatable,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cOur goal is to make sure that doesn\u2019t work, and that all their propaganda money isn\u2019t useful.\u201d\n\nShare\n\nAmal Ahmed is a freelance reporter currently based in Vancouver, Washington.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer looked at recently.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, offered an optimistic perspective on the market on Thursday as he challenged the prevailing pessimism among some on Wall Street. He highlighted the diverse range of sectors showing gains.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Put These 16 Stocks Under a Microscope and Jim Cramer Commented on These 8 Stocks Recently\n\nCramer observed that when investors are focused on long-standing winners, like tech stocks, it can be easy to miss when their dominance starts to wane. Cramer expressed his hesitation to part ways with tech given its long-term success but he pointed out something surprising as he reviewed the top-performing sectors.\n\n\u201cBut when I scroll through the winning sectors for the year, I am struck by how they represent a wide array of groupings that aren\u2019t tethered to any particular economic worldview.\u201d\n\nCramer noted that neither the outlook of a recession nor predictions of a major slowdown could explain the growth seen in sectors beyond tech and communication services. He discussed that this year\u2019s leaders are not only unexpected but in some cases, they seem counterintuitive. He described them as \u201cbroad,\u201d in the sense that they span a wide range of industries, each responding to different economic conditions. He highlighted that these sectors that are performing well now have been largely overlooked for years, as tech has long dominated the spotlight.\n\nCramer said that for a long time, market participants had hoped for a rally that would extend beyond the tech sector, and now it seems to be happening. However, he remarked, \u201cexcept you can\u2019t call it a rally anymore.\u201d He went on to say that a day like Thursday, in his view, was a sign of a healthy market despite the constant narrative of trouble in the economy.\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line: It\u2019s tricky to see such a broad mixture of stocks winning here, from ones that can run in a recession to ones that can rally hard in a robust economy. What it tells me is that the market may be far healthier than we think, and this backdrop simply isn\u2019t as bad as many would have you believe.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 27. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.",

Of this, Chevron will receive $75 million in cash and $450 million as a capital carry to fund D&C of the leasehold\u2019s Haynesville rights.\n\nChevron retains a 30% non-operated interest in the joint venture and an overriding royalty interest (ORRI) in the assets. Chevron estimates the deal is valued to it at $1.2 billion at current Henry Hub futures.\n\n\u201cChevron expects to maintain future upside through the joint venture structure while accelerating development of a non-core asset through a capital efficient approach,\u201d it reported.\n\nTokyo Gas\u2019 Houston-based Haynesville pureplay TGNR will gain the 70% working interest in 71,000 net contiguous acres, all in Panola County, Texas.\n\nThe Japan-based utility confirmed the deal in a separate announcement.\n\n\u201cThe capital carry allows for staged development and payment within TGNR's existing cash flow,\u201d it reported.\n\n\u201cThis asset is expected to have a high profit margin and contribute to improved return on assets for Tokyo Gas' U.S. shale gas business.\u201d\n\nTGNR, of which Tokyo Gas owns 93% and trader Castleton Commodities owns 7%, will have inventory of more than 20 years at its current D&C pace, Tokyo Gas reported.\n\nFive Haynesville wells\n\nChevron produced 29 MMcf/d this past December from Panola County, with just 4.2 MMcf/d of that from Carthage-Haynesville Field, where it has only five wells in the Haynesville, according to Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) data.\n\nThe balance of its production was from hundreds of legacy, shallower, vertical Carthage-Cotton Valley wells.\n\nIt had gained the position in 2000 in its merger with Texaco Inc.\n\nThe sale will be a Chevron exit from the Haynesville in a portfolio revision of $15 billion in divestments over five years as part of its $53 billion all-stock merger with Hess Corp.\n\nTGNR is among Texas\u2019 largest gas producers with 25 Bcf in December, according to the RRC.\n\nOf that, 0.54 Bcf/d was from Panola County alone: 0.49 Bcf/d from Haynesville wells there; the balance, landed in other formations.\n\n\u2018Virgin inventory\u2019\n\nJefferies marketed the Chevron property, opening the data room in February of 2024, offering a sale or joint venture in the acreage block.\n\nJefferies described it in the flyer as \u201csubstantial virgin inventory with approximately 300 [potential] operated Haynesville locations.\u201d\n\nThe acres are 85% operated and 100% HBP, primarily by vertical Cotton Valley wells.\n\nPDP was 120 Bcf net in February of 2024, according to Jefferies. EUR averaged 1.9 Bcf per 1,000 lateral feet for the handful of Haynesville horizontals.\n\nMike Winsor, CEO of Paloma Natural Gas, which he sold recently to hedge fund Citadel for $1.2 billion, said at Hart Energy\u2019s 2024 DUG Gas conference in Shreveport, \u201cThat [Chevron Panola acreage] is a position that all Haynesville operators are interested in.\n\n\u201c[And] mainly because it's undeveloped: You don't have parent-child [well] concerns.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a rare block of property. \u201cIt's not very often you can come into an acreage position that is consolidated,\u201d Winsor said.\n\n\u201cYou can come [into the Chevron acreage] with a blank slate. And whatever your well-spacing, whatever your design, there\u2019s a huge amount of running room there.\u201d\n\nPaloma Natural Gas\u2019 leasehold consisted initially of Goodrich Petroleum\u2019s gas pureplay property, which it bought for $480 million in December 2021.\n\nCarthage-Haynesville\n\nPanola County gas production in December totaled 46 Bcf or 1.5 Bcf/d, according to RRC records.\n\nIn addition to TGNR\u2019s 540 MMcf from the county in December, Sabine Oil & Gas made 295 MMcf/d; R. Lacy Services, 185 MMcf/d; and Comstock Resources, 72 MMcf/d.\n\nTGNR\u2019s Panola production includes what it picked up from Haynesville pureplay Rockcliff Energy in December 2023 for $2.7 billion.\n\nRockcliff\u2019s production was 720 MMcf/d from Carthage-Haynesville Field in Panola, while TGNR produced 77 MMcf/d that month.\n\nThroughout East Texas, Rockcliff\u2019s production was 1.3 Bcf/d gross and 1.2 Bcf/d net before exiting.\n\nIts net leasehold was more than 200,000 acres in Panola and adjacent northeastern Texas counties, making a deal value averaging roughly $3,650 per flowing Mcf/d net.\n\nHenry Hub at the time was $2.44, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration archive, having plunged from $3.34 just six weeks earlier.\n\nCurrently, the 12-month gas strip is some $4.50.",

            "content": "As highlighted above, dividend aristocrats have shown lower volatility as compared to the broader market index. Their ability to provide downside protection can be seen in the upside and downside capture ratios. The S&P report highlighted that the dividend aristocrats index has outperformed the market index 66.67% of the time in down months and 43.88% of the time in up months. Notably, the index also has a lower drawdown level compared with the benchmark index. In addition, the dividend aristocrats index provided an average excess return of 0.87% in down months over the broader market. To further emphasize their low volatility, the report mentioned that the dividend aristocrats had a market beta of 0.8 between December 29, 1989, and February 28, 2025.\n\nIn addition to dividend growth, dividend yield is also an important component of total return. The ability to increase dividends does not come at the expense of lower yields; in fact, the dividend aristocrats index has consistently delivered higher yields than its benchmark. The index had dividend yields within the range of 2.0% to 2.8% over the 28-year period, as reported by S&P Global. Moreover, the average dividend yield of the index was 2.5%, compared with a 1.8% dividend yield of the broader market.\n\nInvestors are more inclined toward dividend growth stocks, and the performance of these equities has also remained stable over the years. According to a report by S&P Global, dividend aristocrats have reported higher returns with lower volatility over the long run as compared to the broader market, which eventually resulted in higher risk-adjusted returns.\n\nGrowing dividends consistently highlight the companies\u2019 confidence in their firms\u2019 prospects as market participants see this as a sign of corporate maturity and strong balance sheets. Dividend aristocrats reveal characteristics of both capital growth and dividend income, as opposed to alternative income strategies that mainly pay attention to pure yield or pure capital appreciation.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. Dividends have been an important part of the overall market return for a very long time. According to a report by S&P Global, dividends have represented approximately 31% of the total return of the broader market from 1926 to February 2025, while capital appreciation has accounted for 69%.\n\nWe recently published a list of the 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks with Over 3% Yield . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best dividend aristocrats with a high yield.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith the AI boom and tech stocks taking center stage, dividend stocks are somehow overlooked by the market. However, the recent market sell-off has restored their importance, as the Dividend Aristocrats Index has surged by over 2% since the start of 2025, compared with a nearly 5% decline in the broader market. The significance of these equities is much more apparent over long periods of time. According to the S&P Global report, the dividend aristocrats index outperformed its benchmark by an average of 1.59% per year between January 2000 and February 2025. This outperformance was because of the fundamental characteristics of the constituents of the index.\n\n15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks with Over 3% Yield\n\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned a list of the Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with dividend yields above 3%, as of March 29. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nDividend Yield as of March 29: 4.12%\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a leading American oil and gas company. It has enhanced its capacity to secure long-term contracts by prioritizing LNG initiatives. The company reported solid earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024, generating revenue of $52.23 billion, up 10.7% from the same period last year. The revenue also exceeded Street estimates by over $3.8 billion. The growth in revenue was mainly driven by a 7% rise in global production and a 19% surge in US output, both achieving record levels for the year.\n\nIn addition, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) generated nearly $8 billion from asset sales and maintained a solid financial position, as the company ended the year with a net debt ratio of 10%. The company\u2019s cash position has remained stable over the years, which has supported its dividend policy. In FY24, it reported an operating cash flow of $31.5 billion, and its free cash flow amounted to $15 billion. Due to this cash generation, the company was able to return $12 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchased over $15 billion worth of shares, reasserting its long-standing commitment to share buybacks.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share, growing it by 4.9% in January. Through this increase, the company achieved its 38th consecutive annual dividend hike, which makes CVX one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. In addition to dividend growth, the stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.12%, as recorded on March 29.\n\nOverall, CVX ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

He further drew attention to Libya\u2019s recent actions, which involved auctioning maritime plots in its own EEZ based on the median line, effectively respecting Greek sovereign rights.\n\nThis, as Mitsotakis pointed out, serves as \u201cclear proof that Greece is exercising its sovereign rights in practice, despite the deliberate misinformation spread by some. It also demonstrates that Greece is recognized as an energy hub in the Eastern Mediterranean.\u201d\n\nMitsotakis also addressed the increase in the minimum wage, which will rise to 880 euros starting on April 1. He explained that public sector wages would be adjusted as well, with an additional 30 euros per month, building on the 70-euro increase public employees received in 2024\u2014the first wage hike in the public sector in 14 years.\n\nAdditionally, the prime minister announced the introduction of a public service evaluation system, with four million citizens soon receiving a detailed questionnaire to assess the services they use. \u201cThe ultimate judge of state services should be society,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nMitsotakis also revealed that the platform for property owners to report the cleaning of their plots, ahead of the fire season, will open in two days. He added that the government is proceeding with the hiring of 2,500 seasonal firefighters.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister praised the performances and achievements of Greece\u2019s national football team, as well as to athletes Emmanouil Karalis and Miltiadis Tentoglou.\n\nReferring to Greece\u2019s national football team\u2019s recent victory over Scotland\u2019s team he stated: \u201cMore moving than their performance is the image of a team\u2014of a family\u2014united in harmony and discipline, which elevates their talent.\u201d \u201cCongratulations to all the athletes and their coach!\u201d",

Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nUnsurprisingly, oil prices were down sharply on the day. Lower oil prices may could offer some relief to consumers, perhaps explaining the rise in other sectors, but the reasons for the price decline may not ultimately be a great sign for the economy overall.\n\nA weak jobs report, tariff threats, and Russia\n\nThis morning, the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) jobs report for February was released, coming in far below expectations. Private sector jobs added were just 77,000, down from the 186,000 added in January and well below the 144,000 that was expected.\n\nThe big miss was likely caused by the same factors that has caused a recent downturn in consumer sentiment, as well as reductions in estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) growth: tariff uncertainty, along with cuts to government spending and the laying off of large swathes of federal workers.\n\nThese rapid-fire changes have upended the prospects of economic growth in the near-term and increased the possibility of stagflation, since tariffs raise prices to consumers while also harming economic activity and lowering business confidence.\n\nOil rig at sunset.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAnother possible headwind to these three stocks is that the Trump administration has said it would likely counter price increases from tariffs by \"unleashing American energy,\" thereby lowering energy prices for consumers. For instance, just today, the Trump administration's Department of Energy approved an extension of Exxon's Golden Pass LNG export terminal.\n\nThe problem for energy stocks is that while lower regulations would be a tailwind for production growth, increased supply could also cause lower prices, counteracting those lower costs and leading to a potential overall negative impact to profits.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, there is also the possibility that another big source of global oil supply may come online soon in a bigger way: Russia.\n\nTwo days ago, it was reported that the Trump administration had directed officials to draft a proposal on lifting sanctions on Russia, which would likely come in conjunction with a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. Then yesterday, Russian officials said ending the war would be conditional on those sanctions being relieved.\n\nRussia is obviously a big oil producer, and while it has been able to sell oil via some workarounds amid sanctions put on by the Biden administration, full sanctions relief could make it easier to sell to more countries, and thereby receive better prices. Increased competition in currently sanctioned countries could lower the overall price of Brent Crude, which is the price at which Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have been realizing.\n\nSlowdown or no?\n\nEnergy stock shares did rebound off their lows later in the day, as did most stocks, after the administration announced a one-month pause in tariffs for automakers who complied with the 2020 USMCA agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada during the trading day.\n\nThat being said, the chaotic tariff announcements, delays, and backpedals are clearly causing employers to slow down hiring amid all the uncertainty. Judging by recent data, an economic slowdown appears to be happening. Whether it turns into a recession or amounts to just a growth scare remains to be seen.\n\nLower oil prices may be good for consumers, assuming they still have a job, but it won't be great for these oil giants. While these three may see some relief on regulations and costs, the offset of lower oil and gas prices may more than compensate for it.\n\nEnergy investors therefore need to hope for a pickup in growth once the economy digests all the tariffs, federal layoffs, and perhaps the relaxation of Russian sanctions in the first few months of the new Administration.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ExxonMobil wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nBack then, the show was heavily focused on the biggest media companies and how Jim Cramer ranked each one. He also discussed some of the biggest losers and winners of the post-pandemic stock market.\n\nIn the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a closer look at the current status of the Magnificent Seven stocks, offering insight into both their market positioning and how the White House\u2019s stance seems to be shifting.\n\n\u201cFirst, I can\u2019t be sure that Trump has changed, but I do believe that he\u2019s never lost sight of the markets and he watches the business channels.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Was Jim Cramer Right About These 13 Stocks? And Did Jim Cramer Nail or Miss These 14 Stocks?\n\nCramer emphasized that his analysis is not political, rather, it is a \u201cclear-eyed\u201d assessment of what the president aims to achieve. According to Cramer, Trump is pushing for more jobs and manufacturing within the U.S., even if it means sacrificing access to cheap goods from overseas. Turning his attention to the Magnificent Seven stocks, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cEverybody knows the Magnificent Seven is not so magnificent anymore\u2026 But as I said over and over again, you simply can\u2019t count these stocks out.\u201d\n\nHe explained that these stocks still hold significant value despite their significant drops from their peak highs. For Cramer, these companies are not to be dismissed lightly. He mentioned that six of them are part of his Charitable Trust, making them especially relevant to his analysis. He noted that some serious damage had been done to the group.\n\nAs Cramer continued his commentary, he pointed out that analyst sentiment toward the Magnificent Seven has become more positive after a year of skepticism. However, he highlighted that only Amazon and Nvidia have truly favorable setups at the moment. For the others, it remains to be seen what the future holds. Regardless of their uncertain outlooks, Cramer noted one important factor common to all these companies: as their stock prices fall, they actually become more affordable.\n\n\u201cTheir stocks actually truly do get cheaper as they go lower, and that\u2019s more than I can say for many others that have held up well during this exceedingly difficult period.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on April 4, 2024. We then calculated their performance from April 4th, 2024, market close to March 26th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nPlease note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, was brought up by a caller during the show. Cramer noted its strength even after a weak earnings report, but advised caution due to the stock trading at its highs at the time:\n\n\u201cI saw the stock up on a bad day even though they admitted last night that they missed the numbers pretty big. What does that tell you about what can happen here? Now it is at a high. We don\u2019t buy at a high; we wait for a 3 to 5 to 7% pullback. We buy at those levels. But you are a winner and you\u2019ve recommended a winner.\u201d\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been very underwhelming, slipping by 1.21% since the episode.\n\nThis underwhelming performance has also forced Cramer to turn bearish on the stock. Here\u2019s what he said on the 6th of February:\n\n\u201cYou know, look, frankly, I\u2019d rather see you in Chevron if you could do that\u2026 but I, no, we wanna stay away from Exxon\u2026 It\u2019s just, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not where the action is.\u201d\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The S&P 500 fell 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite decreased by 2.7%, marking one of the worst weeks in recent years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and parts contributed to market volatility. Automotive stocks were notably impacted; General Motors GM tumbled over 7%, and Ford F slid 3.9%. Conversely, electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla TSLA edged up 0.4%, as their U.S.-based production is less affected by the tariffs.\n\nBeyond the auto sector, economic indicators added to investor unease. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4% in February, bringing the annual rate to 2.8%, above the Fed's 2% target. Additionally, consumer spending data fell short of expectations, exacerbating fears of economic slowdown amid President Trump's tariff policies.\n\nBenzinga provides daily reports on the stocks most popular with investors.

            "content": "Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is followed with almost religious zeal on Wall Street. When he openly backs a company, it often leads others to buy that stock without question. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) has received Buffett's support. But most investors looking for energy exposure would probably be better off with one of these two oil giants (one of which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, too).\n\nWhat Buffett did for Oxy\n\nIt may seem like a lifetime ago at this point, but in 2019 Chevron (NYSE: CVX) was attempting to buy Anadarko Petroleum. Occidental Petroleum, often just known as Oxy, stepped in with a counteroffer. In the end, Oxy won out thanks to Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway providing it with the financial assistance it needed to outbid Chevron. Chevron chose to walk away instead of getting into a bidding war that might lead to overpaying for Anadarko.\n\nThe deal left Oxy heavily in debt, and when oil prices plunged during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the company cut its dividend. The dividend is not yet back to its pre-cut level. This isn't to suggest that Oxy is a bad energy company. In fact, it has been working on expanding its business and doing a reasonably good job of it. It recently bought CrownRock, for example, further expanding its position in the U.S. market. But many long-term investors won't be well served by the company's approach, particularly if creating a reliable and resilient income stream is part of the goal of buying an energy stock.\n\nDecades of proof from ExxonMobil and Chevron\n\nIncome investors who care about dividend consistency will find ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron much more attractive. ExxonMobil has increased its dividend annually for 42 consecutive years, while Chevron's streak is up to 37 years. A notable difference between Oxy and these two integrated energy giants is found on the balance sheet.\n\nWhile Oxy's debt-to-equity ratio has fallen dramatically since the post-Anadarko spike, it is still multiples of the levels of leverage at ExxonMobil or Chevron. This is important because ExxonMobil and Chevron take on debt during industry downturns to support both their businesses and their dividends. Having ample leeway to do this protects their shareholders. Oxy doesn't have as much leeway.\n\nFurther adding to the attractiveness of ExxonMobil and Chevron are their size and diversification. With operations spanning from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemical and refining), their business models help to soften the normal peaks and valleys of the energy cycle. Add in global footprints and market caps of $500 billion for ExxonMobil and $290 billion for Chevron, and they have a scale and reach (business-wise and financially) that $45 billion-market-cap Oxy really can't match.",

            "content": "BOONE, N.C. \u2013 Old Dominion baseball split its doubleheader at App State on Saturday. After dropping the first game of the twin bill 6-1, the Monarchs avoided the Sun Belt series sweep with a 7-6 victory in the second game.\n\nSaturday was changed to a doubleheader after Sunday\u2019s forecast showed signs of showers throughout the day.\n\nGame One\n\nThe Monarchs (8-17, 4-5 Sun Belt) opened the scoring in the top of the second as Maverick Stallings hit his first home run of the season, a two-out solo shot that just cleared the wall to the right of the batter\u2019s eye.\n\nThe Mountaineers (14-13, 5-4) quickly tied the game in the home half of the second. Braxton Church drew a leadoff walk and Juan Correa reached on an ODU fielding error. Tyler Lichtenberger then knotted the game at 1-1 with an RBI base hit to center field.\n\nApp State added to its lead with a Kameron Miller two-run homer in the bottom of the third. The hosts then went up 6-1 with another three runs in the fifth inning. Joseph Zamora singled, stole second, took third on a wild pitch, and scored on a Miller single through the left side. Correa then belted a 2-1 pitch over the wall in left center.\n\nDylan Brown (2-1) received the loss after giving up six runs, five of them earned, on eight hits and one walk. He had five strikeouts in five innings pitched. Ethan Hubbell shut out the Mountaineers for three innings, holding them to two hits and one walk with four strikeouts.\n\nODU failed to get a base runner after the fourth inning. TJ Aiken led ODU at the plate with a 1-for-2 outing. Zach Leite went 1-for-3 and was hit by a pitch, Maverick Stallings also went 1-for-3 with the long ball, Kainen Jorge doubled in a 1-for-4 outing, and Tyler Zedalis also went 1-for-4 for the team\u2019s other hit.\n\nGame Two\n\nOld Dominion was the first to score again in the second game, this time on a leadoff home run by Aiken in the top of the first. The Monarchs looked to add to their lead as Scotty Young and Leite both walked, but Young tried to advance on a Kainen Jorge fly out to left and was tagged out when he over slid third base. Leite advanced to third on a wild pitch and Luke Waters earned a base on balls, but he was thrown out at second to end the inning.\n\nIn the second inning, Stallings hit a one-out double to right field and Jack Slater singled through the left side to put runners on the corners, but Kyle Edwards grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. App State then pulled ahead 2-1 on a Riley Luft two-run homer in the bottom of the frame.\n\nODU pulled even in its next turn at the plate. Young singled to left, advanced to third on a wild pitch, and raced home on another wild pitch. App State again had an answer though as Graham Smiley drove in two runs with a base hit in the home half of the second.\n\nThe Monarchs moved ahead, 5-4 with three runs on four hits in the top of the fourth. With two outs and runners on the corners, Young collected an RBI with a base hit to right. Leite then tacked on two more with a double to right.\n\nNeither side scored again until the bottom of the eighth when Dillon Moquin tied the game at 5-5 with an RBI single through the right side. Leite and Jorge put together a pair of one-out doubles in the ninth to give ODU a 6-5 lead, and Tahraun Hammond poked a ball to right for an insurance run.\n\nThat proved to be a critical hit as, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Smiley doubled to left center and trotted home on a Riley Luft single to right field. Bailey Matela got the next batter to ground out to second though to bring the game to a close.\n\nMatela (1-1) got the win after holding the Mountaineers to one run on three hits and a walk in 1.2 innings in relief. Blake Morgan went five innings and was tagged for four runs on six hits and a pair of walks. He recorded five strikeouts in the no decision.\n\nLeite (3-for-3) doubled twice, walked twice and drove in two runs. Slater (3-for-4) doubled and score once, Young (2-for-3) had a couple of walks with two runs and one RBI, Aiken (2-for-5) hit his fourth home run of the season and contributed two runs, and Hammond (1-for-2) drove in the deciding run.\n\nThe Monarchs round out their five-game road trip this Tuesday when they travel to Charlottesville for a 6 p.m. meeting with Virginia.",

            "content": "We recently published the best retirement portfolio for a 65-year-old. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other stocks in the best retirement portfolio.\n\nThe American retirement system is feeling the strain, with challenges like shrinking fees, underfunded plans, and an aging population slowing down industry growth. Over the last decade, 401(k) expense ratios have declined by a third, according to a PwC report, and recordkeeping fees dropped 8% between 2015 and 2019, making it harder for retirement firms to stay profitable. Some companies have had to merge or shut down, but there is still a big opportunity. Businesses that offer better retirement benefits, financial advice, and affordable plans for small companies could attract more people and unlock an extra $5 trillion in retirement savings.\n\nThe urgency is real. A quarter of US adults have no retirement savings at all, and only 36% feel on track. Even those who are saving may not have enough. For people nearing retirement, between the ages of 55 to 64, the median savings of $120,000 might provide less than $1,000 a month for 15 years. This is hardly enough, especially with longer life expectancies and rising healthcare costs.\n\nFor most Americans, retirement means either living off of savings or finding ways to generate passive income. While some can count on Social Security or a pension, many have to plan their own financial future. Savings usually involve withdrawing money over time, while passive income could mean anything from rental properties to online businesses. Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, believes dividend-paying stocks can be a game-changer. Instead of selling stocks to make money, retirees can rely on regular dividend payments, helping stretch their savings.\n\nDividends have been a huge part of stock market returns, making up about 45% of the broader market's total gains since 1900. But despite their importance, they are often overlooked when planning for retirement, especially as baby boomers look for reliable income sources. According to Thornburg Investment Management, retirees typically fund expenses through either a total return approach, investing for growth and selling assets as needed, or a high-income approach, relying on high-yield investments for steady income. The first risks selling in down markets, while the second limits portfolio growth. A better strategy combines both; investing in stocks that not only pay dividends but also increase them over time can provide a steady income while allowing retirees to grow their wealth. Unlike bonds with fixed returns, dividend stocks can grow income, offering both stability and long-term financial growth. Over 30 years, dividend income has outpaced bond payouts, making it a strong option for retirees. With that investing strategy in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the best retirement portfolio for a 65-year-old.",

            "content": "Last year, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Loper Bright decision put an end to \u201cChevron deference,\u201d a judicial practice of deferring to federal agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. While the legal blogosphere has spent considerable ink weighing the impact of Loper Bright, the Supreme Court recently rejected a pair of petitions on the amount of deference owed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), casting an even longer shadow over Loper Bright. So, what can we learn from the Supreme Court\u2019s inaction?\n\nDiffering Sources of Deference\n\nIssued in 1984, Chevron created a \u201cbedrock principle of administrative law that a reviewing court must defer to a federal agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute it administers.\u201d According to Kent Barnett and Christopher J. Walker in Chevron in the Circuit Courts, Chevron was \u201cone of the most cited Supreme Court decisions of all time.\u201d Under Chevron, a court would first determine whether a statute clearly answered a particular question. If it did, the court would simply apply the statute\u2019s answer. If the statute was \u201csilent or ambiguous,\u201d however, the court would defer to the interpretation of the federal agency charged with enforcing the statute if the agency\u2019s interpretation was \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d\n\nLoper Bright put an end to Chevron\u2019s reign, however, holding that deference to an administrative agency violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because courts and judges were supposed to interpret statutes unless a statute specifically reflected Congressional delegations of discretionary power to the federal agency. In other words, if Congress specifically delegated authority to agencies to promulgate regulations and relevant definitions, Loper Bright appeared to leave that deference intact. After all, in those situations, Congress, not Chevron, required courts to defer to agencies. If Congress did not make that delegation, however, a court, not the agency, was responsible for interpreting an ambiguous statute.\n\nThe NLRB is supposedly one of those agencies Congress tapped to promulgate regulations and relevant definitions for the NLRA. Indeed, the Supreme Court noted in Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, years before Chevron, that Congress had made a \u201cconscious decision\u201d to delegate to the NLRB \u201cthe primary responsibility of marking out the scope of the statutory language.\u201d Similar delegations to federal agencies exist in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), and the recently passed Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the PUMP Act.\n\nSo, Loper Bright should have little impact on the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA and other labor statutes, right? Not so fast. Reasonable minds, like the Sixth and Ninth circuits, might disagree.\n\nCircuital Thinking\n\nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s Approach\n\nThe dispute started in the Ninth Circuit between a group of hospitals and their employees\u2019 union. Per the collective bargaining agreement, the hospitals deducted union fees from participating employees if the employees executed a written assignment authorizing the deduction. After the collective bargaining agreement expired, the hospitals continued to deduct dues for several months but then stopped. They notified the union that they believed the written assignments violated the Taft-Hartley Act because the union\u2019s assignments did not have specific language regarding revocability upon the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe union filed an unfair labor practice charge, the NLRB filed a complaint, and an administrative law judge determined that the hospitals committed an unfair labor practice by unilaterally ending the practice of collecting union dues. After a series of decisions, the NLRB determined that the Taft-Hartley Act did not require specific language and found that the hospitals engaged in unfair labor practices. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the NLRB\u2019s decision.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court issued Loper Bright, the hospitals petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Ninth Circuit improperly deferred to the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA instead of performing its own statutory analysis.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s Approach\n\nThe Sixth Circuit took a slightly different approach. There, a union and a road paving company began negotiating a collective bargaining agreement. When negotiations broke down, the union began picketing. As negotiations continued, the union requested information from the company regarding bargaining unit employees. However, the company did not provide that information, and the union filed unfair labor practices charge against the company based on picketing violations and the failure to provide that information. The NLRB brought a complaint, and an administrative law judge issued a decision finding that the company violated the NLRA by refusing to provide the employee bargaining unit information. The NRLB affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision.\n\nOn appeal, the Sixth Circuit, citing Loper Bright, declined to defer to the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA and decided to exercise independent judgment in deciding whether an agency acted within its statutory authority. Performing its own analysis, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the NLRB\u2019s decision.\n\nThe company petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, arguing, in part, that the Sixth Circuit was required to defer to the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA pursuant to Loper Bright. The company also was seeking to challenge the president\u2019s removal authority, and may have made its Loper Bright argument to sweeten the deal for Supreme Court review (since both the NLRB and Sixth Circuit reached the same result on statutory interpretation).\n\nSupreme Inaction\n\nGiven these two apparently conflicting interpretations of Loper Bright, it seemed the Supreme Court was primed to clarify the appropriate approach. Was the Ninth Circuit correct in deferring to the NLRB\u2019s analysis of the NLRA or was the Sixth Circuit correct in adhering to Loper Bright\u2019s direction that it decide the meaning of ambiguous statute? At any rate, certainly a circuit split requires Supreme Court review?\n\nApparently not. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in both cases without any clarifying statement, leaving it unclear whether Loper Bright will impact NLRB or other agency decisions in the future. So, what does this mean? On one hand, in both cases the federal circuit courts ultimately affirmed the NLRB\u2019s decisions, albeit after performing different analyses. Maybe the Supreme Court was unwilling to wade into these waters if both courts ultimately reached the correct decision. On the other hand, were these simply cases where the statutory text was unambiguous, such that agency interpretations were not even truly implicated?\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re left to wait until the next dispute. Perhaps time will tell, even if the Supreme Court won\u2019t. In the interim, Bradley is available to answer any questions you might have regarding new administrative rules or decisions.",

And I will say that over and over \u2014 general funds, general funds, general funds.\"\n\nRichmond's pension liabilities have been a growing concern, with current payment schedules stretching into 2044 at a total projected cost of $652 million, including $260 million in interest.\n\nKristen Schumacher Nascimento, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers' lead researcher, framed the proposal as an opportunity for Richmond to stabilize its finances while reducing reliance on Chevron, which currently accounts for about 15 percent of the city's revenue.\n\nKristen Schumacher Nascimento, IFPTE's lead researcher, gave a presentation during the March 25, 2025 Richmond City Council meeting.\n\n\"When you have short-term infusions of money, you can use that to pay down long-term debt,\" Nascimento said. \"If you were to do this, you'd pay off the liabilities by 2035 and eliminate that expense from the city's payroll budget, creating permanent savings.\"\n\nNascimento said Richmond is currently spending $33 million every year on pension payments.\n\n\"By paying down the debt sooner, we can free up that money for services like public safety, road repairs, and staffing. That's money we can redirect to the things residents need without having to raise new revenue,\" Nascimento said.\n\nDepending on the year, the proposal would increase the city's annual payment to the California Public Employees Retirement System from $6 million to $22 million.\n\nSupplemental Pension Payments\n\nThe green area shows the additional amount needed for a 10-year UAL payment schedule.\n\nThe proposal, introduced by Councilmembers Claudia Jimenez, Doria Robinson, and Sue Wilson, would direct city staff to collaborate with IFPTE Local 21 to study using the settlement to expedite repayment of Richmond's $392 million in unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nIf approved, the city could save an estimated $117 million in interest payments over two decades, freeing up $33 million annually for city services once the debt is eliminated, according to a presentation by IFPTE Local 21, a union representing city employees.\n\nCouncilmember Wilson sought to clarify the mechanics of the proposal. \"If we use that money to pay down the CalPERS debt over the next 10 years, we simultaneously free up $33 million annually that we are currently paying into the pension system,\" Wilson explained. \"That means more funding for city services like infrastructure, public safety, and staffing\u2014not just for the next decade, but for the next 20 years.\"\n\nPublic comment revealed divided opinions on the proposal. Some speakers, including union representatives, supported the move as a prudent financial decision, while others argued that the funds should be directed toward immediate community needs.\n\nCouncilmember Jamelia Brown argued that the settlement was originally promised for public services and infrastructure improvements, not financial restructuring.\n\n\"This settlement is the people's payday,\" Brown said. \"It's not just about balancing the books \u2014 it's about prioritizing people now, not in 10 or 20 years. We told residents these funds would go to fixing roads, improving youth services, and increasing public safety. Now we're shifting the conversation to debt relief, and that's not what people expected.\"\n\nEmma Ishii, a Local Policy Coordinator with Asian Pacific Environmental Network, spoke in support of the proposal. She highlighted APEN's work with Asian immigrant and refugee Richmond residents on environmental justice campaigns, most recently the Polluters Pay campaign that led to the settlement between Chevron and the city.\n\n\"Richmond residents deserve to see all of the options available to them and weigh in on how these are spent,\" Ishii said. \"APEN will be advocating for the city to continue making decisions on settlement funds in an open and democratic manner that empowers Richmond residents as much as possible.\"\n\nRichmond Police Officers Association President Ben Therriault expressed general support for paying down liabilities but raised concerns about how the issue was presented on the agenda.\n\n\"I think it should be a little bit more transparent, and all the unions should be a part of it,\" Therriault said. \"Especially the unions if they're in negotiations currently, to make sure that the city upholds its end by bargaining in good faith.\"\n\nThe council voted 6-0, with Councilmember Sohelia Bana absent, to direct staff to collaborate with IFPTE Local 21 and analyze potential strategies.\n\nIf you are not a subscriber, please consider supporting local journalism with a Grandview Independent subscription.

These two blocks already have environmental impact studies approved, Greece said.\n\nThe two new blocks now essentially double the total area for exploration to 47,000 sq km (18,147 square miles).\n\nThe new areas that Chevron looks to explore are next to blocks where the other U.S. supermajor, ExxonMobil, is already exploring for oil and gas.\n\nChevron\u2019s latest expression of interest is a vote of confidence for Greece and the attractive investment opportunities it offers, Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said.\n\nGreece has been looking to boost its domestic energy supply by installing renewables and boosting offshore gas exploration after the energy crisis of 2022 and the halt of Russian pipeline gas supply to most EU countries.\n\nGreece has been hoping that its waters could hold giant natural gas resources, similar to the ones discovered in the Eastern Mediterranean offshore Egypt and Israel.\n\nIn October of 2024, Greece said that a consortium led by ExxonMobil had successfully completed the first exploration phase southwest of the Greek island of Crete and decided to proceed with the second exploration stage. The second exploration phase is expected to last three years, and its minimum requirement pertains to completing the collection and assessment of 3D seismic data.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "The Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy has officially accepted a request from U.S.-based energy company Chevron to explore hydrocarbons in two new marine areas south of Crete.\n\nChevron, the second-largest private American energy company globally, has shown interest in researching two marine blocks, South Crete I and South Crete II, located in areas published by the Greek government through an international tender back in 2014.\n\nThese blocks are within Greece\u2019s alleged exclusive economic zone, but their location might be a point of contention with T\u00fcrkiye, lead to concerns that the exploration might exacerbate tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nChevron\u2019s hydrocarbon exploration proposal\n\nAccording to a statement from the Ministry of Environment and Energy, Chevron\u2019s request to explore for hydrocarbons in these two blocks in the southern region of Crete has been met positively.\n\nThe ministry added that it will soon take a decision on the type of contract to be signed and proceed with an international tender process to further formalize the agreement.\n\nThe ministry also mentioned that Chevron had previously shown interest in working in the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, further indicating the company\u2019s growing interest in the Mediterranean energy market.\n\nIf T\u00fcrkiye did not assert its claim in the eastern Med, this is what Greeces EEZ would look like. T\u00fcrkiye has described this as illegitimate. (Map via TRT World)\n\nChevron\u2019s expanding presence in Greece\u2019s energy market\n\nIn response to Chevron\u2019s interest, the Ministry of Environment and Energy has confirmed the acceptance of their proposal and will proceed with the issuance of official decisions regarding the exact coordinates, contract type, and an international tender for the project.\n\nAdditionally, the areas have already been subjected to an approved Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment, ensuring the exploration meets necessary regulatory standards.\n\nChevron\u2019s interest in these areas is seen as a positive development for Greece\u2019s energy sector, which aims to reduce its dependency on foreign energy sources and boost its energy security. This decision to allow Chevron to explore the areas south of Crete follows a similar proposal recently reaffirmed by the company for the southern Peloponnese region, accepted earlier by former Minister of Environment and Energy, Thodoris Skilakakis.\n\nFrom T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s perspective, the exploration of these areas by Chevron may be seen as an infringement on its rights over the contested waters.\n\nAnkara, which has also pursued energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean, has long objected to Greece\u2019s claims over maritime zones, particularly in areas surrounding Crete and other nearby islands. Ankara maintains that these areas fall within T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s own maritime jurisdiction, and has argued that Greek exploration activities are a violation of international maritime laws, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). As such, the involvement of major foreign companies like Chevron in these disputed regions could be perceived by T\u00fcrkiye as a challenge to its sovereignty and territorial rights.\n\nFatih and Kanuni drilling ships are seen as Kanuni drilling vessel completed the flow test of Turkali-2 well at Sakarya Gas Field, in Zonguldak, T\u00fcrkiye on Jul. 29, 2021 (AA Photo)\n\nMinister Papastavrou\u2019s statement on Greece\u2019s energy future\n\nGreek Minister of Environment and Energy, Stathis Papastavrou, expressed confidence in the country\u2019s growing role as an energy hub in the Mediterranean. \u201cToday we have a significant and positive development. The Ministry of Environment and Energy accepts Chevron\u2019s interest in the South Crete I and II marine areas. Chevron, the second-largest private American energy company operating in hydrocarbons, is showing ongoing and increasing interest in exploration in our homeland. This is a vote of confidence in Greece,\u201d Papastavrou said.\n\nHe emphasized that this move demonstrates Greece\u2019s appeal as an investment destination, bolstered by a reliable government committed to ensuring stability.\n\n\u201cThis is also a strong indication of the presence of significant natural energy resources, crucial for our country, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Europe.

            "content": "Trump is shaking up energy markets again. The U.S. president just announced a 25% tariff on any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, with the new measure kicking in after April 2. According to The Wall Street Journal, the move is part of a wider effort to cut off funding to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime. Countries like China, which still import Venezuelan crude, could take a direct hit. Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX)\u2014one of the last U.S. firms operating in the country\u2014has been granted a license extension, which keeps its ties to Venezuela alive a little longer.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump accused Venezuela of sending \u201ctens of thousands of high-level and other criminals\u201d into the U.S., calling the action a \u201csecondary tariff.\u201d Brent crude jumped 1.3% on the news, with analysts warning higher prices at the pump may follow.\n\nChevron Gets a Temporary Green Light\n\nThat extension, confirmed by Reuters, lets Chevron continue running its joint ventures with Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA until May 27. It\u2019s a crucial exception. Chevron had previously exported around 200,000 barrels a day under the waiver. Though the company declined to comment, analysts say the extension helps avoid a sharper short-term shock to supply.\n\nWith most Western firms long gone, Chevron has remained one of the few American players on the ground. And for now, it looks like Washington wants to keep it that way.\n\nInvestors React to Oil Risk and Chevron\u2019s Position\n\nExperts like Rapidan Energy\u2019s Fernando Ferreira told the Financial Times this is uncharted territory. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen secondary tariffs before,\u201d he said, warning countries may self-sanction rather than risk losing U.S. trade access altogether. China\u2019s foreign ministry responded coolly, saying the U.S. should \u201cdo more things that are beneficial to the peace, stability, and development of Venezuela and other countries.\u201d\n\nOil prices ticked up slightly on the news, with futures up nearly 1.5%. Analysts believe Chevron\u2019s continued presence could help soften any supply shocks. Meanwhile, Chevron\u2019s stock saw a modest lift as investors bet it can keep navigating the geopolitical minefield\u2014for now.\n\nIs Chevron a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about CVX stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and three Holds. Over the past year, CVX has increased by 10%, and the average CVX price target of $176.64 implies an upside potential of 7% from current levels.\n\nSee more CVX analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Chevron\u2019s Extension Amid Trump\u2019s Tariff Storm. China is biggest consumer of Venezuelan oil\n\nTimothy Gardner, Marianna Parraga, Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON/HOUSTON\n\nEnergiesNet.com 03 25 2025\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday issued an executive order declaring that any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela will pay a 25% tariff on trades with the U.S., while his administration extended a deadline for U.S. producer Chevron (CVX.N), to wind down operations in the South American country.\n\nTrump\u2019s new policy relieves some pressure on Chevron to quickly exit Venezuela after the U.S. Treasury Department on March 4 gave it 30 days to wind down operations. Trump had issued the initial wind-down after he accused President Nicolas Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns.\n\nTreasury said on Monday it would wait seven more weeks until May 27 before terminating a license that the U.S. has granted to Chevron since 2022 to operate in sanctioned Venezuela and export its oil to the United States.\n\nChevron\u2019s extension came hours after Trump announced the new tariff, saying Venezuela has sent \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people to the United States who have a \u201cvery violent nature.\u201d\n\nThe two moves temporarily focus Trump\u2019s pressure on buyers of Venezuelan crude oil other than the United States, such as China, though it is uncertain how his administration will enforce the tariff.\n\n\u201cThe United States has long abused illegal unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cChina firmly opposes this.\u201d\n\nDavid Goldwyn, president of consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies, said the moves allow a compromise between those in the Trump administration who were concerned about pushing Western companies out of Venezuela and those, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who are concerned about enriching Maduro\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis potentially provides a sweet spot for both of them,\u201d Goldwyn said.\n\nPunishing foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s oil with tariffs could hit its crude exports, forcing price discounts, and have a similar effect to secondary sanctions on the country that Trump imposed during his first term in 2020.\n\nThe extension of Chevron\u2019s wind-down period would secure payments to the company for oil cargoes delivered to U.S. customers, while avoiding a collapse in crude volumes exported from Venezuela in coming weeks, especially to the U.S., according to analysts and sources.\n\nTrump, who has made illegal migration one of the top priorities of his administration, earlier this month invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify the deportation of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua without final removal orders from immigration judges.\n\nChevron said it had no comment.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s government said it firmly and categorically rejected the \u201cnew aggression\u201d announced by Trump.\n\n\u201cThis arbitrary, illegal, and desperate measure, far from weakening our resolve, confirms the resounding failure of all sanctions imposed against our country,\u201d the Venezuelan government said in a press release.\n\nSWITCH TO RUSSIAN?\n\nThe 25% tariff to be imposed on buyers of Venezuelan oil will take effect on April 2 and would be combined with any existing tariffs, according to the executive order. The tariff will expire one year after the country last imported Venezuelan oil, the order said.\n\nThe tariff would apply to countries that buy Venezuela oil through third parties, the order said.\n\nOil prices rose 1% on Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, although the gains were capped as the U.S. extended the wind down period of the Chevron license.\n\nOil is Venezuela\u2019s main export and China, which is already the subject of U.S. tariffs, is the largest buyer. In February, China received directly and indirectly some 503,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude and fuel, some 55% of total exports.\n\n\u201cWe call on the United States to stop interfering in Venezuela\u2019s internal affairs and abolish illegal unilateral sanctions against Venezuela,\u201d said the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.\n\nIndia, Spain, Italy and Cuba are other consumers of Venezuelan oil.\n\nTariffs imposed by China on imports of certain types of Venezuelan oil in past years led to a decline in the volume of Venezuelan crude received by Chinese buyers, which ultimately forced state company PDVSA to widen price discounts to its most important market.\n\nRubio this month said foreign buyers of Venezuelan oil would be notified of a policy change, but many joint-venture partners of PDVSA continued taking cargoes, according to company documents.\n\nPDVSA is also readying a plan to reorganize operations at its largest joint venture with Chevron, the Petropiar project at the Orinoco Belt, and secure oil exports from there.\n\nMaduro has rejected U.S. sanctions, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an \u201ceconomic war\u201d designed to cripple Venezuela. But he has cheered what his government says is the country\u2019s resilience despite the measures.\n\nGoldwyn said the new tariffs could have the ironic effect of increasing global demand for Russian oil. \u201cChina and India are unlikely to risk additional tariffs to access Venezuelan heavy oil, when they can buy Russian crude.\u201d\n\nReporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and Marianna Parraga in Houston, additional reporting by Doina Chiacu and Katharine Jackson and Eduardo Baptista in Beijing; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Marguerita Choy, Nia Williams and Alistair Bell\n\nreuters.com 03 24 2025",

            "content": "The U.S. extended Chevron 's wind-down of oil exports from Venezuela by two months on Monday, after President Donald Trump said that any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela will pay a 25% tariff on any trades made with the United States.\n\nIn an expected move, the Trump administration extended until May 27 the wind-down of a license that the U.S. had granted to Chevron since 2022 to operate in sanctioned Venezuela and export its oil. Chevron is only permitted to export that oil to the United States.\n\nTrump had initially given Chevron 30 days from March 4 to wind down that license after he accused President Nicolas Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns.\n\nChevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump announced a \"secondary tariff\" to take effect on April 2, in a post on Truth Social. The two moves taken together alleviate some pressure on Chevron while putting more pressure on consumers of Venezuelan oil, though it is uncertain how Trump's administration will enforce the tariff.\n\nTrump is imposing the tariff because, he said, Venezuela has sent \"tens of thousands\" of people to the United States who have a \"very violent nature.\"\n\nBenchmark crude oil futures jumped nearly 1.5% on the news of the tariff.\n\nTrump earlier this month invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify the deportation of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua without final removal orders from immigration judges.\n\nChina, which already has been the subject of U.S. tariffs, is the largest buyer of Venezuela's oil, the OPEC member's main export. In February, China received directly and indirectly some 503,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude and fuel, which represented 55% of total exports.\n\nTariff impositions in China on imports of certain types of Venezuelan oil in past years led to a decline in the volume of Venezuelan crude received by Chinese buyers, which ultimately forced state company PDVSA to widen price discounts to continue selling to its most important market.\n\nSpain, Italy, Cuba and India are other consumers of Venezuelan oil. U.S. imports of the oil are set to end May 27.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Maduro's government to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's notice of the tariff occurred days after news that Shell Plc SHEL.L aims to begin producing natural gas at Venezuela's Dragon gas field and exporting it to neighboring Trinidad and Tobago in 2026, a year ahead of the original 2027 start date.",

Roy Rodman Award given by the Norfolk Sports Club to its choice as Virginia's best collegiate coach.\n\nHe will receive the award at the sports club's 78th jamboree on Wednesday, April 23, at Chartway Arena. Former ODU women\u2019s basketball star Nancy Lieberman will be the featured speaker.\n\nManilla\u2019s teams have won four consecutive conference championships \u2013 two in Conference USA and two in the Sun Belt \u2013 and his Monarchs are generally ranked among the top 35 programs in the country.\n\nODU has made the last five NCAA tournaments, a run that began with an at-large bid in 2019.\n\nAn ODU player has been named conference player of the year the last five seasons, and five of the last six years, Manilla has been named conference coach of the year. Five players he coached have participated in the NCAA Singles Tournament, including Sofia Johnson, who ranked as high as No. 7 in the country this spring.\n\nHe says the Norfolk Sports Club Award \u201cis the most meaningful coaching award I\u2019ve ever received,\u201d Manilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a prestigious award and I\u2019m just so grateful and honored.\u201d\n\nThe award, named for the late Portsmouth businessman and philanthropist, has a distinguished list of past winners, including then Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer, Virginia basketball coach Tony Bennett, ODU men\u2019s basketball coaches Paul Webb, Sonny Allen and Jeff Jones and ODU women\u2019s basketball coaches Wendy Larry and Marianne Stanley.\n\nNorfolk Sports Club Vice President Jack Ankerson, who heads the sports club award committee, and Carolyn Crutchfield, ODU\u2019s executive senior associate athletics director, met Manilla at his office to tell him about the award.\n\n\u201cThat was really special for Jack and Carolyn to take the time to do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen she (Crutchfield) called, I was thinking, \u2018Oh no, is there a problem?\u2019 But she told me that all is good, and I was overwhelmed when they told me the news.\n\n\u201cFor Jack to come here and tell me personally, that was so classy.\u201d\n\nManilla, 39, is a native of Nelson County, Virginia who cut his teeth playing tennis. His father, Ron Manilla, is a long-time tennis pro in the Charlottesville area and his brother, Josef Manilla is a former college assistant coach.\n\n\u201cHe has a distinct pedigree as he comes from tennis royalty,\u201d said Bruce Stewart, ODU\u2019s deputy athletic director and COO who is the administrator for men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis.\n\nManilla walked-on at ODU without a scholarship and played for the late Darryl Cummings, the long-time men\u2019s and women\u2019s coach at ODU. He was a young assistant coach at ODU when Cummings announced he would retire.\n\nCummings advised him to leave ODU to gain more experience.\n\nBy then, Manilla had caught the eye of John McEnroe, the fiery former American tennis star who won six Grand Slam singles events. Manilla went to work with McEnroe at his tennis academy on Randall\u2019s Island in New York City.\n\nPart of the interview process with McEnroe was to play a few rounds of tennis with him.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the coolest moments of my life,\u201d Manilla said.\n\nBut then he received a call from Stewart, who told him he was on a short list of people being considered to replace Cummings. Stewart chaired the selection committee that would hire both the men's and women's tennis coaches.\n\nGrey Folkes and Ricky Stevens, for whom ODU's Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center is named, were on the selection committee. The committee selected Manilla as the new ODU women\u2019s coach.\n\n\"Dom was critical because he could connect the dots and was ingrained with the ODU tennis community, as well as past alums,\" Stewart said. \"He had worked and played under Darryl and understood the collegiate tennis landscape.\u201d\n\nManilla praised Dr. Wood Selig, ODU\u2019s director of athletics, who in his first year at ODU, agreed to put more resources into both the men's and women's programs, including restructuring the program by hiring dedicated coaches for both the men and women.\n\n\u201cWood and Bruce, they\u2019ve always had my back,\u201d Manilla said. \u201cThey\u2019ve provided the resources for us to become successful. Wood has been extremely supportive. I couldn\u2019t ask for better bosses.\n\n\"I've always appreciated Bruce's guidance and leadership over the years. His impact, you can\u2019t put into words.\n\n\u201cI would jump through fire for that guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Bruce, if I\u2019m going to coach at ODU, we\u2019re not just going to be good. We\u2019re going to be great,\" Manilla added\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased with what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve worked hard. But I feel like we can get better, that we can and will do more.\u201d\n\nODU\u2019s program is envy of most mid-major schools, and mid-major, is a term he doesn\u2019t like. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve proven we are a power program,\u201d he said.\n\nManilla, now in his 14th season, is 210-94 at ODU and a lot of those victories have come against Power 4 schools. Since 2017-18, ODU has won 29 matches against Power 4 schools, including victories over Baylor, Notre Dame, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Maryland, LSU, Iowa State, Missouri, Wisconsin, Penn State, Georgia Tech, Ole Miss, Florida State, and Kansas.\n\nThe Monarchs defeated South Carolina the last two years in the NCAA Tournament and also defeated Arkansas, 4-2, in the 2021 NCAA Tournament.\n\nVirginia Beach businessman Brad Hobbs, a Virginia Tech graduate and booster, met Manilla\u2019s father when his kids were training in Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cHe asked me, \u2018Do you know my son?\u2019 I didn\u2019t but then I met Dom and began to watch what he\u2019s doing with ODU,\u201d Hobbs said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve since become very involved with ODU tennis. Over the years, I\u2019ve donated about $150,000 to the program and that\u2019s because of Dom. He\u2019s an incredible fundraiser. He\u2019s so passionate about his program and his girls.\n\n\u201cTo have a Top 35 program year after year at ODU is quite an achievement. And it\u2019s all Dom. People don\u2019t understand how hard it is to do that year after year. People don\u2019t understand what he goes up against.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s goes toe to toe with the biggest programs in the country and holds his own. He\u2019s just an amazing coach.\u201d\n\nHis teams have been just as successful in the classroom. Every scholarship tennis player Manilla signed has graduated and generally, his team is among the most successful on campus academically.\n\nWomen\u2019s tennis had the best grade-point-average among ODU\u2019s 18 athletics teams in 2023-24.\n\nManilla has also developed a close relationship with men\u2019s coach Dominik Mueller, whose program has won the last two Sun Belt titles and has also had great success against Power 4 programs.\n\nMueller\u2019s team is ranked 59th nationally, just behind North Carolina and ahead of Northwestern and Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cDominik and I work together well,\u201d Manilla said. \u201cWe feed off each other\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nODU\u2019s Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center, a 74,000 square foot center with eight indoor and 12 outdoor courts, has helped both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s programs compete at the highest level.\n\nFew mid-major programs have such outstanding tennis facilities.\n\n\"I look at the Folkes-Stevens Tennis Facility as a center of champions,\" Stewart said. \"People who've been to watch our men and women play say it's the best place to watch high-level tennis in the Hampton Roads area.\"\n\nManilla hit a home run seven years ago when he hired Yana Sokolenko, who is the associate head coach and a brilliant recruiter.\n\nA native of Minsk, Belarus, Sokolenko speaks fluent Russian and Spanish and four of ODU\u2019s eight players are native Russian speakers.\n\nSokolenko is also a great coach. She was formerly the head coach at Miami of Ohio, where she won two MAC titles in her three seasons, and was the associate head coach at VCU for three seasons.\n\n\u201cDom and Yana, that\u2019s the dynamic duo right there,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThey complement each other very well. And she is a great mentor for these young ladies.\"\n\n\u201cYana has been instrumental in our success in recruiting great players from overseas,\" Manilla aded. \"Having someone who grew up close to where you grew up, someone who speaks your language, that means a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that makes Dom good,\u201d Stewart added, \u201cis how much he cares and is emotionally invested. When you go to any senior day match, and he speaks about his players, you immediately know why he has garnered so much success.\n\n\"He knows his student-athletes on a much deeper level than their mere rankings and he\u2019s got a genuine care and concern about their overall well being.\u201d\n\nManilla is thankful not only for the support he's received from athletics administrators, but also from ODU President Brian O. Hemphill, Ph.D.\n\n\"Dr. Hemphill has been kind enough to have our entire team and the men's teams over to his house after we won Sun Belt championships,\" Manilla said.\n\n\"How many women's tennis teams get that kind of support from their college president? Everyone in our athletics department feels valued and we're so grateful for that.\"\n\nMinium is ODU\u2019s senior executive writer.

            "content": "Argentina\u2019s state oil and gas company YPF has confirmed that Shell and Chevron have completed legal formalities to secure stakes in the Vaca Muerta Oleoducto Sur SA (VMOS) midstream joint venture to develop and operate the $3 billion Vaca Muerta Sur export pipeline transporting oil from the Vaca Muerta shale fields to a new marine terminal on the Atlantic coast.\n\nShell Argentina S.A., Chevron Argentina SRL, and Argentinian independent Pluspetrol S.A. exercised options in December to claim equity in VMOS. They joined initial shareholders YPF S.A. and independents Vista Energy Argentina SAU, Pampa Energ\u00eda S.A., and Pan American Sur S.A.\n\nThe 437-km Vaca Muerta Sur pipeline will transport 180,000 B/D when it enters service at the end of 2026. Throughput is planned to rise to 550,000 B/D in 2027 with a further capacity boost to 700,000 B/D possible after 2028, according to YPF.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Shale Oil Klondike\n\nYPF reported its oil export revenues nearly tripled to $1 billion in 2024. Crude production grew 6% year-on-year to 257,000 B/D, and shale accounted for 122,000 B/D of that, a record 26% increase over 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are reshaping our oil production matrix, leaving conventional mature fields and targeting to increase our shale oil production share from 50% to a minimum of 80%,\u201d YPF\u2019s CEO Horacio Mar\u00edn told analysts at the company\u2019s Q4 earnings call in March.\n\n\u201cIn parallel (by VMOS to develop and operate the new export pipeline) we are \u2026 engaging and consolidating the effort of all major producers in Argentina to ramp up production to provide the forecast throughput,\u201d Mar\u00edn said.\n\nOn 13 March, the day after Shell and Chevron finalized their participation in VMOS, Argentina\u2019s Minister of Economy Luis Caputo announced that Vaca Muerta Sur will be first to receive financial assistance under the Incentives Regime for Large Investments initiated by President Javier Milei in 2024.\n\nEPCM Contract Awarded\n\nMajor contracts already awarded by VMOS include:\n\n\n\nAn EPCM (engineering, procurement, construction, and management) award to Madrid-based engineering firm T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas for the hydrocarbon storage and dispatch terminal at Punta Colorada.\n\n\n\nAnother EPC award to CB&I for engineering, procurement, fabrication, and construction also related to the 630,000-m3 (4-million-bbl) capacity terminal oil storage facility. CB&I is based in The Woodlands, Texas.\n\nThe terminal\u2019s storage facility will comprise five tanks with a 62,000 m3/D dispatch capacity through two monobuoys capable of loading very large crude carriers tankers.\n\nIn a news release in January, T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas reported the contract value of $440 million of which \u201cmore than $70 million will correspond to engineering and project management services,\u201d the release noted. \u201cThe total investment to be made by YPF and its partners for the full implementation of the terminal will be around $1.8 billion.\u201d\n\nWith offices in Spain, Argentina, and Chile, T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas, worked earlier to optimize YPF's conceptual engineering; the firm also helped upgrade YPF\u2019s Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo refinery, its news release noted.\n\nThe Vaca Muerta Sur pipeline starts in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, connecting the Loma Campana oil field to the Allen pumping station in R\u00edo Negro province. From Allen, the pipeline travels to Chelfor\u00f3 and then to the coastal export terminal at Punta Colorada in R\u00edo Negro province.\n\nVaca Muerta Sur pipeline route from the Vaca Muerta shale formation south to Punta Colorada on the Atlantic Coast.

(La Escalonada and Rincon La Ceniza), Shell 45%, and the YPF S.A.-operated Bandurria Sur block (Shell 24.5%).\n\nChevron Argentina SRL owns and operates one concession covering 111,000 acres (450 km2) with both conventional production and Vaca Muerta Shale potential. Another Chevron subsidiary participates in the Loma Campana and Narambuena concessions, covering 73,000 net acres (295 km2) in Vaca Muerta, according to Chevron\u2019s website.\n\nArgentinian independent Pluspetrol acquired ExxonMobil Exploration Argentina in December 2024, absorbing the supermajor\u2019s former assets in Vaca Muerta: Bajo del Choique-La Invernada, Los Toldos I Sur, Los Toldos II Oeste, and Pampa de las Yeguas, as well as a share in the Oldelval pipeline, according to a company statement.\n\nIn terms of Argentina\u2019s technically recoverable shale reserves, the US Energy Information Administration reported 308 Tcf of gas (2nd globally) and 16 bbl of oil (4th globally) in its December 2024 country report.\n\nFor Further Reading\n\nVaca Muerta Shale Drives Argentina\u2019s LNG Export Ambitions by Pat Davis Szymczak, JPT.",

He added, \"We are doing everything to ensure that everyone in Israel and the region has the gas to generate electricity.\"\n\nHe further stated, \"Even during this period, we continued our projects, which were very challenging. We had a floating hotel (Floatel) at the Tamar gas field with 400 contractors working on the platform. At the same time, a pipeline was being laid from the Tamar reservoir to the platform, a distance of 150 kilometers\u2014all in the middle of a war. These are certainly significant achievements.\"\n\nEwing said one of his challenges was bringing contractors to Israel: \"Because of the situation, they didn\u2019t want to come, but thanks to our experience and global connections, we convinced them to arrive.\" He noted, \"We have a project that could increase gas exports to Jordan and Egypt while ensuring Israel\u2019s energy security. We know that Israel can be a leader in the energy sector. From our perspective, there are excellent assets here that we want to continue developing.\"\n\nEwing also spoke about Chevron\u2019s assistance to trauma victims in Ashkelon: \" We contributed to a center that supports youth and trauma victims called My Wave (HaGal Sheli). We provided resources to Tel Aviv University, which runs a program offering aid to trauma victims, including scholarships for social work students. We invested millions of shekels in support for various centers.\n\nFrom an energy standpoint, we must ensure that there is energy security in routine times and emergencies. Clearly, Israel had that security during the war, and Chevron played a significant role in making that happen.\"\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with Chevron",

The officials did not specify how many were alleged Tren de Aragua members or how their affiliations were determined.\n\nMaduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.\n\n\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.\n\nVenezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello walks down a plane after the arrival of 311 Venezuelan migrants at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, on March 20, 2025. Venezuela on Thursday flew home a planeful of its citizens from Mexico, most of them U.S.-bound migrants whose journey came to a premature end as Washington cracks down on undocumented immigrants. PEDRO MATTEY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nTren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.\n\nCBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.\n\nMaduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nIn recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

The Monarchs (7-14, 3-3 Sun Belt) had an opportunity to do some damage in the bottom of the second inning. After Zach Leite singled through the right side, Efrain Morales hit a ball back towards Roberts. The junior right hander looked to erase Leite with the force at second, but his throw was too high for second baseman Kaleb Freeman. ODU couldn\u2019t take advantage though as Tanner Schaedel and Kainen Jorge both flied out and Maverick Stallings went down swinging.\n\nMorgan shut out the visitors for five innings and racked up a season high nine strikeouts. The Panthers (16-9, 4-2) looked to break through in the top of the third as CJ Blackwell led off with a double down the left-field line and reached third on a sacrifice bunt, but a ground out to short and a strikeout by Morgan kept the visitors in check.\n\nGSU applied pressure again in the fifth with two outs and runners in scoring position after Jae Williams was hit by a pitch and Freeman doubled down the left-field line. ODU\u2019s defense came through again however as Stallings fielded a ground ball and fired over to Schaedel at first base for the third out.\n\nThe Panthers finally got to Morgan in the sixth. With two outs, William Maginnis connected on an 0-1 pitch for a solo home run to left field. GSU then pushed across two more runs in the seventh when ODU brought in Hunter Baynes in relief. Blackwell was plunked, Williams drew a one-out walk, and the pair ran home on a Freeman double off the wall in left center field.\n\nMorales singled through the right side to open up the bottom of the seventh and then moved up to second base on a wild pitch. Schaedel then flew out to center field and Jorge went down swinging before Stallings walked, but ODU came up empty as Tahraun Hammond flew out to right field.\n\nThe Monarchs finally plated a run in the bottom of the ninth as Leite singled to left center and scored on a Schaedel one-out double to the gap in left. ODU couldn\u2019t get any closer as Jorge and Stallings both went down swinging to end the game.\n\nMorgan (2-2) took the loss after allowing one run on four hits and one walk in six complete innings. Leite went 2-for-3 with a walk and a run to lead ODU at the plate. Schaedel finished 1-for-4 with the RBI double, Luke Waters and Morales also hit 1-for-4 on the day, and Stallings went 0-for-2 but walked twice.\n\nNeither side hit well, with the Panthers turning in a combined .188 (6-for-32) clip while the Monarchs hit .156 (5-for-32) as a team.\n\nNext up for ODU is a road game at East Tennessee State this Wednesday. First pitch at Thomas Stadium is scheduled for 3 p.m.",

            "content": "If you are looking to add exposure to the energy sector in your portfolio, you are probably considering Chevron (NYSE: CVX) as an option. It is a very good option, though that has to be explained a little bit because Chevron is almost always a good choice in the energy patch.\n\nHere's why you might want to buy Chevron stock now and hold it for the long term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhat does Chevron do?\n\nChevron is what is known as an integrated energy company. This means that it has operations across the energy landscape, from the upstream (drilling) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). Having exposure to the various segments of the energy industry helps to soften the impact from the biggest problem energy companies face, volatile oil and natural gas prices.\n\nFinancial performance in the upstream is almost entirely driven by the price of energy. The midstream simply collects tolls as it helps to move energy from one place to another. And the downstream uses oil and natural gas as an input, so low oil prices are normally a benefit to the sector's financial performance. All in, oil and natural gas prices still have a material impact on Chevron's business, but this diversification across the energy industry helps to dampen the performance swings.\n\nAlthough a U.S. company, with a material domestic presence, Chevron has a global portfolio. That helps smooth out its results over time as well, as it can invest in the areas where it sees the most opportunity and sell into regions where there is the most robust demand and strongest pricing. If you are looking for an energy stock, Chevron always covers a lot of ground.\n\nWhy buy Chevron today?\n\nJust using the integrated business model, however, isn't enough to make an energy company a buy. Indeed, Chevron has more positive attributes to appreciate. For example, it has increased its dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. That's an impressive streak given the inherent volatility of the energy sector.\n\nNotably, during the coronavirus pandemic when European peers BP (NYSE: BP) and Shell (NYSE: SHEL) cut their dividends, Chevron was one of the integrated majors that stood by its dividends.\n\nChevron's dividend yield today is also fairly attractive at 4.2%. The yield on offer from the S&P 500 index is a miserly 1.2%, and the average energy stock has a yield of roughly 3.1%. So Chevron is currently offering an attractive, reliable, and growing dividend despite operating in a volatile sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron has a strong financial foundation, including a very modest debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2. A rock-solid balance sheet gives the company the leeway to add leverage during the hard times, which allows it to keep investing in its business and paying that dividend. When the good times return, as they always have historically in the energy patch, management reduces leverage to prepare for the next, inevitable, industry downturn.\n\nThat said, not all is perfect with Chevron. It is attempting to buy Hess (NYSE:HES), and the transaction has been complicated by Hess' business dealing with Chevron's competitors. Failing to close this deal could be a major near-term impediment to the company's production plans, though longer term, if the deal falls through, Chevron will likely just find another company to buy.\n\nNear-term uncertainty is still relatively high right now. But that could be an opportunity for longer-term investors. Indeed, every company eventually goes through hard times, and for well-run companies those weak patches often end up being attractive entry points into the stock.\n\nChevron has been cheaper\n\nChevron is a well-run energy giant that is a pretty good choice just about all of the time if you are looking for energy exposure. Given the inherent volatility of the energy sector, however, the best time to buy it has historically been during deep oil downturns. That's not what is happening today, so Chevron is not as cheap as it has been at times.\n\nFor contrarian investors and those with a deep value focus, it might make sense to wait for a more difficult oil market. But for most others, Chevron is the kind of energy company you buy and sock away in your dividend portfolio for decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chevron wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The Texas-based corporation could be granted an additional sixty days to wind down its operations in Venezuela.\n\nPDVSA has put forward plans to maintain output at crude upgrader Petropiar. (Archive)\n\nCaracas, March 22, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 The Donald Trump administration is considering granting Chevron more time to cease its activities in Venezuela following lobbying efforts by the US oil giant to secure an extension.\n\nIn recent days, company CEO Mike Wirth met with several members of Trump\u2019s cabinet before taking part in a larger gathering of oil executives with the president himself. He reportedly argued for an extension of the existing license. According to Bloomberg, the administration will grant the corporation additional time to close its Venezuela activities.\n\nWirth has repeatedly defended Chevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela but vowed to comply with US Treasury directives.\n\nThe White House and Treasury Department have not officially commented, while a Chevron spokesperson only disclosed that firm executives \u201cmeet regularly\u201d with US officials to \u201cengage constructively on issues\u201d related to the company\u2019s activities.\n\nIn early March, Washington issued General License 41A (GL41A), giving Chevron until April 3 to wind down operations in the Venezuelan oil sector as an escalation of economic pressure against the Caribbean nation.\n\nA Reuters source floated a scenario of a new sanctions policy after the two-month period that would see the US oil giant, and possibly other US corporations, operating in the country while the Treasury Department would target other foreign actors that deal with Venezuela\u2019s oil sector.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was the first to reveal the Chevron lobbying efforts to secure more time before closing its operations in Venezuela. The WSJ\u2019s original report claimed that the Trump administration is \u201cweighing a plan to impose tariffs or other financial penalties\u201d against countries that buy crude from Venezuela.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s electoral victory last November, several think tanks urged officials to leverage energy sanctions to the benefit of US corporations, securing Chevron-type deals for other companies while driving away enterprises from other countries with secondary sanctions.\n\nHowever, any decision to revert Chevron\u2019s withdrawal or allow further firms into Venezuela is bound to encounter fierce opposition from foreign policy hardliners such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. In a phone call with Wirth, Rubio reportedly insisted on Chevron\u2019s pull-out by the April deadline.\n\nChevron holds minority stakes in four joint projects with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA that currently produce around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) combined, roughly a quarter of the South American nation\u2019s total output.\n\nThe company\u2019s renewed agreement with PDVSA following its return to the country was not publicly disclosed. Quoted by OilPrice, former Biden administration official Juan Gonz\u00e1lez claimed that Venezuela only received taxes and royalties from the joint ventures, estimated at around 50 percent of proceeds. PDVSA\u2019s share of dividends would then be destined to offset existing debts or cover operational costs.\n\nChevron\u2019s activities in the country were made possible through a sanctions waiver issued by the Biden administration in November 2022 which allowed Chevron to resume crude extraction and export operations from its Venezuela joint ventures.\n\nGeneral License 41 (GL41) was the Biden White House\u2019s only major departure from the first Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions policy against Venezuela. The South American nation\u2019s all-important oil industry remains heavily constrained by financial sanctions, an export embargo and a raft of other measures aiming to strangle Venezuela\u2019s most important revenue source.\n\nReuters reported that US authorities could extend GL41A by \u201cat least 60 days.\u201d One quoted source stated that, despite the larger wind-down time frame, there was no possibility of reverting the decision to drive the Texas-based energy multinational out of Venezuela.\n\nFor its part, PDVSA is preparing to take over from Chevron the operations at crude upgrader Petropiar. According to Reuters, the state oil firm will ensure diluent supplies and repurpose certain units in order to maintain present output levels above 100,000 bpd.\n\nThe Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government has vowed that the oil industry would continue its recent recovery and appealed for foreign investment.\n\nEuropean companies Repsol (Spain), Eni (Italy) and Maurel & Prom (France), who received a green light from the US Treasury Department to expand operations in Venezuela, are expected to be driven out of the country in the coming weeks as well.\n\nEdited by Jos\u00e9 Luis Granados Ceja from Mexico City, Mexico.",

(AP Photo/Cristian Hernandez, File)\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela will once again accept repatriation flights from the United States carrying its deported nationals after reaching an agreement with the U.S., a Venezuelan official said on social media Saturday.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro suspended flights on March 8, after the U.S. Treasury Department announced the withdrawal of Chevron\u2019s license to export Venezuelan oil.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed with the U.S. government to resume the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants with an initial flight tomorrow, Sunday,\u201d said Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of Venezuela's Assembly and Maduro\u2019s chief negotiator with the U.S.\n\nVenezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the \u201cthe return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nIn his statement, Rodr\u00edguez referred to the deportation by Donald Trump\u2019s government of some 250 Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.\n\n\u201cMigrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nMaduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \u201cWe are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\u201d Maduro said.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.\n\n\u201cYou guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\u201d Maduro said.\n\nTrump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nTren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.\n\nMaduro\u2019s government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nIn recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

ODU captured its first Sun Belt series win of the series and will go for the sweep when the teams return tomorrow for a 1 p.m. first pitch.\n\nGSU\u2019s Kaleb Freeman led off the top of the first with a home run to left center, but ODU starting pitcher Dylan Brown settled down after that and kept the visitors in check until the sixth inning.\n\nODU took over in the bottom of the third inning. TJ Aiken drew a one-out walk and moved up to third on a Kyle Edwards double down the left-field line. Both runners then raced home on a Luke Waters base hit to left, and the senior outfielder proceeded to steal second and score on another double down the left-field line, this time by Zach Leite. After Efrain Morales poked a ball through the left side of the defense and Tanner Schaedel wore a pitch to load the bases, Jack Slater made it a 4-0 lead with a four-pitch walk.\n\nThe Monarchs went up 6-1 in the fifth as Morales doubled to the gap in left before Schaedel hit his second two-run homer in as many days. The guests responded with an Andon Lewis two-run shot in the sixth and pulled to within 6-5 in the eighth as Colin Hynek also hit a two-run blast, but that was all the offense the Panthers (15-9, 3-2 Sun Belt) could muster.\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, Tahraun Hammond earned a base on balls and then touched home on an Edward standup triple to right center. GSU conceded another run as Edwards then trotted home on a Waters ground out to short.\n\nODU then brought in Bailey Matela to face the Panthers in the ninth, and the left-hander retired the side to collect his second save of the season.\n\nBrown (2-0) earned the win and allowed three runs, two of them earned, on seven hits and two walks. He recorded eight strikeouts in six complete innings on the bump. The Lansdale, Pennsylvania native struck out the side in the second inning.\n\nEdwards (3-for-4) had another solid day at the plate and was a home run shy of hitting for the cycle. The Virginia Beach native scored twice, drove in a run and added a walk to his totals. Morales (3-for-4) doubled and scored a run, Leite (3-for-5) contributed an RBI double and a run, and Waters (1-for-5) tallied three RBIs with a stolen base.\n\nThe Monarchs combined to hit .353 (12-for-34), to include .381 (8-for-21) with runners on and .364 (4-for-11) with runners in scoring position.",

The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\n\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, It expects a low double-digit growth rate.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+20.1% vs. +3.8%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\n\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.35 billion people daily. Meta\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\n\n\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\n\n\nChevron\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past six months (+13.5% vs. +6.9%). The company being a fully integrated energy firm is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\n\n\n\nFurther, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\n\n\n\nAnother concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Taylor Devices have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the past year (-24.8% vs. -6.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $99.73 million has seen U.S. sales, which account for 82% of revenues, declined 7%, reflecting softness in domestic demand. Total revenues for the first half of fiscal 2025 was $20.17M, a slight decline from the prior year, while net income and operating income each fell 3%. SG&A expenses increased 7% year over year.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Taylor Devices is positioned for growth, supported by increasing global demand for seismic protection, industrial dampers and defense applications. The company\u2019s backlog expanded to $34.5 million, providing strong revenue visibility into fiscal 2025-26. International sales rose 37%, particularly in Asia.\n\n\n\nIndustrial segment sales climbed 43%, reflecting the broader adoption of vibration control systems in automation and heavy industry. Gross margin improved to 47% from 45%, highlighting pricing power and operational efficiency. A strong balance sheet ensures financial flexibility for expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Taylor Devices here >>>)\n\n\n\nGSI Technology\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry over the past year (-34.5% vs. -32.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $68.36 million is facing challenges which includes an $8.4 million net loss in the first nine months of FY2025, an 11.9% YoY revenue decline, and margin compression to 46.7%. SRAM sales weakness, customer concentration risks and cash burn raise sustainability concerns.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, GSI Technology is expanding its defense AI presence with key U.S. government contracts, including a $0.3 million Army SBIR contract and ongoing Phase 2 projects with the Air Force and Space Development Agency, validating its AI accelerators for military applications.\n\n\n\nThe company operates in the growing HPC and AI markets, with its Gemini-II and Plato chips designed for low-power, high-speed AI workloads. Rising SRAM demand from AI hardware supports revenues, with a major AI customer expected to lead sales in FY2025.

Of course, I do not know the exact path the market will take moving forward, but the best thing we as investors can do is prepare for all the possible scenarios ahead of us, especially the worst case.\n\nIf markets rebound from here, investors can resume the strategies we were all using before, following the AI boom and owning tech stocks. However, in the case of a further downturn and even a possible bear market I have some ideas for how to get defensive and hopefully even turn a profit.\n\nThere is one sector in the market that is showing obvious outperformance over the last week, month and YTD and boasts some of the cheapest companies in the market \u2013 the energy sector. Furthermore, during the most recent bear market, in 2022, energy was a bright spot as investors rotated into real assets and held up performance of the savviest investors. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and National Fuel Gas Co. are three energy stocks I believe can outperform in good times or bad.\n\nChevron Stock Stages Technical Breakout\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest vertically integrated energy companies in the world, Chevron is a juggernaut in the sector that has put up enviable long-term returns. The company also currently pays a 4.2% dividend yield, providing a nice income for patient investors.\n\nChevron currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a mixed earnings revision trend. The company is expected to grow its earnings 17.7% this year and 10.1% annually over the next three to five years. At 15.2x forward earnings, CVX\u2019s valuation is about in line with its long-term median of 13x forward earnings. While fairly valued at the time, the key catalyst which should drive the stock higher is investors seeking some sort of defensive positioning, as these mega cap energy companies boast strong business models and steady cash flows.\n\nAs an investor who follows technicals, Chevron price action is offering clear signals. After consolidating for the last two years CVX stock has broken out of its range, indicating that investors are piling into the stock. Whether the volatility in stock continues or not, CVX appears to be a compelling investment option.\n\nExxon Mobil Stock Outperformed During 2022 Bear Market\n\nExxon Mobil, like Chevron is a mammoth company, diversified across all segments of the industry and provides investors with a steady stream of profits and dividend payments. Premier assets such as these energy companies give investors exposure to real assets, which provide critical services to the world\u2019s economy and become especially scarce when uncertainty is on the rise.",

The changes aim to increase capacity on the 5,500-mile fuel network by discontinuing the shipment of a specific fuel grade. However, this move has faced resistance from shippers such as Valero Corp. and BP, who argue that it would escalate their expenses and introduce operational challenges.\n\nColonial Pipeline, which manages the largest gasoline pipeline in the United States, has defended the plan, suggesting that the adjustments will serve both shippers and the public interest. The pipeline company is preparing to address the objections in a response scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile, other refiners, including Motiva Enterprises LLC, Shell PLC, Marathon Petroleum Corp., and Phillips 66, have also submitted motions to intervene with the regulatory authorities.\n\nAccording to data from the IndexBox platform, the US gasoline market remains a critical component of the national energy infrastructure, with the Colonial Pipeline playing a pivotal role in the distribution network.

AP\n\nAs part of any potential move to extend the license, Trump\u2019s team is working out the details of a plan to levy tariffs or another kind of financial penalty on other countries that buy oil from Venezuela, the sources said.\n\n\u201cChevron executives meet regularly with government officials in Washington to engage constructively on issues related to our business \u2013 both in the US and abroad,\u201d a Chevron spokesperson told The Post in a statement.\n\nThey added that the company conducts its business to comply with global laws and regulations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChevron has warned that leaving Venezuela could open the door for China to tap into its oil resources. The potential tariffs are an attempt to quash any encroaching nations, sources told the Journal.\n\nThe plan was discussed with Trump and Wirth, as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, according to the report.\n\n4 President Trump earlier this month ordered Chevron to wind down its operations in Venezuela within the next 30 days. REUTERS\n\nLutnick reportedly told Wirth that the tariffs could force Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro back to the negotiating table, the Journal said.\n\nThe potential to place more pressure on Maduro could be a convincing factor for Trump, who has been battling to get the Maduro regime to accept migrants who have flooded into the US.\n\nWirth has been lobbying Trump officials after the president issued the decree. He spoke privately this week with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and staffers from the National Security Council, asking for a deadline extension of at least 60 days past the current April 3 deadline, sources told the Journal.\n\n4 Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has reportedly been meeting with White House officials to try to convince them to extend the deadline. REUTERS\n\nRubio told Wirth during a call on Monday that he thought Chevron should wind down operations by the original deadline, sources told the Journal.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have praised Trump for reversing the Biden-era waiver that allowed Chevron to pump oil in the Maduro-controlled nation.\n\nThey have argued that Venezuela\u2019s economy is propped up by Chevron\u2019s operations, and have sought a wind-down to place more pressure on Maduro.\n\n4 President Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns. via REUTERS\n\nTrump accused Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns when he initially announced the 30-day deadline earlier this month.\n\nIt was a stark U-turn from January, when the White House appeared to be making progress with Maduro. White House special envoy Richard Grenell had met with the Venezuelan president and returned with six Americans who had been held prisoner in the nation.\n\nDuring the visit, Maduro had reportedly agreed to accept deportation flights of migrants if oil licenses were kept in place, according to the Journal.",

Christian Rush and Lucas Carmichael had a couple of RBI doubles, and Derek Holmes made it 3-0 with a hit back up the middle. After Jamie Laskofski dropped down a bunt single, W&M pulled off a double steal and Kevin Francella singled through the right side to bring in two more runs.\n\nZach Leite got the Monarchs (5-13) on the board in the second inning with a leadoff home run to right field. The hosts stretched their lead to 7-1 though with another two runs in the fourth. Laskofski drew a leadoff walk, took second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on an Owen Wilson single through the right side. Kainen Jorge\u2019s throw home was off target, and the error allowed Wilson to move up to second. He then raced home as Ben Parker doubled down the left-field line.\n\nODU cut into the W&M lead with a three-run top of the fifth. With one out, TJ Aiken doubled to left center and was able to come home when Jorge reached on a Tribe throwing error. Jorge cut the deficit to 7-3 as Leite doubled to the gap in left. Efrain Morales was hit by a pitch, Tyler Zedalis walked to load the bases, and Evan Holman picked up an RBI with another walk.\n\nThe Tribe answered with three more runs on as many hits in the home half of the fifth to pull away, 10-4. Rush was plunked, took second on a wild pitch, and reached third on a single by Carmichael. Holmes brought him in with a single through the left side, Carmichael would score on a Francella ground out to short, and Laskofski reached on a fielder\u2019s choice and came around on a Charlie Felmlee single up the middle.\n\nIn the sixth, Edwards walked and stole second but was picked off when he tried to extend his lead. Aiken then walked, Jorge doubled to left field, and Leite brought them both in with a hit back up the middle to cut the deficit to 10-6.\n\nODU inched closer with two more runs in the seventh. Holman singled through the left side, Tahraun Hammond was hit by a pitch, and Aiken earned a base on balls to run the bags full. Waters found a hole in the right side of the defense, plating Holman and Hammond to cut the score to 10-8. Waters stole second but was straned after a strikeout and ground out to end the threat.\n\nThe Monarchs went down in order in the eighth and ninth inning as Zach Boyd recorded his first career save for the Tribe.\n\nLeite led ODU with a 3-for-5 day at the plate with a double, homer and four RBIs. Leite is the second Monarch in as many games to nearly hit for the cycle, as Zedalis was a double shy of the cycle in Sunday\u2019s win at Southern Miss.\n\nNick Sulpizio suffered the loss on the mound, while Hunter Baynes and Jayce Park delivered a pair of scoreless multiple inning appearances out of the bullpen.\n\nODU will host Georgia State this weekend for a Sun Belt Conference series at War Memorial Stadium.

            "content": "On 26 February, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to end General License 41, which allowed Chevron to operate in Venezuela despite sanctions. Meanwhile, there are other \u201cspecific licenses\u201d for oil and gas companies at risk. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had created a system to monitor at least part of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry by waiving sanctions for certain American, European, and Indian companies but with strict limitations.\n\nFour corporations that were authorized by licenses or comfort letters\u2014Chevron, Repsol, Maurel et Prom, and Eni\u2014contributed to a production of 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, to the country\u2019s total of 1,068,000 bpd, according to PDVSA, the state-owned energy company. Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries and Harry Sargeant\u2019s Global Oil were also authorized to ship Venezuelan petroleum products.\n\nWhat does it mean if the \u201cChevron License\u201d is over? Is there a way to know who will be the winners and the losers after Trump\u2019s decision? How will the revocation impact the oil market, geopolitics, and the Venezuelan economy?\n\nWe have one benefit. We have seen how financial and economic sanctions were introduced and intensified from 2017 to 2020 under the first Trump term and then how they were eased via licenses under Biden. While there are many more variables at play affecting Venezuela\u2019s politics, economy, and its oil sector, we can form a good understanding of who wins and who loses with tougher sanctions.\n\nWhat was the purpose of the Chevron license? The Chevron authorization, and later the specific licenses, were carefully designed to maximize recouping debt and minimize cash flows to the Venezuelan state in a country with an oil sector that has the highest government take in the world.\n\nRelated: Is the Endgame with Iran About to Begin?\n\nJuan Gonz\u00e1lez oversaw policy towards Caracas under the Biden administration, as National Security Council Director. He was the lead designer of General License 41. He says that the idea was to allow Chevron to recoup its debt while bringing transparency to the sector and limiting cash flows to the Maduro government.\n\n\u201cBefore the Chevron license, Venezuela sold all its oil on the black market, pocketing every dollar. With the license, most of the oil revenue [from joint ventures with Chevron] went to pay off debt, leaving the regime with less money\u2014not more. Revoking it doesn\u2019t punish Maduro; it just drives oil sales back underground, undermining U.S. leverage,\u201d says Gonzalez. Under the license, \u201cthe regime only got taxes and royalties, and the rest went to Chevron.\u201d\n\nMany foreign policy analysts have argued that sanctions can work as a \u201cshock and awe\u201d weapon but that they lose effectiveness over time as targeted states gradually adapt. While some argue that revoking the Chevron license will push oil sales underground, proponents of stricter sanctions believe that cutting off all revenue streams will increase economic pressure on the Maduro government, potentially leading to political concessions.\n\nWho benefits? Corrupt officials like opaque systems.\n\nA strict sanctions environment is where shady intermediaries and corrupt officials are allowed to flourish. The targeted state has no choice but to hide data on production, exports and revenue, at the expense of transparency and accountability.\n\nIn the Venezuelan case, we have seen shadow fleets charging higher freight costs for older, rundown tankers. Shipping companies also had to turn off radars at sea and carry out ship-to-ship transfers. There would also be added layers of separation between PDVSA and the final buyer. Altogether, exports became riskier and more costly, benefitting intermediaries.\n\nCertain PDVSA managers have also profited. There is the infamous corruption scandal where the then Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami flourished under the strictest period of sanctions. In March 2023, it was leaked to Reuters that PDVSA had $21.2 billion in unpaid bills from intermediaries.\n\nEl Aissami managed the oil sector from April 2020 until his downfall in March 2023, when the scandal was uncovered. In that time, he constructed an opaque system to produce and sell Venezuelan oil. He did manage to ramp up output, from a trough of 393,000 bpd in June 2020 to 754,000 bpd when he was forced to resign.\n\nBut with virtually all transactions carried out with cash and crypto, and sales numbers hidden from the public, El Aissami and his associates were able to divert billions of dollars. The final count of all the damages caused is not available to the public.\n\n\u201cGrey market\u201d importers in China buy at a discount\n\nIn a scenario of all-out sanctions, even major Chinese companies shied away from Venezuelan oil. But there are always willing buyers, in black or \u201cgrey\u201d markets, with a low-enough price. And that is the key: in the period from 2019 to 2022, the discount of Venezuela\u2019s Merey to the Brent benchmark could be as high as $35.\n\nPDVSA still exports part of its crude via Malaysia, where it is rebranded, and then on to China. However, their share fell in the last two years as more North American, European and Indian buyers were allowed by the OFAC to enter the market.\n\nIn the book On Sanctions in Venezuela, economists Asdrubal Oliveros and Juan Palacios show that in 2023, the U.S., Spain and India represented 34% of Venezuelan oil exports, while China and Malaysia took 51.6%. In 2024, their shares virtually inverted, with 56.2% going to the first group and 26.8% to the second.\n\nDiluent imports: Iran says \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d\n\nThe Orinoco Oil Belt, the formation with the largest known reserves of crude, has mostly extra heavy oil, like bitumen. It is too sticky even to move through pipelines, so it needs to be mixed with diluents, like gas condensate at a ratio of 3.5 to 1. Later, other petroleum products are needed to refine heavy crude for a final product, like car fuel.\n\nMany of these diluents are produced locally, but a vital share is imported. For decades, the U.S. was the main oil partner, and thus provided the lion\u2019s share. At the toughest point of sanctions, Iran became the sole provider of diluents for Venezuela.\n\nCurrently, there are series of OFAC licenses and comfort letters for U.S., European and Indian companies to swap vital inputs for Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, as a way to pay part of their bill with PDVSA.\n\nHowever, between 2020 and 2022, Iran was the only source of diluents. There really was no one else. In Venezuela, many will remember waiting with anxiety for the arrival of Iranian tankers, also targeted by sanctions themselves, which would be essential to produce car fuel. Many external observers then were shocked to see that a petrostate needed oil imports.\n\nAn Atlantic Council paper shows that from July 2021 and July 2023, Iran gave Venezuela 35 million barrels of condensate, in return for 47 million barrels of crude, with most shipments sent for China at steep discounts. That was not a bad deal for Iran.\n\nWho loses?\n\nThe Venezuelan foreign exchange market might stand to lose the most, and with it the private sector. Chevron, as well as the other oil companies, have to make large payments in bol\u00edvares, such as for taxes, covering the payroll, and purchasing services.\n\nEven while the Venezuelan economy is highly dollarized, many transactions are carried out in the local currency\u2014though using the dollar to set the price. Furthermore, the OFAC licenses authorize companies only to pay in bolivars, as opposed to the greenback.\n\nEnergy corporations thus sell hard currency through private banks, which are then bought by local companies, for example, if they need to buy imports. Without licenses, the market dries up. Corrupt officials such as Tareck El Aissami had no need to trade in their dollars, instead stashing away whatever they do not spend on consumption.\n\nAsdrubal Oliveros, a Venezuelan economist, argued in a radio interview that 85% of the nation\u2019s income comes from oil exports, which would be about $15 billion. \u201cThe net effect [of removing GL 41] is that the country would lose $3.1 billion this year.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some policymakers contend that removing sanctions too soon could provide the Maduro government with financial relief without securing meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nBy Elias Ferrer via Orinoco Research\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "Not all decisions are final regarding the Trump administration's policies on Venezuela's oil sector. But revoking License 41 will lead, in the short and medium term, to a production decline that will make fuel more scarce and the economy weaker\n\nThe U.S. government intensified pressure on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Tuesday, March 4, by revoking Chevron\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela. The Treasury Department gave the oil giant just one month to dismantle its operations in the country. If this measure is extended to other companies\u2014including Spain\u2019s Repsol, Italy\u2019s Eni, and France\u2019s Maurel & Prom\u2014Venezuela\u2019s economy could face a sharp decline in crude oil production, reduced gasoline distribution, a weaker foreign exchange market, devaluation, and soaring inflation.\n\nThis move effectively enforces former Trump\u2019s long-standing warning: \u201cWe will no longer buy oil from Maduro.\u201d He made this pledge repeatedly during his presidential campaign and continued to push for it after taking office. His government justified the sanctions by citing Maduro\u2019s failure to meet two key conditions: deporting Venezuelans from the U.S. and ensuring fair electoral conditions within Venezuela.\n\nEconomic experts and private consulting firms predict that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) measure will have an immediate impact. Consulting firm Ecoanal\u00edtica forecasts a sharp contraction in oil-related foreign currency inflows, estimating a reduction in crude output linked to foreign companies of between 30% and 50% over the next year. The ultimate impact, however, will depend on the Trump administration\u2019s next steps.\n\nEcoanal\u00edtica estimates that Venezuela will face a discount of approximately $1.286 billion when trading its crude oil in opaque markets and through intermediaries to evade U.S. sanctions. This scenario is not unprecedented. When the U.S. imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela in January 2019, PDVSA was forced to sell crude at steep discounts\u2014sometimes as high as 40% per barrel\u2014in informal markets to bypass restrictions. At the time, the country\u2019s oil production plummeted to just 350,000 barrels per day (b/d). That was very far from the 3 million b/d it once produced, which first sunk to around 1 million b/d by the end of 2018 thanks to chavista mismanagement and then at the beginning of 2019 suffered a +300,000 b/d drop linked to the nationwide blackout.\n\nChevron, for instance, managed operations in four key joint ventures: Petrobosc\u00e1n and Petroindependiente in western Venezuela, as well as Petropiar and Petroindependencia in the Orinoco Oil Belt\u2014home to the world\u2019s largest reserves of heavy and extra-heavy crude. Before the OFAC revocation, the U.S. company was producing 219,000 barrels per day.\n\nDespite repeated pledges by the governments of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to diversify Venezuela\u2019s economy over the past 25 years, the country remains almost entirely dependent on oil, with petroleum revenues accounting for 90% of total income. As a result, any disruption to the oil sector has far-reaching consequences for the entire economy.\n\nEcoanal\u00edtica projects a 2% to 3% contraction in GDP by the end of 2025, with a 20% decline in the oil sector. \u201cAll signs suggest that 2025 will be even more challenging than initially expected, with a sharper short-term drop in production and a decline in oil revenues,\u201d the firm reported.\n\nThis downturn is largely due to a further reduction in exports, as PDVSA struggles to secure international buyers without the involvement of its foreign partners, whose participation has depended on licenses granted since November 2022.\n\nOil expert and Central University of Venezuela (UCV) professor Rafael Quiroz Serrano warns of a significant fall in crude oil production, which recently crossed the 900,000 b/d mark according to secondary sources in February\u2019s OPEC monthly report. Oil produced by foreign joint ventures with PDVSA accounts for close to 40% of the total production. \u201cThat\u2019s the alarming reality of this scenario,\u201d Quiroz notes, \u201cif the license revocations extend to European oil companies.\u201d\n\nQuiroz Serrano doubts that PDVSA will be able to take over the operations left behind by Chevron, as it lacks the necessary resources to sustain production at those wells. \u201cPDVSA does not have the financial capacity to invest at the same level as Chevron\u2014or even as Repsol and Eni, which continue to operate but only invest the bare minimum to maintain current production. The reality is that there is no one to replace these companies, which will inevitably lead to a decline in output,\u201d he explained.\n\nVenezuelan regulations require PDVSA to form joint ventures with national and/or foreign partners to operate in the country\u2019s oil sector. By law, PDVSA must hold at least a 60% stake in these ventures, while private partners can own up to 40%. On average, international oil companies involved in Venezuela\u2019s energy market hold a 30% share.\n\nChevron, for instance, managed operations in four key joint ventures: Petrobosc\u00e1n and Petroindependiente in western Venezuela, as well as Petropiar and Petroindependencia in the Orinoco Oil Belt\u2014home to the world\u2019s largest reserves of heavy and extra-heavy crude. Before the OFAC revocation, the U.S. company was producing 219,000 barrels per day.\n\nChevron\u2019s withdrawal from Venezuela comes at a time when the economy is experiencing major macroeconomic problems: a constant devaluation of the local currency and rising inflation.\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, an oil expert and professor at Rice University, highlights another critical economic risk: if all licenses are revoked, PDVSA could struggle to import the diluents necessary for producing gasoline and diesel\u2014fuels essential for the country\u2019s broader productive sectors.\n\n\u201cThis would have a significant additional impact, as PDVSA would be forced to source these diluents from alternative markets or negotiate with other countries, as it previously did with Iran. However, these imports could take time, potentially leading to gasoline shortages in the medium term,\u201d he warned.\n\nIn 2024, Chevron supplied Venezuela with an average of 9,000 barrels per day (b/d) of gasoline and 40,000 b/d of diluents. Meanwhile, domestic fuel consumption stands at 102,000 b/d\u2014far below the 700,000 b/d produced during the oil price boom.\n\nBeyond financial constraints, Monaldi also points to a talent drain as a major obstacle for PDVSA. \u201cFor years, the industry has suffered from a mass exodus of skilled workers, while many others were dismissed for political reasons. Those who remained were often employed by international companies like Chevron, which offered higher salaries to retain staff.\u201d\n\nThe fate of workers in the Chevron-PDVSA joint ventures will also be affected. Iv\u00e1n Freites, general secretary of one of the country\u2019s largest oil unions, who is currently in exile, said that 2,500 workers who earn salaries far higher than those offered on the state payroll will be directly affected. \u201cThe Minister of Hydrocarbons, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, will surely announce that PDVSA will take over the operations Chevron is leaving, but, as always, she will turn a blind eye when salary issues are raised,\u201d Freites stated.\n\nA blow for all pockets\n\nChevron\u2019s withdrawal from Venezuela comes at a time when the economy is experiencing major macroeconomic problems: a constant devaluation of the local currency and rising inflation. This is compounded by the limited availability of international reserves from the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) to address exchange rate instability.\n\nThe U.S. oil company generated $200 million per month in domestic sales, playing a crucial role in meeting Venezuela\u2019s demand for foreign currency.\n\nEcoanal\u00edtica projects that the reduction in foreign currency availability will drive up the exchange rate on the parallel market, pushing the dollar to between 130 and 160 bolivars. This depreciation is also expected to fuel a surge in inflation, potentially pushing it back into triple-digit territory.\n\nVenezuela emerged from a seven-year recession and a three-year period of hyperinflation in mid-2023, during which annual inflation soared into four-digit figures. However, inflation remains a persistent challenge. Former opposition lawmaker and economist Jos\u00e9 Guerra has warned that by 2025, the bol\u00edvar will have lost 30% of its value against the dollar\u2014a collapse he describes as a \u201cmacro-devaluation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween 1999 and 2016, Venezuela received almost a trillion dollars in oil exports and didn\u2019t save a cent; instead, it went into debt,\u201d Guerra noted. He asserted that one of the main effects of the exchange rate hike is that it generates more inflation. \u201cIt is estimated that this year, inflation could exceed 150%,\u201d something that will wreak havoc on the purchasing power of Venezuelan workers, especially pensioners, one of the most vulnerable populations in the country.\n\nAccording to a report by the Venezuelan Finance Observatory, 86% of Venezuelans live in poverty, and remittances and income from self-employment are a fundamental part of Venezuelans\u2019 daily lives.\n\nIf conditions persist, Ecoanal\u00edtica predicts that 2026 will be the year when the greatest impact of what is happening in the oil sector will be observed. \u201cAs has been the constant in the Venezuelan economy, these effects will not be replicated equally across all sectors. Some, such as food and non-alcoholic beverages, the healthcare sector, and even personal care, which aim to meet the population\u2019s basic needs, will become more resilient. On the contrary, others, such as manufacturing, construction, and the automotive sector, which have recently shown a recovery, will be more affected given their greater vulnerability to changes in factors such as consumption, prices, and the exchange rate,\u201d the consulting firm added.",

            "content": "Oil company Chevron recently announced and is advancing plans to develop data centers for greater power generation. While many AI companies are investing in data centers, many oil companies are doing the same. In order to advance the future of energy and oil, Chevron and other oil companies are upping their engineering and need to data centers and energy to supply such endeavors.\n\nChevron to Develop US Data Centers\n\nData centers are basically large server warehouses to produce huge amounts of electricity. While there are some in the US, the total number of data centers is expected to triple over the next three years. Over the past year, tech companies are buying power directly from power plants in order to fuel their AI campaigns. The power sector is seeing immense growth and huge demand due to the push for AI and engineering. In fact, the demand for power currently is at a record high for the past twenty years. But this brings up a large question, if Chevron is an oil company, can\u2019t they produce energy from oil?\n\nLast year both Chevron and Exxon Mobile announced plans for power generation. These data centers will be powered by the oil which Chevron and competitors drill for. Daniel Droog, vice president of power solutions at Chevron said that \u201cthe customer interest is high.\u201d Droog also said \u201cIt\u2019s really trying to intersect where they have that level of need because they\u2019re building new or expanding facilities, at a rate that\u2019s ahead of the power supply.\u201d\n\nNew Data Center Capabilities\n\nNew data centers are generally capable of producing about 20 gigawatts. These data centers, however, are massive. They are about 50 times larger than traditional data centers and a single location can be as large as a mid-sized city. Chevron likely won\u2019t be making their data centers are large or as capable. They are targeting data center sites capable of producing about 1 gigawatt and hope to have it up and running in 2027 or 2028. Droog went on to said \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on scale, speed and reliability.\u201d Droog did now answer questions about customer concerns nor exactly where the data centers will be built. He did indicate that the data centers will likely be in the south or the Midwest.\n\nChevron will be unique in using natural gas to power their data center. Big tech companies are reluctant to the idea due to previous pledges around environmental protection concerns. While Chevron likely won\u2019t produce as much power as competitors, they certainly want to earn a seat at the data center table.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: David Brown; Pexels: Thank You!\n\nThe post Chevron to Develop US Data Centers appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Chevron (CVX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nChevron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.58, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.58 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CVX\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CVX\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Chevron here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Chevron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

            "content": "In this regular update, RCR Wireless News highlights the top news and developments impacting the booming AI infrastructure sector\n\nSoftBank and OpenAI to develop AI agents in Japan\n\nSoftBank plans to convert a former Sharp LCD plant in Osaka, Japan into a large-scale AI data center in collaboration with OpenAI. The site will initially operate with 150 MW of power, expanding to 250 MW by 2028. The facility will host OpenAI\u2019s AI agent base model, with GPUs sourced from NVIDIA and SoftBank\u2019s Stargate Project.\n\nMitsui to acquire hyperscale data center in Japan\n\nMitsui & Co. Asset Management Holdings (MAH) announced plans to acquire an operational hyperscale data center in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan to expand its data center business. The 20 MW facility will be acquired via a holding company, in which MAH will invest JPY18 billion ($120 million) for a 50% stake.\n\nOracle in talks for cloud center in Indonesia\n\nOracle is in discussions with the Indonesian government to establish a cloud services center on Batam Island, with Nongsa Digital Park as a potential location. The site offers existing data center infrastructure, free trade zone benefits and proximity to Singapore and Malaysia. Oracle already operates two cloud computing centers in Singapore and has announced a $6.5 billion data facility in Malaysia.\n\nChevron advances plans to develop U.S. data centers with power generation\n\nChevron is moving forward with plans to develop data centers powered primarily by natural gas. The oil company has entered the permitting and engineering phases for multiple U.S. sites, aiming to capitalize on rising AI-driven energy demand.\n\nIron Mountain, Ooredoo to accelerate data center growth across MENA\n\nIron Mountain and Middle East operator Ooredoo Group announced a strategic partnership, in which the former will take a minority equity stake in Ooredoo\u2019s carrier-neutral data center company, MENA Digital Hub.\n\nThe partnership will enable Ooredoo to expand its MENA footprint of hyperscale and AI data center infrastructure. Under the partnership, Iron Mountain will provide MENA Digital Hub with specialized advice in the design, construction and daily operations of data centers.\n\nWhat is AI as a Service (AIaaS)?\n\nIn another article, RCR Wireless News explains the concept of AI as a Service (AIaaS) and how this technology is revolutionizing the way businesses and individuals harness the power of artificial intelligence. AIaaS refers to cloud-based AI services that allow organizations to access and utilize AI tools without needing to build and maintain their own infrastructure. By providing ready-to-use AI capabilities, AIaaS eliminates the high costs, technical complexities as well as resource-intensive requirements traditionally associated with the development of AI.\n\nMoreover, AIaaS enables businesses to leverage AI-driven applications such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and predictive analytics. All these services can be applied in various fields, including customer service, fraud detection, healthcare diagnostics, supply chain optimization and personalized marketing. With AIaaS, companies can integrate intelligent automation into their operations, improving efficiency, decision-making and customer experiences.\n\nWhy these announcements matter?\n\nThese announcements reflect a global acceleration in AI infrastructure investments. NVIDIA-backed CoreWeave\u2019s European expansion, Oracle\u2019s potential cloud hub in Indonesia and Mitsui\u2019s hyperscale investment in Japan highlight the increasing demand for AI data centers worldwide. Meanwhile, Chevron\u2019s entry into power generation for data centers underscores the growing energy challenges of AI-driven workloads. Finally, Iron Mountain\u2019s MENA partnership signals further consolidation and growth in emerging markets.",

            "content": "Oil major Chevron (CVX) is waiting for its $53 billion acquisition of rival Hess Corp. (HES) to be approved by regulators and the courts. In the meantime, Chevron is buying HES stock on the open market.\n\nRegulatory filings just revealed that Chevron purchased 4.99% of Hess\u2019 outstanding shares as the price slumped to $145. Barron\u2019s reports that Chevron made the stock purchase because it considers HES stock to be trading at a discount currently.\n\nChevron has offered to buy all of Hess\u2019 stock for about $171 per share as part of the $53 billion acquisition. However, the purchase is being delayed by a legal claim. In the meantime, HES stock has fallen along with the entire oil and natural gas sector, enabling Chevron to purchase the shares at a discount to the price it initially offered.\n\nDispute with Exxon Mobil\n\nChevron announced it was buying Hess in October 2023. But the deal has been stalled since then. The legal issue involves a claim by fellow oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM). Specifically, Exxon says that it has a right of first refusal to buy Hess\u2019 stake in a major offshore project in Guyana, which is home to one of the world\u2019s most productive oil fields.\n\nExxon is the operator of the Guyana project, and Hess owns a nonoperating stake. The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris will hold an arbitration hearing in May, with a decision expected to come sometime in the three months after the hearing. If Exxon wins, there is a likelihood that Chevron\u2019s purchase of Hess crumbles.\n\nHowever, some analysts say that HES stock is likely to rise even if the Chevron purchase doesn\u2019t go through. In the meantime, Chevron is taking advantage of a good deal when it sees one. CVX stock has risen 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nIs CVX Stock a Buy?\n\nChevron\u2019s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 11 Buy and three Hold recommendations assigned in the past three months. The average CVX price target of $176.64 implies 10.95% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on CVX stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is one of the most-watched stock indexes on Wall Street. Its list of components is rather small; that small list, however, means these are cherry-picked companies that are both large and highly important businesses.\n\nIt makes sense for dividend investors to use the Dow Jones as a shortcut for finding high-yield stocks. But are the highest-yielding stocks in the index today worth buying? Here's a look at the top three.\n\n1. Verizon is a reliable high-yield stock with a lot of debt\n\nThe big draw with telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ) is a dividend that yields 6.2% at recent prices. That's way above the 1.2% yield you would collect from the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which is probably the most monitored stock index in the world. Also attractive is the fact that Verizon has increased its dividend annually for more than two decades.\n\nThere's just one small problem, and that's its balance sheet.\n\nVerizon's debt-to-equity ratio is 1.45. That's well above the 1.18 for AT&T (T), its closest peer, and the 1.28 for T-Mobile US (TMUS), the next most important competitor in the U.S. cellphone market.\n\nThis matters because building a cellular network is a very expensive process and requires constant upgrading to keep pace with the competition. Large capital investments are the norm, and Verizon's more leveraged balance sheet puts it at a disadvantage compared to peers.\n\nThis ends up being a risk/reward call. With roughly 57% of Verizon's free cash flow going to dividends in 2024, it's very likely the company can keep supporting that lofty yield and growing its payout, slowly, over time. But if you do buy it, you'll want to keep close tabs on the company's leverage, just in case.\n\n2. Chevron's yield is attractive in a volatile sector\n\nNext up is Chevron (CVX) and its 4.5% dividend yield. Being an integrated energy giant means the company's business stretches from upstream operations (drilling for oil and natural gas), to midstream (pipelines), and all the way to downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the highs and lows within the highly volatile energy sector.\n\nThe most notable feat achieved by Chevron, however, is probably its 37-year streak of annual dividend increases. That's the proof that its business model is capable of surviving even the most harrowing swings in oil and natural gas prices while rewarding dividend investors.\n\nOnce again, its balance sheet plays an important role, but this time it's because Chevron has very little leverage. That allows management to add debt during the lean times to support its business and dividend.\n\nWhen the oil market recovers, which it always has historically, management pays down debt to prepare for the next downturn. If you are looking for a dividend-paying energy stock, Chevron is a good all-weather choice with an attractive yield.\n\n3. Merck is a fine business, but it has been cheaper\n\nMerck (MRK) is one of the largest drugmakers. It produces some of the world's most important medications, including in the fields of oncology, vaccinations, cardiovascular disease, and animal health.\n\nWith $64.2 billion in sales in 2024, Merck is clearly a dominant force in healthcare. And its dividend yield is an attractive 3.4%. It would be hard to suggest that investors would want to avoid this stock.\n\nIn fact, looking at traditional valuation metrics, its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are both below their five-year averages. And while the dividend hasn't been increased every single year, it has trended higher steadily over time. A good company at a good price: What's not to like?\n\nThe answer is that the dividend yield is actually only about average compared to the stock's long-term range. It probably wouldn't be a mistake for dividend investors to buy Merck today, but if income is your goal, it has been far more attractive in the past. You might want to watch it and wait for more of a market dislocation, when investors have a tendency to throw the babies out with the bathwater.\n\nBuy all three high-yield Dow stocks?\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no company here that investors should be so worried about that they couldn't buy it right now.\n\nVerizon's debt needs to be monitored, but it has deftly managed its balance sheet for years. Chevron operates in a volatile sector, but has proved to be a long-term survivor and reliable dividend payer. And while Merck's yield has been higher in the past -- which may keep some investors on the sidelines today -- it doesn't appear that it would be a mistake to buy the attractively valued stock, either.",

At times, the discovery is mundane and relates to some in-game mechanic, like the visual glitch that renders huge items.\n\nAd\n\nAt others, it is related to cosmetics like the Spider Gamer's Locker Bundle, which no one knew was there in the first place. However, every so often, something hilarious is discovered, and users can't help but stop and stare. In this case, the reason for stopping and staring is the near-immortal god of passing to the afterlife and captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones.\n\nIt turns out that due to having a peg-leg, the character can only wear one Croc(s) or Kick(s). This is what Reddit user adrianahasaids had to say about this:\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n\"Now I want him just for this reason alone.\"\n\nMaster the game with our Fortnite Interactive Map v33.00 here!\n\nAnd seeing him in this predicament will never not be funny for all time to come, especially since users still have to pay the full price to gain access to Crocs and Kicks. That is just the tip of the iceberg of this hilarious discovery. Here is more on the matter at hand.\n\nArr, shiver me timbers, Davy Jones is making waves in the world of fashion in Fortnite\n\nAd\n\nEver since this was posted on Reddit, it has steadily gained traction. While it was obvious that a peg-leg wouldn't be able to accommodate a shoe, no one took note of it until now. If nothing else, this is brilliant attention to detail by Epic Games, and it stays true to how a peg-leg would work in real life.\n\nHowever, given the Fortnite community and their love for humor, one user had a brilliant suggestion regarding what to do with the other shoe that was missing. banjoface123 had this to say:\n\nAd\n\n\"The other should replace his hat.\"\n\nIt would be funny for sure, but Epic Games is likely not to commit to this change. Furthermore, the Crocs/Kicks Davy Jones is wearing are the Crocs Classic Clog 'White', which cost 1,000 V-Bucks. As such, one user commented that Epic Games should refund 500 V-Bucks as compensation.\n\nComment byu/AnenJK from discussion inFortNiteBR Expand Post\n\nAd\n\nAnother user, Gciel35, wrote, stating that the entire fiasco with the Crocs/Kicks is the sole reason they want to purchase the Davy Jones Outfit. Who wouldn't want a fashionable God of the deep, right? Another user, effystonm, outright asked, \"Why would he wear two?\" to which the OP replied, \"His crab leg could get cold.\"\n\nAll said and done, this was a genius design choice by Epic Games. Instead of just allowing the character to equip a pair of Crocs/Kicks, the idea to let them just have one for the functional foot is very cool.\n\nAd\n\nRead more Fortnite articles here:\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer reportedly dropped a bombshell behind closed doors Thursday night, stating that he\u2019s ready to start the process of considering the Republican-led government funding bill.\n\nAccording to , he is willing to vote for the House bill, stating that while the Republican bill is terrible, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much much worse.\n\nHe reportedly called the bill a terrible option but doesn\u2019t want to give President Donald Trump more power while the government is shut down.\n\nSEE ALSO |\n\nDemocrats have been pushing for a continued resolution that would keep the government open for 30 days, giving lawmakers a chance to negotiate some more.\n\n\u201cOn a government shutdown, we know that there is a concern that you can have a Trump and Musk that would like a government shutdown and maybe never reopen the government, or reopen only selective parts,\u201d exclaimed Sen. Mark Warner. \u201cOn the continuing resolution, I will tell you. I\u2019m amazed Republican senators aren\u2019t standing up. They had no participation in that, so this was a MAGA group of far-right Republicans in the house that drove this and nobody else had input.\u201d\n\nRepublicans need support from at least eight Democrats to get the bill to Trump\u2019s desk, in one of his biggest legislative tests so far in his second term.\n\nThe stand-off is on here on Capitol Hill, hours before the deadline that will shut down the government. Even though it takes 51 votes to pass a bill, you need 60 names to bring the legislation to a vote.\n\nEssential government workers, those who are required to keep vital services running, will not get a break if the government does indeed shutdown at midnight Friday.\n\nSEE ALSO |\n\nSome will be forced to continue to work without pay. So here\u2019s what is on the table:\n\nSenate democrats are proposing a 30-day continuing resolution authored by Senator Patty Murray, from Washington state, that is clean in terms of social policy riders that will allow the two sides to negotiate a budget deal.\n\nIt does not include the severe cuts that would .\n\nThe other option is the House CR, continuing resolution that was passed earlier this week, which includes cuts of about $1 billion to the local government.\n\n7News first reported the cuts for the local government would include $350 million from public and charter schools, $75 million from MPD, and $216 million loss for Metro. D.C. Shadow Senator Paul Strauss, who represents the District, tells 7News' John Gonzalez that maybe it\u2019s time to start from scratch.\n\n\u201cMaybe it makes sense to just put the pause on all of this dismantling of these government agencies which is essentially a shutdown by a 1,000 cuts, if it were. And have a real conversation about what Congress wants its priority to be,\u201d said Strauss. \u201cI think it makes sense to look at deficit reduction if that supposedly is a republican priority. I think it makes sense to make sure the District of Columbia local budget, which isn\u2019t federally subsidized, this is the dollars that D.C. taxpayers pay as individuals, as business owners.\u201d\n\nThanks to the 2019 Government Shutdown Prevention Act, if there is a shutdown Friday, 11:59 p.m., eventually back pay must be provided to the majority of furloughed workers. However, with the instability and uncertainty within the government right now, many aren\u2019t sure exactly how that will work and there is fear of paycheck implications.",

It\u2019s an eyesore. Hypodermic needles, used condoms, everything. We can\u2019t bring our grandkids back here or let them run around unsupervised. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll see or come across,\u201d the neighbor said.\n\nThe neighbor also described how people living in the woods will create a mess in one area, then move just a few feet away and repeat the cycle.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll set up camp in one spot for a few weeks, destroy it, and then move over a few yards and do it all over again,\u201d he explained.\n\nJohn Cox addressed the Florence City Council on Monday, raising concerns about the homeless problem, including panhandling.\n\nSeveral other community members also expressed that panhandling is a major issue in Florence, one that they feel is being overlooked by law enforcement.\n\nCox also discussed the widespread litter in the city.\n\n\"Everywhere I go in Florence, there\u2019s litter all over the place. It really makes the city look bad, and it's embarrassing,\" he said.\n\nIn response, Florence City Manager Scotty Davis addressed Cox\u2019s concerns.\n\nDavis explained that the city allocates $75,000 annually to assist the homeless, including those who are sheltered or at risk of becoming homeless. He added that the city partners with several organizations and shelters to help those in need.\n\nDavis also mentioned partnerships with anti-litter groups, including Keep Florence Beautiful, to help clean up trash across the city.\n\nKeep Florence Beautiful is a 501(c)(3) organization that works to \"organize programs and empower citizens through volunteer opportunities to beautify and clean our environment.\" Their programs include community cleanups, responsible consumerism, recycling, urban forest restoration, and graffiti prevention.\n\nA community member reached out to ABC 15 about the trash around another homeless encampment near Highway 52 and I-95 in Florence. The community member shared on social media that \u201cThe tents are in the trees next to the southbound on-ramp to I-95. The trash is unbelievable. There are also tents in the woods behind the Thunderbird Hotel. A good question to ask is why the city keeps the trees around the exit, knowing that the trash will build up and homeless people will set up camp there.\u201d\n\nABC 15 contacted the Florence County Environmental Services department about the litter around the homeless encampments, including the wooded area off of Freedom Boulevard. Officials said they plan to send a crew to assess the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, neighbors living near the encampments said they are willing to help clean up the trash, but only if the city and county can maintain the area afterward.\n\n\"I would gladly use my time to clean it up if I had assurance that it wouldn\u2019t happen again,\" said one neighbor. \"This place has value to me, and I\u2019d be happy to help if we can make sure it stays clean.\"\n\nABC 15 will continue to follow community concerns about litter and the issues facing those who are unsheltered.",

            "content": "There is no dearth of Midas skins in Fortnite considering the character has been around since Chapter 2 Season 2 and will probably exist long after the storyline comes to a grinding halt. He is an enigma, a \"golden\" legend (and somewhat of a cult figure to some within the community). Then again, who wouldn't want to be part of Midas' cult (I'm not the only one, right?).\n\nAd\n\nMoving on from cults and the allure of gold, Epic Games has introduced many Midas skins in Fortnite over the years. They are simply various iterations of the same character from various realities. However, the Midas associated with the storyline (past and present timeline) is still the same one (which is a relief because there's just too much to keep track of).\n\nJust to make things easier to understand, there are a total of eight Midas skins in Fortnite. Each has a unique interpretation of the character and reflects on their personal aspects. Some are more popular than others, given their association with the storyline, but all of the skins are still amazing in their own right.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nAnd no, before anyone comments asking, \"What about Meowdas?\" - he is not a Midas, but a remix of Midas and Meowscles.\n\nMaster the game with our Fortnite Interactive Map v33.00 here!\n\nHere is the list of all Midas skins in Fortnite.\n\nThere are a total of eight Midas skins in Fortnite (but I wish there were more!)\n\n1) Midas\n\nThere's not much to say that hasn't already been said about the very first Midas. He likely founded The Agency, hired a bunch of henchmen, sought control over the island, and wanted to overthrow the Imagine Order; basically, your typical Tuesday for a man who can turn anything he touches to gold.\n\nAd\n\nOut of all the Midas skins in Fortnite, this is the original one. It was part of the Chapter 2 Season 2 Battle Pass, and it can never be obtained anymore (which is why we now have so many Midas skins in Fortnite). Although Midas met his end at the jaws of a Loot Shark at the start of Chapter 2 Season 3, it wasn't the end of the line for him.\n\nThe OG Midas (Image via Epic Games)\n\nAs for his design, Midas can be seen in a suit and is equipped with grenades and pistols. He has numerous tattoos, which include two roses, one of which is stabbed with a knife, thorns, a stars symbol, a skull with flowers, and a Loot Shark (which is the very creature that devoured him).\n\nAd\n\nThe tattoos also include his daughter's pet Ohm, engineer's gears, the walls of The Authority, the GHOST logo, a dollar sign, the word \"MIDAS\", the word \"24k,\" and a crown. (Yeah, he really likes tattoos). Unlike all other Midas skins in Fortnite, this variant of the character even has styles for his organizations, GHOST and SHADOW.\n\n2) Midas Rex\n\nMidas Rex is no laughing matter (Image via Epic Games)\n\nMidas Rex is another one of the amazing Midas skins in Fortnite. This version of the character takes a lot of inspiration from Lex Luther. Despite being part of The Last Laugh Bundle, which features Joker and Poison Ivy, he is not related to DC in any way. He first appeared in Chapter 2 Season 4 and confused fans quite a bit as the original Midas was out of the timeline at this point.\n\nAd\n\nThis version of the character has full body armor, and the symbol of his ancient crown is visible on his chest. This is from when he was Oro (that's another can of worms to open, so we'll skip out on that). He also has two revolvers, much like the first iteration of the character. With the full body armor comes a helmet that has a built-in respirator.\n\n3) Shadow Midas\n\nMidas' Revenge! (Image via Epic Games)\n\nWhile there are many Midas skins in Fortnite, Shadow Midas is perhaps the only one to fall to corruption. First introduced in Chapter 2 Season 4, he is largely considered to be a lackey of The Cube Queen. He had the same ominous purple glow as Kevin The Cube, and was but a shell of the human being that he once was.\n\nAd\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's still stylish and wears a suit (fashion truly never dies, even in the afterlife). However, his hands are a shade of purple instead of gold. The eyesight in his right eye is seemingly restored (which is rather unnatural), and both eyes now glow purple as well. Thankfully, this abomination variant of Midas wasn't present on the island for long (which is kind of a relief).\n\n4) Midsummer Midas\n\nAd\n\nMidas on the beach (Image via Epic Games)\n\nOut of all of the Midas skins in Fortnite, Midsummer Midas was an absolute surprise. No one could have imagined that Midas would appear on the island during a full-blown alien invasion. Yet there he was, in shorts no less, soaking in the Sun while impending doom hovered over. Chapter 2 Season 7 was truly momentous for the timeline.\n\nAd\n\n5) Icebound Midas\n\nMidas as cold as ice! (Image via Epic Games)\n\nWhen talking about Midas skins in Fortnite, it is rather difficult to avoid the cold elephant in the room, which is Icebound Midas. The only thing that sets apart this version of the character from the original is the fact that he's frozen over (might be a bit too cold-hearted). Other than this tiny detail, there's not much else to say about him. He was introduced at the start of Chapter 3 Season 1 and is part of the Black Ice Legends Pack.\n\nAd\n\n6) Golden Gear Midas\n\nKawaii Midas (Image via Epic Games)\n\nOut of all the Midas skins in Fortnite, Golden Gear Midas is the only one that is animated. Introduced in Chapter 3 Season 4, his arrival to the Fortnite Item Shop was met with much glee and anticipation. Although he was not related to the storyline in any way, he was nonetheless a welcome sight. He's part of the Anime Legends Pack.\n\nAd\n\n7) Ascendant Midas\n\nBack from The Underworld (Image via Epic Games)\n\nSince falling from grace, Ascendant Midas had spent his days in The Underworld. He was, in a way, the highlight of Chapter 5 Season 2, and has been involved in the storyline after a very long time. Out of all the Midas skins in Fortnite, this one had the makings of a true king.\n\nAd\n\nMidas has on Spartan armor equipped with a knife and pistols. On his head rests a golden laurel crown, signifying his rise to kingship, and a belt as well as a cape with his ace on them. With the help of his daughter, Jules, he now also has a gauntlet on his arm to stop his Golden Touch ability, in essence, bringing about the end to his curse.\n\n8) Outlaw Midas\n\nOutlaw in arms (Image via Epic Games)\n\nThe most recent of Midas skins in Fortnite is none other than Outlaw Midas. Introduced in Chapter 6 Season 2, he's now a rootin' tootin' gunslinger and still an outlaw after all these years. With him being a major proponent in the storyline, it will be interesting to see how things turn out this time around.\n\nAd\n\nIf you happen to own the Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 Battle Pass, you should unlock Outlaw Midas as soon as you can. His design varies greatly from the very first iteration of the character from Chapter 2 Season 2 (especially his cowboy hat, which makes him look like a true outlaw).\n\nThat's about all that can be said about the various Midas skins in Fortnite. No doubt, we can expect more to be added in the future, given how popular the character is. For the time being, seven versions of Midas (barring the first iteration of the character) can be obtained as and when they appear in the Fortnite Item Shop.\n\nAd\n\nRead more Fortnite articles here:\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Chevron Corporation is stepping into data center power generation. The company is focusing on locations with easy access to natural gas and lower carbon intensity. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth revealed and discussed these plans at the CERAWeek energy conference by S&P Global in Houston.\n\nHyperscale companies want off-grid power sources to speed up their market entry. This makes Chevron\u2019s proposed facilities very crucial. Wirth highlighted,\n\n\u201cOne of the criteria in site selection will be access to gas. It will also be proximity to carbon capture and storage capacity, access to renewables, potentially off the grid, access to geothermal or potentially hydrogen, so we\u2019re looking for ways to reduce the carbon intensity over time.\u201d\n\nChevron aims to develop these facilities in key U.S. regions like the Southeast, Midwest, and West. The company plans to place power plants near data centers. This will help ensure reliable energy and lessen reliance on the grid.\n\nChevron, Engine No. 1, and GE Vernova To Power U.S. Data Centers\n\nIn January, Chevron announced a partnership with Engine No. 1 LP. Together, they will develop gas-fired power plants designed for U.S. data centers.\n\nThese \u201cpower foundries\u201d will use GE Vernova\u2019s 550-MW 7HA gas turbines and will deliver up to four gigawatts of power, equivalent to powering 3-3.5 million U.S. homes. Deliveries will start in 2026, and Chevron expects power generation to begin by late 2027.\n\nChris James, founder of Engine No. 1, stressed the importance of energy in AI growth.\n\n\u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance. By using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower. This partnership with Chevron and GE Vernova addresses the biggest energy challenge we face.\u201d\n\nThese gigawatt-scale power solutions will help data centers that need quick setup and dependability. The initial design keeps these plants off the grid but can be integrated in the future. Consequently, this will reduce strain on the grid and lower consumer electricity price risks. Future expansions could increase capacity, providing reliable power for U.S. AI data centers.\n\nThe press release further revealed that a key part of Chevron\u2019s initiative is integrating lower-carbon solutions over time. The power plants will use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that can potentially remove 90% of CO2 emissions from gas turbines. Notably, these facilities might use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydrogen. This will help reduce carbon intensity even more.\n\nNatural Gas and CCUS: Future Outlook\n\nThe Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario predicts gas demand will peak soon and drop 30% by 2030 to 3,300 bcm. By 2050, demand could fall 70% from 2021 levels to 1,200 bcm, with 40% used for hydrogen production with CCUS. Despite falling demand, continued investment is needed to sustain supply. The NZE Scenario estimates $200 billion per year until 2030, then $85 billion annually. The NZE Scenario promotes policies for CCUS investment. By 2050, CCUS could capture 6.2 Gt of CO\u2082, helping cut emissions in industries like cement and data centers. AI Boom Fuels Natural Gas Surge\n\nAI and cloud computing are increasing energy use. So, securing stable power sources is now essential. Traditional grid systems can\u2019t keep up, so companies look for direct energy solutions.\n\nS&P Global further noted that analysts predict U.S. data centers could demand an extra 3-6 Bcf/d of gas by 2030. However, the exact role of gas in this growth is unclear and could be due to an increase in renewable energy investments.\n\nChevron\u2019s natural gas production is already increasing. In Q4 2024, the company averaged 2.74 Bcf/d, with full-year production reaching 2.68 Bcf/d\u2014up 27% from 2023.\n\nThe Permian Basin remains a major source, producing 20.5 Bcf/d in 2024, an 80% increase over five years. By 2028, production could exceed 24 Bcf/d, solidifying the region\u2019s role in the energy landscape.\n\nFluctuating Permian gas prices have also shaped Chevron\u2019s strategy. According to data from Platts (a part of Commodity Insights), in 2024, Waha Hub prices in West Texas often fell below zero due to pipeline issues, averaging just 2 cents/MMBtu.\n\nChevron plans to redirect excess gas to power foundries. This approach captures value and supports AI growth.\n\nChevron\u2019s Power Shift: Merging Energy, AI, and Sustainability\n\nChevron is transforming energy infrastructure with its move to behind-the-meter power generation. This shift goes beyond AI and data centers, driving a broader push toward localized power production.\n\nThe joint venture will create thousands of jobs and boost U.S. reindustrialization. Chevron\u2019s power plants will also sell excess electricity back to the grid that will further boost stability. This model balances immediate AI-driven power needs with long-term grid support.\n\nThe oil giant\u2019s endeavors don\u2019t end here. As per its sustainability report, the company is investing $8 billion in lower-carbon energy projects from 2021 to 2028, focusing on renewable fuels, carbon capture, hydrogen, and offsets. It is also committing an additional $2 billion to cut 4 million metric tons of emissions annually within its operations.",

            "content": "The Venezuelan government has confirmed its intention to attract foreign capital into the oil sector following the U.S. decision to end Chevron\u2019s operating license in the country. This measure, which forces the American company to cease its activities before April 3, was presented by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as a response to the outcome of last July\u2019s presidential election, deemed illegitimate by Washington.\n\nA sector seeking new investors\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro stated that Venezuela remains open to foreign investment in the oil, gas, petrochemical, and refining sectors. He assured that all of the country\u2019s oil fields would continue production despite Chevron\u2019s departure, without specifying which actors might take over.\n\nThe U.S. government, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), has imposed a gradual reduction of Chevron\u2019s activities in Venezuela, including its joint ventures with state-owned Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) or any entity in which PDVSA holds more than a 50% stake. These restrictions replace measures adopted in November 2022 by the previous administration.\n\nA market under pressure between sanctions and restructuring\n\nVenezuela holds the world\u2019s largest proven crude oil reserves, but its production has been significantly reduced by economic sanctions and a lack of investment. In February, national production exceeded one million barrels per day, and the government expects this trend to continue in March. Chevron previously accounted for nearly a quarter of this output, or approximately 200,000 barrels per day.\n\nThe country\u2019s prolonged recession, which saw its gross domestic product shrink by 80% between 2014 and 2021, was exacerbated by falling oil prices and export restrictions. In this context, opening up to new investors appears to be necessary to maintain infrastructure and stimulate production.\n\nAn uncertain outlook for market players\n\nThe Venezuelan opposition has recently put forward an energy reform proposal aimed at attracting foreign companies and restructuring the sector. This initiative includes opening oil and gas blocks to private investment and auctioning stakes in PDVSA. The stated objective is to increase production beyond three million barrels per day, a level not seen in nearly 15 years.\n\nAmid strengthened U.S. sanctions and restrictions on international transactions, Caracas is exploring alternative options to offset Chevron\u2019s exit. Talks have been initiated with partners such as China and Turkey as the country seeks to diversify its funding sources and stabilize its energy sector.\n\nThe future of foreign investment in Venezuela will depend on the government\u2019s ability to ensure a stable regulatory framework and overcome challenges related to economic sanctions. The outlook remains uncertain for market players in an environment marked by political tensions and persistent financial constraints.",

            "content": "Chevron's Venezuela oil contractors continue work despite impending Trump deadline\n\n(Bloomberg) \u2013 Venezuelan oil contractors are continuing their work with Chevron Corp. and have not been warned of an impending shutdown despite a U.S. government deadline to stop producing oil there by early April.\n\nLocal service companies working for three of Chevron\u2019s joint ventures with state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA have not slowed down work, according to five people with knowledge of the matter. Chevron hires local companies to maintain oil wells, supply power generators, operate small drills and specialized equipment as well as manage housing contracts for employees.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration set an April 3 deadline for the oil major to wrap up operations in Venezuela, cutting short the six-month wind-down period. The fact that Chevron\u2019s work continues apace more than a week after Washington issued its order underscores how challenging it will be for the company to comply with the accelerated timeline, designed to pressure Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to make a deal over democratic reforms and accept more migrants from the U.S.\n\nChevron is \u201caware of the President\u2019s directive and will abide by any direction given by the U.S. Treasury Department to implement that directive,\u201d spokesperson Bill Turenne said by email. The company \u201cconducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S. government.\u201d\n\nSee also: U.S. sets one-month deadline for Chevron to end Venezuela operations",

            "content": "From the Philippines to Korea, Prince Aleta's academic journey has taken him across continents. Now pursuing a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston, he dedicates countless hours to electrochemistry research under Dr. Mim Rahimi. Prince completed his bachelor's in chemical engineering at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines then worked under Dr. Sungpyo Kim at Korea University where he acquired his master\u2019s in environmental engineering.\n\nUnder Dr. Rahimi, their team works towards electrifying carbon capture. This means using electricity, ideally from renewable sources, to power the process of capturing and storing CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n\u201cOur first attempt at trying to retain our carbon emissions was by basically capping power plants that we know produce a large quantity of carbon dioxide. That's the easiest way to reduce our carbon emissions, by capping it and then capturing the carbon height,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the technology is pretty mature, meaning it's been around for a long time, and we have experience using that machine for that technology.\u201d\n\nRahimi\u2019s team is taking a second attempt, this time developing a new way of carbon capture which is by capturing it from the ocean.\n\n\u201cSo, another bad side effect of the increased CO\u2082 in the atmosphere is that the more CO\u2082 in the atmosphere, the more CO\u2082 is being absorbed by the ocean,\u201d Aleta said.\n\nAs a natural sink for CO\u2082, it dissolves in the ocean water to create carbonic acid. As a result, the pH levels decrease causing ocean acidification. One of the earliest signs of the increased CO\u2082 in the ocean was coral bleaching. Ocean acidification combined with the rising ocean temperatures results in weakened corals making the bleaching effect more severe.\n\n\u201cThat is one way to actually remove carbon and at the same time, replenish the ocean's natural alkalinity. If you're removing the CO\u2082, you can think of it as giving the ocean more capacity to absorb CO\u2082 and so that's what I'm trying to achieve currently in my research,\u201d Aleta explained.\n\nIn 2024, Prince became a UH-Chevron Energy Graduate Fellow, providing him the opportunity to advance his research and to connect with industry professionals at Chevron.\n\n\u201cIt's helpful for people in the research field to hear back from people in industry, because although we're very closely linked, there can be a vast difference between what is being researched right now and what is being practiced in the industry,\u201d Aleta said.\n\nIn addition to the fellowship, Prince serves as one of the Vice Chairs for the UH Energy Coalition. These student ambassadors work closely with UH Energy to connect students to energy industry professionals. Given Houston\u2019s convenient location, their research team was easily recognized through pitch competitions as their developed technology aligns well with the goal of decarbonization. In 2024, he and his team, ECHO Solutions, won the UH Energy\n\nChevron Technology Commercialization Competition, earning $25,000 for their research. His team went on to compete in the 2024 EnergyTech University Prize competition held in Austin. Competing against 117 schools nationwide, Team Echo took home a bonus prize of $22,000. Aleta values Chevron's ongoing mentorship, which helps him and the other fellows understand the evolving energy sector and align their research with industry needs.\n\n\u201cWe're in the energy capital of the world, a huge industrial presence is here in Houston, so being able connect with them and talk with them about the energy industry has been very enjoyable for me,\u201d he expressed.\n\nPrince credits his experience at UH with providing him the opportunity to grow and connect with fellow energy researchers and experts who inspire him to continue his work.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that the progress I'm making in my research right now will progress our understanding of this technology of carbon capture and electrochemical capture and pave the way for new and potentially better ideas,\u201d Aleta said.\n\n",

Credit: NASA/Marvin Smith\n\nShortly after dawn on March 27, 2001, NASA pilot Bill Rieke took off from an airfield just outside of Phoenix in NASA\u2019s blue-and-white Learjet 25 and flew low over a series of microphones for the first flight test of a groundbreaking NASA technology.\n\nOn one of the plane\u2019s engines was an experimental jagged-edged nozzle that researchers at Glenn Research Center in Cleveland had discovered made aircraft significantly quieter. These initial flight tests were an important step toward using these \u201cchevron nozzles\u201d on modern aircraft, lowering noise levels for communities.\n\nNASA Glenn has been exploring ways of reducing engine noise since the first jet airliners appeared in the 1950s. New turbofan engines in the 1960s were quieter, but the expansion of the overall airline industry meant that noise was still an issue. With the introduction of noise-limiting mandates in the 1970s, NASA and engine manufacturers embarked on a decades-long search for technologies to lower noise levels.\n\nNASA researchers discovered that the military\u2019s use of rectangular notches, or tabs, along an engine nozzle\u2019s exit \u2013 to help disguise a jet fighter\u2019s infrared signature \u2013 could also reduce engine noise by helping mix the hot air from the engine core and the cooler air blowing through the engine fan. In the 1990s, Glenn researcher Dennis Huff and his colleagues discovered that a serrated, or sawtooth, shape, referred to as a chevron, offered more promise.\n\nDennis Huff explains chevron nozzles, seen on a table, to U.S. Senator George Voinovich and other visitors inside the Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory facility in 2006. Huff was head of NASA Glenn Research Center\u2019s Acoustics Branch at this point. Credit: NASA/Marvin Smith\n\nNASA contracted with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney to develop an array of tab and chevron designs to be analyzed in Glenn\u2019s unique Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL). Extensive testing in the spring of 1997 showed the possibilities for reducing noise with these types of nozzles.\n\nEngine manufacturers were impressed with the findings but wary of any technology that might impact performance. So, in 1998, NASA funded engine tests of the 14 most promising designs. The tests revealed the chevron nozzle had a negligible 0.25% reduction of thrust. It was a major development for jet noise research.\n\nIn September 2000, Glenn\u2019s Flight Operations Branch was contacted about the logistics of flight-testing chevron nozzles on the center\u2019s Learjet 25 to verify the ground tests and improve computer modeling. Nothing further came of the request, however, until early the next year when Huff informed Rieke, chief of Flight Operations, that the researchers would like to conduct flight tests in late March\u2014with just eight weeks to prepare.\n\nGlenn\u2019s Acoustics Branch worked with colleagues at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and the Arizona-based engine manufacturer Honeywell on the effort. They planned to conduct testing at Estrella Sailport just outside of Phoenix from March 26 to 28, 2001.\n\nBill Rieke and Ellen Tom with the chevron nozzle installed on the Learjet.

While the special nozzle engineers created for the flights would allow them to switch between a six- and a 12-chevron design during testing, it also got hot quickly. This necessitated the installation of new sensors, rewiring of fire alarm cables, and the presence of an onboard test engineer to monitor the temperatures. The short turnaround also required expedited efforts to obtain flight plan approvals, verify the plane\u2019s airworthiness, and perform normal maintenance activities.\n\nDespite the challenges, Rieke and a small team delivered the Learjet to Estrella on March 25, as planned. The next day was spent coordinating with the large Langley and Honeywell team and acquiring baseline noise data. The pilots idled the unmodified engine as the Learjet flew over three perpendicular rows of microphones at an altitude of 500 feet and speed of 230 miles per hour.\n\nView from below as NASA Glenn Research Center\u2019s Learjet 25 passes overhead at the Estrella airfield with the experimental chevron nozzle visible on the left wing.

The researchers anecdotally reported that there was no perceptible noise reduction as the aircraft approached, but significant reductions once it passed. Recordings supported these observations and showed that sideline noise was reduced, as well.\n\nThe flights of the Learjet, which was powered by a variation of GE\u2019s J-85 turbojet, were complemented by Honeywell\u2019s turbofan-powered Falcon 20 aircraft. These flights ultimately confirmed the noise reduction found in earlier AAPL tests.\n\nOverall, the flight tests were so successful that just over a year later the FAA began certifying GE\u2019s CF34\u20138, the first commercial aircraft engine to incorporate chevron technology. The engine was first flown on a Bombardier CRJ900 in 2003. Continued studies by both NASA and industry led to the improved designs and the incorporation of chevrons into larger engines, such as GE\u2019s GEnx.\n\nAccording to Huff, the chevron\u2019s three-decibel noise decrease was analogous to the difference between running two lawnmowers and one. Their comparatively easy integration into engine design and minimal effect on thrust made the chevron a breakthrough in noise-reduction technology. In 2002, NASA presented an innovation award to the Glenn, Langley, and Honeywell team that carried out the flights. Today, airliners such as the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner use chevron nozzles to lower noise levels for communities near airports.",

            "content": "The overturning of Chevron deference marks a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape, particularly for biotechnology and agriculture technology. While the balance of power between federal agencies, Congress, and the courts could redefine innovation and safety standards in the next few years, it also presents an opportunity to encourage a more precise, evidence-based, and collaborative approach between the federal agencies, Congress, and the courts.\n\nWhat Is Chevron?\n\nThe Chevron doctrine originated from the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The ruling established that when Congress\u2019s laws are clear and unambiguous, both federal agencies and the courts must adhere to them. However, when the laws passed by Congress are ambiguous and allow for more than one reasonable interpretation, the courts must defer to the expert federal agencies designated by Congress to implement those laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision has profoundly impacted the scope of agency authority in biotechnology regulation. [Canva]\n\nThe principles established by Chevron deference granted regulatory agencies considerable leeway to interpret the statutes they administer. This flexibility enabled the adaptation of regulations in response to rapid advancements in biotechnology, which enabled a more responsive regulatory framework for biotech innovations.\n\nHowever, legal challenges and judicial scrutiny have called into question the applicability of Chevron deference. Opponents of the deference have argued that Chevron deference can lead to excessive agency power and can reduce accountability. This sentiment, in part, led to Chevron deference being overruled in the Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and the Relentless Inc. v. Department of Commerce cases (collectively called Loper Bright). In both these cases, the courts ruled against the National Marine Fisheries Service, citing that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law lacked a clear statutory basis. The Supreme Court reviewed and provided their opinion on both cases and ultimately, in a 6-3 vote, overturned Chevron. This decision highlights the need for agencies to have explicit authorization for their regulations and has led to a shift in how courts approach agency interpretations and the scope of Chevron deference.\n\nThe overturning of Chevron will significantly reshape the authority of federal regulatory agencies in their areas of expertise, creating confusion and concern among biotechnology stakeholders. However, some see a glimmer of hope that this shift may lead to more streamlined or expedited biotechnology regulation. Fully understanding the implications of the Chevron decision on biotechnology regulation will take time, and in the interim, various stakeholders are adapting to this new landscape.\n\nFederal Regulatory Agency Response\n\nFederal regulatory agencies rely on their expertise in interpreting laws and regulations, aided by the Chevron Deference in the courts. However, with the recent overturning of the Chevron Doctrine and new directives limiting the authority and discretion of these agencies, they will need to adapt their operations. As the risk of increased scrutiny grows, agencies may shift towards offering guidance rather than engaging in formal rulemaking when it comes to new regulations on biotechnology products.\n\nIncreased collaboration between regulators and industry experts will be crucial in adapting to the post-Chevron regulatory landscape. [DALL-E]\n\nUnlike rulemaking, which is the official process for establishing regulations and setting standards, guidance documents provide agencies with more flexibility in outlining their views on a particular product. While guidance is not foolproof in court, it still allows agencies to offer direction to the industry based on evidence and facts.\n\nThat said, when agencies do propose formal rulemaking, the public comment period will be crucial. During this period, stakeholders can submit their feedback on the proposed rule, and agencies can use these comments to support their position in court if needed. For instance, if a significant number of stakeholders express support for the rule, these comments can be used in court to demonstrate that the agency is not overstepping its bounds, potentially helping the courts decide whether to defer to the agency's expertise in specific cases.\n\nUltimately, for regulatory agencies, both the guidance and rulemaking processes will become increasingly collaborative. However, it is expected that there will be some hesitation as the regulatory landscape evolves. Despite this, the shifting landscape presents an opportunity for greater collaboration, particularly among agencies involved in the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology Regulation. The choice between issuing guidance or formal rules may facilitate better coordination, allowing agencies to work more effectively together in understanding and regulating various biotechnology products.\n\nPublic & Industry Response\n\nAs science has evolved and become increasingly complex and interdisciplinary, regulatory pathways have also become less straightforward and substantially more challenging. This has resulted in industry stakeholders not having clear insights into how new biotechnologies can and will be regulated, despite the best efforts of the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology Regulation and the Unified Website for Biotechnology Regulation to simplify and clarify the regulatory process. Industry stakeholders have lamented about the difficulties in navigating the regulatory landscape, sometimes attributing the inability of technologies being approved due to the regulatory process. However, with the overturning of the Chevron deference, public and industry stakeholders now wonder if there is potential for the regulatory process to become much more simplified and that certain technologies could be brought to the market much faster.\n\nClearer regulatory pathways may help innovative biotechnologies move from lab to market more efficiently. [Canva]\n\nThough it\u2019s tempting to expect rapid approval of breakthrough technologies, the regulatory process will likely proceed as usual. Established regulatory pathways, such as environmental reviews, safety assessments, and public consultations, will remain largely unchanged due to specific statutory mandates. The overturning of Chevron ultimately does not affect the core legal obligations that underlie these pathways. Ultimately, while these regulatory processes may seem cumbersome and slow, they are crucial for safeguarding both public health and the environment.\n\nWith the overturning of Chevron, judges may be more willing to challenge agency decisions, especially if there are concerns that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or failed to properly follow statutory mandates. This shift could mean that, even after a technology has navigated the regulatory process, it may still face delays due to legal challenges that send it back for further review, potentially not only delaying its introduction to the market but also blocking it entirely.\n\nGiven this shift, it is increasingly important for both the public and industry stakeholders to actively engage in the regulatory process, particularly when responding to agencies' requests for public comment on proposed regulations, decisions, or rulemakings. By providing well-informed feedback, whether in support of or opposition to a regulatory agency\u2019s plans or decisions, stakeholders can help ensure their views are considered during both the regulatory process and, if litigation arises, the judicial review process. When courts assess whether agencies are operating within their statutory authority, input from the public and industry can serve as evidence that agencies are following proper procedures. Public and industry perspectives are not only important for potentially shaping regulations but also for ensuring that the regulatory process is resilient to judicial review. As industries increasingly seek more transparent, adaptable, and forward-looking regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with technological innovation, they will likely press regulatory agencies to adopt approaches that align with both current scientific advancements and practical realities. Ultimately, this collaborative process will help facilitate the approval of innovative technologies that can address pressing societal and global challenges.\n\nLegislative Branch Response\n\nWith the shifting judicial landscape, Congress may need to adopt a more prescriptive approach to legislative drafting. Chevron allowed for some ambiguity in statutes, granting regulatory agencies a degree of autonomy in interpretation. However, with the Supreme Court no longer deferring to agency interpretations, lawmakers may feel compelled to craft more detailed laws to reduce ambiguity. This could lead to clearer language, explicitly defining agency powers to minimize the risk of courts striking down agency actions or agencies exceeding their authority.\n\nWhile this approach could reduce ambiguity, it may also limit flexibility. Modern regulatory issues often require flexible interpretation, and overly specific statutes could restrict agencies' ability to adapt. Congress could also increase oversight to ensure agencies adhere closely to legislative intent rather than exercising broad discretion. However, overly narrow statutes could reduce the flexibility needed to address complex, evolving challenges.\n\nThe legislative response to Chevron's overturn will also depend on the political composition of Congress. Ideological divides between Democrats and Republicans will influence how much authority is granted to agencies. For example, a more conservative Congress might limit agency powers, enacting laws that narrowly define regulatory authority. In contrast, a liberal Congress might seek to preserve agency discretion, particularly on complex issues like climate change or public health.\n\nThese political dynamics will shape how Congress approaches the specificity and prescriptiveness of future legislation. Frequent changes in the party controlling Congress could lead to inconsistency in lawmaking, with new majorities attempting to undo or reinterpret laws passed by the previous Congress. This could create political instability and uncertainty in the regulatory landscape, making it more difficult for agencies to operate effectively. As power shifts between the political branches, debates over agency autonomy and legislative authority will likely intensify, creating an unstable environment for both regulators and those subject to regulation.\n\nJudicial Branch Response\n\nThe overturning of Chevron deference is expected to unfold through a lengthy and complex process involving significant participation from both the circuit courts and the Supreme Court. Given the political divisions within the U.S. judiciary, responses to this shift will likely vary across different circuits. Courts in more liberal-leaning regions may be more inclined to uphold broader agency discretion in interpreting ambiguous statutes, while courts in conservative-leaning regions may adopt a more restrictive approach, limiting agency authority. As a result, litigants may strategically choose where to file lawsuits, seeking out jurisdictions that align with their preferred interpretation of the law. This could create inconsistencies in how Chevron is applied across the country, leading to a fragmented legal landscape as different circuits respond to the shift in their own ways.\n\nWith Chevron overturned, courts now play an even more critical role in shaping biotechnology regulation. [Canva]\n\nUltimately, it will fall to the Supreme Court to resolve the ambiguity and inconsistency across the circuit courts. By hearing and ruling on several pivotal cases, the Supreme Court will be able to establish clear guidelines for how agencies can exercise their powers and how courts should review those actions. Until these cases are decided, however, the judicial system will face a period of legal uncertainty and potential conflict.\n\nOverall, the overturning of Chevron represents a significant shift in how regulatory decisions are made and challenged, particularly in the realm of agricultural biotechnology and broader biotech regulation. What was once a system where courts deferred to agency expertise when statutes were ambiguous is now evolving into one where courts are more likely to intervene and provide their own interpretations. As a result, this change will likely lead to increased litigation against regulatory agencies, creating greater uncertainty in the regulatory process as agencies\u2019 decisions are questioned more frequently. While the regulatory process is unlikely to become faster or easier, this shift offers an opportunity for public and industry stakeholders to engage more actively in the regulatory process by providing public comments as opportunities arise. The overturning of Chevron presents a unique opportunity for advocacy groups and non-profit organizations. With the increased scrutiny on regulatory agencies, these groups can advocate for the use of evidence-based, science-driven facts in the regulatory process and for increased resources to help agencies meet the growing complexity of biotechnology regulation.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe author expresses deep gratitude for the insights provided by David Doniger and the team at H&K Law and Karen Carr at ArentFox Schiff.\n\n\u200dNazish Jeffery is the Bioeconomy Policy manager at the Federation of American Scientists and the Chair of the Bioeconomy and Policy Track at SynBioBeta 2025: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference, being held May 6-8 in San Jose, California.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other billionaire\u2019s favorite oil and gas stocks right now.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant driver of the global economy, influencing industries, transportation, and geopolitical dynamics. However, the past year has been nothing short of a roller coaster for the sector, with high volatility coming from factors such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and a dampening demand due to a global economic slowdown.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now\n\nBrent crude prices have recently hit a 6-month low as US crude oil stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected build, coupled with worries about a looming return of more OPEC+ barrels to the market and President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The global oil and gas majors have already struggled with decreasing prices in 2024 and the recent decline has only added to their troubles. Things could get even worse, as the IEA expects Brent crude prices to fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, as the US oil and gas production hits record highs, President Trump has made calls to \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d and pump those numbers up even higher, as he seeks to make the country self-sufficient in energy. However, not everyone seems to be on. Instead of continuously increasing supply and hence plunging prices even lower, the oil industry remains focused on achieving efficiency gains and maintaining capital discipline, while also rewarding loyal shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the natural gas sector. US gas producers, which curbed production last year due to multi-year low prices, are now adding gas rigs and boosting production as the price has crossed the $4.6 mark this week. The slowing output in 2024, a booming LNG industry, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in years have driven gas prices up by over 150% over the last year.\n\nAnother significant growth driver for America\u2019s natural gas industry is the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and the accompanying data centers, which consume 10 to 50 times the amount of energy per square foot of a typical commercial office building. These energy intensive facilities could consume as much as 9% of all energy generated in the US by 2030, and this energy needs to come from a relatively clean, flexible, and reliable source that is abundantly available in the form of natural gas. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. Several gas majors are now even bypassing traditional utilities and building power plants to connect directly to data centers, a move that could reshape the industry in the years to come, if it pays off.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela will stop receiving deportees from the US in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to revoke Chevron Corp\u2019s license to operate in the South American country.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVenezuela\u2019s ruling party secretary, Diosdado Cabello, confirmed Monday that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had ordered direct repatriation flights from the US be halted. The Andean nation will still receive migrants back from other countries, starting with a group from Bolivia, Cabello said on state television.\n\nMaduro\u2019s officials privately warned the Trump administration they would halt the flights after the US gave Chevron 30 days to wind down operations, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe US is also preparing to revoke waivers allowing other foreign oil companies to operate in the country. Maduro\u2019s suspension of flights could potentially trigger even more aggressive measures from the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWith what they did, they have damaged the communications that we had opened,\u201d Maduro said on Saturday, referring to the revoked Chevron license. \u201cI wanted to bring back all the Venezuelans who are imprisoned and unjustly persecuted just for being migrants, and that affected the flights we had already programmed.\u201d\n\nIn early 2024, Maduro suspended direct deportation flights after former President Joe Biden threatened to reimpose oil sanctions in response to the Venezuelan leader\u2019s failure to follow through on democratic commitments. The flights resumed in February after Trump\u2019s special envoy, Ric Grenell, visited Caracas and secured the release of six US citizens from Venezuelan prisons.\n\nIn total, three flights arrived in Venezuela that month, carrying around 370 passengers either directly from the US or from its naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Maduro\u2019s government said the US administration had told them that roughly 5,000 migrants could be subject to deportation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

One of President Donald Trump\u2019s first acts in his second term was an executive order to \u201cunleash American energy.\u201d\n\nBut while Trump\u2019s declaration is beneficial to the industry now, so many changes are not conducive for long-term investment, Wirth argued. A reliable solution is needed.\n\n\u201cSwinging from one extreme to the other is not the right policy approach in the long investment segment,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cCapital is out there for decades, and so we really need consistency in our energy policy.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Department of Energy already undid some of the Biden-era rules, such as the pause on LNG export permits, since switching leadership. Wirth hopes other bodies of government take the changes as a \u201csignal,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the changes could all be undone, again, if a future administration takes on a different point of view, he said.\n\n\u201cMore durable policy will come through the legislative process,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cSome of the things we\u2019ve talked about could improve the investment environment across the entire energy industry, not just in our sector.\u201d\n\nThe results of a shifting regulatory environment should be seen as a lesson, Wirth said.\n\n\u201cEurope is waking up to the fact that they have hallowed out their industrial base,\u201d he said. The results are an aging population that\u2019s not growing, and a regulatory regime that is forcing businesses and investors to look to other locations for business.\n\nAnd back at home, California\u2019s regulatory environment is pushing out businesses as well, Wirth said.\n\nChevron moved its headquarters to Houston from San Ramon, California, in 2024. Wirth said the company still has several assets in California, but he thought the move to Texas, where the energy industry is \u201ccelebrated,\u201d should have been made a little sooner.\n\nThe future may be difficult to plan for, but regional policies should be helpful, Wirth said.\n\nPlanning ahead\n\nChevron also has plans in motion to capitalize on growing demand for power as AI adoption takes hold.\n\nWirth discussed Chevron\u2019s development of an on-site power solution geared toward supplying electricity for the burgeoning AI data center sector. Chevron has partnered with GE Vernova and Engine No. 1 to build gas-powered turbines capable of producing the megawatts of energy needed on site.\n\nChevron expects to have the systems ready for delivery in 2027.\n\nIn the 2010s, Chevron created a program in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to keep its technical staff up-to-date on the developing AI sector.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it help us, as we are beginning to integrate AI tools into our business,\u201d Wirth said.",

(Presidential Press)\n\nCaracas, March 9, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 The Venezuelan government will not accept more deportation flights from the US following a recent escalation of coercive measures against the Caribbean country.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government has \u201cprivately warned\u201d the Trump administration that it will not coordinate new repatriations after the US Treasury Department withdrew a license allowing Chevron to operate in Venezuela.\n\nCaracas has not publicly commented on the issue, with the Journal citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nVenezuela has received three groups of returned nationals following a high-profile meeting with White House Special Envoy Richard Grenell. The flights brought back nationals from Texas, Guant\u00e1namo (via Honduras) and Mexico. On the latter, Venezuelan authorities did not clarify if the Venezuelan families had been deported from the US to Mexico or if they had not managed to cross the border.\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized a migrant crackdown in its first weeks in office, particularly targeting Venezuelans. The Department of Homeland Security rescinded Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants, leaving as many as 600,000 at potential risk of deportation.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s reported reluctance to maintain engagement with the US on deportations follows Washington\u2019s recent removal of General License 41 (GL41) which allowed Chevron to run crude extraction and export operations in its Venezuela joining ventures.\n\nInstead, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 41A (GL41A) establishing a 30-day period for the oil giant to wind down its activities in the South American nation.\n\nThe move, first announced by Trump on February 27, contrasted with the White House\u2019s early policy of engagement with Caracas. According to reports, the administration hardened its economic pressure against Venezuela as a concession to foreign policy hardliners ahead of a crucial budget vote.\n\nFlorida Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar provided crucial votes for the narrowly approved budget. Though they also opposed the cancellation of TPS, which affected their constituencies, the Cuban-descent politicians focused their lobbying efforts on tighter sanctions against Venezuela.\n\nThe removal of General License 41 undid the Biden administration\u2019s only significant departure from the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions policy put in place during Trump\u2019s first term. The Biden White House issued General License 44 in October 2023, allowing Venezuela to export crude without levying heavy discounts or resorting to unreliable intermediaries. However, widespread restrictions were re-introduced after six months.\n\nWashington has targeted Venezuela\u2019s all-important oil sector in recent years in an effort to strangle the country\u2019s main revenue source. US Treasury coercive measures have included financial sanctions, an export embargo and secondary sanctions.\n\nChevron holds minority stakes in four joint projects that currently pump an estimated 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), just under a quarter of the industry\u2019s total output. Analysts have predicted that its impending exit will hurt the Venezuelan government\u2019s social spending ability and potentially trigger higher inflation.\n\nAfter forcing Chevron out of Venezuela, US officials have reportedly granted similar 30-day wind-down periods to French corporation Maurel & Prom and the US\u2019 Global Oil Terminals. The latter conglomerate, owned by magnate Harry Sargeant III, had secured a significant asphalt import deal until 2026.\n\nEuropean companies Eni (Italy) and Repsol (Spain), which have likewise increased their activities in Venezuela in recent years following US Treasury approval, are expected to be driven out in the coming weeks as well. Indian refining giant Reliance Industries received a green light to import Venezuelan crude, but it is unclear if the arrangement was open-ended or had an expiration date.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s dealings with international partners also allowed state oil company PDVSA to access highly needed diluents and light crude required to produce export blends and produce fuel. The recent sanctions ramp-up could additionally lead to gasoline and diesel shortages.\n\nFor its part, the Maduro government criticized the Chevron sanctions waiver withdrawal as \u201cdamaging and inexplicable\u201d and accused its US counterpart of bowing to pressure from Venezuela\u2019s hardline opposition.\n\nVenezuelan authorities went on to activate an \u201cAbsolute Productive Independence\u201d plan to ensure the stability of the energy sector. Maduro vowed that the oil sector would maintain its upward trend despite the tightening of coercive measures.\n\nEdited by Jos\u00e9 Luis Granados Ceja in Mexico City, Mexico.",

He made it clear that Venezuelan revolutionaries are anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist, independentists and Bolivarian, but not anti-American. Photo: Presidential Press\n\nCaracas, March 9 (RHC)-- Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has denounced that the U.S. administration, headed by Donald Trump, broke the communications that had been opened by revoking the license to the oil company Chevron to continue operations in the South American nation.\n\nDuring a commemorative event for International Women's Day, held this Saturday in Caracas, the Venezuelan head of state said that by making that decision, without any explanation, the Trump Administration shot itself in the foot and sanctioned an American company.\n\nMaduro called to defend peace and prevent harm to Venezuela. \"Here peace, work, and national unity will triumph above all else.\"\n\nHe explained that he was interested in communications with the Trump Administration \"because I wanted to bring all the Venezuelans who are imprisoned and persecuted there unjustly just for being migrants. Being migrants is not a crime (...), their human rights must be respected,\" he stressed.\n\nHe added that the decision also affected the trips scheduled for the return of compatriots from the United States, which were carried out through the Return to the Homeland Plan.\n\n\"If it were up to us, I'll say it more clearly, if it were up to me as president, if it were up to the high political-military command of the Bolivarian Revolution and if it were up to our people, that Chevron company would continue working in Venezuela for 100 more years. We have no problems,\" he said.\n\nHe questioned the fact that sectors of the extreme right are spreading the idea that Venezuela is anti-American. He made it clear that the Venezuelan revolutionaries are anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist, pro-independence and Bolivarian, but not anti-American.\n\nHe emphasized that the Venezuelan people do not recognize masters. \"We do not want to be colonies, nor do we want to be slaves of anyone, neither today nor ever.\" He added that anyone who wants to work in Venezuela within the framework of respect for its Constitution and its laws, and with mutually beneficial agreements, will be welcome.\n\n\"It is regrettable that they are carried away in the North by hatred, by revenge and by the desire to harm Venezuela (...) But I say to those who want to harm Venezuela, to the criminal fascist La Sayona or to those who hear it in the North: 'You are broke. Nobody is harming Venezuela. We are moving forward and the people today are more united than ever,' she stressed.\n\nThe Venezuelan president also denounced that the U.S. authorities covered up the evidence of the accusations of corruption made by Caracas against representatives of the far right such as Juan Guaid\u00f3, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Julio Borges, among others who are accused of stealing Venezuelan assets and U.S. funds that supposedly should have been used for humanitarian assistance.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Companies that Just Raised their Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other companies that just raised their dividends.\n\nDividend stocks have been attracting investor interest for quite some time, consistently delivering strong performances that highlight their long-term appeal. This growing investor preference has led many major technology companies to introduce dividend payments. As a result, dividends are no longer limited to traditional value stocks, with growth-oriented firms also emerging as significant dividend payers.\n\nHistorical trends show that dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed other asset classes across various market cycles. A report from T. Rowe Price highlights that dividends have made up nearly one-third of total equity returns for US stocks since 1926. During the period from 1980 to 2019, which saw a decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the broader market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nBy the end of September 2024, approximately 80% of companies in the broader market were distributing dividends\u2014a proportion that has remained relatively steady over the past decade. Notably, the technology sector represented nearly 24% of dividend-paying companies, a significant rise from 13% ten years ago. Other industries, such as healthcare and industrials, also experienced an uptick in firms offering dividends. This broader availability of dividend-paying stocks has provided income-focused investors with more opportunities to gain exposure to high-growth and innovative businesses. Given these developments, analysts maintain a positive outlook for dividend stocks as they head into 2025.\n\nDividend growth is closely tied to a strong earnings season. In February, the broader market struggled, declining by over 2% as concerns about inflation, upcoming tariffs under former President Donald Trump, and escalating geopolitical tensions weighed on investor sentiment. On February 28, the major index briefly dipped into negative territory for 2025. However, corporate earnings reports for the fourth quarter have provided a fresh catalyst for the market.\n\nAs of February 28, nearly 97% of companies in the broader market had reported earnings, with over 75% surpassing analyst expectations, according to FactSet. Many of these companies delivered encouraging news for income-focused investors. In the week ending February 25, data from JPMorgan showed that 20 companies announced dividend increases, with no reports of dividend cuts or suspensions during that period. This is positive for income investors, as dividend growth is always a welcomed development for them.",

Licenses for other foreign energy corporations will also be scrapped.\n\nThe revocation of oil licenses is a brutal provocation amid heightened military tensions with neighboring Guyana and the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department to remove all \u201cspecific licenses\u201d last week. Trump, who attempted to overturn the US elections in 2020 and is signing illegal executive decrees daily, said Venezuela has failed to meet democratic standards and respond efficiently to the deportation of migrants from the United States.\n\nThe licenses had provided an exemption to several North American, European and Indian companies from ongoing US sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas that were imposed under the first Trump administration.\n\nTheir revocation ends a financial lifeline for Venezuela, with immediate, catastrophic consequences. Chevron produces 242,000 barrels per day, while Spanish Repsol, French Maurel et Prom and Italian Eni produce an additional 83,000 bpd, according to the latest figures available. In total, these firms account for about 30 percent of Venezuelan oil output.\n\nVenezuelan reliance on Chevron for imported diluents to sell its heavy crude oil, technical expertise and resources for maintenance and operation will have a much broader impact. The sector had not recovered after years of declining infrastructure and capacity due to sanctions, mismanagement and corruption.\n\nWhile private Chinese and Iranian firms are expected to step in, and Caracas has focused on appealing to India for cooperation on energy, China and Russia more broadly have pulled back from operations with Venezuelan oil to avoid further US sanctions.\n\nOil production has historically been the main source of income for the Venezuelan government to pay for salaries, vital services and imports, including food, medicine and materials needed for production and maintenance.\n\nThe decision is only the latest instance in which the Trump administration responds to concessions made by other governments by pushing for more. It follows agreements reached in early February between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Trump\u2019s special envoy Richard Grenell, which included the release of six American prisoners and the resumption of deportation flights to Venezuela.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, however, has insisted that none of these talks will lead to the recognition of Maduro and made clear the ongoing intentions of ousting the Venezuelan government. Washington has continued to recognize US-backed opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as president-elect following elections last July which both Gonz\u00e1lez and Maduro claimed to have won.\n\nAlong with the threats to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal, control Greenland, invade Mexico and turn Canada into the 51st US state, the Trump administration is looking to assert its domination over the western hemisphere and turn its countries, particularly those with strategic natural resources like Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, into semi-colonies.\n\nThe calculation behind these devastating sanctions was to encourage sections of the Venezuelan military and capitalist ruling clique to overthrow Maduro and set up a US puppet state; however, even after the economy was reduced to less than a fifth of its previous size and nearly 8 million people, roughly a third of the population, left the country, this strategy has failed to oust Maduro.\n\nThis is due to the unpopularity of the far-right forces sponsored by the United States, who are known for demanding US sanctions and even an invasion, and not the result of popular policies by Maduro. On the contrary, the \u201cBolivarian\u201d government has overseen an economic shock therapy to place the entire weight of the crisis on the shoulders of the working class while providing tax cuts and other incentives to foreign capital. A haphazard experiment of partial dollarization to overcome currency depreciation has made the economy much more vulnerable.\n\nGiven the failure of past coup attempts, Trump, Rubio and several other top officials have previously endorsed the possibility of a military incursion into Venezuela to overthrow Maduro. However, this could result in levels of destruction, death and economic cost akin to the US-led wars in the Middle East.\n\nThe recent decision by Donald Trump to revoke licenses that allowed Chevron to export Venezuelan oil is closely linked to rising tensions with neighboring Guyana.\n\nGuyana\u2019s President Irfaan Ali notified the Trump administration and other international allies on Saturday that an armed Venezuelan naval vessel had entered disputed waters that harbor a major offshore oil deposit being exploited by an Exxon-led consortium.\n\nThe Guyanese military, which operates in close collaboration with the Pentagon, deployed aircraft and naval vessels, while the US State Department warned on X: \u201cFurther provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime.\n\nVenezuelan Vice-President and Oil Minister, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez denounced Ali for telling \u201cbald-faced lies\u201d indicating that the naval activities took place in \u201cdisputed international waters.\u201d The disputed territory of \u201cGuyana Essequibo,\u201d she added, \u201cbelongs to Venezuelan men and women and nobody else, and we will defend it with our lives. Don\u2019t even dare, here we have a Bolivarian National Armed Forces, a civic-military-police union that stands up to defend our country.\u201d\n\nThe nationalist bombast and militarism are signs of a cornered regime. The danger that Caracas makes the reactionary decision to move into the disputed territory and take the bait set up by Washington, similar to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, cannot be discarded.\n\nRodr\u00edguez called Trump\u2019s license revocation \u201cdamaging and inexplicable.\u201d But the intensification of efforts to install a puppet regime are not only explicable but the only reasonable expectation from US imperialism and its leader Trump, who models his regime after Hitler.\n\nThe Venezuelan ruling clique around Maduro has made clear that it is ultimately dependent upon and subservient to US imperialism and unable to muster a genuine defense against threats of neo-colonial subjugation. These threats, involving economic and potentially military devastation, can only be confronted through the independent mobilization of the working class in Venezuela, in a united struggle with workers of the United States and across the region on the basis of a socialist program.",

            "content": "Buffett\u2019s value investing concepts remain intact even as markets shift. He draws attention to the company\u2019s growing stakes in five significant Japanese trading firms, which represents an exceptional but purposeful venture into international stocks. He mentioned that after reviewing the financial records, they were surprised by how undervalued the stocks appeared. Despite some of these equities declining by as much as 24% over the past year, he regarded these downturns as investment opportunities rather than reasons for concern. He also emphasized that their holdings in these five companies were intended to be long-term investments.\n\nBuffett\u2019s longtime belief that equities, which represent ownership in successful companies, are still the best way to build wealth over the long run is reflected in this position. He cautions against turning to cash or bonds, particularly in inflationary times when bond returns lag behind price increases and the currency depreciates.\n\n\u201cDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett made it clear in his 2025 shareholder letter that Berkshire is not abandoning stocks, even though some analysts claim that the company has a record $334 billion in cash that it is reserving. Buffett tells shareholders,\n\nWarren Buffett wagered $1 million in 2007 that the broader market index fund would outperform a group of hedge funds over ten years. Buffett\u2019s preferred Vanguard Index Fund Admiral Shares produced average yearly returns of 7.1%, despite the 2008 financial crisis, compared to the average of the hedge funds of 2.2%. While hedge funds only reached $121,000 by 2016, a $100,000 investment in Vanguard grew to $185,000. The primary issue was fees, with hedge funds\u2019 2% management fees and 20% profit share reducing earnings compared to index funds\u2019 0.03% fees. Buffett\u2019s straightforward approach, supported by inexpensive investing, far outpaced pricey active management.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the most successful investors the world has known. Additionally, he is arguably one of the strongest supporters of long-term investing. Buffett uses his hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway , to invest in solid businesses, and he frequently keeps such stocks for years or even decades.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other Warren Buffett Stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBuffett\u2019s conviction that patient investors will eventually be rewarded by undervalued companies with solid fundamentals is seen in Japanese investments. He commends these businesses for their prudent capital management, shareholder-friendly practices, and fair executive pay. Buffett\u2019s strategy highlights a key idea in value investing: if the underlying company is favorable, short-term price volatility doesn\u2019t matter. Buffett has shown throughout his career that he does not hesitate to look for bargains, even if they are located outside of the United States.\n\nThe route to success continues to be apparent for investors who want to follow in Buffett\u2019s footsteps: own up to your mistakes, stick with profitable assets like equities, and patiently invest where value is present despite short-term noise.\n\n10 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nA tanker truck making its way through a refinery facility. .\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Warren Buffett\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds in Q4 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock\u2019s revenue growth (year-over-year) as a tiebreaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nRevenue Growth Rate (year-over-year): 0.39%\n\nThe multinational oil company Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in exploration, production, and refining activities. It produces 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes 1.8 million barrels of liquids and 7.7 million cubic feet of natural gas, making it the second-largest oil firm in the US. Production takes place throughout South and North America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe.\n\nIt recently disclosed a partnership to create scalable power solutions, including carbon capture and storage, based on natural gas-fired turbines to satisfy the growing energy needs of data centers in the United States. Moreover, the company successfully started producing gas from the Sanha Lean Gas Connection project, guaranteeing the Angola Liquefied Natural Gas facility a steady supply of natural gas. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has gone up by about 5% since the start of 2025, making it one of the Best Warren Buffett Stocks.\n\nIn 2024, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) broke records and exceeded expectations. While output in the United States rose by an astounding 19% to record levels, output globally grew by 7%. Looking ahead to 2025, growth is projected to continue, supported by the full-year benefits of the PDC Energy acquisition, which closed in August 2023. The introduction of significant projects in the Gulf of Mexico and continued growth in the Permian Basin, where output jumped by 18%, further strengthened its overall performance.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in the company among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database at the end of Q4 2024. It owns 118.61 million shares worth $17.18 billion as of Q4.\n\nOverall CVX ranks 10th on our list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "March 7, 2025 \u2013 Oklahoma lawmakers have taken a step toward eliminating Chevron deference from the state\u2019s judicial system.\n\nThe Oklahoma House of Representatives on Monday passed a bill sponsored by Rep. Gerrid Kendrix (R) that would prevent courts and administrative officials from deferring to state agencies when interpreting laws and regulations.\n\nThe legislation would, among other things, \u201cestablish that state courts, hearing examiners, or administrative officers must independently interpret state statutes, regulations, and sub-regulatory documents without deferring to a state agency's interpretation.\u201d\n\nThe Chevron doctrine, enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1984, required federal courts to defer to an agency like the FCC in the interpretation of ambiguous statutes passed by Congress, giving the agency a leg up in court battles. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2024 ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo overturned the forty-year-old Chevron precedent, subjecting FCC regulations to stricter judicial scrutiny.\n\nKendrix said the bill was inspired by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Loper Bright.\n\nOklahoma House Speaker Kyle Hilbert (R) praised the bill for keeping agencies from growing too powerful.\n\n\u201cBy eliminating the Chevron deference, we are restoring proper checks and balances and reaffirming that agencies cannot expand their own authority beyond what the law allows,\u201d Hilbert said.\n\nOklahoma is not alone in pursuing such changes. On Wednesday, a Kentucky House committee advanced a similar measure, signaling a broader push to curtail agency power at a state level.",

Layoffs Follow Voluntary Buyouts, Raising Concerns Over Refinery Closures & CA Gas Prices.Chevron Corporation has announced plans to reduce its global workforce by an estimated 15% to 20%, aligning with an initiative to streamline operations and reduce expenditures by $3 billion by 2026. This decision follows Chevron's headquarters transition from San Ramon, California, to Houston, Texas, a move aimed at fostering closer collaboration with industry leaders.According to an internal memo [], voluntary buyout options were extended to employees in April and May, with final layoffs scheduled to conclude by June. Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth and Vice Chairman Mark Nelson guided the relocation earlier this year, emphasizing strategic advantages in the Houston market. Chevron reported a workforce of 45,600 employees as of December 2023 and indicated that positions tied to California's refinery and technical operations will remain intact.Recent developments suggest that Chevron has considered closing certain California refinery operations. Such action could notably affect gasoline prices in the region, given that the company's refineries are responsible for producing approximately one-third of California's gasoline. Any significant curtailment of refining capacity may pose challenges for both employees and consumers in the state.The headquarters shift concludes a 145-year era in the Bay Area, where Chevron operated initially in San Francisco before relocating to San Ramon in 2001. The earlier move was partially influenced by proximity requirements for the Richmond refinery and concerns regarding San Francisco's business tax policies. More recently, Chevron has expressed dissatisfaction with California's regulatory framework, particularly in the realm of climate legislation. The corporation is currently embroiled in litigation with the state concerning its environmental impact, with Wirth voicing support for a global policy approach as opposed to what he terms \"piecemeal litigation.\"Investor sentiment remains cautious, as reflected by a 1.6% dip in Chevron's stock price following the announcement. Industry observers note that ongoing workforce restructuring and operational realignments have introduced a level of uncertainty into the company's near-term outlook.Burgeoning interest has emerged among professionals affected by these workforce changes in specialized retirement planning guidance.

            "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department has handed Chevron a one-month window to cease its activities in Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 41A (GL41A) establishing that the energy giant\u2019s operations in its Venezuela joint ventures are only authorized through April 3.\n\nThe new document replaced General License 41 (GL41), which was issued by the Biden administration in November 2022 allowing Chevron to resume crude extraction and export processes in the Caribbean Nation. Under the new restrictions, the company is not even allowed to perform basic maintenance operations.\n\nThe Donald Trump administration announced its decision to force a shutdown of Chevron\u2019s Venezuela activities on February 27. The White House argued that the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government did not fulfill electoral pledges and was not accepting migrant deportations fast enough.\n\nThe sanctions waiver withdrawal, alongside the highly shortened wind-down period, marks a significant escalation of Washington\u2019s economic coercion against Venezuela. The moves contrast with Trump\u2019s early engagement with Caracas which saw Special Envoy Richard Grenell hold a high-profile meeting with Maduro.\n\nAxios reported that the revocation of Chevron\u2019s license, a long-standing demand of foreign policy extremists and Venezuelan far-right politicians, was a result of pressure from Florida Republican House members ahead of a crucial U.S. Congress budget decision.\n\nRepresentatives Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar produced key votes in the narrowly approved budget deal following the announcement of GL41\u2019s removal. Nicknamed \u201cCrazy Cubans\u201d in reference to their roots, the three politicians heavily lobbied the administration to ramp up economic aggression against Caracas.\n\nThough they also opposed the White House\u2019s cancellation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants, leaving some 600,000 at risk of deportation, Diaz-Balart, Gimenez and Salazar prioritized the hardening of sanctions over their constituents\u2019 interests.\n\nFor its part, the Maduro government criticized the planned withdrawal of Chevron\u2019s sanctions exemption as \u201cdamaging and inexplicable,\u201d while vowing that the country\u2019s economic recovery would continue.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Caracas issued a statement accusing the U.S. government of \u201cbowing to the pressure\u201d of the Venezuelan opposition. Authorities went on to announce the activation of an \u201cAbsolute Productive Independence\u201d plan to secure the stability of the energy sector.\n\nGL41 was the Biden administration\u2019s only major departure from the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign imposed by Trump in his first term. OFAC issued General License 44 in October 2023, allowing Venezuela to freely export crude, but reimposed widespread restrictions six months later.\n\nThe South American country\u2019s most important industry remains heavily burdened by coercive measures, including financial sanctions, an export embargo and secondary sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department likewise announced a review of authorizations granted to other foreign corporations to deal with Venezuela\u2019s oil sector. European firms Repsol (Spain), Eni (Italy) and Maurel & Prom (France) all received Washington\u2019s green light in recent years to ramp up operations in energy projects. Indian refining giant Reliance received permission to import Venezuelan crude.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\u2019s state-owned National Gas Company also sought U.S. approval to pursue two natural gas projects in Venezuelan waters alongside BP and Shell, respectively.\n\nChevron holds minority stakes in four joint ventures that currently produce around 200,000 crude barrels per day (bpd), 20-25 percent of the country\u2019s total output. According to Reuters, the company will abide by the Treasury\u2019s directions to implement GL41.\n\nThe sudden removal of the firm\u2019s sanctions waiver will have an immediate impact on Venezuela\u2019s oil production. Washington\u2019s sanctions ramp-up is likely to foster increased overcompliance as well, with international agents more inclined to avoid transactions with state oil company PDVSA. Venezuela has been forced to levy significant discounts and resort to unreliable intermediaries in order to export crude cargoes.\n\nAnalysts additionally predict that the fall in oil revenues will affect the Venezuelan government\u2019s social spending ability and the supply of foreign currency, potentially triggering renewed inflation.\n\nEdited by Cira Pascual Marquina in Caracas.",

Chevron\u2019s exit is a blow to Venezuela, where it helped boost oil output to over 1 million barrels per day in January 2025, the highest since June 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado welcomed the White House's measures, arguing they cut off funds Maduro\u2019s regime uses for repression, not public welfare. She claimed the government earned up to US$ 4.5 billion from Chevron\u2019s operations last year, money spent on elite forces and lavish lifestyles for Maduro\u2019s allies.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times by video call from a hiding place inside Venezuela, Machado mentioned that oil revenues \u201cdidn\u2019t go to hospitals and schools, it was spent on repression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regime used the money that belonged to the Venezuelan people to fund repression against the Venezuelan people,\u201d she also pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhere did that money go?\u201d Machado wondered. \u201cTo the elite repression forces who now have new vehicles, new weapons and new technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new Trump administration now poses a much greater threat to the regime,\u201d Machado further acknowledged.\n\nAnalysts from Ecoanal\u00edtica predict the loss could slow Venezuela\u2019s economic growth from 3.2% to 2% this year, weaken the bolivar (Venezuela's currency), and fuel inflation, which hit 48% in 2024.\n\nThe former US administration of President Joseph Biden had granted Chevron\u2019s license in 2022 to encourage fair elections. However, Maduro\u2019s July 28, 2024, victory came amid fraud allegations as the opposition showed evidence that the Unitarian Democratic Platform's (PUD) Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia had prevailed despite announcements from the government-managed National Electoral Council (CNE).",

            "content": "Chevron (CVX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this oil company have returned -1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Chevron belongs, has lost 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $2.53 per share, indicating a change of -13.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.79 points to a change of +7.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.59 indicates a change of +16.8% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

ODU must win four more games in four days to get to Monday\u2019s Sun Belt championship game, but for now, they\u2019ve done what they had to do \u2013 survived to play another day.\n\nODU had not won a postseason game since 2019, when the Monarchs defeated Western Kentucky, 62-56, in the Conference USA championship game, and Jones said he was proud his team ended that losing streak.\n\n\u201cI told the guys in the locker room just before we walked onto the court\u201d that the Monarchs hadn\u2019t won in the postseason since 2019, Jones said.\n\n\"We were aware we hadn't won in a long time.\"\n\n\u201cGetting that first win gives us a lot of confidence going into the next game,\u201d added senior guard R.J. Blakney, who had eight points. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely grateful for this win.\u201d\n\nLouisiana (12-21) entered Wednesday\u2019s game having won five of its last eight games and while the Ragin\u2019 Cajuns kept it close most of the way, the Monarchs used their superior size and speed to pull away.\n\nDurugordon, a third-team All-Sun Belt choice, had his 14th double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nJones has often called Swanton-Rodger one of the best big men in the Sun Belt, and the 7-foot junior center from Calgary, Alberta, Canada certainly looked the part on Wednesday.\n\nHe made nine of 13 shots and had 10 rebounds to tally his first career college double-double. He added three blocked shots.\n\nPoint guard Jaden Johnson played a superb floor game and had nine assists. Robert Davis Jr. added 10 points.\n\nTaller and more physical than the Ragin\u2019 Cajuns, ODU outrebounded Louisiana, 43-24, and had a 36-26 scoring advantage in the paint.\n\nSwanton-Rodger was red hot from the opening tip as he poured in eight points in the game\u2019s first five minutes. Durugordon\u2019s fast-break layup with 1:09 left gave ODU a 29-23 lead the Monarchs carried into the second half.\n\nJones said the Monarchs did not play well in the first half.\n\n\"We had the first-game tournament jitters,\" he said. \"But we overcame that in the second half.\"\n\nLouisiana kept it close in the early minutes of the second half, but then Swanton-Rodger gave the Monarchs the lead for good, 40-38, on a dunk shot with 13:51 to go. Two minutes later, he had another dunk that gave the Monarchs a 44-39 lead.\n\nDurugordon had a three-point shot and Blakney a layup with 7:24 left and ODU led by 10, 54-44.\n\nBlakney\u2019s layup with 4:19 left gave the Monarchs a 60-46 lead and ODU coasted from there.\n\nThe Monarchs have been beset with injuries and lost some heartbreakingly close games, but through it all, Jones said, \u201cwe stayed together.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot. And you know, I\u2019ve been around this game long enough to know that a lot of other teams wouldn\u2019t have persevered through everything we\u2019ve been through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been patient with them and they\u2019ve been patient with me and through the good times and the bad times, we haven\u2019t wavered. We haven\u2019t blinked.\u201d\n\nTexas State eliminated ODU from the last two Sun Belt tournaments. ODU headed into the 2023 tournament with a 19-12 record but the Monarchs played poorly and fell to the Bobcats, 65-36.\n\nThe Monarchs led most of the way against Texas State last season, but beset with foul trouble and hobbled by the flu, ODU fell to the Bobcats in overtime, 92-83.\n\nODU upended Texas State, 75-64, on Feb. 5 at Chartway Arena.\n\n\u201cThey had a couple of guys who did not play the last time we played them,\u201d Jones said. \u201cRegardless of who they suit up, we\u2019ve got to worry about what we can control.\n\n\u201cWe can control our effort and we can control our execution.\n\n\u201cTexas State has been our nemesis in this tournament and we get another shot at them tomorrow.\u201d",

The deadline, set for April 3, provides the company only 30 days instead of the normal six-month wind-down period.\n\nSince 2022, Chevron has been allowed to operate in Venezuela as an exception to U.S. sanctions, exporting crude to the United States and recovering billions in pending debt. However, with the new directive, the company must halt its operations.\n\nA similar wind-down order was provided by Trump\u2019s administration in 2020, which allowed Chevron to continue production in Venezuela but banned its exports or imports to the United States.\n\nImpact on U.S. and Venezuelan Oil Markets\n\nChevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela has been a key stabilizer for both countries\u2019 oil sectors. The company\u2019s joint ventures with state firm PDVSA account for nearly 20% of Venezuela\u2019s oil output, which has significantly bolstered the country\u2019s economy, controlled its sky-high inflation and injected hard currency into its private sector.\n\nChevron, currently carrying Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has also been a source of heavy crude to major oil refining companies in the United States, such as Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, PBF Energy Inc. PBF and many more.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe license termination will not only reduce Venezuela\u2019s oil revenues but may also pressure U.S. gasoline prices and increase the risks for U.S. companies to invest overseas.\n\nFebruary data showed a decline in Chevron\u2019s Venezuelan oil exports from 294,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January to 252,000 bpd. This downward trend could accelerate, affecting crude supply chains globally.\n\nVenezuela's Economic and Political Fallout\n\nMaduro\u2019s administration has strongly opposed the sanctions, citing them as illegitimate measures that lead to economic war. Since 2023, Chevron\u2019s operations in Venezuela have provided the country with a steady source of revenues in terms of royalties and tax payments, lifting Venezuela\u2019s economy, especially its oil and banking sectors.\n\nThe loss of Chevron\u2019s payments in royalties and taxes may weaken the country's exchange market, leading to currency depreciation and further economic instability.\n\nAlthough the magnitude of the scale-down was not immediately clear, the company said that it is aware of Trump's directive and would abide by any direction given by Treasury to implement it.",

            "content": "Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (XOM -1.04%), Chevron (CVX 0.30%), and ConocoPhillips (COP -0.58%) were all trailing the market today, falling 3.6%, 2.8%, and 4.2% at their lows, before recovering to declines of 3%, 1.9%, and 3%, respectively, as of 12:51 p.m. ET.\n\nThe declines stood in contrast to the broader market indices, which all bounced into positive territory by that time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, oil prices were down sharply on the day. Lower oil prices may could offer some relief to consumers, perhaps explaining the rise in other sectors, but the reasons for the price decline may not ultimately be a great sign for the economy overall.\n\nA weak jobs report, tariff threats, and Russia\n\nThis morning, the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) jobs report for February was released, coming in far below expectations. Private sector jobs added were just 77,000, down from the 186,000 added in January and well below the 144,000 that was expected.\n\nThe big miss was likely caused by the same factors that has caused a recent downturn in consumer sentiment, as well as reductions in estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) growth: tariff uncertainty, along with cuts to government spending and the laying off of large swathes of federal workers.\n\nThese rapid-fire changes have upended the prospects of economic growth in the near-term and increased the possibility of stagflation, since tariffs raise prices to consumers while also harming economic activity and lowering business confidence.\n\nAnother possible headwind to these three stocks is that the Trump administration has said it would likely counter price increases from tariffs by \"unleashing American energy,\" thereby lowering energy prices for consumers. For instance, just today, the Trump administration's Department of Energy approved an extension of Exxon's Golden Pass LNG export terminal.\n\nThe problem for energy stocks is that while lower regulations would be a tailwind for production growth, increased supply could also cause lower prices, counteracting those lower costs and leading to a potential overall negative impact to profits.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, there is also the possibility that another big source of global oil supply may come online soon in a bigger way: Russia.\n\nTwo days ago, it was reported that the Trump administration had directed officials to draft a proposal on lifting sanctions on Russia, which would likely come in conjunction with a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. Then yesterday, Russian officials said ending the war would be conditional on those sanctions being relieved.\n\nRussia is obviously a big oil producer, and while it has been able to sell oil via some workarounds amid sanctions put on by the Biden administration, full sanctions relief could make it easier to sell to more countries, and thereby receive better prices. Increased competition in currently sanctioned countries could lower the overall price of Brent Crude, which is the price at which Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have been realizing.\n\nSlowdown or no?\n\nEnergy stock shares did rebound off their lows later in the day, as did most stocks, after the administration announced a one-month pause in tariffs for automakers who complied with the 2020 USMCA agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada during the trading day.\n\nThat being said, the chaotic tariff announcements, delays, and backpedals are clearly causing employers to slow down hiring amid all the uncertainty. Judging by recent data, an economic slowdown appears to be happening. Whether it turns into a recession or amounts to just a growth scare remains to be seen.\n\nLower oil prices may be good for consumers, assuming they still have a job, but it won't be great for these oil giants. While these three may see some relief on regulations and costs, the offset of lower oil and gas prices may more than compensate for it.\n\nEnergy investors therefore need to hope for a pickup in growth once the economy digests all the tariffs, federal layoffs, and perhaps the relaxation of Russian sanctions in the first few months of the new Administration.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to revoke Chevron\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela may be felt well beyond the South American country\u2019s borders.\n\nThe move \u2014 announced by Trump in a Truth Social post last week \u2014 will be a major blow to Venezuela. Chevron produces about a fifth of Venezuela\u2019s crude annually, according to analysts at the Rystad Energy research firm, and losing the ability to export to the U.S. will be a blow to the country\u2019s already floundering economy.\n\nFor Chevron, it represents a pause in more than 100 years operating in Venezuela and an inability to recoup debts it is owed by Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrices for oil in the U.S. could also rise, and prices at the pump could climb in regions that depend on getting gasoline from Gulf Coast refiners that use Venezuela\u2019s heavy crude. Benchmark U.S. oil was trading for less than $70 a barrel on Monday, and the industry will be closely watching to see where it goes from here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last stalwart of a U.S. supermajor in Venezuela going away,\u201d said Tom Liskey, senior regional manager for Latin America with the Enverus energy analytics firm, about Trump\u2019s decision on Chevron. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s more questions than answers as to what could happen.\u201d\n\nBill Turenne, a spokesperson for Chevron, said the company was looking into Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the president\u2019s announcement and are considering its implications,\u201d he wrote Friday in a statement. \u201cChevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nLosing its ability to produce in Venezuela is the latest in a string of headlines about the second-largest U.S. oil major.\n\nChevron announced last year that it was moving its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston amid ongoing tension over regulations in the Golden State. Chevron already has thousands of workers in Texas\u2019 largest city and uses downtown office space formerly occupied by Enron.\n\nTurenne said the lower cost of living, Texas\u2019 business-friendly environment and proximity to oil and gas infrastructure were major considerations in a move meant to help with efficiency and collaboration.\n\nThen last month, the company told employees it would shed as much as 20 percent of its workforce before the end of 2026 \u2014 following downsizing announcements at companies such as BP and Shell.\n\nTurenne has said that decision was made to simplify Chevron\u2019s organizational structure and position it for \u201cstronger long-term competitiveness.\u201d He said the layoffs were in line with an earlier announcement that the company is aiming to cut $2 billion to $3 billion in costs by the end of 2026.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement about Venezuela, meanwhile, is another blow to Chevron\u2019s South American plans at a time when investors are interested in the growth prospects and production outlook at big oil and gas companies amid price uncertainty.\n\n\u201cTwo things are probably the key themes for Chevron right now,\u201d said Allen Good, director of equity research with Morningstar financial services. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over long-term growth and the near-term weakness in oil prices.\u201d\n\nChevron in October 2023 announced a $53 billion deal to acquire Hess \u2014 part of a wave of mergers and acquisitions among major oil companies \u2014 only for rival Exxon Mobil to challenge one of the largest parts of that deal. At issue is a stake in a massive oil field off the coast of Guyana, which is just east of Venezuela.\n\nThe Stabroek Block could have as many as 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. Hess holds a 30 percent stake in the Guyana block, while Exxon has a 45 percent stake and operates the project and infrastructure.\n\nAn Exxon spokesperson pointed POLITICO\u2019s E&E News to a December 2024 corporate update during which Exxon CEO Darren Woods said Hess\u2019 stake presents an opportunity for Exxon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed the value of that asset. We have a right to consider the value of that asset in this transaction and a right to then take an option on it,\u201d Woods said in the December call. \u201cThere is an option value here. We think it\u2019s in the best interests of all our shareholders to maintain that value option. Why would we give that away because one of the partners constructed a deal with another third party?\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from E&E News, Chevron pointed to an interview with CEO Mike Wirth in an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Jan. 31. During the interview, Wirth said he\u2019s confident that Hess and Chevron will prevail in arbitration and that Chevron will be able to take Hess\u2019 stake in Guyana.\n\n\u201cIt has taken longer than we would have liked,\u201d Wirth said of the deal. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a line of sight to resolution later this year.\u201d\n\n\u2018A real hunger\u2019\n\nIn Venezuela, Chevron has weathered the former Hugo Ch\u00e1vez regime and remained the only U.S. oil companies to continue operating in the country after Ch\u00e1vez nationalized the country\u2019s oil industry and mandated that international companies sign onto joint ventures with national oil company PDVSA as minority partners.\n\nExxon and ConocoPhillips, for example, pulled out of the country in 2007 after refusing to obey Venezuela\u2019s oil nationalization rules, said Schreiner Parker, managing director for Latin America at Rystad Energy.\n\n\u201cChevron has been able to maintain the relationship\u201d with Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas company and its government \u201cbecause of the nature of their assets,\u201d Parker said.\n\nWhile Chevron produces a sizable portion of Venezuela\u2019s crude, it\u2019s a small part of its overall portfolio. Chevron\u2019s South American assets, including Venezuela, were just 5.2 percent of its international upstream liquids production last year, according to the company\u2019s 2024 earnings report.\n\nThat lasted until April 2020, when the first Trump administration told Chevron to \u201cwind down\u201d its production in Venezuela as that administration ratcheted up economic sanctions against the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Parker said.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden approved a license in 2022 to allow Chevron to produce Venezuelan crude that could be sent to the U.S. during negotiations with the Maduro government \u2014 after Maduro restarted talks with opposition groups and made pledges to allow independent candidates to run in Venezuela\u2019s 2024 election. That license, known as General License 41, was issued by the Treasury Department.\n\nEven though many of those pledges fell to the wayside before, during and after the 2024 Venezuelan election, the Biden administration continued to reauthorize Chevron\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela every six months.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s de facto opposition leader recently defended the Trump administration\u2019s decision to halt oil licenses.\n\nPart of the reason Biden may have restarted the import of Venezuelan oil, Parker said, is the type of crude that comes from Venezuela. It\u2019s known as heavy crude, and that is a key type of oil processed by refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Those refineries are largely unable to work with the lighter crude oil that comes from areas like the Permian Basin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real hunger from the Gulf Coast refining community to get heavy crude. They traditionally got it from Venezuela; when they didn\u2019t get it from Venezuela, then they got it from Russia,\u201d Parker said.\n\nHe noted that Russian imports to the U.S. came to a halt after April 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine in February that same year.\n\n\u201cPart of calculus is that importing up to 200,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan heavy crude just prior to the U.S. election could help stabilize gas prices or put a little bit of a ceiling on gasoline prices,\u201d Parker said.\n\nIn December 2024, the most recent month for which the U.S. Energy Information Administration has data, the United States was importing an average of 296,000 barrels a day from Venezuela.\n\nConsumer implications\n\nLiskey with Enverus said a rise in crude oil prices after Trump\u2019s Venezuela announcement may have been a knee-jerk reaction. But he said there will be clear impacts to U.S. markets.\n\nCutting off oil supplies from Venezuela could cause prices for U.S. gasoline to rise, especially throughout the Gulf Coast, according to Liskey.\n\nAnd higher prices could lead to political implications for Trump, who campaigned on pledges to lower prices at the pump.\n\nOn Monday, AAA reported an average price of $3.097 per gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. That was down from $3.346 per gallon a year earlier, the automobile club said. But more pricing pressure could be on the way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving into peak driving season. Everyone\u2019s going to be hitting the road, and the government has promised a better economy,\u201d Liskey said.\n\nObservers also will be watching gasoline prices in places like the Midwest and Rocky Mountains, where refineries depend on Canadian heavy crude supplies that could be affected by tariffs proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nIn response to questions from E&E News, the White House press office pointed to the fact that Venezuela is not a top supplier of imported crude to the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, the top importers are Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Colombia \u2014 which largely send heavy crude to the U.S.\n\nThe White House also said that Gulf Coast refineries have started processing lighter crude as well, which the EIA noted in 2018.\n\nParker said it\u2019s surprising to see Chevron defend its stake in Venezuela when so little of its portfolio is produced there and operating in the country presents unique challenges.\n\nCountries such as Colombia that produce heavier crude could help fill part of that gap, Liskey said. Russia, too, may return as a source with heavy crude, he said, now that Trump and President Vladimir Putin have begun to discuss what Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month are \u201cincredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians.\u201d\n\nBut those potential imports are far from certain, Liskey said.\n\n\u201cAlmost every world leader in this equation between Russia, the U.S. and Venezuela are very unpredictable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many aspects to the equation that you just cannot define yet.\u201d",

(Chevron)\n\nCaracas, March 4, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 The US Treasury Department has handed Chevron a one-month window to cease its activities in Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 41A (GL41A) establishing that the energy giant\u2019s operations in its Venezuela joint ventures are only authorized through April 3.\n\nThe new document replaced General License 41 (GL41), which was issued by the Biden administration in November 2022 allowing Chevron to resume crude extraction and export processes in the Caribbean Nation. Under the new restrictions, the company is not even allowed to perform basic maintenance operations.\n\nThe Donald Trump administration announced its decision to force a shutdown of Chevron\u2019s Venezuela activities on February 27. The White House argued that the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government did not fulfill electoral pledges and was not accepting migrant deportations fast enough.\n\nThe sanctions waiver withdrawal, alongside the highly shortened wind-down period, marks a significant escalation of Washington\u2019s economic coercion against Venezuela. The moves contrast with Trump\u2019s early engagement with Caracas which saw Special Envoy Richard Grenell hold a high-profile meeting with Maduro.\n\nAxios reported that the revocation of Chevron\u2019s license, a long-standing demand of foreign policy extremists and Venezuelan far-right politicians, was a result of pressure from Florida Republican House members ahead of a crucial US Congress budget decision.\n\nRepresentatives Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar produced key votes in the narrowly approved budget deal following the announcement of GL41\u2019s removal. Nicknamed \u201cCrazy Cubans\u201d in reference to their roots, the three politicians heavily lobbied the administration to ramp up economic aggression against Caracas.\n\nThough they also opposed the White House\u2019s cancellation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants, leaving some 600,000 at risk of deportation, Diaz-Balart, Gimenez and Salazar prioritized the hardening of sanctions over their constituents\u2019 interests.\n\nFor its part, the Maduro government criticized the planned withdrawal of Chevron\u2019s sanctions exemption as \u201cdamaging and inexplicable,\u201d while vowing that the country\u2019s economic recovery would continue.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Caracas issued a statement accusing the US government of \u201cbowing to the pressure\u201d of the Venezuelan opposition. Authorities went on to announce the activation of an \u201cAbsolute Productive Independence\u201d plan to secure the stability of the energy sector.\n\nGL41 was the Biden administration\u2019s only major departure from the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign imposed by Trump in his first term. OFAC issued General License 44 in October 2023, allowing Venezuela to freely export crude, but reimposed widespread restrictions six months later.\n\nThe South American country\u2019s most important industry remains heavily burdened by coercive measures, including financial sanctions, an export embargo and secondary sanctions.\n\nThe US Treasury Department likewise announced a review of authorizations granted to other foreign corporations to deal with Venezuela\u2019s oil sector. European firms Repsol (Spain), Eni (Italy) and Maurel & Prom (France) all received Washington\u2019s green light in recent years to ramp up operations in energy projects. Indian refining giant Reliance received permission to import Venezuelan crude.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\u2019s state-owned National Gas Company also sought US approval to pursue two natural gas projects in Venezuelan waters alongside BP and Shell, respectively.\n\nChevron holds minority stakes in four joint ventures that currently produce around 200,000 crude barrels per day (bpd), 20-25 percent of the country\u2019s total output. According to Reuters, the company will abide by the Treasury\u2019s directions to implement GL41.\n\nThe sudden removal of the firm\u2019s sanctions waiver will have an immediate impact on Venezuela\u2019s oil production. Washington\u2019s sanctions ramp-up is likely to foster increased overcompliance as well, with international agents more inclined to avoid transactions with state oil company PDVSA. Venezuela has been forced to levy significant discounts and resort to unreliable intermediaries in order to export crude cargoes.\n\nAnalysts additionally predict that the fall in oil revenues will affect the Venezuelan government\u2019s social spending ability and the supply of foreign currency, potentially triggering renewed inflation.\n\nEdited by Cira Pascual Marquina in Caracas.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US administration of Donald Trump is giving Chevron Corp. one month to stop producing oil in Venezuela, delivering a heavy blow to President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s autocratic regime.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe US Treasury set an April 3 deadline for the oil major to wrap up operations in the country, much less than the normal six-month wind-down period. The narrow time frame is an unexpected hit to Maduro, significantly ratcheting up pressure on him to quickly make a deal over democratic reforms and accepting more migrants from the US.\n\n\u201cClosing down Chevron\u2019s operations in a month is an almost impossible task,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \u201cI would bet the administration is leaving space for the license to be renewed in April, if new terms are negotiated.\u201d\n\nChevron, which has a Treasury Department waiver to operate in Venezuela despite US sanctions, is a key driver of the nation\u2019s economic growth. The company has ramped up production in recent years to supply about 20% of Venezuela\u2019s output, helping inject hard currency into the country\u2019s private sector.\n\nEnding Chevron\u2019s production in Venezuela could eventually remove as many as 200,000 barrels a day from the global market. Much of that oil is shipped to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, which are designed to process the country\u2019s heavy crude. It\u2019s unlikely to have an immediate impact on oil prices, especially after OPEC unexpectedly decided to lift production this week, beginning with a 138,000 barrel-a-day increase in April.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude declined 1% to $67.67 at 16:37 p.m. in New York, on course for the lowest close this year.\n\nChevron said in a statement it would abide by the Treasury\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cChevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S. government,\u201d the company said. Chevron shares fell 0.7% on Tuesday.\n\nDollar bonds from Venezuela and its state-owned oil company fell. Sovereign notes due in 2027 slipped 0.8 cent to 19.1 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSome critics, including Florida Republican lawmakers, argue that Chevron is providing an economic lifeline to Maduro even after he reneged on pledges for democratic reforms last year. Trump has also criticized Maduro for failing to accelerate the pace of flights of migrants from the US quickly enough.",

The measure, outlined in the newly issued regulation (General License 40A) shortens the original six-month timeline set under the now-revoked General License 40.\n\n\u201cOne month is a very short period for an orderly wind-down,\u201d according to a person familiar with the industry. It is not clear whether Chevron will be allowed to load and ship Venezuelan oil in March, or if cargoes will be halted immediately.\n\nThe U.S. has not officially removed private authorizations granted to the likes of Eni, Repsol, Maurel & Prom and Reliance, but these companies are also likely to see their permissions revoked soon, according to energy expert Francisco Monaldi. The Treasury probably won\u2019t do that in public since those companies don\u2019t operate under a public license.\n\nThe rollback is signaling a return to the 2019-2021 sanctions era, when Venezuela was forced to offload its crude at discounts on the black market, leading to significant revenue losses. Another question is whether the U.S. will also block the import of refined products such as diluents, which are crucial for sustaining operations in the Orinoco Belt\u2014home to Venezuela\u2019s extra-heavy crude. If that happens, Maduro would likely turn to Iran to get access to these products, a process that \u201cis going to take time,\u201d warns Monaldi.\n\nAs reported by Axios, the announcement comes after three Republican House members\u2014Mario Diaz Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar\u2014suggested they wouldn\u2019t support a Republican budget resolution that was passed last week if Trump didn\u2019t slash the U.S. oil deal with Venezuela. The decision probably caught many off guard, even in the Trump cabinet, which is probably the reason why OFAC took five days to outline wind-down instructions for Chevron.\n\nSupporting the removal of Chevron\u2019s license is currently illegal in Venezuela under the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Law, which states that any action in support of unilateral sanctions is treason.

            "content": "The Venezuelan economy is showing new warning signs on its dashboard. The slow recovery of the last three years, after the economic crash of the 2014-2020 period, faces several risks in the first quarter of 2025. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cancel the license for the multinational Chevron to operate in Venezuela threatens a serious budgetary imbalance that augurs new economic storms.\n\nAfter successive political crises and economic devastation over the past 25 years the Venezuelan economy, with its industry and export apparatus at historic lows, is even more dependent on its oil and petrochemical revenues. After a period of relative stability, the official exchange rate has depreciated by 81% since September. A year ago, one U.S. dollar was valued at 36 bolivars. Today, it is 64. The differential between the official dollar and the parallel one, which is already sold at 73 bolivars, shows a gap of 27%, with a tendency to grow.\n\nInflation, which seemed to have been averted in mid-2024, has climbed again: in January, it jumped to 7%, a very high figure for the first month of the year and one that the Central Bank of Venezuela recognizes at 4%. Venezuelan salaries remain the lowest in the region. Caracas is coming off economic growth of close to 4% of GDP in 2024 and had planned for a relatively similar rate, perhaps somewhat lower, according to some sources, for 2025. Obviously, that was before the Chevron news.\n\nVenezuela would have to post double-digit growth rates for several years to recover its former size, during which time it was the fifth-largest \u2014 sometimes the fourth \u2014 economy in Latin America, before Nicol\u00e1s Maduro came to power. The impact of Chevron\u2019s departure from Venezuela\u2019s weak productive structure will be apparent when the terms of its exit are clear. Formally, the company would have six months to leave while maintaining operations until August 1 (which would mean that its dollars would continue to flow into the Treasury until then). There are, however, those who maintain that there is interest in Washington in hastening the multinational\u2019s withdrawal, according to Venezuelan information circles in Miami. There is also talk of new negotiations and a new energy agreement between Maduro and the United States. The situation has become confused.\n\n\u201cWithout oil licenses for foreign companies, Venezuela will hardly see growth this year and in the years to come. We would have, once again, inflation of more than 100% by the end of 2025, and an exchange rate far from current levels. Oil production will inevitably fall. Although PDVSA can take over operations in these fields, it will have a hard time making maintenance investments, which require a lot of money and technology,\u201d says Luis Oliveros, economist and academic at the Metropolitan University of Caracas.\n\nLike other economists, Oliveros thinks it likely that Trump will seek some new energy agreement with Maduro, designed on his terms. A good part of the Venezuelan opposition, led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \u2014 but particularly the citizens in exile \u2014 view these measures against Chevron operations with favor. A minority but visible sector of the democratic field within the country, however, has issued fresh warnings about the terrible economic consequences that Chevron\u2019s departure would have.\n\nAfter producing 3.2 million barrels a day in its prime, PDVSA could now be at as little as 650,000. Unlike what occurred at the end of the 20th century, the country urgently needs international investments to maintain equipment and oil wells that will allow it to sustain and increase current production.\n\n\u201cIf Chevron leaves in March, the consequences for the state would be much more severe, and everyone would feel them immediately,\u201d says Leonardo Vera, president of the National Academy of Economic Sciences. \u201cChevron puts $200 million a month into the exchange market that would no longer exist, and that market is already in crisis. Its departure would also have a fiscal impact. The official dollar could go to over 100 bolivars by the middle of this year. All of that with high inflation, new wage declines, and a contraction of between one and two points of GDP. If the exit is gradual, there could be some movement this year and the effects will be delayed until the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026.\u201d\n\nMaduro has reacted to Trump\u2019s decision: \u201cThere is no threat in this world that intimidates us. We can negotiate with the United States if they want, in a relationship based on respect. But if not, we will continue working on our project. We do not expect anything from the imperialists.\u201d\n\nVice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has been visiting countries such as Turkey and India for some time now to seek new oil investment agreements that could replace the departure of Western companies from Venezuelan oil fields, which have the largest reserves in the world.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

There were judges in individual cases that would disagree about whether or not a statute was clear or ambiguous,\u201d Hill said, which complicated the second step of deciding whether an agency\u2019s interpretation should be deferred to.\n\nOnce again, the courts decided if an agency\u2019s interpretation was permissible and reasonable. Under Loper Bright, courts no longer can give \u201cbinding deference\u201d to agencies, he said. What they can do is \u201cgive the agency very great respect, due respect. They can consider it highly persuasive, especially informative, [give it] most respectful consideration, great weight. So, what\u2019s the difference between that and some pretty great amounts of deference?\u201d\n\nAs the lower courts ruled on how to apply deference under Chevron, they also likely will \u201cdecide how much Loper Bright actually changed the real law,\u201d Hill said. \u201cNow they can\u2019t say \u2026 \u2018we\u2019re just stuck with what the agency said,\u2019 but they can give a lot of weight to what the agencies did, and I think they will on some of the really technical, statutory interpretations.\u201d\n\nCary Coglianese, director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Carey Law School, generally agreed with Hill\u2019s interpretation of Loper Bright, but said the ruling likely would have symbolic impacts. Beyond the court overturning a 40-year-old precedent, \u201cyou have to also think about Loper Bright in the context of a larger Supreme Court that\u2019s deeply skeptical of administrative power,\u201d he said.\n\nCoglianese pointed to other recent cases, such as West Virginia vs. EPA, which raised the \u201cmajor question doctrine demanding greater clarity whenever agencies are to use statutes to do something important, like regulating to protect against climate change.\u201d\n\nFuture cases may be \u201ca little less about how Loper Bright is actually written and what it says, but more [about] what it actually means to be part of a larger, shifting legal landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd quite frankly, we can\u2019t discount at all the administrative and political landscape that\u2019s shifting as well.\u201d\n\nIs the Endangerment Finding Safe?\n\nSpeaking from the legislative side, Ana Unruh Cohen, Democratic staff director for the House Natural Resources Committee, said individual lawmakers \u201calways aspire to write a very clear and direct \u2026 piece of legislation, and then things get negotiated; things change.\u201d\n\nCertainly, as representatives move new bills, they are focused on ensuring their language is clear, Unruh Cohen said. Similarly, Hill said, agency staff writing regulations will have to think carefully about building a well-argued paper trail to validate their interpretation of statutes without relying on Chevron.\n\nCould Loper Bright also be used to advance further deregulation, such as a rollback of EPA\u2019s 2009 endangerment finding, which allowed the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act?\n\nUnruh Cohen noted that the Supreme Court has not overturned the endangerment finding in the past, even when it had the opportunity to do so, but Coglianese again pointed to the shifting legal and administrative landscape. \u201cMaybe this current Supreme Court would be willing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re willing to go back and overrule Chevron, if they\u2019re willing to go back and overrule Roe v. Wade,\u201d is the endangerment finding really safe?\n\n\u201cMaybe they would be happy to say, yeah \u2026 we now accept that EPA under the Trump administration has a better reading of the Clean Air Act that says it never authorized regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nCoglianese and Unruh Cohen both expect that any approach to overturning the endangerment finding would have to be done on statutory grounds rather than a full-on attack on climate science. Congressional Republicans have shifted their approach from one that questions climate science itself to one that asks which policies can best address the issue, Unruh Cohen said.\n\nComing at it from a statutory perspective starts from the \u201cquestion of whether we have the statutory authority in the first place to do this,\u201d Coglianese said. \u201cThen, quite frankly, none of that technical information really matters.\u201d\n\nCoglianese also laid out the statutory and constitutional issues related to Trump\u2019s funding pause. \u201cOne has to ask the people who are issuing these directives, do they have statutory authority? Second, are they acting in a manner that is not arbitrary? \u2026\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s these constitutional questions about whether it\u2019s consistent with our separation of powers. Whether it\u2019s consistent with the spending clause of the United States Constitution for the executive branch on its own to simply decide what we want to spend money on or not, even though Congress has approved and told the administration to carry out the spending.\u201d\n\nThe catch, he said, is the pacing and timing problem: \u201cThose who control the computers are able to block funding, and there\u2019s not a lot of transparency around that. The courts are being much more deliberative and trying to figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d",

The move was followed by a directive that aimed to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, and accelerate drilling and pipeline development.\n\n\u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\u201d Trump said in his inauguration speech, adding that the US has the \u201clargest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth \u2014 and we are going to use it.\u201d\n\nYet some industry observers have speculated that energy prices and other market forces may deter energy companies from increasing drilling, noting that the US has been the world's top crude oil and liquefied natural gas producer for several years now. Moreover, many of the government's directives face legal challenges from environmental groups and other opponents, creating uncertainty in the sector.\n\nTo better understand how the oil and gas sector is reacting to developments in Washington, we asked Jeff Gustavson , President of Chevron New Energies, about the efforts to scale back regulations and increase production and how the moves might impact market trends and renewable energy advancements.\n\nHere\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cWe believe Chevron\u2019s US production helps power progress. Energy demand is projected to rise from current record highs well into the future. Chevron is responding by increasing our US oil and gas production in ways that are affordable, reliable and ever cleaner. In 2024, Chevron\u2019s US production was ~1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of ~19% compared to the year prior.\n\n\u201cEarly actions by the Trump administration to streamline permitting are encouraging, but durable policy will require action by Congress. Meaningful permitting reform should be viewed as an enabler of the energy transition to a lower carbon future. An overly burdensome infrastructure permitting process can slow critical energy projects of all types \u2014 oil and gas, and renewable infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAt Chevron, we continue to support projects that prioritize affordability, reliability and meet environmental standards, this is what is needed to enhance our energy security and advance a lower carbon future.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to continue working with the White House and both parties to achieve comprehensive and meaningful permitting reform that will unlock infrastructure development, support American economic competitiveness and promote energy security for the US and allies.\u201d",

            "content": "As privacy regulations and enforcement grow more complex, companies must keep up with key developments and continue partnering with privacy experts to understand their practical impact.\n\nOne notable development that flew under the radar in recent months is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn the long-standing doctrine of Chevron deference, established by the Supreme Court\u2019s 1984 decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThis principle held that judges should defer to federal agencies\u2019 reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes. In other words, when Congress passes a law with unclear provisions, Chevron deference says that it\u2019s up to the federal agency tasked with enforcing the law to fill in any gaps in interpretation.\n\nBetween 1984 and 2024, Chevron was cited in over 19,000 cases, becoming a linchpin in administrative law. Yet it was also hotly debated: Supporters said it gave agencies the flexibility to quickly tackle emerging problems with their unique expertise; detractors, meanwhile, saw it as a key contributor to executive overreach and agency politicization. Last July, the detractors won a major victory when, in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the Supreme Court overturned Chevron, paving the way for a significant overhaul of administrative power.\n\nThe impact on digital advertising\n\nThere are a few key ways that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Chevron could alter the digital ads industry. First, it could push privacy regulation further to the states, leading to increased fragmentation and complexity.\n\nIt could also impact the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) ability to enforce violations of its privacy regulations. And, finally, it could complicate the passing and enforcing of a federal privacy law. To understand these impacts, consider how the FTC enforces privacy today.\n\nIn the absence of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the US, the FTC gets its authority from several statutes, including the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which restricts the online collection and use of data from children under 13; the Health Breach Notification Rule, or HBNR, which governs the unauthorized disclosure of health information by certain entities; and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the FTC has interpreted these legacy laws \u2013 each enacted well before modern digital privacy concerns took shape \u2013 to cover new, often complex areas of privacy. In doing so, it has taken a particular interest in ad tech. In just the past year, the FTC has:\n\nFinalized a plan to expand the scope of COPPA\n\nSignaled upcoming challenges to contextual advertising practices\n\nStated that web browsing history, television viewing history and location information should be considered sensitive data\n\nExpanded its definition of health data and the scope of HBNR to cover a wide range of health services and information providers\n\nDecried social media and video streaming platforms for engaging in \u201cvast surveillance\u201d of consumers\n\nEmphasized that hashing data does not anonymize it\n\nArgued that ad tech\u2019s self-regulatory organizations risk falling into \u201cirrelevance\u201d if they do not evolve to meet regulatory expectations\n\nExpressed that even long-standing uses of artificial intelligence can fall within the FTC\u2019s enforcement authority, and will be scrutinized\n\nMany of these moves have sparked debate. Even within the FTC, senior leaders have voiced concerns that the agency may be stretching its interpretive authority.\n\nTake incoming FTC chair Andrew Ferguson. Although he has been vocal about what he views as the FTC\u2019s recent overreach, he has consistently voted in favor of privacy-related enforcement during his time on the commission. So don\u2019t expect enforcement to slow down too much.\n\nStill, now that Chevron is overturned, it will be easier for companies to challenge FTC regulations in court, arguing that they exceed the FTC\u2019s mandate. Previously, the FTC only had to show a court that its interpretation of the law was reasonable. Now it will have to show that its interpretation is correct. That\u2019s a much heavier burden, especially in courts that will be proliferating with Republican judges.\n\nChevron\u2019s demise also makes passing a federal privacy law more difficult. To ensure they don\u2019t become stuck in litigation limbo driven by ambiguity \u2013 often the friend of legislative compromise \u2013 lawmakers will need to draft any new law with painstaking precision to avoid years of court battles over the FTC\u2019s interpretation of their words.\n\nThat\u2019s no easy feat in our polarized environment, making it likely that privacy regulation and enforcement will continue to fall to the states.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nEven in the wake of these changes, as the perennial target of regulators, ad tech is slated to remain squarely in their crosshairs in the coming years. And between existing federal law and the 19 (and counting) unique state privacy laws on the books, those regulators will have a lot of arrows in their quivers.\n\nAll of this increases complexity, risk and signal loss across our ecosystem. But it also unlocks a unique opportunity to innovate, ushering in a new standard of digital privacy in ad tech. Now more than ever, it\u2019s crucial to work with partners who stay ahead of the curve, embedding data ethics into their ethos to create solutions with lasting value in a privacy-centric world.\n\n\u201cData-Driven Thinking\u201d is written by members of the media community and contains fresh ideas on the digital revolution in media.\n\nFollow OpenX and AdExchanger on LinkedIn.\n\nFor more articles featuring Julie Rooney, click here.",

Brett Vondohlen homered to left field to open the scoring, and a Nathan Brewer single and an ODU fielding error allowed Tyler Minnick to score from first base.\n\nODU starting pitcher Blake Morgan settled down after that, shutting out the hosts for the next six innings. The lefthander from Marlton, New Jersey retired the side in order in the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings.\n\n\u201cBlake gave us a really good start, I believe the longest of his career,\u201d said ODU Head Coach Chris Finwood. \u201cZach Leite and Kyle Edwards provided most of the offense for us and Kellen Davis and Bailey Matela did the job out of the bullpen.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchs (3-7) got a run back in the second as Kainen Jorge singled up the middle and was waved home on a Zach Leite double to left center. Later in the fourth, Jorge walked and moved up to second on a Leite hit back up the middle. ODU then executed a double steal, and the throw to second by the MTSU catcher went wide and into center field. The miscue allowed Jorge to come around and tie the game at 2-2.\n\nOld Dominion then pulled ahead with another two runs on four hits in the fifth inning. Kyle Edwards led off with a single through the left side and reached second on a Ryan Thomas base hit to right field. Luke Waters then poked a ball through the left side of the defense, bringing in Edwards for the 3-2 lead. Another double steal by the Monarchs and a walk by Jorge loaded the bases, and Leite scored Thomas with a single through the right side to make it 4-2.\n\nSome aggressive base running by Edwards helped ODU scratch across another run in the sixth. With one out, the senior shortstop doubled to right center and then stole third. The MTSU catcher again tried to make the throw, but it sailed past the third baseman and the error allowed Edwards to cross the plate.\n\n\u201cWe have struggled with runners in scoring position this weekend, so it was nice to get some big hits to expand the lead,\u201d added Finwood. \u201cWe have a long way to go offensively and are still striking out way too often. We have to improve on that as the season progresses.\u201d\n\nMTSU manufactured a run in the eighth as Eston Snider doubled to the gap in left and came around on a Vondohlen single down the left-field line. Vondohlen tried to stretch for two, but Waters\u2019 throw to Tahraun Hammond was in time to get the out. Kellen Davis then relieved Morgan and ended the inning with a fly ball to center field.\n\nDavis retired the leadoff batter in the ninth and handed the ball over to Matela. After Brewer reached with a single through the left side, the next batter popped up to Hammond for the second out. An ODU fielding error and a walked batter ran the bags full for the tournament hosts, but Cale Vinson flew out to left to bring the game to an end.\n\nMorgan (1-0) earned his first win of the season after tallying seven strikeouts. He allowed three runs, two of them earned, on seven hits and one walk in a 7.2-inning start, a new career high. Matela picked up the save after holding the Blue Raiders to one hit with one walk in 0.2 innings of work.\n\nLeite had the big day at the plate for ODU, batting 3-for-4 with a double, two RBIs and a stolen base. Edwards finished 2-for-4 as he doubled, scored twice and also swiped a bag. Jorge (1-for-3) also scored two runs, walked twice and added a steal to his totals. Thomas (1-for-4) walked once, stole a base and scored a run, and Waters (1-for-5) drove in a run with one steal.\n\nBoth teams tallied eight hits in the game. The Monarchs swiped six bags on seven attempts, hit 8-for-33 (.242) on the day, and were also 5-for-19 (.263) with runners on.\n\nThe Monarchs will be in Alabama next weekend for three games at Auburn. Starting times for next Friday and Saturday have yet to be announced, but the series finale on Sunday, March 9 will begin at 3 p.m. EST.",

It canceled a license with oil giant Chevron that had become a lifeline to the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime. This is an important step to continue pressuring a rogue and deadly dictatorship that is not even pretending to play by the rules.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence of election fraud, Maduro crowned himself president earlier this year. The massive fraud in the July presidential elections was followed by a terror campaign that included more than 1,000 arrests of Venezuelans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration rightly reimposed oil sanctions that were briefly lifted in exchange for a promise of free elections, but there was a loophole the Maduro regime was still taking advantage of: individual licenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a previous editorial, we asked the incoming Trump administration to take a stronger stance and revoke these licenses that allowed Maduro to continue to export its oil. This measure will force the Venezuelan regime back into the black market, generating more corruption and, likely, more migration, but it has become necessary. The U.S. must keep the Maduro regime under pressure to give this ailing nation a path to democracy.\n\nOpinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThrough a social media message, President Donald Trump said he was revoking the Chevron license because the Maduro government had failed to meet \u201celectoral conditions\u201d and had not transported \u201cviolent criminals\u201d at a quick enough pace.\n\nIn January, Trump sent his top envoy, Richard Grenell, and struck a deal with Maduro that allowed the restart of deportation flights and the release of six Americans. The Chevron license was left out of the agreement, according to news reports. Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flew 177 deportees from Guant\u00e1namo to Venezuela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince 2022, the Chevron waiver has allowed Venezuela to recover economically after years of hyperinflation. The Houston-based company helped the country lift its crude production back above 1 million barrels per day from as low as 365,000 barrels, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe end of the waiver can create another opening for China and Russia, which already have a presence in Venezuela, but it\u2019s worth noting that this is a move that the Venezuelan opposition to Maduro was pleading for. The Trump administration should go further and help the opposition with intelligence and resources.\n\nThere is a link between unraveling democracies and immigration. While the Trump administration is more invested in preventing the latter, it should work toward fostering democratic stability in Latin American nations. The tumult in the region is the root of the illegal immigration problem at our southern border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of our series The Unraveling of Latin America.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~10.3%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~14.0x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is engaged in integrated energy and chemicals operations. The company\u2019s economic moat revolves around its strong franchise, healthy supply chain capabilities, and cost efficiencies. Bloomberg reported that the company is exploring an opportunity to acquire Phillips 66\u2019s stake in their 50-50 chemicals JV, CPChem, with activist Elliott Investment Management pushing for an exit. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s CEO Mike Wirth believes that chemicals have strong demand growth.\n\nThis is because more people continue to enter the middle class globally, and there is an increased need for energy-efficient, lightweight plastics in airplanes and vehicles, as highlighted by Wirth in an interview with Bloomberg T.V. CPChem has significant growth projects, such as $8.5 billion polymers facility in Orange, Texas, and $6 billion complex in Qatar. Notably, they will utilize low-cost ethane as feedstock, placing them in an advantageous position compared to plants in Europe and Asia that use naphtha. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) continues to be active in managing its portfolio, as highlighted by the recent Canadian divestment announcement. These strategic initiatives remain focused on optimizing Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s asset base and are targeting high-return opportunities.\n\nOverall CVX ranks 12th on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "While efforts to reduce global carbon emissions continue, natural resource companies are adjusting by balancing traditional operations with sustainability initiatives. For example, the UAE has pledged $30 billion to a global finance fund while its banking sector aims to invest $270 billion in green finance by 2030 to support renewable energy growth. Simultaneously, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, which manage $3.8 trillion in assets, are increasingly allocating capital to green investments. This shift has not only reduced fiscal breakeven burdens for energy companies but has also increased regional economic stability.\n\nMoreover, technological advancements such as Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platforms are increasing the efficiency of offshore gas production while reducing reliance on onshore infrastructure. According to Business Wire, global liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction capacity is expected to double by 2028 from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA as expansion projects continue. This projected increase indicates that even as the world strives for cleaner energy sources, natural gas will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix.\n\nHowever, the natural resource sector has been experiencing a surge in market activity, driven mainly by commodity price movements and global demand. Precious metals, in particular, have proven to be strong assets. Over the past year, the market\u2019s Gold Index returned 44.59%, while the Silver Index returned 42.01%. These gains have resulted from rising investor interest in safe-haven assets due to inflationary pressures and escalating global trade tensions. As inflation erodes the value of fiat currencies, investors are increasingly turning to gold and silver as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty.\n\nThe top 40 global mining companies generated a record $943 billion in revenue in 2022, but this figure declined to approximately $792 billion in 2024, owing primarily to fluctuating commodity prices. Despite this, Deloitte reported that between January and mid-November 2024, the oil and gas industry paid out $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks, demonstrating the sector\u2019s strong cash returns.\n\nNatural resource stocks are an important part of the global economy, representing mining, energy, and agricultural companies. These industries are the foundation of numerous sectors, providing necessary materials for infrastructure, technology, and transportation. Despite the growing emphasis on renewable energy, fossil fuels, metals, and agricultural resources remain essential for modern economies. According to The Business Research Company , the global mineral market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. This growth emphasizes the long-term importance of natural resources.\n\nWe recently published a list of 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chemicals industry is also shifting to sustainability, with renewable production of key chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, and olefins expected to cost between $440 billion and $1 trillion by 2040. According to PwC, this figure could rise to between $1.5 trillion and $3.3 trillion by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, innovative zinc recycling techniques have produced a 95% recovery rate from steel mill waste, converting industrial waste into useful recyclable components. Nanotechnology breakthroughs are increasing recovery efficiency in gold mining while reducing environmental impact. These technological advancements demonstrate the growing significance of technology in maximizing resource use and cutting waste, which propels the natural resource industry forward.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds, we first conducted extensive research to identify companies with significant exposure to the natural resource sector. We defined exposure in terms of mining, energy production, agriculture, or the extraction and processing of key commodities. We then analyzed these companies based on their hedge fund holdings and ranked them based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The company\u2019s operations include upstream exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, as well as downstream refining, marketing, and petrochemical manufacturing. Chevron is also at the forefront of carbon capture, renewable fuels, and gas-to-liquids technology, all of which help shape the future of energy infrastructure.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported a strong performance in Q4 ended 31 December 2024, earning $3.2 billion, up from $2.3 billion in the same period in 2023. Adjusted for one-time factors, earnings were $3.6 billion, reflecting a mix of challenges and accomplishments. While refined product margins were lower and severance charges reduced profits, these impacts were partially offset by volume growth and favorable foreign currency effects. Full-year 2024 production reached new highs, with a 7% increase in global output and a notable 19% increase in U.S. production, primarily due to the company\u2019s expansion in the Permian Basin. This outstanding performance allowed Chevron to return a record $27.0 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, highlighting the company\u2019s strong cash flows.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s ability to execute complex, high-impact projects was fully demonstrated in 2024. One of the most significant accomplishments was the completion of the 20,000-psi Anchor project in the Gulf of Mexico, a groundbreaking deepwater venture. Furthermore, the company successfully ramped up production in Kazakhstan\u2019s Tengiz field, solidifying its position in the energy sector.\n\nLooking ahead, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) remains dedicated to both operational efficiency and long-term sustainability. The company is focused on cost control, aiming to reduce structural costs by $2 billion to $3 billion by 2026. At the same time, it continues to prioritize investments in energy transition initiatives, such as carbon capture and natural gas supply expansion. With capital expenditures expected to remain stable, Chevron\u2019s strategic investments are poised to ensure continued production growth and cash flow resilience, positioning the company well for the future of energy.\n\nOverall, CVX ranks 4th on our list of best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "The Trump administration dealt a huge blow to the Venezuelan economy this past week. It canceled a license with oil giant Chevron that had become a lifeline to the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime. This is an important step to continue pressuring a rogue and deadly dictatorship that is not even pretending to play by the rules.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence of election fraud, Maduro crowned himself president earlier this year. The massive fraud in the July presidential elections was followed by a terror campaign that included more than 1,000 arrests of Venezuelans.\n\nThe Biden administration rightly reimposed oil sanctions that were briefly lifted in exchange for a promise of free elections, but there was a loophole the Maduro regime was still taking advantage of: individual licenses.\n\nIn a previous editorial, we asked the incoming Trump administration to take a stronger stance and revoke these licenses that allowed Maduro to continue to export its oil. This measure will force the Venezuelan regime back into the black market, generating more corruption and, likely, more migration, but it has become necessary. The U.S. must keep the Maduro regime under pressure to give this ailing nation a path to democracy.\n\nThrough a social media message, President Donald Trump said he was revoking the Chevron license because the Maduro government had failed to meet \u201celectoral conditions\u201d and had not transported \u201cviolent criminals\u201d at a quick enough pace.\n\nIn January, Trump sent his top envoy, Richard Grenell, and struck a deal with Maduro that allowed the restart of deportation flights and the release of six Americans. The Chevron license was left out of the agreement, according to news reports. Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flew 177 deportees from Guant\u00e1namo to Venezuela.\n\nSince 2022, the Chevron waiver has allowed Venezuela to recover economically after years of hyperinflation. The Houston-based company helped the country lift its crude production back above 1 million barrels per day from as low as 365,000 barrels, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe end of the waiver can create another opening for China and Russia, which already have a presence in Venezuela, but it\u2019s worth noting that this is a move that the Venezuelan opposition to Maduro was pleading for. The Trump administration should go further and help the opposition with intelligence and resources.\n\nThere is a link between unraveling democracies and immigration. While the Trump administration is more invested in preventing the latter, it should work toward fostering democratic stability in Latin American nations. The tumult in the region is the root of the illegal immigration problem at our southern border.\n\nPart of our series The Unraveling of Latin America. This editorial explains why the Trump administration is right to revoke an oil license between Chevron and the Venezuelan regime.\n\nWe welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor.

Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nWhy did 49ers trade Deebo Samuel?\n\n#1. Cap Relief\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have a lot of players that need to be paid coming up and not as much cap space as they'd like. This move frees up a lot of money for the team and allows them to not be as pricey in the wide receiver room. With players like Brock Purdy getting ready for extensions and an expensive roster, getting ahead of things with this move could have been a catalyst.\n\nAd\n\nThe Washington Commanders are paying Samuel's entire 2025 salary, meaning that is no longer on the San Francisco 49ers' books and that allows the team to be able to use that money elsewhere to improve the roster going forward.\n\n#2. Wide Receiver Redundancy\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers with Deebo Samuel had a player very similar on the roster in Brandon Aiyuk. With both having bigger contracts, this didn't make financial sense to keep them both going forward.\n\nAd\n\nWith the 49ers also drafting wide receiver Ricky Pearsall in the first round last year, they still have quality wide receivers even without Samuel.\n\n#3. Get Something for Him\n\nWith the way the 49ers were going, it was clear the team was not going to re-sign Deebo Samuel once his contract expired after the 2025 season. Trading him with a year left allowed the team to acquire a pick in the NFL draft as compensation for him rather than losing him for nothing as a free agent.\n\nThe 49ers now have 11 picks in the 2025 draft with this move as they received four compensatory picks as well. The team could get younger and better going forward after missing the playoffs with this trade.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "The San Francisco 49ers are in an interesting position as they look to rebound after missing the playoffs last season. The team could shake up its roster, and one name drawing interest is wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, who signed a four-year, $120 million extension last offseason.\n\nAd\n\nLet's take a closer look at the potential landing spots for Brandon Aiyuk this offseason.\n\nBest Brandon Aiyuk landing spots\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\n#5: Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs would be an intriguing destination, as they need a top wide receiver who can create separation. With the expected departure of veteran wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, this move would give Patrick Mahomes a reliable target for the future.\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nWith the uncertain future of Rashee Rice as well, acquiring Aiyuk would help address one of the Chiefs' biggest offensive concerns for the coming years.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n#4. Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals could essentially swap out Tee Higgins and replace him with Aiyuk. Pairing Ja\u2019Marr Chase with Aiyuk would be an upgrade and potentially a more affordable option than re-signing Higgins.\n\nThis move could also make Joe Burrow\u2019s life easier by securing a high-level No. 2 receiver. Aiyuk\u2019s contract could allow the front office to invest in the defensive side of the ball and help the Bengals return to the postseason.\n\nAd\n\n#3. Las Vegas Raiders\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are looking to upgrade their offense, and adding a wide receiver could be the move here. Aiyuk would immediately become their best wideout, and with tight end Brock Bowers, the team would have multiple offensive weapons to attract a veteran quarterback.\n\nWith Pete Carroll as the new head coach, the Raiders could be an appealing destination for players this offseason.\n\n#2. New England Patriots\n\nThe New England Patriots have plenty of cap space and need to add talent at wide receiver. With new head coach Mike Vrabel taking over, the team must surround quarterback Drake Maye with weapons to help him develop.\n\nAd\n\nBrandon Aiyuk is under contract for four more seasons, giving the Patriots a chance to build long-term chemistry and stability on offense.\n\n#1. Houston Texans\n\nThe Houston Texans made the AFC divisional round last season but still struggled in key areas. Their biggest need is at wide receiver, with Stefon Diggs and Robert Woods both set to become unrestricted free agents. The team finished 21st in passing yards per game (207.4) and must improve to become a legitimate offensive threat.\n\nAdding Brandon Aiyuk would give quarterback C.J. Stroud a young, dynamic playmaker to build around for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best crude oil stocks to buy right now.\n\nCrude oil markets have seen extreme volatility over the past year, fueled by a variety of economic, geopolitical, and supply and demand factors. Prices fell at the end of 2023, when international demand faltered and supply remained strong from key regions, before rebounding in early 2024 as leading oil-producing countries implemented supply cuts to stabilize the market. Meanwhile, demand signals have been mixed \u2014 industrial activity in major economies has improved, but high interest rates and inflationary pressures have limited overall energy consumption. After the presidential elections in the US, the Trump 2.0 agenda appears to be driving cracks in the economic outlook, due to a plethora of initiatives such as tariffs, a fight with immigration, and significant cuts in government spending. Despite Republicans notoriously being pro-business and pro-carbon, as confirmed by an announced policy of encouraging energy exploration and production on Federal land and Outer Continental Shelf, the reaction of the stock market has been mixed, as many crude oil stocks have underperformed the broad market in the last couple of months.\n\nThe reluctance of the broad market to price in an acceleration in the crude oil space is likely due to expectations of lower oil prices, primarily driven by an uncertain economic and industrial outlook. A slowing economy generally consumes less oil, which coupled with an increasing supply should put downward pressure on prices. Optimism for the year ahead vanished and the outlook has become one of the gloomiest since the pandemic. Companies started to signal widespread concerns about the impact of government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments. For instance, the US economic surprise index hit the lowest last week since September, while the business capex forecasts were abruptly cut at the beginning of the year. Small businesses reflect similar signals, by cutting their capex expectations (as per surveys), while consumers report deteriorating financial expectations going forward. All these developments don\u2019t play out in favor of a strong economy in the following quarters.\n\nFinancial markets have reflected this turbulence, as energy stocks moved in tandem with the swings in oil prices, which retracted more than 10% since the inauguration day. While refiners and midstream companies have generally performed well due to resilient transportation and processing demand, exploration and production firms have faced challenges in securing new investments. Looking forward, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors will continue to shape the crude oil market. Geopolitical factors, particularly in key oil-producing regions, remain an ongoing concern \u2013 with the end of the Ukraine conflict becoming a reality, Russian oil will likely flow more freely abroad, putting even more downward pressure on global prices. Despite the aforementioned headwinds, there are also some positive takeaways for investors \u2013 while renewable energy investments continue to grow, the transition remains gradual, ensuring that crude oil will remain a critical component of the global energy mix in the future, especially under the carbon-friendly Trump 2.0 regime. Furthermore, with oil prices declining and many crude oil stocks being down from their mid-2024 highs, the current developments may turn out to be a great long-term buying opportunity.",

            "content": "Oil giant Chevron is to slash its workforce by 15\u2013 20% by the end of 2026, losing up to 9000 jobs. The goal is to simplify the company\u2019s structure and reduce annual costs by around $2\u20133 billion (\u00a31.6\u20132.4 billion).\n\nChevron is not alone. In January, BP began cutting around 4700 employees, around 5% of its workforce, and 3000 contractors \u2013 again to reduce costs. BP\u2019s profits have fallen behind competitors such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron in recent years, but fossil fuel profits generally are looking volatile.\n\n\u2018The returns are much weaker than in 2022 and 2023, and cost cutting is one way to try improve that,\u2019 says Alan Gelder, chemicals and oil market analyst at Wood Mackenzie. \u2018Oil prices are lower, refining margins are weaker and chemicals margins are pretty poor. So 2024, and particularly [the fourth quarter], was much more difficult.\u2019\n\nDemand growth has slowed, having recovered somewhat from the lows of the Covid-19 pandemic. Additional new refining capacity has also come online. \u2018There\u2019s been a huge build in petrochemical facilities in China, so global petrochemical margins are weak from this oversupply,\u2019 Gelder says. And while the extended Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) countries have agreed on production curbs in an effort to shore up prices, growth elsewhere means production has continued to rise.\n\nThe US government recently estimated that world petroleum and other liquids supply rose by about 0.6 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2024 and will increase by 1.9mb/d in 2025 and 1.6mb/d in 2026. Supply growth will mainly be in the US, Canada, Guyana and Brazil, if OPEC+ countries stick to their agreed quotas. In a February report, the International Energy Agency similarly predicted global supply growth of 1.6mb/d in 2025, bringing total global production to 104.5mb/d.\n\n\u2018We expect production volumes to grow at a low, but steady rate, but capital spending will be subdued in the US given the decline in oil prices,\u2019 comments Joshua Aguilar, equity analyst at investor research firm Morningstar.\n\nConsolidation rush\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a flurry of dealmaking in the last two years, with acquisitions by major players, especially in US shale oil and gas. ExxonMobil bought shale specialist Pioneer in 2023 in a deal valued at $59 billion. This gave it the largest presence in the Permian Basin of Texas and Mexico.\n\nIn February 2024, Diamondback Energy merged with Endeavour Energy Resources in a $26 billion deal, combining operations in the Permian shale. ConocoPhillips completed its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil in November 2024, boosting its presence in two other major shale formations (Eagle Ford in Texas and Bakken in Montana).\n\nAguilar says that attractive shale sites are getting harder to find at reasonable prices, driving larger firms to look at acquiring smaller players for their drilling rights. \u2018There\u2019s still consolidation going on in the US as a way for companies to grow and save costs,\u2019 says Gelder. The US shale industry is now becoming more corporate, he adds, with \u2018a smaller number of larger players trying to optimise what they do\u2019.\n\nThe discussion around transitioning to renewables is legitimate and will continue\n\nUS production is expected to grow by 1.1mb/d from 2024 to 2026. \u2018Our ability to frack oil and gas has just got better and better. There\u2019s been continually increasing efficiency and technology in the US,\u2019 says James Stock, an energy and climate economist at Harvard University, US. The average breakeven point for shale used to be around $70\u201380 a barrel, but has fallen to around $50. Higher oil prices encouraged more oil and gas production from US shale in recent years, particularly pre-pandemic, but the focus on investor returns has slowed growth during the 2020s.\n\nChevron is presently in a legal wrangle with ExxonMobil over Chevron\u2019s plan to acquire Hess for $56 billion, which would give it control over a Hess subsidiary in Guyana. Exxon claimed that it should have had first right of refusal with Hess, owing to an existing joint operating agreement in an oil block off Guyana.\n\nWith all this activity, oil and gas watchers believe that the US administration\u2019s encouragement to \u2018drill baby, drill\u2019 is unlikely to have much impact on production in the near future. \u2018These companies are there to generate returns on investment. The more they drill, the lower the oil price, the weaker their returns,\u2019 says Gelder.\n\nRenewables feel chill\n\nOne marked trend amongst companies, however, is to walk back promises on renewable energy and climate targets. BP has now completely abandoned its target to reduce oil and gas output by 2030, having previously reduced the target from a 40% reduction to 25%. The company will now step up its spending on oil and gas, and cut spending on renewable energy by 70%.\n\nNorwegian company Equinor recently trimmed its 2030 target for installed renewable energy generation capacity from 12\u201316GW to 10\u201312GW and halved its planned investment in renewables and low-carbon solutions to $5 billion between 2025 and 2027. Equinor also announced it would boost oil and gas production by 10% by 2030.\n\n\u2018The discussion around transitioning to renewables is legitimate and will continue,\u2019 says Stock. \u2018Companies have different degrees of commitment to being broader energy companies than just oil and gas, though for some it was just lip service,\u2019 he adds.\n\nPolitics is also coming into play. \u2018We\u2019re seeing a lot of political pushback in Germany, the US and in Canada against climate policies,\u2019 says Stock. He adds that the new US administration is causing chaos in the renewable energy markets. A lot of plans for wind or solar energy sites in the US are likely to be put on hold, given uncertainty around subsidies and tax credits.\n\nIt is not just in the US. \u2018We\u2019re seeing a lot of European majors \u2013 Equinor, Shell, BP \u2013 roll back because the policy support isn\u2019t there and the projects don\u2019t generate the required returns, so they pivot back to traditional businesses,\u2019 says Gelder. \u2018It\u2019s a trend that reflects relative returns,\u2019 he says. \u2018The oil industry makes large bets on big projects to generate high returns that it pays back to shareholders as dividends. The challenge for a lot of renewable projects is that the returns were relatively low.\u2019",

But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in last month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes.\n\nBiden's government for months then resisted calls from Venezuela's opposition and others to rescind the license, whose goal the U.S. initially said was \"to support the restoration of democracy.\" The opposition has estimated that Maduro's government has received about $4 billion through the permit, which was set to be renewed Saturday.\n\nOver time, the license has become responsible for roughly a quarter of Venezuela's oil production.\n\n\"We are aware of today's announcement and are considering its implications,\" Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement. \"Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S. government.\"\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves and once used them to power Latin America's strongest economy. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production decline steadily.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when the oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWednesday's announcement, which Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez characterized as \"harmful and inexplicable,\" put a quick end to what Maduro's government had hoped would be an improved relation with the White House following the Feb. 1 visit of a Trump envoy to Caracas, the capital. Shortly after that visit, Venezuela's government began taking back migrants deported from the U.S.\n\nRodriguez in a statement warned that decisions similar to Wednesday's \"drove migration from 2017 to 2021 with the widely known consequences.\"\n\nThe U.S. government does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president. Under Biden and then Trump, the U.S. considers retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez the winner of the July 28 election.\n\nChevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.\n\nThe joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels of oil a day in 2019, but the following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by Trump's first administration to try to topple Maduro forced Chevron to wind down production. When the company got the license to export oil to the U.S. in November 2022, the joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000 barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from 2019.\n\nThe terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or royalties to Venezuela's government. But the company sends money to the joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how Maduro's government has used that money as it stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago. On Wednesday, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in a podcast interview with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., accused Maduro of using the funds for \"for repression, persecution and corruption.\"\n\n\"This is a huge step, and it sends a clear, clear, firm message that Maduro is in huge trouble,\" she said.\n\n",

(Bloomberg)\n\nCaracas, February 27, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 The Donald Trump administration is set to revoke Chevron\u2019s US Treasury license to operate in Venezuela.\n\nIn a message published on social media on Wednesday, the US president announced the reversal of the November 2022 \u201coil transaction agreement,\u201d in reference to General License 41 (GL41) issued by the Joe Biden White House that allowed Chevron to restart its activities in the South American nation.\n\n\u201cI am ordering that the ineffective and unmet Biden \u2018Concession Agreement\u2019 be terminated as of the March 1st option to renew,\u201d Trump wrote, arguing that Caracas had not fulfilled \u201celectoral conditions\u201d nor accepted deportations of \u201cviolent criminals\u201d fast enough.\n\nDespite hardline campaign rhetoric against Venezuela, Trump began his second term by engaging with Caracas, with Special Envoy Richard Grenell holding a high-profile meeting with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in late January. Migrant deportations were reportedly a central discussion topic, with Venezuela receiving three groups of repatriated nationals since.\n\nThe Venezuelan government issued a statement rejecting the ramped-up sanctions and recalling that US-led economic coercive measures \u201cprompted migration with its widely known consequences.\u201d\n\nCaracas called the decision \u201cdamaging and inexplicable,\u201d vowing that the economy would continue its recovery and that the measure would \u201churt\u201d the United States and its companies.\n\nAnalysts framed the move to cancel Chevron\u2019s sanctions waiver as a short-term concession to foreign policy extremists, particularly from Florida, as the White House enters into crucial budget negotiations. Officials such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, alongside the Venezuelan far-right opposition, have long lobbied for the removal of General License 41.\n\nFlorida politicians, including Trump hardliners such as Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, have also pushed back on the White House\u2019s decision to revoke an extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans in the US. However, the lack of movement on the TPS issue suggests they prioritized a hardening of sanctions as opposed to protecting their constituents\u2019 interests.\n\nOn Wednesday, Congressman Carlos Gimenez (R) said in a press conference that he expected \u201cmore measures\u201d targeting Caracas in the near future. The Florida representative vowed that the Maduro administration, as well as its Cuban and Nicaraguan counterparts, had \u201cits days numbered.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, has gone on the record to state that he feels that a \u201ctransition\u201d in Cuba is not only \u201cinevitable\u201d but \u201cimminent.\u201d Rubio recently announced a further hardening of sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela with an expansion of an existing visa restriction policy relating to Cuba\u2019s overseas medical missions.\n\nFor its part, the California-headquartered corporation has defended its role in Venezuela. CEO Mike Wirth recently stated that Chevron was \u201cin contact\u201d with the administration and that it held a \u201cconstructive presence\u201d in the Caribbean country.\n\nThe license allowing Chevron to operate in Venezuela stipulated its automatic renewal on the first of each month for a six-month period. Its revocation before March 1st would establish a wind-down period that would conclude at the end of July. The administration would need to decide whether to reimpose Chevron\u2019s prior license, which only allowed for basic maintenance operations, or seek a middle-ground solution that could include a production cap.\n\nThe US energy giant holds minority stakes in four joint projects with Venezuela\u2019s state oil company PDVSA. The ventures currently produce around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), between 20 and 25 percent of the country\u2019s total output.\n\nEconomist Asdr\u00fabal Oliveros estimated that the cancellation of GL41 would deprive the country of US $4 billion in revenue in 2026, which would have a significant impact on the foreign currency supply and potentially trigger inflation.\n\nChevron\u2019s license was the Biden administration\u2019s only significant departure from the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign imposed by Trump during his first term. Washington issued General License 44 in October 2023, allowing Venezuela to freely export crude for six months, but the waiver was not renewed.\n\nThe Caribbean nation\u2019s most important industry remains heavily constrained by coercive measures, including financial sanctions and an export embargo. The Treasury Department has explicitly threatened to levy secondary sanctions against international corporations that engage with the Venezuelan oil sector without Washington\u2019s green light.\n\nApart from Chevron, European companies Repsol (Spain), Eni (Italy) and Maurel & Prom (France) also secured US approval in recent years to resume and expand their operations in several joint ventures.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago government has likewise sought Washington\u2019s acquiescence to develop natural gas projects with Venezuela and international enterprises.\n\nTrinidad\u2019s state-owned National Gas Company (NGC) is currently engaged in two offshore gas extraction projects, in the Dragon and the Loran-Manatee fields, with Shell and BP as the main operators, respectively. PDVSA will reportedly hold no shares in the energy ventures and only collect taxes and royalties from the projects operating in Venezuelan waters.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Port of Spain will seek an extension of an existing US sanctions waiver for Shell and BP to negotiate with Caracas regarding the Dragon project. The exemption allows PDVSA to receive payments in kind or hard currency but expires in October 2025.\n\nEdited by Cira Pascual Marquina in Caracas and Jos\u00e9 Luis Granados Ceja in Mexico City, Mexico.",

            "content": "Chevron is the only US oil major left in Venezuela and serves as a vital lifeline, having helped tame runaway inflation in recent years. The company\u2019s oil production, which is operated through joint ventures with state-controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA, totaled more than 200,000 barrels a day as of mid-2024. It accounts for about 20% of the oil-rich nation\u2019s production and has helped boost overall output above 1 million barrels a day.\n\nMaduro\u2019s officials blasted Trump\u2019s move. \u201cThe United States government has made a harmful and inexplicable decision to announce sanctions against the American company Chevron,\u201d Venezuela Vice President and Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez said in a statement. Instead of hurting the Venezuelan people, Washington is causing \u201cdamage to the US, its people and its companies.\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a post in X that he will provide \u201cforeign policy guidance\u201d to \u201cterminate all Biden-era oil and gas licenses that have shamefully bankrolled the illegitimate Maduro regime.\u201d\n\nThe move represents an intensification of US restrictions on the South American nation after Maduro\u2019s contested reelection and a sweeping crackdown on his opponents. And Trump is promising to hit where it hurts most: the economy, at a time when almost 80% of citizens say they feel frustrated and disappointed after Maduro\u2019s inauguration last month, according to pollster Meganalisis.\n\n\u201cWe are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post. He cited the electoral conditions in Venezuela and the country\u2019s failure to take back migrants from the US as quickly as it promised.\n\nThe US president referred to a concession agreement from November 2022, which would match the date that Chevron was granted a license to produce and sell oil in Venezuela despite sanctions against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian government. Under the terms of the license, Chevron would have a six-month wind-down period to exit Venezuela.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he plans to revoke Chevron Corp.\u2019s oil license to operate in Venezuela, threatening to torpedo the nation\u2019s slow economic recovery.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cWe are aware of today\u2019s announcement and are considering its implications,\u201d Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said by email. \u201cChevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government.\u201d\n\nThe US government has allowed a few other oil majors to keep buying and producing Venezuelan crude, including Reliance Industries Ltd. of India, Repsol SA of Spain and France\u2019s Maurel & Prom. Trump\u2019s pronouncement raises questions about their ability to continue their operations.\n\nIf Trump actually follows through \u2014 and isn\u2019t just using the threat as a negotiation tactic \u2014 it could cut Venezuela\u2019s overall production by 100,000 barrels per day, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American energy policy at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston. And other foreign oil producers may follow suit.\n\n\u201cVenezuela might see its revenues decrease by the void of barrels sold at US refineries at market price rerouting to the Asia market with discount,\u201d Monaldi said. \u201cBut it could compensate this by taking all of Chevron\u2019s shares of their production.\u201d\n\nTrump has been telegraphing the revocation of the license for weeks, with both the president and Rubio indicating Chevron\u2019s operating license was under review.\n\nIt also dovetails with his repeated, confident assertions that the US is so rich in oil and gas bounty that it doesn\u2019t need to rely on foreign supplies, whether from North American allies or Venezuela. The president has promised to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and entice oil companies to tap more of what he calls the \u201cliquid gold\u201d under US soil.\n\nYet oil exports from Venezuela have been seen as helping blunt the potential impact of Trump\u2019s promised tariffs on Canadian and Mexican crude, currently on hold until early March. And even without immediate new levies on Canadian crude, removing Venezuelan supplies could act to boost domestic energy costs, running counter to the president\u2019s bid to tame inflation and pare fuel prices.\n\nThe US imports about 250,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan crude, mostly for refineries on the Gulf Coast. Valero Energy Corp., the third-biggest US fuelmaker, was the top user of Venezuelan oil at the end of 2024, followed by Chevron, which uses the crude in its own refineries as well as sells it to others.\n\nBy granting the waiver to Chevron in 2022, then-US President Joe Biden sought to pressure Maduro into democratic reforms and increase the flow of oil to US refineries at a time when US gas prices were at record highs.\n\nChevron \u2014 having endured political convulsions, military coups, civil unrest and economic collapse in its century-long history in Venezuela \u2014 is a little more shielded.\n\nIt removed its Venezuelan assets from its reserves given the uncertainties around the sanctions waiver. That means the country\u2019s production doesn\u2019t contribute to earnings and is not included in the company\u2019s financial forecasts.\n\nIts shares fell less than 1% in New York after Trump\u2019s post.\n\nMeanwhile, dollar bonds from Venezuela and PDVSA fell to session lows on the announcement, according to indicative pricing data collected by Bloomberg.\n\nChevron\u2019s joint ventures with Venezuela\u2019s state producer are estimated to have contributed some $4 billion in tax payments over the past two years, representing about a quarter of the regime\u2019s total revenue over the same period, according to Ecoanal\u00edtica, a Caracas-based consultancy. They have been a driving force behind the uplift in Venezuela\u2019s economy, which is on track to grow 9% this year.\n\nCanceling the license may prove more complicated for Trump than first thought.\n\nOperational control over Chevron\u2019s joint ventures is likely to pass to PDVSA, which in turn could flow revenues back to Maduro.\n\nFurther, the dollars Chevron generates from rising oil production stay within Venezuela and mostly get reinvested in local currency through private banks, which then lend to local companies to boost the economy \u2014 all out of the clutches of Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nAn end to this source of private revenue may see inflation return, which could increase migration over the long-run.\n\nVenezuela opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \u2014 who Maduro banned from running in last year\u2019s election \u2014 appeared Wednesday evening on Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s podcast.\n\nShe commended the US president\u2019s decision to revoke Chevron\u2019s license, saying the oil major provided \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d that \u201cMaduro has used for repression, persecution and corruption.\u201d\n\nShe said it showed that Maduro was in \u201cbig\u201d trouble.\n\nAnalysts, however, suggest the move could still just be a negotiating tactic.\n\n\u201cI never bought into the idea of Maduro becoming Trump\u2019s best friend,\u201d said Alejandro Arreaza, an economist at Barclays in New York. \u201cThe American government is using a good-cop-bad-cop strategy and now the bad cop is coming out to ratchet up pressure.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Rubio comment in 5th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

And if Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA exports oil previously exported by Chevron, US refineries will be unable to buy it due to US sanctions.\n\nSince his return to office in January, Trump has repeatedly said the US does not need Venezuelan oil and left open the possibility of revoking Chevron's operating licence.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pursued a \"maximum pressure\" sanctions policy against Maduro's government, especially targeting Venezuela's energy business.\n\nAfter initially easing sanctions to encourage fair and democratic elections, Biden in April reinstated broad oil sanctions, saying Maduro failed to keep his electoral promises.\n\nBut Biden had left the Chevron licence intact, along with US authorisations granted to several other foreign oil companies.\n\nTax and royalty payments resulting from Chevron's licence have provided a steady source of revenue to Maduro's administration since early 2023, a source familiar with Venezuela's oil industry said. The money has lifted Venezuela's economy, especially its oil-and-banking sectors, which expanded last year.\n\nThe government take from oil activities covered by all US licences, to Chevron and a handful of European companies, is estimated between $2.1 billion and $3.2 billion annually, only considering royalties and taxes, said Jose Ignacio Hernandez from consultancy Aurora Macro Strategies.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Wednesday after Trump's comments that the US is the world's largest oil producer and \"small interruptions from other nations\" will not affect global supply.\n\nTo display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

Maduro's last two election wins were both disputed by Washington, with Venezuela's opposition saying it won the July 2024 presidential election by a landslide, an assertion backed by the US and other Western countries.\n\nThe cancellation of the licence proves Trump is on the side of Venezuelans, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado told Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. during an interview on the latter's video and podcast interview show.\n\n\"What you just mentioned is proof for me that President Trump is on the side of the Venezuelan people, of democracy, and prosperity of the US and for Venezuela as well,\" Machado said, adding the question from Trump Jr. was the first she had heard of his father's decision. \"This is exactly the path ahead.\"\n\nThe oil concession agreement would be terminated as of the March 1 option to renew, Trump said.\n\nRead moreTrump pushes for revival of Keystone XL Pipeline project cancelled by Biden\n\nIt was not immediately clear what would happen with cargoes of Venezuelan crude currently navigating to US ports or about to depart from Venezuela through the end of the month.\n\nMaduro and his government have always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an \"economic war\" designed to cripple Venezuela.\n\nMaduro and his allies have cheered what they say is the country's resilience despite the measures, though they have historically blamed some economic hardships and shortages on sanctions.\n\nWhen the licence was first issued, Chevron was owed about $3 billion by Venezuela. According to the company's debt recovery plan, explained by sources, by the end of 2024 it should have recouped some $1.7 billion as oil output approached an average of 200,000 barrels per day as expected.\n\nChevron's automatically renewing license allowed it to expand crude output at joint ventures with PDVSA and send some 240,000 bpd to its own refineries and other customers.\n\nChevron said earlier in February it will lay off up to 20% of its global staff by the end of 2026 as part of an effort to cut costs and simplify the business. Chevron told its employees the company was falling behind competitors and struggled to quickly make decisions.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with Reuters)",

The move is a major blow to the Venezuelan government as the licence provided it, through joint ventures between the state-run oil company and US oil giant Chevron, with a crucial income in dollars. Trump said he was revoking the licence - which gave Chevron permission to operate in Venezuela - because the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had failed to meet \"electoral conditions\" and had not transported \"violent criminals\" deported from the US at a quick enough pace. Venezuela called the decision \"damaging\" and said it could increase migration to the US.\n\nTrump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing that he was \"hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022\". He did not clarify which concessions he was referring to, but the only licence related to Venezuela granted that day was the one issued by the US treasury authorising Chevron to \"resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela\". The licence allowed Chevron to operate joint ventures with Venezuela's state-controlled oil company PDVSA, but barred the US company from paying \"any taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela\". Chevron's spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement on Wednesday that \"Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government\". In a recent interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth argued that if Chevron was forced to pull out of Venezuela, it would allow companies from China and Russia to increase their presence and influence there. He also warned that Venezuela's economy could suffer more if Chevron left the country, which could drive further migration to the US. The Venezuelan opposition, on the other hand, has in the past argued for the licence to be revoked, arguing that it provides the Maduro government with \"a financial lifeline\".",

            "content": "Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days on Thursday, with supply worries resurfacing after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a reversal of a license given to Chevron to operate in Venezuela.\n\nOil prices rose more than 2% on Thursday as supply concerns resurfaced after U.S. President Donald Trump revoked a license granted to U.S. oil major Chevron to operate in Venezuela.\n\nTrump also said tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on March 4. Those tariffs include a 10% levy on energy imports from Canada. However, investors were still keeping an eye on signs of a potential peace deal in Ukraine, which could result in higher Russian oil flows.\n\nBrent crude oil futures gained $1.51, or 2.08%, to close at $74.04 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose $1.73, or 2.52%, to settle at $70.35.\n\nThe contracts had settled in the previous session at their lowest levels since December 10.\n\n\"Markets like clarity as opposed to uncertainty. Unless a clear path is presented on tariffs and Eastern European peace, oil prices will remain on the defensive with sporadic and spontaneous headline-based rallies,\" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM.\n\nThe Chevron license revocation means the company will no longer be able to export Venezuelan crude. And if Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA exports oil previously exported by Chevron, U.S. refineries will be unable to buy it because of U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe move also could lead to the negotiation of a fresh agreement between the U.S. producer and state company PDVSA to export crude to destinations other than the U.S., sources close to the talks told Reuters\n\nChevron exports about 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its Venezuela operations, more than a quarter of the country's entire oil output.\n\n\"Chevron's exit could reduce Venezuela (oil) production, giving OPEC+ capacity to increase output. If this occurs, coastal U.S. refiners could incur higher procurement costs,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note.\n\nIf OPEC+ does not increase supply, it could increase heavy sour prices, which would hit U.S. refiners, the analysts said.\n\nOil prices rose during intraday trading after Reuters reported that OPEC+ is debating whether to raise oil output in April as planned or freeze it as its members struggle to read the global supply picture because of fresh U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, Iran and Russia, eight OPEC+ sources said.\n\nAlso in focus is Trump's involvement in efforts to facilitate a Russia-Ukraine peace deal.\n\nTrump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would visit Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on rare earth minerals, though the Ukrainian leader said the success of talks would hinge on continued U.S. aid.\n\nU.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, and the loss of momentum appears to have persisted early this quarter amid cold weather and concerns that tariffs will hurt spending through higher prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week. A separate unemployment program, reported with a one-week lag, showed no impact yet of the recent mass layoffs of probationary federal government workers.",

The move would allow Chevron to deepen its exposure to the petrochemicals market, capitalizing on strong global demand for energy-efficient, lightweight plastics and other chemical products.\n\n\n\n\n\nNippon filings indicate that both Chevron and Phillips 66 hold right-of-first-refusal over each other\u2019s stakes, meaning any potential sale must first be offered to the partner. CEO Mike Wirth of Chevron underscored the robust demand growth in the chemicals sector, emphasizing that an equity investment in CPChem would be strategically inseparable from capital spending. Valuations for the stake, as cited by activist Elliott, hover around $15 billion, though details remain subject to negotiation and market conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Overview:\n\n\n\n\n\nChevron aims to bolster its petrochemicals exposure by acquiring Phillips 66\u2019s stake in CPChem.\n\n\n\nThe chemicals joint venture is a key asset with significant growth projects, including multi-billion-dollar facilities in Texas and Qatar.\n\n\n\nStrong global demand for energy-efficient materials underpins the strategic rationale behind the move.\n\n\n\nKey Points:\n\n\n\nBoth partners hold right-of-first-refusal, adding complexity to any potential sale.\n\n\n\nChevron\u2019s CEO highlights robust demand growth, making an equity investment attractive if the price is right.\n\n\n\nActivist Elliott\u2019s push signals a broader trend toward focusing on core, high-growth assets.\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n\n\nFuture negotiations will focus on aligning valuation with long-term capital spending plans.\n\n\n\nThe outcome could redefine market dynamics in the global chemicals industry.\n\n\n\nRegulatory and strategic hurdles will play a decisive role in shaping the final deal structure.\n\n\n\nBull Case:\n\n\n\nAcquiring full control of CPChem would allow Chevron to capitalize on strong global demand for energy-efficient, lightweight plastics and chemical products.\n\n\n\nThe move could streamline operations and potentially unlock significant shareholder value through improved efficiency and strategic alignment.\n\n\n\nChevron's existing familiarity with CPChem's operations could facilitate a smooth transition and rapid realization of synergies.\n\n\n\nFull ownership would give Chevron greater flexibility in capital allocation and strategic decision-making within the petrochemicals sector.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition could position Chevron as a leader in the growing petrochemicals market, diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional oil and gas.\n\n\n\nBear Case:\n\n\n\nThe potential $15 billion valuation for Phillips 66's stake could strain Chevron's financial resources and impact its ability to pursue other strategic opportunities.\n\n\n\nIncreased exposure to the cyclical petrochemicals market might introduce greater volatility to Chevron's earnings.\n\n\n\nRegulatory hurdles and potential antitrust concerns could complicate or delay the acquisition process.\n\n\n\nThe move might be seen as a departure from Chevron's core competencies, potentially raising concerns among investors focused on traditional oil and gas operations.\n\n\n\nIf global demand for petrochemicals weakens or faces environmental regulatory pressures, the acquisition could become less profitable than anticipated.\n\n\n\nWhile no formal talks have commenced, Chevron\u2019s interest in buying the stake highlights its strategic intent to consolidate its position in the chemicals sector. If successful, this acquisition could streamline operations and unlock significant shareholder value, setting a benchmark for similar transactions in the industry.Looking ahead, market watchers will be keen to see how regulatory, pricing, and geopolitical factors influence the negotiations. A favorable outcome could not only enhance Chevron\u2019s competitive edge but also catalyze further consolidation in a market poised for robust growth amid global demand for advanced petrochemical products.This article was originally published on Quiver News , read the full story\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Trump may leverage Chevron to advance Venezuela agenda\n\n(Bloomberg) \u2013 One of the key reasons Venezuela\u2019s economy is slowly recovering from the worst collapse in modern history is an oil giant 2,200 miles away: Chevron Corp.\n\nThe Houston-based oil major, which has a U.S. waiver to operate in Venezuela despite sanctions against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime, has helped lift the Andean nation\u2019s crude production back above 1 million bpd, stoking an economy that lives and breathes oil.\n\nNow Donald Trump is poised to leverage Chevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela to get what he wants from Maduro.\n\nThe 2022 license that\u2019s seen Chevron ramp up exports from Venezuela to a seven-year high is the most powerful tool the president has to advance his agenda in Caracas, which includes following through on his campaign pledge to halt irregular migration into the U.S. Cancelling the waiver would sever a vital financial lifeline for Venezuela\u2019s economy as it begins to perk up \u2014 and generate more corruption by handing the government full control of oil trading again.\n\nChevron has been operating in Venezuela for more than a century. But the company has only recently begun to exert an outsized influence on the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe revenue Chevron generates in dollars from rising oil production stays in the country and mostly gets reinvested in local currency through private banks, which can lend to companies that help boost the economy \u2014 all out of the clutches of the government. Some trickles down to consumers, helping fuel an incipient recovery that\u2019s seen luxury stores, retail chains and car dealerships open in the capital even as a majority of Venezuelans remains impoverished.\n\nTrump sent a top adviser to Caracas at the end of January, in a bold step to get to Maduro. The move resulted in the release of six American prisoners and the restart of deportation flights.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if energy issues were discussed during special envoy Ric Grenell\u2019s talks with Maduro, Chevron\u2019s license was left untouched. It renewed automatically for six months the next day, as it does the first of every month.\n\n\u201cThe license is a very challenging card to play,\u201d David Goldwyn, head of the energy advisory group at the Atlantic Council, said by phone. \u201cChevron\u2019s activity in Venezuela is in both country\u2019s interests, as it\u2019s having an efficient player helping the Venezuela economy from falling back and preventing migrants from coming back.\u201d\n\nTrump is keeping his options open. The U.S. company\u2019s operations in the sanctioned nation are currently under review, the president told reporters on Feb. 18 at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Asked whether he would be inclined to continue to allow oil exports through Chevron, Trump said: \u201cMaybe not.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment on Friday.",

            "content": "The past several years have been rollercoasters for oil and gas companies. At the onset of the pandemic, oil demand experienced a drastic decline, leading to a sharp decrease in prices. Then, the landscape shifted dramatically when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, causing oil prices to surge.\n\nMany companies in the sector capitalized on their windfall profits, which they used to strengthen their financial positions and return capital to shareholders. Lately, however, oil and gas stocks have been the laggards in the S&P 500 index.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Chevron (CVX 0.58%) stock has fallen nearly 11%, while the S&P 500 has surged 60% higher. If you're thinking of adding Chevron to your portfolio, consider the following first.\n\nChevron's cyclical business is dependent on oil and gas prices\n\nChevron is a key player in the oil and gas sector, and its performance can fluctuate based on commodity prices. This cyclical nature makes the stock sensitive to overall market conditions and how that impacts oil and gas prices.\n\nDuring the mid-2010s, oil companies aggressively increased their drilling activities. This strategy led to high capital expenditures, and all the production sent oil prices downward. Companies in the sector faced falling earnings, triggering a decline in stock prices. The pandemic in 2020 then presented another demand shock for industry players.\n\nConversely, the surge in oil prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 resulted in crude oil prices reaching multiyear highs, leading to significant windfall profits for major oil and gas companies like Chevron.\n\nWith its integrated business model, Chevron aims to smooth out some of these fluctuations. It not only drills and produces oil and gas (upstream), but also has operations in the midstream and downstream sectors. This provides Chevron income from transporting its fuel, operating gas stations, and refining crude oil into petroleum products. The integrated approach helps mitigate some of the impacts of oil price volatility.\n\nChevron used its windfall profits from a couple of years ago to bolster its balance sheet and return more capital to its shareholders. Last year, the company returned $27 billion in capital to shareholders, including $11.8 billion in dividends and $15.2 billion in share repurchases. The company has grown its dividend over 37 consecutive years, illustrating its prudent financial management in a cyclical business and its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nOil and gas producers are taking a prudent approach to capital expenditures\n\nAlthough President Trump has encouraged more drilling, oil companies are taking a cautious and strategic approach to production. The Wall Street Journal reported in early February that \"another American oil boom isn't in the cards soon, no matter how many regulations are rolled back, according to oil executives.\"\n\nThese companies hadn't forgotten what happened in the prior decade, when many companies ramped up capital expenditures (capex) and production, only to see oil prices plummet. Coupled with many countries' desires to reduce carbon emissions, oil and gas producers are taking a measured approach to their capex spending.\n\nChevron will continue to boost production, although it warned that upcoming Permian growth may be less than seen in prior quarters. The company plans to moderate growth and capital expenditures and focus on predictable free cash flow.\n\nThe company is also awaiting a decision on whether it can acquire Hess. The $53 billion deal, including debt, was announced in October 2023 and would increase Chevron's portfolio in key oil-producing regions. It would give Chevron a 30% stake in Guyana's Stabroek Block, one of the largest oil discoveries in the last decade, as well as shale properties in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota.\n\nA significant hurdle is an ongoing arbitration dispute with ExxonMobil, which claims it has a right of first refusal over Hess' stake in the Guyana project under their joint operating agreement. This dispute has delayed the deal and could jeopardize it if Exxon prevails. A final decision on this arbitration is expected around August of this year.\n\nBuy, sell, or hold Chevron?\n\nChevron is one of the largest oil producers and publicly traded stocks on the market in the industry today. It has a stellar dividend payout history, but investors must keep in mind the cyclical nature of the business. If this isn't appealing, you probably want to sell or avoid owning the stock.\n\nThat said, Chevron has shored up its balance sheet and is well-positioned to continue growing its free cash flow. While Chevron stock isn't going to deliver explosive gains, it provides diversification and a reliable dividend, making it a solid stock to include in your diversified portfolio.\n\nThe company's deal with Hess is up in the air, so investors may want to wait for the outcome before deciding to buy. If approved, it could provide a big boost to Chevron's growing free cash flow over the next several years.",

            "content": "Energy oversupply, technical losses and lack of electrical space are the major challenges of the renewable energy market, which, according to diaNEOsis, is the most spectacular development the Greek economy has shown in recent years.\n\nThe estimated amount of investments in the last five years in RES unit projects, accompanying projects and infrastructure and network projects reached 9.5 billion, the nonprofit research organization states in its new analysis on the significant challenges and prospects of the penetration of RES in domestic electricity generation.\n\nThe analysis highlights the issue of energy cuts as one of the biggest challenges of the RES market, which the market itself and the stakeholders involved recognize. In Greece, 860 gigawatt-hours of green energy were cut in 2024 due to reduced storage capacity, a figure that corresponds to 3.3% of total electricity generated from RES in the same period and is more than double the figure in 2023.\n\nRegarding technical losses, it notes that a better designed network of stations and substations for the needs of RES and more frequently adapted to new needs could limit their extent. The report also points out that significant capacity problems are recorded in almost a quarter of the high-to-medium voltage transformers of electricity distribution network operator DEDDIE: Out of a total of 453 transformers, 29 have exhausted their thermal margin, 82 have exhausted the short-circuit level margin and five have exhausted both margins.\n\nThe total capacity of operating RES is 15 GW, while the capacity of the existing electricity transmission system is estimated at 28 to 30 GW. From 2019 to 2024, the increase in energy production from RES, excluding hydroelectric power, indicates an average annual growth rate of 15.6%.\n\nIn 2024, most (55.3%) electricity demand in Greece\u2019s interconnected system was covered by RES. Total net production exceeded electricity demand by 307 megawatt-hours in 2024. Simply put, the need for imports was zero last year and theoretically Greece could export a marginal surplus, approximately 0.6% of demand.",

            "content": "By Harry Minium\n\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2013 Mike Jones hadn\u2019t been to an Old Dominion home game in years prior to this season, but like most ODU men\u2019s basketball fans, he has known Tommy \u201cTuffy\u201d Leemon by reputation for nearly a decade.\n\nNot by name, mind you. Most ODU fans don\u2019t know who he is, his life story or what inspires a 74-year-old man to stand at Chartway Arena and, with cameras taking in his every move, pretend he is in the middle of a trendy Manhattan dance club juking to some exotic music.\n\nJones, now ODU\u2019s first-year head coach, is a Monarch alumnus who often watched his alma mater on TV. And Tuffy managed to garner a ton of TV coverage over the years.\n\nHonestly, his dancing skills are modest at best. But it is his enthusiasm, that look on his face that says \"I'm so cool\" and his ability to be make a little fun of himself that makes him so entertaining.\n\n\u201cI love his energy,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI love who he is and at his age, to be able to enjoy life the way he does. He\u2019s a remarkable person, and a great example of why none of us should never take ourselves too seriously.\u201d\n\nJones and the Monarchs play their final home game of his first season tonight at 7 when they host Georgia State. Tuffy says he\u2019ll be there.\n\nTuffy is, in fact, at nearly every home game, and in many ways the quintessential ODU fan. His father was in the Navy and although Tuffy began playing sports in California, the family settled in Norfolk when he was in elementary school.\n\nHis parents purchased a house in the Norview area, but when Tuffy told them he wanted to attend Granby High School, they rented that house to others and purchased another in Ocean View. Although he now lives in Virginia Beach, \u201cOcean View will always be home to me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe played football and baseball at Granby, including the 1965 Thangsgiving Day football game between the Comets and Maury that drew a sellout crowd to Foreman Field that some estimated at 30,000.\n\nI was there, with my father, and we sat in the aisle on the west side \u2013 all the aisles were full.\n\nHe earned his nickname during a Granby junior varsity football practice when assistant coach Bill Powell dared him to run over a taller and heavier player during a drill. He pummeled his teammate and was accorded the nickname \"Tuffy,\" then famous because of former New York Giants football star Alphonse \u201cTuffy\u201d Leemons.\n\nThe nickname stuck as did many of the lessons he learned from coach Punchy Marshall.\n\nTuffy was a teacher and coach for 43 years at Eastern Academy, Norfolk Catholic, Brunswick County and Heritage high schools.\n\nLike many young Norfolk basketball fans 50 years ago, he became enthralled with ODU\u2019s basketball teams then coached by Sonny Allen. He\u2019s been attending games since the Monarchs played home games at Lake Taylor and Wilson high schools.\n\n\u201cI became addicted to ODU basketball,\u201d he said.\n\nHe played two seasons of football at VMI, but after getting married, was forced to leave school. He transferred to ODU and played baseball for Bud Metheny.\n\n\u201cI learned so much from Bud,\u201d Tuffy said. \u201cHe was such a gentleman and so knowledgeable about the game and life in general.\u201d\n\nFor many years, Tuffy umpired American Legion and high school baseball games. He doesn\u2019t remember the night in the late 1970s when he tossed my brother out of a game for back-talking to him.\n\nYears later, I have to admit, Tuffy should have tossed him.\n\nHe recalls sitting on the bench at an ODU game with then coach Mark Newman and Ducky Davis, a long-time area umpire.\n\n\u201cDucky looked at Mark and said, \u2018You know Mark, I realize now how right you\u2019ve been over the years. It\u2019s so much easier to see balls and strikes from here than it is from behind the plate.\u2019\u201d\n\nTuffy began attending ODU games regularly about a decade ago after moving back to the area from Brunswick County and said he stood the first night at a game and did his dance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I did,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it was because they were giving pizzas away to the best dancer.\n\n\u201cI won a lot of pizzas over the years.\u201d\n\nTuffy is quick-witted and self-deprecating but he\u2019s also a dedicated family man. He has three children \u2013 Hunter, Tate and Cameron \u2013 and four grandchildren.\n\nHis wife, Louise, is usually by his side at home games and she\u2019s his biggest critic.\n\n\u201cShe wants me to get some new moves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I told her my signature move is when I move my hand around my head and that people love that.\u201d\n\nTuffy has been an ODU football season ticket holder for a decade and also attends a lot of women\u2019s basketball and volleyball games.\n\n\u201cOur volleyball players, they are just amazing athletes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think everything that ODU does at its basketball games, it\u2019s all first class. The pep band, the cheerleaders and dance team, (public announcer) Jack Ankerson. ODU basketball games are so much fun.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people stop me and take my picture several times inside Chartway. Some take selfies with me.\n\n\u201cIt really makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nFunny thing about that. Tuffy has been making fans at Chartway Arena feel good for many years.\n\nEven ODU players, who are supposed to be listening to their coaches during timeouts, and not watching senior citizens dancing in the stands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen him,\u201d said forward Dani Pounds. \u201cEven when we\u2019re not looking up in the stands, when he\u2019s dancing, we can hear the crowd, saying, \u2018go, go!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe brings so much energy to the arena. He must be a really cool guy.\u201d\n\nHe is, Dani, a very cool guy.\n\nMinium is ODU\u2019s senior executive writer. Contact him at hminium@odu.edu or follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram",

            "content": "According to recent news, more than 40,000 workers could be laid off from Chevron petrol stations. About 40,000 Chevron workers watched a movie last week in an internal town hall meeting that highlighted the oil giant\u2019s achievements in Colorado as the state\u2019s biggest producer of gas and oil. Executives revealed intentions to reduce personnel worldwide by as much as 20% less than half an hour later.\n\nChevron is set to lay off thousands of workers from their petrol stations in the United States\n\nRecently, the company Chevron has announced plans to lay off up to 8,000 employees, or a fifth of its staff, following a year in which oil prices remained mostly in the $70-80 per barrel area. Chevron\u2019s 2024 full-year profit was $18.3 billion, down from $24.7 billion in 2023, despite lower oil prices and refining margins than the previous year. To obtain a significant stake in Guyana\u2019s lucrative oilfields, the second-largest U.S. oil producer signed a $53 billion deal to buy New York-based oil company Hess in October 2023. However, Exxon Mobil and CNOOC, Hess\u2019 partners in Guyana, challenged the deal in court, and the layoffs ended a difficult 18 months for the company.\n\nInternally, four Chevron workers told Reuters that the layoffs were generally anticipated. Some even acknowledged that to compete with Exxon Mobile and other competitors, the change was required. I believe it will be beneficial for a Chevron employee who asked to remain anonymous since they were not permitted to speak in public. Although it is difficult, we are the final majors to make cuts. Everyone was curious about when Chevron would take action. Moreover, in November, Chevron stated that it planned to reduce expenses by up to $3 billion by 2026, including by altering the location and method of operations.\n\nAccording to a Chevron representative, the organization\u2019s restructuring will increase productivity and outcomes. \u201cThe decision to downsize our workforce is not an easy one, even though these changes are required,\u201d the representative stated. As part of a cost-cutting initiative, UK-based oil giant Shell intended to reduce its personnel in oil and gas exploration and development by 20%, as stated by a Reuters story from August. BP, a rival UK giant, announced last month that it would eliminate 3,000 contractor positions and lay off roughly 4,700 workers. Because the oil and gas industry is cyclical, three Chevron employees reported having seen multiple rounds of layoffs over their careers. One of them claimed that layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic were worse.\n\nDue to the sharp rise in sales of electric vehicles in China, the world\u2019s largest importer of crude oil, which has been driving up oil consumption for more than ten years, the forecast for global fuel demand remains dubious. Nick Hummel, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, stated that future oil prices may be capped by uncertainty regarding China\u2019s economy and worldwide demand. The oil business typically experiences mass layoffs following a decline in oil prices. An employee of Chevron voiced disappointment that the layoffs were occurring at a time when prices were comparatively stable.\n\nWho should be held responsible for the upcoming petrol station layoffs?\n\nDuring the town hall, employees questioned if Chevron management would take responsibility for the company\u2019s poor performance. Kim McHugh, vice president of Chevron\u2019s Rockies business unit, read the questions they had submitted. CEO Mike Wirth emphasized the importance of transparency and action within the leadership team at Chevron, stating that the company will clarify decision-making roles and hold them accountable. Staff members are looking for assurance that the most recent restructuring will be effective after multiple prior reorganizations, McHugh told Wirth.",

            "content": "By Ernest Scheyder and Sheila Dang\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - During an internal town hall meeting last week, roughly 40,000 Chevron employees were shown a video touting the oil giant's success in Colorado as the largest oil and gas producer in the state.\n\nLess than 30 minutes later, executives announced plans to cut up to 20% of the global workforce.\n\nDespite progress in safety and financial performance, Chevron had fallen behind its competitors, company leaders told employees during the internal meeting on February 12. The business had become over-complicated, costs had crept up and Chevron struggled to quickly make decisions, they said on the webcast.\n\nReuters reviewed presentation slides and a recording of the town hall that was webcast to staffers globally.\n\nChevron's plan to cut as much as a fifth of its workforce - about 8,000 people - comes after oil prices traded in the $70-80 per barrel range for most of the past year. Oil prices and refining margins were lower than the previous year, but still sufficient to drive a full year 2024 profit for Chevron of $18.3 billion, down from $24.7 billion in 2023.\n\nThe layoffs cap a tough 18 months for the second-largest U.S. oil producer, which inked a $53 billion agreement to acquire New York-based oil firm Hess in October 2023 in order to gain an important stake in Guyana's profitable oilfields, only to have Exxon Mobil and CNOOC, Hess' partners in Guyana, challenge the deal in court.\n\nThe deal is stalled pending arbitration.\n\nFour Chevron employees told Reuters the layoffs were widely expected internally. Some even conceded the move was necessary to compete with Exxon and other rivals.\n\n\"I think it will be a good thing,\" said a Chevron employee, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n\"It's tough going through this, but we are the last of the majors to (make cuts). Everyone was wondering when Chevron would do it.\"\n\nChevron said in November it aimed to cut up to $3 billion in costs by 2026, including by changing how and where work is performed.\n\nA Chevron spokesperson said changes to the company's structure will improve efficiency and results.\n\n\"While these changes are necessary, the decision to reduce our workforce is not an easy one,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUK-based oil major Shell planned to scale back its oil and gas exploration and development workforce by 20% as part of a cost-saving drive, Reuters reported in August. Rival UK major BP said last month it would lay off about 4,700 employees and cut 3,000 contractor positions.\n\nThree Chevron employees said they had been through several rounds of layoffs during their careers, due to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas business. Layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic were worse, one of them said.\n\n\"They always say it will be the last time,\" the employee said.\n\nThe outlook for global fuel demand is uncertain due to the rapid increase in electric vehicle sales in the world's largest crude importer China, which for over a decade has driven rising oil consumption.\n\nUncertainty about global demand and China's economy could cap oil prices in the future, said Nick Hummel, an equity analyst at Edward Jones.\n\nMass layoffs in the oil industry usually come after a plunge in oil prices. One Chevron employee expressed dismay at the timing of the layoffs during a period of relative price stability.\n\n\"It bites,\" said the person outside Chevron's Houston headquarters who identified himself as an employee but declined to give his name. \"Oil prices seem stable and then they bring the hammer down.\"\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nDuring the town hall, Chevron's vice president of the Rockies business unit, Kim McHugh, read questions submitted by employees, who asked whether Chevron executives would hold themselves responsible for the company's lagging performance.\n\n\"People feel like they are being held accountable. Their question is, how is leadership accountable?\" McHugh said.\n\nCEO Mike Wirth said he looked for action and transparency within the leadership team.\n\n\"When things aren't going well, do you get a nice explanation and a pile of excuses, or do you get a plan?\" he said.\n\nIn simplifying the business, Chevron will also clarify which roles have decision-making rights and hold those individuals accountable, Wirth said in response to another question.\n\nAfter several previous reorganizations, staffers are seeking reassurance that the latest restructuring will be successful, McHugh told Wirth.\n\n\"I think the employees would want me to say, 'You've committed to giving us simplicity,'\" she said to the CEO.\n\n\"Let's make sure this time that you pick the people and stuff to make this work, so that we don't have to go through this again.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang, Ernest Scheyder, Arathy Somasekhar and Marianna Parraga in Houston; Editing by Simon Webb and Nia Williams)",

Instead of the usual week-long All-Star activities, the NHL has players from leading nations in the USA, Canada, Sweden and Finland represent their countries.\n\nThe competition brought back a level of intensity that was lost during All-Star breaks. The round-robin game between USA and Canada saw three fights in the first nine seconds.\n\nAd\n\nNaturally, it led to comparisons to the NBA All-Star game and the NFL Pro Bowl, where ratings have been declining.\n\nThe NFL transformed Pro Bowl weekend into a skills competition. Players selected for the Pro Bowl competed in several competitions, with points awarded to the AFC and NFC divisions.\n\nThe final event was a flag football competition. This year, the NFC defeated the AFC, 76-63. However, viewership for the Pro Bowl fell for the third straight year, with 4.7 million people coming in to witness the flag football conclusion.\n\nWhile Christian McCaffrey may have asked for a three-game series but USA vs Canada game is not going to happen as the players returned to their respective teams to resume league play. If they want revenge, McCaffrey and the USA fans will have to wait for next year.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

But credit goes to Marshall. They exploited a few things that we clearly have to clean up before we play them next week.\"\n\nMarshall (16-12, 9-6) shot 60% (making 32 of 53 shots), outrebounded ODU, 34-30, and outscored the Monarchs in the paint, 42-34, with Obinna Anochili-Killen, a fifth-year senior from Nigeria, doing most of the damage with 24 points and four blocked shots.\n\nThe most telling statistic of the game may have been assists \u2013 Marshall had 21 and ODU just six.\n\nSean Durugordon led ODU with 19 points, Robert Davis Jr. had 18, R.J. Blakney 16 and Jaden Johnson 10 for ODU. All four played a big role in ODU\u2019s comeback.\n\nThe game was played two hours earlier than originally scheduled because of a storm that dumped nearly a foot of snow on Norfolk and while the crowd of 3,839 was the smallest of the season, it raucously cheered the ODU comeback.\n\nODU never led and Anochili-Killen dunked the Herd to a 17-point lead, 45-28, a minute into the second half and the Monarchs were in danger of getting routed. ODU then went on a 7-0 run to cut the lead back to single digits.\n\nThe Herd pushed the lead back to double digits, and with 7:06 left, Jakob Gibbs made a layup and Marshall led by 18 points, 68-50.\n\nThe Monarchs then staged a remarkable comeback.\n\nFreshman Scottie Hubbard, who came off the bench to score eight points, made a three-point shot to begin the ODU run, and that was followed by four points from Blakney and another three-pointer from Hubbard that cut the lead with nine with 4:14 left.\n\nJohnson made a layup with 46 seconds left and after an ODU timeout, Durugordon forced a Marshall turnover and then made a layup to trim the lead to just three, with 40 seconds left.\n\nThen, in a rapid fire few seconds, ODU forced another turnover, then turned the ball over and Blakney blocked a Marshall shot and then corralled the rebound.\n\nBut then the Monarchs turned the ball over and were forced to foul.\n\nMikal Dawson then made two free throws with 16 seconds left and the Monarchs trailed by five.\n\nDavis then missed a three-point shot and the Herd rebounded, sealing the victory.\n\nODU went to a pressing defense in the game\u2019s final minutes that turned the momentum. Alas, because of injuries that have knocked four players out of the lineup, Jones said the Monarchs don\u2019t have the depth to press non-stop.\n\n\u201cYou would hope 28 games into a season that you would know your identity and who you are and how you\u2019re going to play and how rotations go,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to do that.\n\n\u201cWhen we press, it helps us play with more energy. We would like to press, but with our limited depth at this point, we\u2019d be crazy to try to do it for 40 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good when we can create that kind of chaotic play, when you\u2019ve got guys getting deflections and steals, and just having a different energy level.\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is, we\u2019re not deep enough right now to play that as much as we\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\nODU hosts Georgia State Saturday in its final home game of the season. The 7 p.m. game is the second of a doubleheader with the ODU women, who host Georgia Southern at 2 p.m.\n\nODU dropped a 20-point loss at Georgia State last week in Atlanta.\n\nThe Monarchs conclude the regular season with games at Marshall on Tuesday, Feb. 25, and Coastal Carolina, Friday, Feb. 28.",

I was curious to see where we are in that field.\n\n\n\nWe had a chance to win going into the last day, but we didn't play well enough. We were holding onto second place for a while there, but one bad hole late plummeted us down the leaderboard a little bit. A top-five finish early.\n\n\n\nWe told the ladies when we got home that there was more good than bad. To be in a position to win on the last day, that's what you ask for. We had a chance going into the back nine. If we can do that every week, a lot of good things are going to happen.\n\n\n\nFor a lot of those ladies, it was their first time in a playoff-caliber field. To accomplish what we want to accomplish, we'll have to beat them. We did it in the first event out in the spring. It's a quick turnaround, but I'm ready to get back out there.\n\n\n\nNo disrespect to the previous A&M teams, but those were the old team's stories. This team can write their own story. I think it's disrespectful in a way to assume that it's going to happen. We have a lot of new faces. I knew going into this season that we were going to get better every week. Maybe we took for granted our previous teams, but this group is relishing the chance to test themselves.\n\n\n\nIt's us against us. We are trying to be the best version of ourselves every week. We assess what goes wrong, unpack it and keep moving forward.\n\n\n\nIt's why I was upset and disappointed in the late mistakes we had because we had gotten used to a group that didn\u2019t do that. Good teams don't do that. I still think we are a good team. We were disappointed because we knew the standard.\n\n\n\nI had a great talk with Kynadie Adams , and I'm just saying nobody is putting us in the championship. I didn't see any celebrating like we arrived, so that\u2019s a good thing. I saw them practicing on their day off, so I think we have the culture to keep going.\n\n\n\n, and I'm just saying nobody is putting us in the championship. I didn't see any celebrating like we arrived, so that\u2019s a good thing. I saw them practicing on their day off, so I think we have the culture to keep going. It was a great performance by Vanessa Borovilos . She had it really going her front nine, made a mistake at the turn and ended up shooting 76. If you had told me that was happening, I would have said something went horribly wrong. She looked really good leading into that. To post two red numbers to help us out says so much about a freshman. We're very excited that we will get to see a lot of golf from her.\n\n\n\n. She had it really going her front nine, made a mistake at the turn and ended up shooting 76.

She didn\u2019t have her best stuff on the last day. She had a late triple bogey that really derailed a good finish. We talked to the airport about a plan coming back, and she wants to get back to that. I don't worry about her.

I'm ready to get back in and get back to work.\n\n\n\nWinning in our sport is very hard because you have to beat 14 other teams. Everybody remembers the postseason. Everything is a build to that. I try to pride my programs on winning in April and May. It's still February, and it feels like it in more ways than one. I'm ready to get back on the road and compete.",

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$22.6b US$27.0b US$23.7b US$25.4b US$25.6b US$25.7b US$25.9b US$26.3b US$26.8b US$27.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 0.19% Est @ 0.96% Est @ 1.49% Est @ 1.87% Est @ 2.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$21.0k US$23.4k US$19.1k US$19.1k US$17.9k US$16.7k US$15.7k US$14.8k US$14.0k US$13.3k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$175b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$27b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.8%) = US$596b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$596b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$290b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$465b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$155, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Chevron as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.090. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Chevron\n\nStrength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Chevron, there are three essential items you should further examine:\n\nFinancial Health: Does CVX have a healthy balance sheet?

Credit: Svet foto/Shutterstock.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s primary oil export route, managed by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), was disrupted due to a drone strike at the Kropotkinskaya pumping station.\n\nSituated in the Kavkazsky district of Kuban, the station is the largest CPC pump station in Russian territory, CPC said.\n\nThe attack, involving seven drones, has been labelled as an act of terrorism by the consortium.\n\nWhile the CPC did not directly attribute the incident to Ukraine, an official from Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it targeted the pumping station and the nearby Ilsky oil refinery, reported Reuters.\n\nThe strike occurred a day before US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia for Ukraine war talks.\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity, reported hearing at least 20 explosions in the area of the refinery.\n\nHe further claimed that the oil facilities were being utilised to support Russia\u2019s military operations in the ongoing war against Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, CPC said that, as a result of the strike, the Kropotkinskaya pumping station \u201chas been taken out of service. Crude transportation through Tengiz-Novorossiysk pipeline system is being maintained at reduced flow rates.\u201d\n\nThis incident marks the first instance of Ukrainian drones striking energy infrastructure associated with Western oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon.\n\nThe CPC pipeline is a key channel for global oil supply, with Kazakhstan contributing approximately 1% of the world\u2019s oil.\n\nThe Tengiz-Novorossiysk pipeline spans 1,511km, carrying more than two-thirds of Kazakhstan\u2019s oil exports along with crude from Russian oilfields, including those in the Caspian region.\n\nOther shareholders in the CPC include Shell, Italy\u2019s Eni and the Russian state.\n\nIn January 2025, Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine came to a halt, marking a major shift in the region\u2019s energy landscape.\n\nUkraine President Zelenskiy called the transit stoppage \u201cone of Moscow\u2019s biggest defeats\u201d and urged increased US gas exports to Europe.",

            "content": "A Ukrainian drone strike in Krasnodar has reduced the capacity of the CPC pipeline from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, according to Russian and Ukrainian sources.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) is a U.S.-British-Italian-Russian-Kazakh pipeline partnership that transports Kazakh oil through Russian territory to a single-point mooring terminal at Novorossiysk. It has a nameplate capacity of about 1.5 million barrels a day, equal to roughly two percent of the global seaborne-traded oil supply.\n\n\n\nCPC confirmed that seven explosives-laden drones attacked the Kropotkinskaya pumping station on Sunday night, the pipeline's largest station within Russia. The strike took the station out of service; while the line has not fully shut down, \"crude transportation through the Tengiz-Novorossiysk pipeline system is being maintained at reduced flow rates,\" CPC said.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully struck two major Russian oil installations in Krasnodar Krai.\n\n\n\nEarly in the evening, seven Ukrainian drones struck the Kropotkinskaya pumping station, the largest on the Caspian Pipeline, reportedly slashing total system capacity. pic.twitter.com/3IQPFXTO8W \u2014 OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) February 17, 2025\n\nUkrainian drones cripple Russia\u2019s largest Caspian Pipeline pumping station, Kropotkinskaya\u2014cutting off oil transit to Novorossiysk. Some added color for the talks in Saudi Arabia. pic.twitter.com/vpHMl6TICm \u2014 Maria Avdeeva (@maria_avdv) February 17, 2025\n\nThe CPC was subject to frequent interference by Russian interests in the early months of the war, but up until last weekend, it had not been targeted by Ukraine. The pipeline is part-owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Eni - all tied to Ukraine's Western allies - and it carries Western-owned oil from Kazakhstan's prolific oil fields on the Caspian Sea.\n\nNearly 90 percent of the CPC's oil volume is Kazakh-origin, but an attack on the CPC would impact Russian energy revenue. Russian state oil company Transneft controls the pipeline and owns 31 percent of its shares, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profits annually for the Russian state.\n\nThe attack could have an even bigger impact on Western oil companies. Chevron is counting on $4 billion in free cash flow from its Tengiz oilfield investments this year, and $5 billion in 2026, according to the ICIJ. A pipeline slowdown or shutdown could temporarily crimp deliveries.\n\nChevron told Energy Intel in a statement that its Kazakh joint venture continues to produce oil and export it via the CPC pipeline \"uninterrupted.\"\n\nKazakhstan, which depends heavily on oil exports for foreign exchange revenue, has the biggest stake in CPC's performance. It is a neutral party in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 80 percent of its oil exports are delivered via the CPC pipeline.\n\nFront month Brent and WTI futures ticked up by just under one percent after news of the pipeline slowdown.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best natural gas stocks to buy now.\n\nThe United States of America is the Top Natural Gas Producing Country in the World, courtesy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, notably in shale, sandstone, carbonate, and other tight geologic formations. The country\u2019s dry natural gas production reached 103.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2023, up 4.3% from 2022 and the highest for any year on record, dating back to 1930, according to 2023 Natural Gas Annual. The US was also a net exporter of natural gas for the seventh consecutive year in 2023, transporting gas to 42 countries during the year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Stocks to Buy in 2025\n\nAfter a stellar 2023, the US natural gas output slumped slightly last year due to prices falling to multi-decade lows, but production is expected to climb to 104.5 bcfd in 2025, as a period of strong demand and improved prices spark a resurgence in production. Analysts expect average annual gas prices to increase by more than 40% this year over the levels seen in 2024, as demand is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The demand surge is largely attributed to new LNG export facilities, like Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3, coming online, while the Golden Pass LNG project is also anticipated to begin operations by mid-2026.\n\nEurope remains a top destination for American liquified natural gas. The continent has had to rely significantly more on imported LNG and less on gas delivered via pipelines from Russia since the Putin government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The American LNG sector is also set to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month to lift a freeze on new US licenses to export liquefied natural gas, making good on a campaign pledge to rescind the measure.\n\nThe country\u2019s natural gas sector is also expected to benefit significantly from the ongoing AI boom and the accompanying data centers, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. According to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights, if even a quarter of the projected data center load is supplied by gas-fired generation, this would translate to a 2% increase in total US gas demand in 2040.",

But now, WTI oil prices are hovering between $70 and $75 per barrel -- giving up the bulk of their year-to-date gains.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nLet's dive into the key takeaways from ExxonMobil's and Chevron's results and discuss why both high-yield dividend stocks are worth buying in February.\n\nA silhouette of a person pointing at a pumpjack with a blue sky with scattered clouds and the sun in the background.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Strong results, all things considered\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron have been on a roller coaster over the last five years. The pandemic-induced crash led to steep losses for both companies in 2020. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, followed by an economic rebound, led to higher oil and gas prices. 2021 was a recovery year for both companies. But 2022 saw surging sales, earnings, and free cash flow (FCF).\n\nExxonMobil\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Sales and operating revenue (in billions) $398.68 $334 $339.25 Net income (in billions) $55.74 $36.01 $33.68 Diluted EPS $13.26 $8.89 $7.84 Capital and exploration expenditures (in billions) $22.7 $26.33 $27.55 FCF (in billions) $58.39 $33.45 $34\n\nData source: ExxonMobil. EPS = earnings per share. FCF = free cash flow.\n\nChevron\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Sales and operating revenue (in billions) $235.72 $196.91 $193.41 Net income (in billions) $35.61 $21.41 $17.75 Diluted EPS $18.28 $11.36 $9.72 Capital expenditures (in billions) $12 $15.8 $16.4 Free cash flow (in billions) $37.6 $19.8 $15\n\nData source: Chevron.\n\nSince then, both companies have ramped up capital expenditures and announced major acquisitions. However, the return to expansion has coincided with lower oil and gas prices. 2024 saw lower sales and earnings for both companies, but context is key.\n\nFocusing on upstream alone, both companies are delivering excellent results thanks to low production costs and technological advancements. The main issue is the downstream business. In 2024, ExxonMobil earned just $4.03 billion in worldwide earnings in its energy products segment compared to $12.14 billion in 2023. Worldwide upstream earnings were higher in 2024 than in 2023 due to the integration of Pioneer Natural Resources and ExxonMobil's expansion offshore Guyana.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron reported a loss in its U.S. downstream business in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the full year, the U.S. downstream segment reported just $531 million in earnings compared to $3.9 billion in 2023. The international downstream segment eked out a $100 million profit in Q4, but had over $1 billion less in profit for the year compared to 2023.\n\nGiven the challenges of lower oil and gas prices and refining margins, ExxonMobil and Chevron had solid years. ExxonMobil, in particular, generated incredibly impressive free cash flow -- a testament to its efficiency improvements.\n\n2. Excellent balance sheets\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron are well positioned to deliver strong earnings in 2025, even at lower oil prices. Seventy-five percent of Chevron's oil investments have a break-even point below $50 per barrel, while ExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 is based around $65-per-barrel Brent crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices are over $76.75 per barrel at the time of this writing.\n\nWhat's more, both companies can afford to support long-term growth plans even during cyclical downturns thanks to their strong balance sheets.\n\nExxonMobil finished 2024 with a net debt-to-capital ratio of just 6.8% -- which is calculated by dividing its $41.7 billion in total debt minus $23.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents by total equity of $270.6 billion. Similarly, Chevron finished the year with $24.5 billion in debt, $6.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and a net debt ratio of 10.4%.\n\nGiven their size and the capital-intensive nature of the oil and gas business, both companies have very healthy balance sheets -- giving them flexibility to navigate a period of lower oil and gas prices.\n\n3. Sustainable capital return programs\n\n2024 showcased the impeccable profitability of ExxonMobil and Chevron -- even during mid-cycle conditions. Both companies returned boatloads of capital to shareholders without compromising the health of their balance sheets.\n\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil paid $16.7 billion in dividends and bought back $19.3 billion in stock -- reaffirming plans to spend $20 billion on buybacks per year through at least 2026.\n\nChevron spent $11.8 billion in dividends and $15.2 billion on buybacks. On Friday, it raised its dividend by 5% -- marking the 38th consecutive year Chevron has boosted its payout. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years.\n\nBased on its new dividend payout of $1.71 per share per quarter, Chevron has a forward dividend yield of 4.6% compared to 3.7% for ExxonMobil.\n\nQuality dividend stocks at a good value\n\nSizable yields, track records for annual dividend raises, and strong balance sheets make ExxonMobil and Chevron excellent high-yield dividend stocks for passive income investors to consider buying now. Lower oil and gas prices and a downturn in the refining industry have weighed down both companies. And yet, they still can return plenty of capital to shareholders and invest in long-term growth through higher capital expenditures.\n\nBoth companies sport reasonable valuations. Based on 2024 earnings per share and both stocks' closing prices on Jan. 31, ExxonMobil has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.6 compared to 15.3 for Chevron. That's a compelling value considering trailing earnings were hindered by the factors discussed.\n\nAdd it all up, and ExxonMobil and Chevron are no-brainer buys for investors looking to boost their passive income stream from the two strongest players in the oil patch.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ExxonMobil wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s unclear which of those roles, if any, are set to be impacted by the layoffs.",

After walking the leadoff man, a single through the left side and another free pass loaded the bases with no outs for the hosts. Georgia Tech\u2019s Tyler Neises then drove in a pair of runs with a single to left center to trim ODU\u2019s lead to 3-2.\n\nThe Monarchs (0-2) then turned to Frankie Wright, but a throwing error to first allowed GT to reload the bases. Kyle Lodise then drew a four-pitch walk to tie the game and Drew Burress homered to right field to complete the comeback.\n\n\u201cIt was another good ball game, but we can\u2019t walk three guys in the ninth inning and expect to win,\u201d said ODU Head Coach Chris Finwood.\n\nODU scored all three of its runs in the first inning. Efrain Morales led off the game and was hit by a pitch, and Tech starting pitcher Brady Jones proceeded to walk Luke Waters, Kainen Jorge and Tyler Zedalis as the Monarchs went up 1-0. Zach Leite then made it 3-0 with a 2-RBI single down the left-field line.\n\nTech looked like it might get to Brown in the bottom of the second as Vahn Lackey hit a one-out double down the right-field line and moved up to third on a wild pitch, but Brown settled down and struck out the next two batters to preserve the 3-0 lead.\n\nThe junior lefty from Lansdale, Pennsylvania then struck out the side in the bottom of the third.\n\nIn the bottom of the sixth, a fielding error and a single to left put runners on the corners for the Yellow Jackets. ODU was able to shut down the threat though as Kellen Davis struck out the next batter before Kyle Edwards, Maverick Stallings and Leite turned a 6-4-3 double play.\n\nOld Dominion had an opportunity to add to its lead with two outs and the bases loaded in the top of the seventh, however Morales tried to race home on a ball in the dirt and was tagged out.\n\nBrown gave up just two hits and walked two batters, throwing 59 of his 96 pitches for strikes. Matela (0-1) took the loss and was responsible for four runs on two hits and three walks in one inning of work.\n\n\u201cWe had another good start from Dylan Brown, Kellen Davis was good in relief, and Bailey\u2019s first inning was good. We will have to get the back end of games figured out and we will,\u201d Finwood said of his team\u2019s pitching.\n\nLeite finished 1-for-3 with the two RBIs, Jorge also turned in a 1-for-3 effort and scored a run, Waters went 1-for-4 with a run, and Jack Slater collected ODU\u2019s other hit with a 1-for-4 day at the plate.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t very good today offensively,\u201d continued Finwood. \u201cVery passive and took too many strikes. We have another shot at them tomorrow and need to play a full nine innings. We\u2019ve been ahead for 15 out of the 17 innings we have played and are 0-and-2. You have to play well for all nine innings to beat a good team on the road.\u201d\n\nODU and GT wrap up the series tomorrow with Game 3 scheduled for a 1 p.m. start.",

The company announced the moves as an effort to cut costs, simplify its business, and complete its ongoing merger with Hess Corp. NYSE: HES.\n\nAfter falling about 2% on the announcement, CVX stock has recovered but still trades over 10% below its 52-week high of around $166. That\u2019s not new to investors.\n\nGet Chevron alerts: Sign Up\n\nShares of the oil giant have been rangebound for the last 18 months, so long-term investors may wonder if this decision will spark the growth that\u2019s been absent from CVX stock in recent years. The answer may not be as clear as the company\u2019s dividend, which remains one of the key selling points for CVX stock.\n\nLike other energy stocks in the oil and gas industry, Chevron has faced lower-than-expected crude oil prices, drilling restrictions put in place by the previous administration, and the cost pressures that come as many traditional oil companies begin to pivot towards renewable energy. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to put this news into context because many issues impact the company\u2019s outlook.\n\n\"Drill, Baby, Drill\" Is Being Met With Resistance\n\nBetween September and the election in November, CVX stock soared higher based on Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d to unleash America\u2019s energy independence. This was the playbook he used with success in his first term. But this is a different environment for oil companies that resist Trump\u2019s urging to increase production.\n\nThe oil and gas industry and the fortunes of energy stocks in general are always governed by supply and demand. When the price of oil goes down, it\u2019s more expensive for oil companies to drill, especially for exploratory projects. But that\u2019s the case for Chevron and other big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Co. NYSE: XOM and Occidental Petroleum Corp. NYSE: OXY.\n\nSimply put, they know that if the Trump administration is successful in oversupplying the market, the price of oil will head lower. And while Chevron can still break even with oil trading in the $50s, it\u2019s not anxious to test that right now, particularly as it faces cost overruns on a project on a large project in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Merger With Hess Still Weighs on Earnings\n\nChevron continues to wait to finalize its merger with Hess. The deal is subject to the outcome of an arbitration proceeding filed by Exxon Mobil. The deal is largely expected to go through, but the impact of the merger on future profits is weighing on the stock.\n\nEmbracing Technology to Streamline Operations\n\nChevron reported its fourth quarter 2024 earnings on February 7. The company beat on the top line with revenue of $52.23 billion, outpacing expectations for $48.41 billion. However, the company missed earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $2.06, coming in well below estimates of $2.42.\n\nCVX stock fell about 4% on the news but has since recovered. The layoffs came with the additional news that Chevron would be moving to embrace robotics and artificial intelligence to modernize and streamline its operations. However, that may be more significant to AI stocks than it will be for CVX investors.\n\nCVX Stock May Be Fairly Priced\n\nChevron Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$174.13\n\n12.82% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 17 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $194.00 Average Forecast $174.13 Low Forecast $160.00 Chevron Stock Forecast Details\n\nChevron\u2019s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.1 puts it at the average for integrated oil and gas stocks. And the stock has been bouncing around its 200-day simple moving average without much conviction for the past 12 months.\n\nBut there are a couple of reasons beyond cost-cutting to be bullish on CVX stock. First, the company is likely to benefit from higher LNG exports. It\u2019s also possible that crude oil prices will actually rise and not fall. This is because the United States has to continue replenishing its strategic oil reserve, and despite the increase in output in 2024, U.S. crude oil stocks remain near their lowest levels in five years.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to digest, but on balance, the outlook for oil prices coupled with Chevron\u2019s cost-cutting moves supports analysts' forecasts for a consensus price of $174.13 and an 11.6% gain from the current price. When you combine that with the company\u2019s dividend yield of 4.18%, CVX stock remains a quality, buy-and-hold stock in a volatile sector.\n\nChevron Co.

            "content": "As detailed in our previous updates, the IRA\u2019s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Negotiation Program or Program), which enables the federal government to negotiate prices for some of the costliest Medicare Part D drugs, has been subject to several legal challenges from manufacturers and trade associations over the last year. Since CMS selected the first ten drugs subject to negotiation in late August 2023, four chambers of commerce, two trade associations, and all but one of the affected manufacturers have filed a total of nine lawsuits challenging the constitutionality and legality of the Negotiation Program on several grounds.\n\nSince our last update, there have been developments in several cases as well as a significant Supreme Court ruling in an unrelated case that may create new avenues for manufacturer challenges to the Negotiation Program. Specifically with respect to the Negotiation Program lawsuits:\n\nIn September 2024, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a Texas federal court\u2019s decision tossing on procedural grounds a suit brought by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the National Infusion Center Association (NICA), and the Global Colon Cancer Association (GCCA), sending the case back for consideration of the merits.\n\nbrought by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the National Infusion Center Association (NICA), and the Global Colon Cancer Association (GCCA), sending the case back for consideration of the merits. In late October 2024, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard oral argument in appeals from decisions dismissing suits brought by AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nbrought by AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Johnson & Johnson. In July and October 2024, a federal district court judge in New Jersey ruled against two manufacturers, granting summary judgment in favor of the government in both cases. Both manufacturers, Novo Nordisk (Novo) and Novartis, have since appealed the decisions to the Third Circuit, and Novo has requested that the court expedite oral arguments and a decision.\n\nIn August 2024, a federal district court judge in Ohio granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss based on lack of standing and improper venue in a lawsuit led by the Dayton Chamber of Commerce. The plaintiffs have since appealed the ruling to the Sixth Circuit.\n\nIn August 2024, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) appealed the July 2024 district court ruling granting summary judgment in favor of the government to the Second Circuit.\n\nin favor of the government to the Second Circuit. In January 2025, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc. (Teva) filed a complaint against the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the US District Court for DC.\n\nAdditionally, in late June, the Supreme Court overruled its landmark 1984 Chevron decision in the consolidated cases Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce (Loper Bright). For the last 40 years, Chevron directed courts to defer to a federal agency\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of ambiguous statutes. While the Loper Bright decision was unrelated to the ongoing Negotiation Program lawsuits, the fact that the ruling reduces judicial deference to administrative agencies may provide a new pathway to block negotiation and implementation of maximum fair prices (MFPs).\n\nFurther, on January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term in office. The change in administration has obviously raised questions about the future of the Negotiation Program.\n\nNational Infusion Center Association\n\nMonths ago, an Austin, Texas-based federal court dismissed the lawsuit brought by PhRMA and two other associations, NICA and GCCA, on procedural grounds. In short, the district court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over NICA\u2019s constitutional claims because those claims had to be \u201cchanneled\u201d through HHS before a suit could be brought in court. And without NICA\u2019s claims, the court concluded that the venue in Texas (which is within the jurisdiction of the conservative-leaning Fifth Circuit) was improper.\n\n\n\nIn September, the Fifth Circuit reversed the lower court action, scoring the first victory for manufacturers in the ongoing Negotiation Program lawsuits. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the constitutional claims did not have to be channeled through HHS. A majority of the court concluded that because NICA did not challenge specific reimbursement rates, but instead challenged whether an unconstitutional process was created to set the price for the drugs for which its members are reimbursed, the claims did not need to be channeled. (One judge penned a dissent.) Importantly, the court also concluded that NICA lacked standing based on its claims that the Negotiation Program violated the non-delegation doctrine and that it levies excessive fines, sowing doubt as to whether those claims can be considered by the district court on remand. Though the court did not comment on the merits of the claim, the majority opinion also provides some hints that at least two judges on the Fifth Circuit align with the manufacturers\u2019 view of the Negotiation Program as a \u201cgun to the head\u201d rather than a true negotiation.\n\nThe government has the option to petition for further review from either the en banc Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court. If it does not, then the case will return to the district court for further proceedings on the merits. That merits decision may make its way to the Fifth Circuit in the not-so-distant future.\n\nThird Circuit Hears Argument in AstraZeneca, J&J, and BMS Cases\n\nAs we previously reported, federal judges in New Jersey and Delaware rejected constitutional challenges brought by AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS), and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson (J&J). Each manufacturer appealed, and the Third Circuit, on October 30, 2024, heard oral argument on the appeals. The arguments before a panel of three judges considered the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, including violations of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, the First Amendment right against government-compelled speech, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and procedural due process (which we have previously summarized). The court also considered AstraZeneca\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act claims challenging CMS\u2019s interpretation of \u201cqualifying single source drug\u201d and \u201cbona fide marketing,\u201d as well as the government\u2019s procedural arguments that AstraZeneca lacked standing to bring those claims and, in any event, those claims were subject to the IRA\u2019s judicial-review bar with respect to those interpretations. The judges hurled difficult questions at counsel for both parties, showing no clear inclination of which way the court would rule on the various claims.\n\n\n\nA decision is expected by the spring of 2025. That decision, regardless of its outcome, will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Novartis\n\nOn July 31 and October 18, respectively, a New Jersey federal judge rejected constitutional challenges from Novo and Novartis. As we detailed in our last update, on April 29, 2024 Judge Zahid N. Quraishi of the District of New Jersey, who has overseen four of the manufacturer lawsuits, issued a joint ruling against BMS and J&J. The four cases involved many overlapping claims and arguments, and Judge Quraishi\u2019s rulings in the Novo and Novartis decisions largely mirror his earlier ruling against BMS and J&J.\n\nNovo filed its lawsuit against the government on September 29, 2023, after CMS selected two of its products, NovoLog (NovoLog, NovoLog FlexPen, and NovoLog) and FIASP (FIASP, FIASP Flextouch, and FIASP Penfill), for negotiation. The Novo case is notable because CMS controversially aggregated the three NovoLog and three FIASP products as a single selected drug. Novo alleged that the IRA violated the separation of powers, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, and the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on compelled speech (together, Constitutional Claims), as well as the APA and Security Act (SSA) by imposing new legal obligations without complying with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, and the express mandate of the IRA by combining the NovoLog and FIASP products as a single drug (together, Statutory Claims).\n\nConsistent with his ruling against BMS-J&J, Judge Quraishi rejected each of the manufacturer\u2019s Constitutional Claims based on the conclusion that participation in Medicare is purely voluntary. The court rejected the Statutory Claims as well, reasoning that because the IRA precluded administrative or judicial review of the selection of drugs, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider challenges to CMS\u2019s underlying determinations that led to it selecting Novo\u2019s drugs. Further, in considering Novo\u2019s argument that CMS had effectively identified 15 products for 2026, the first year of the Program, (rather than the 10 drugs permitted by the IRA) by combining the NovoLog and FIASP products into a single drug, the court concluded that Novo failed to demonstrate it had standing. To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate that it suffered a concrete injury, that the injury was likely caused by the defendant, and that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief. Instead of seeking judicial relief on each of its statutory claims, however, Novo had provided \u201ca ten-paragraph general prayer for relief based on all of their claims,\u201d which the court concluded was \u201coverbroad\u201d because it sought not just to enjoin the injury that Novo suffered, but also \u201cto enjoin the IRA program as a whole and to declare invalid CMS\u2019s entire guidance.\u201d\n\nOn September 1, 2023, shortly after CMS selected the company\u2019s heart failure medication, ENTRESTO, for negotiation, Novartis filed suit alleging that the Negotiation Program violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause and the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on compelled speech. Novartis also argued that the Program\u2019s \u201cexcise tax\u201d was an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause. The court rejected each of Novartis\u2019s claims, citing to and reiterating the analysis of these claims in its BMS-J&J and Novo rulings.\n\nNovo and Novartis appealed to the Third Circuit. On January 27, 2025, after three of Novo\u2019s drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus) were selected for negotiation for 2027, Novo requested that the court expedite the oral arguments and its decision in the matter.\n\nDayton Chamber of Commerce\n\nOne of the first challenges to the Program was filed by the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and the US Chamber of Commerce (together, the Chambers). As we\u2019ve previously written, on September 29, 2023, the district court denied the Chambers\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and the government\u2019s first motion to dismiss, which gave the Chambers the opportunity to amend their complaint and to elaborate on the facts establishing standing. Because each of the Chambers did not have standing to sue in their own right, they asserted standing under the theory of associational standing, which allows associations in some circumstances to sue on behalf of their members who have standing.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, the Ohio federal court recently ruled in favor of the government\u2019s latest motion to dismiss, dismissing the case on procedural grounds before reaching the merits of the constitutional challenges.\n\nThe court concluded that three of the Chambers (Dayton, Ohio, and Michigan) did not have associational standing, while the fourth (US Chamber of Commerce), had it filed the case alone, would have needed to file suit in a different venue. The Chambers had argued that they had associational standing to sue on behalf of members that suffered injury, naming AbbVie (located in Illinois, California, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia) and Pharmacyclics (based in California). The court concluded that the Chambers had failed to provide information directly connecting the interests of Pharmacyclics or AbbVie to the business climate in the Dayton area, and as such, the interests at stake in this lawsuit were not germane to Dayton\u2019s interest. The court similarly concluded that the Ohio and Michigan Chambers of Commerce had not explained how any named members have interests in Ohio or Michigan. The court reasoned that the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s purpose \u2014 improving business conditions in the US \u2014 was sufficiently related to the interest in the lawsuit to satisfy the requirements for associational standing. However, the court agreed with the government\u2019s argument that if Dayton\u2019s claims were dismissed, venue would not be proper in the Southern District of Ohio where the case was filed. As such, the court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to the US Chamber of Commerce as well.\n\nThe Chambers appealed the district court\u2019s ruling to the Sixth Circuit, which is not expected to rule for several months.\n\nBoehringer Ingelheim Appeals to the Second Circuit\n\nAs detailed in our last update, on July 3, the federal district court in Connecticut overseeing the lawsuit brought by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Program passed constitutional muster. Resting largely on the conclusion that participation in the Medicare program is purely voluntary, the court rejected BI\u2019s claims, which overlapped with those brought by several of the other manufacturers (including the First Amendment, Takings Clause, and Unconstitutional Conditions claims considered and rejected by other courts). BI has since appealed the ruling to the Second Circuit. A decision from the Second Circuit is not expected for several months.\n\nTeva Files Lawsuit Related to its Drug Austedo\n\nIn January 2025, Teva filed a lawsuit against HHS related to its drug Austedo. The lawsuit appears to mirror the arguments advanced by the other lawsuits, including the assertion that CMS\u2019s definition of a Qualifying Single Source Drug and the bona fide marketing standard set forth in CMS\u2019s implementing guidance violate the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and that the CMS guidance violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Notably, the Teva lawsuit is the first manufacturer challenge related to the drugs selected for 2027. While Teva filed the lawsuit two days prior to the HHS announcement of the 15 drugs selected for negotiation for 2027, HHS included Austedo on its list of drugs for 2027.\n\nLoper Bright and the End of Chevron Deference\n\nIn late June, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in the high-profile Loper Bright case, overturning its long-standing doctrine of Chevron deference. While Loper Bright was not specifically related to the Negotiation Program lawsuits, the ruling is expected to have (and in some cases, already has had) a significant impact on various areas of administrative law. As we discussed in a blog post in August, Loper Bright could breathe fresh life into APA challenges to the Program.\n\nFor context, Chevron deference was primarily a product of the Court\u2019s 1984 decision in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which established a two-step test that federal courts were mandated to follow when reviewing whether a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute was permissible. In the first part of the test, courts were required to examine whether Congress had directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If there was an underlying statute that was unambiguous and clear, courts would review whether an agency\u2019s interpretation adhered to the statute. The second step, which is typically referred to as Chevron deference, provided that if the statute was silent or ambiguous on the issue in question, then the court would analyze whether the agency\u2019s interpretation was based on a \u201cpermissible construction\u201d of the statute, regardless of whether a court felt that there was a more accurate interpretation of the law.\n\nLong considered a \u201cbedrock\u201d of federal administrative law, Chevron deference essentially gave federal agencies wide latitude to issue federal regulations and administer federal programs based on congressional legislation that often (and sometimes intentionally) has left specific details about how a particular law is supposed to function unaddressed. For many years, the impact of Chevron deference has had a considerable effect on lawsuits challenging agency action. There is also some empirical evidence that Chevron resulted in agency rule drafters adopting more aggressive interpretations of federal statutes.\n\nSubsequent Supreme Court decisions narrowed the scope of Chevron deference so that courts were only required to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation if supported by formal proceedings, including adjudication and notice-and-comment rulemaking. Opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and other subregulatory guidance were thus afforded lesser judicial deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co. Along with similar rulings issued by the Supreme Court around the same time, including Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy, Loper Bright is expected to open federal agencies such as CMS up to more scrutiny and increase the number of lawsuits filed against agencies when a statute underlying agency action is ambiguous.\n\n\n\nLoper Bright will potentially strengthen the APA claims that manufacturers and other plaintiffs have brought, although it is unclear how much of an immediate impact the Court\u2019s ruling will have on the current Negotiation Program litigation. There is evidence that courts have been deferring to agency interpretations less and less in recent years, and Chevron has not appeared to factor into the Negotiation Program lawsuits, some of which only include constitutional claims that are unaffected by Loper Bright. Even for those lawsuits that include APA claims, the litigations appear to be more focused on the constitutional issues raised. In part, the focus of manufacturers and other plaintiffs on constitutional claims over APA and other statutory claims may be strategic. The constitutional claims, if successful, would be more successful in gutting the Negotiation Program completely, whereas success under the APA claims would likely only affect certain specific aspects of the Program, such as CMS\u2019s subjective determinations in selecting negotiation-eligible drugs and the calculation of MFPs.\n\n\n\nIt's also unclear how Loper Bright will help manufacturers and other plaintiffs (some of which have taken issue with the fact that CMS implemented the Negotiation Program primarily through subregulatory guidance) overcome the fact that the IRA expressly allows the Secretary of HHS (which CMS is a subagency of) to implement the Program for 2026, 2027, and 2028 \u201cby program instruction or other forms of program guidance.\u201d Manufacturers and other plaintiffs must also overcome the IRA\u2019s bar on judicial review; the IRA also precluded judicial review for many of the aspects of the Negotiation Program that are most concerning manufacturers and other plaintiffs, such as the factors used to determine which drugs are negotiation eligible.\n\nThe Teva lawsuit filed in January 2025 includes a single reference to Loper Bright in support of the manufacturer\u2019s assertion that courts \u201cmay not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d It is unclear whether Loper Bright will play a larger role in Teva\u2019s argument as the litigation progresses. It would not be surprising if other manufacturers and plaintiffs \u2014 including those that bring claims in the future related to CMS\u2019s selection of drugs for 2027 and onward, \u2014 will attempt to center Loper Bright in their arguments that parts of CMS\u2019s implementing guidance, to the extent not supported by a clear delegation of authority in the IRA, are invalid. In that sense, Loper Bright may breathe new life into challenges to the Negotiation Program.\n\nLooking Forward: The Trump Administration and the Negotiation Program\n\nThe election of President Trump has raised questions about the future of the Negotiation Program and the IRA more broadly. Congressional Republicans, who gained control of the Senate and maintained control of the House of Representatives, have been critical of the Negotiation Program since the IRA was passed. Unsurprisingly, the US pharmaceutical industry appears to be aggressively lobbying the new administration, which has various mechanisms to either repeal or undermine the Program.\n\nThe most substantial action the Trump administration could take would be to outright repeal the Negotiation Program via legislation. While Republicans only hold 52 seats in the Senate, short of the 60-vote filibuster-proof majority that would typically be needed to repeal a major law like the IRA, they would only need a simple majority in the Senate to repeal the law because it was passed under a Budget Resolution. Repeal of the Negotiation Program would arguably render the existing lawsuits moot.\n\nThe Trump administration is also now responsible for defending the law in federal court against the manufacturer lawsuits and could simply choose not to defend challenges to the law. However, the fact that the lawsuits involve constitutional claims that, if successful, could undermine the government\u2019s ability to carry out other measures means the Trump administration has a broader incentive to continue aggressively defending the lawsuits against manufacturers. Further, the administration abandoning the government\u2019s defense of the Negotiation Program would not necessarily result in a different outcome \u2014 federal courts can appoint amicus curiae, or \u201cfriends of the court,\u201d to argue in favor of a law's constitutionality. As we\u2019ve noted, federal courts have thus far rejected the manufacturers\u2019 claims on the merits, and the federal government removing itself from the defense of the Program would not necessarily change how courts have analyzed the claims.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration could also modify the Negotiation Program via agency guidance. Under President Biden, HHS has entirely implemented the Negotiation Program via subregulatory guidance, a decision that has been challenged (unsuccessfully) by manufacturers. While implementing the Negotiation Program via guidance had the benefit of expediency for the Biden administration, it also means that the Trump administration now has broad discretion to modify the Program to address manufacturer complaints about how drugs are deemed eligible for negotiation.\n\n\n\nIf recent history is a guide, speculating on the future of the Negotiation Program with any certainty is an exercise in folly. However, reporting by news organizations (which is consistent with what Mintz\u2019s consulting group, ML Strategies, has heard) indicates the new administration\u2019s approach to the Negotiation Program is more likely to involve modifications to certain aspects of the Negotiation Program rather than outright repeal or abandoning the defense of the lawsuits. For one, while President Trump has made broader statements about repealing portions of the IRA, notably, he has not publicly addressed how his administration\u2019s approach to the Negotiation Program will differ from the Biden administration\u2019s. Instead, his criticisms of the IRA have focused on the environmental provisions of the law. Further, on January 29, CMS published a short statement indicating that the new administration will continue the Negotiation Program. The statement also notes that CMS is \u201cconsidering opportunities to bring greater transparency in the Negotiation Program\u201d and would give stakeholders an opportunity to provide specific ideas to improve the Negotiation Program. The same day CMS released the statement, President Trump\u2019s nominee to lead HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stated during his nomination hearing that the White House had issued an executive order on the Negotiation Program \u2014 although it appears he was mistakenly referring to the CMS statement. Otherwise, Mr. Kennedy did not provide substantive responses to the various questions on the Negotiation Program he received from several senators.\n\nThe new administration\u2019s apparent reluctance to attach the Negotiation Program may be explained by the fact that it is broadly popular among the general public. One recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that 65% of Democrats, 54% of Independents, and even 48% of Republicans support expanding the number of drugs the federal government negotiates. There are obvious parallels to previous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration, which appear to have failed in part due to the ACA\u2019s growing popularity at the time.\n\nThere are also indications from Trump\u2019s first term in office that are informative. The first Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and proposals related to lowering drug prices were surprisingly aggressive. For example, prior to leaving office, the Trump administration\u2019s HHS proposed a Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model that would have capped the price of Medicare Part B drugs and biologics at the lowest price that a drug could receive in other similar countries. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has championed the broader use of MFN pricing for years, including most recently in a bill proposed in 2023.\n\nAnother signal that the Negotiation Program will be subject to tweaks rather than outright repeal comes from the reporting on pharmaceutical industry lobbying of the Trump administration. By all indications, drug lobbyists have focused on delaying the timeline (i.e., bona fide marketing standard) and formula (i.e., Qualifying Single Source Drug) used for determining a drug\u2019s eligibility for negotiation rather than outright pushing for the Trump administration to eliminate the Program.\n\nAs noted, however, anything short of outright repeal will not necessarily address the broader constitutional challenges to the Negotiation Program. As such, the litigation over the Negotiation Program will likely continue.\n\n[View source.]",

            "content": "Devon Energy (DVN -3.28%) recently completed the acquisition of assets in the Williston Basin (in the northern central U.S.) worth roughly $5 billion. That's a tiny deal relative to the roughly $53 billion Hess (HES -0.10%) acquisition that Chevron (CVX 0.41%) is attempting to complete. That size difference helps explain why Devon Energy's business has been growing solidly even though the company operates in the shadows of industry giants Chevron and ExxonMobil (XOM -0.93%).\n\nDevon Energy vs. Exxon and Chevron\n\nExxonMobil is a gigantic energy company, sporting a massive $470 billion market cap. Chevron isn't far behind with a market cap of over $260 billion. Devon Energy has a relatively tiny market cap of about $21 billion. Size, however, isn't the only difference here.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron are integrated energy companies. That means that they operate across the broader energy landscape, from the upstream (oil and natural gas production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the frequent and sometimes dramatic swings in the price of oil and natural gas. For example, when the upstream is suffering through low commodity prices, the downstream will benefit from low prices for key inputs. Pipelines, meanwhile, tend to produce reliable cash flows no matter what is happening with energy prices.\n\nBy comparison, Devon Energy is a pure-play upstream energy company. All it does is produce oil and natural gas, which means that its top and bottom lines will fluctuate along with commodity prices since there are no offsets to those fluctuations. Devon Energy is probably not an appropriate stock for conservative investors. Such investors should probably stick to integrated giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron. But that doesn't mean that it isn't an attractive energy stock for those looking to focus on upstream businesses. Devon Energy will likely see a much greater upside on the earnings and stock front when oil and natural gas prices rise (and a bigger downside when they fall, of course).\n\nDevon Energy is growing nicely thanks to its size\n\nOne of the key factors to monitor is Devon Energy's ability to grow its business. That's important for Chevron and ExxonMobil, too, but Devon has an edge over the giants. As noted above, the Hess acquisition that Chevron is working on is huge relative to the most recent deal that Devon completed. But Chevron's deals have to be big to have a material impact. ExxonMobil's roughly $5 billion purchase of Denbury Resources was about the same size as Devon's recent deal, but given the scale of Exxon, it just wasn't as important to the business.\n\nTo put some numbers on that, $5 billion is roughly 24% of Devon's market cap while that same figure is only about 1% of ExxonMobil's market cap. The deals aren't even in the same league when it comes to their impacts on the respective businesses. Tiny deals aren't a bad thing for ExxonMobil, but they aren't exactly needle-moving, either. It would take a lot of them to have the same impact on ExxonMobil that a single one would have on Devon Energy.\n\nThis is notable because it means Devon can benefit more from such acquisitions than its giant peers. Don't underestimate the importance of this fact, as it suggests that Chevron and ExxonMobil aren't likely to focus on such small acquisitions. That should leave plenty of opportunity for Devon Energy to act as an industry consolidator, even as giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron do the same on a larger scale.\n\nAs an example, in 2019, Devon operated in four energy basins. By 2023, it had operations in five basins, and the 2024 asset acquisition expanded its scale in the newly added basin. The recent expansions increased production and added land on which future wells can be drilled, in addition to diversifying Devon's business geographically.\n\nLooking at the business a different way, in 2019, Devon's production totaled 119 million barrels of oil equivalent (119 MMBOE). By 2023 that had increased to 240 MMBOE. The late 2024 acquisition noted above should push it higher again, with an even greater impact in 2025 given a full year of ownership.\n\nBeing small is an asset for Devon Energy\n\nIndustry giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron are very attractive to investors. But there are other ways to invest in the energy sector, and Devon Energy offers something of a sharpshooter approach for those with a positive view of energy prices. Given its small size and regional focus, it can pick up smaller assets, likely at attractive prices, that giants like Exxon and Chevron wouldn't even bother with. That has helped to fuel Devon's business growth in the past, and it will likely continue to do so well into the future.",

We pitched it well and played good defense. Hit a bunch of balls hard, but left a few on third base with less than two outs. Those are the runs you have to get in against good teams to win,\u201d said ODU Head Coach Chris Finwood.\n\nIn what started off as a pitchers\u2019 duel between ODU\u2019s Ben Moore and Georgia Tech\u2019s Tate McKee, the game was scoreless through four innings before the Monarchs (0-1) finally broke through in the fifth. Kainen Jorge, a transfer from the College of Central Florida, drew a one-out walk, stole second, and took third on a throwing error by the Tech catcher. After Tanner Schaedel also walked, Evan Holman brought in Jorge with a base hit to left field.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets (1-0) pulled even in the home half of the sixth on a Kent Schmidt solo home run to right, then jumped ahead 2-1 in the seventh as Alex Hernandez doubled to the gap in left, reached third on a sacrifice bunt, and then scored on a squeeze bunt.\n\nODU had an opportunity to do some real damage in the eighth as Holman started things off with a single to left. Ryan Thomas then entered the game as a pinch runner and Scotty Young, who came in to pinch hit for TJ Aiken, followed with a base hit down the left-field line. Thomas crossed the plate on the Morales double, and the Monarchs had runners in scoring position with no outs.\n\nTech brought in right hander Jaylen Paden, and the reliever began his appearance by striking out Kyle Edwards. Young was tagged out in a run down after Luke Waters sent a ground ball towards third, and Tyler Zedalis went down swinging as the Yellow Jackets escaped the jam.\n\nGeorgia Tech quickly applied pressure in the bottom of the eighth with back-to-back walks and a sacrifice bunt to open the frame. Maverick Stallings then fielded a weak grounder up the middle, but his throw home was to the wrong side of the plate as Drew Burress slid in safely for the decisive run. The Monarchs then went down in order in the ninth to close out the game.\n\nNick Sulpizio (0-1) took the loss after giving up one run on two walks in one inning in relief. Ben Moore held the Yellow Jackets off the board in a 4.1-inning start, holding the hosts to one hit and two walks while striking out three.\n\nHolman led ODU with a 2-for-2 day at the plate. He drove in one run and was also hit by a pitch. Morales went 2-for-4 with the RBI double, Young batted 1-for-1, and Zedalis contributed a 1-for-4 performance.\n\nThe Monarchs outhit the Yellow Jackets 6-5, but combined to hit 6-for-31 (.194) for the game and also left five runners on base.\n\nODU will look to even the series tomorrow when the teams return for a 2 p.m. first pitch at Russ Chandler Stadium.",

The employees would be given an option of voluntary buyout through April or May as Chevron prepares for internal reorganization.\n\nIndustry Pressures and the Setbacks in Major Projects\n\nChevron, currently carrying Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),is taking these cost-cutting measures amid industry challenges. The company is facing weaker refining margins along with declining oil prices. The company\u2019s major acquisition of Hess, which would provide access to Guyana\u2019s oil-rich fields, is currently on hold due to legal disputes with Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. Over the last few years, the company also faced a major decline in its oil and gas reserves, raising concerns about its long-term growth prospects.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLayoff Scenario in the United States\n\nDespite a rise in domestic oil and gas production in the United States, the number of jobs in the oil and gas industry is facing a setback of approximately 10% below pre-pandemic levels. The rising frequency of mergers and acquisitions, efficiency in drilling activities and a focus by management on profitability over production growth have led to job cuts and slow hiring.\n\nSince 2019, Exxon Mobil\u2019s global workforce has been reduced by about 17% despite an increase in production. Chevron\u2019s move also aligns with the broader industry trends and decides to cut jobs to strengthen its competitiveness.\n\nKey Picks\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like SM Energy Company SM and Sunoco LP SUN.\n\nDenver, CO-based SM Energy Company is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM\u2019s 2024 earnings indicates 15.11% year-over-year growth.\n\nDallas, TX-based Sunoco LP is a master limited partnership that deals with the distribution of motor fuel to roughly 10,000 customers, including independent dealers, commercial customers, convenience stores and distributors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SUN\u2019s 2024 earnings indicates 83.17% year-over-year growth.",

The project uses \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technology that can safely reach deep oil reserves up to 34,000 feet below sea level. The Anchor project could help Chevron with its declining oil and gas reserve replacement going forward.\n\nAn important metric for energy companies is reserve replacement, which is a measure of how much oil and gas can be produced and for how long. Over the past decade, Chevron\u2019s oil and gas reserves have fallen to record levels. In 2023, the company had 11.1 billion barrels of oil in reserve, but the number fell to 9.8 billion at the end of last year.\n\nIn August 2024, Chevron announced it was moving its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston, Texas.

Fox - Ktvu\n\nOil-titan Chevron, the second largest oil producer in the U.S., announced it will be reducing its global workforce by 20% as it is seemingly trying to slim costs and streamline operations.\n\nChevron's 2023 employment numbers place its workforce at 40,212 workers in various parts of its business. This means that if layoffs do happen at 20% as indicated, they will amount to roughly about 8,000 people. If you include employees at Chevron's service stations, this would add approximately 5,400 more to total layoffs.\n\nWith the layoffs, Chevron has said it aims to cut $3 billion in costs through 2026 by leveraging technology, asset sales, and changing how and where work is performed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Chevron's $53-billion deal to acquire oil producer Hess, intended to give it access to Guyana's lucrative oilfield, is in jeopardy has a court battle with larger rival Exxon Mobil. Guyana is at the center of competition between these two companies as Exxon Mobil has outperformed Chevron in production growth while achieving record production in Guyana.\n\nChevron has also faced production challenges, including bloated costs and delays in a large Kazakhstan oilfield project.\n\nWhile Chevron's shares saw a slight dip after the announcement, their share price has been up 2.86% in the last year. More broadly, the S&P 500 Energy Sector index has fallen 2.7% in the last day.\n\nReuters also reported that Chevron told employees during an internal town hall that they could begin opting for buyouts now through April or May.\n\nLayoffs come as Chevron headquarters recently relocated to Texas\n\nChevron announced in August last year that it would be moving its corporate headquarters from San Ramon, Calif., to Texas by the end of 2024. The company selected Houston as the location for its new headquarters, where it operates from now.\n\nAccording to a news release from the company, Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth, along with Vice Chairman Mark Nelson and other senior leaders, also moved to Houston during the company's transition to help maintain operations. Chevron is not only the latest such transplant; it is also the highest ranking in Forbes\u2019 latest Fortune 500, as it featured at 15th on the list.\n\nMoreover, its move to Houston added yet another major oil player to the state of Texas as it is also home to ExxonMobile, Sunoco and Valero.\n\nBeck Andrew Salgado covers trending topics in the Austin business ecosystem for the American-Statesman.

At the end of 2023, Chevron employed about 46,000 people worldwide, including 40,212 people across its operations and 5,400 people at service stations. The layoffs will only affect employees in operations, per Reuters, and impact employees across the world including in the U.S. where over half of Chevron's workforce is based.\n\n\"Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,\" Chevron vice chairman Mark Nelson said in a statement to various news outlets.\n\nRelated: Meta Informs Staff that Layoffs Will Begin Monday Morning in a Now-Leaked Internal Memo\n\nA source told Reuters that Chevron employees can opt for a buyout of undisclosed value or resign in exchange for a severance package from now through April or May.

Top Energy Stocks to Hold Now\n\nChevron reported its first loss in four years last month, causing the company's stock to fall by 3.9% the day it reported earnings. Chevron's downstream business, which refines crude oil into products like gasoline, lost $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a profit of $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nCNBC reports that lower profits on fuel sales could be due to declining demand after a post-pandemic surge in the U.S. and China, the largest oil consumers. Chevron wrote in its earnings statement that diminished profits were due to lower margins on sales of refined products, like gasoline, and higher operating expenses.\n\nChevron has also faced production challenges recently as its reserves, or the amount of oil and gas it can extract, have dipped to their lowest point in over a decade. Chevron's reserves have decreased from 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent by the end of 2023 to 9.8 billion in 2024.\n\nRelated: Exxon Mobil Leads The Oil Sector: Have Both Peaked?",

The company said its fuel business lost $248 million in the 4th quarter, a catastrophic swing compared with a profit of $1.15 billion in the prior year.\n\nA backdrop for all of this is another problem for Chevron. In 2023, the company announced a $53 billion bid to buy Hess, a deal that\u2019s become increasingly complicated as Chevron rival Exxon Mobil has mounted a legal challenge that\u2019s led to the yet-to-be-resolved effort dragging on for two years.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm\u2019s vice chairman Mark Nelson says it needs to simplify its business and its organizational structure in order to \u201cexecute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness.\u201d\n\nSpecific to the job cuts, Nelson later said in a statement that the company \u201cdoes not take these actions lightly\u201d and that it will support employees through the transition.\n\nCNN, citing a source familiar with the matter, said the company is telling employees they can opt for buyouts between now and April or May.\n\nChevron\u2019s workforce across the globe is an estimated 40,000-deep, meaning a cut of one-fifth would amount to 8,000 jobs.

Philip Gostelow/Photographer: Philip Gostelow/Bl\n\nChevron has announced plans to eliminate 15% to 20% of its global workforce by the end of 2026 as it seeks to cut costs and simplify operations. That translates to between 6,000 and 8,000 of its more than 40,000 member workforce. It\u2019s too early in the process to know how that will impact Chevron\u2019s Permian Basin operations.\n\n\u201cThese reductions are in line with our previous announcement of $2 billion to $3 billion in targeted structural cost reductions by the end of 2026, with some residual impact in 2027 and beyond. We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition. But responsible leadership requires taking these steps to improve the long-term competitiveness of our company for our people, our shareholders and our communities,\u201d Chevron officials said in a statement to the Reporter-Telegram.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAs Chevron begins a year of celebrating its 100th year of Permian production, the company has seen record production not only from the U.S. as a whole, but particularly the Permian, where output grew 18% in 2024.\n\nChevron CEO Mike Wirth told investors on the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call that its Permian production averaged 992,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the fourth quarter and surpassed 1 million barrels per day in December. The company has begun the process of shaping its Permian Basin profile toward a plateau, lowering capital investment while continuing to grow production.\n\n\u201cWe still expect to see 9% or 10% production growth in 2025 and something a little bit less than that in 2026. We\u2019re headed towards a lower rate of growth,\u201d Wirth told investors. \u201cAt some point you can\u2019t grow a position like this infinitely. We\u2019ll have an asset that will produce something over a million barrels per day for many years into the future. As we can maintain that with a lower rate of capital investment than we\u2019ve required to get to where we are, that really opens up the free cash flow off of that asset.\u201d\n\nOrganic capital expenditures are expected to remain within Chevron\u2019s $14 billion to $16 billion guidance range. The $2 billion to $3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026 is expected to be accomplished through asset sales, scaling technology solutions and changing work habits to improve efficiencies.",

The company said the reductions would simplify its structure and enable it to act faster, better positioning the firm for long-term growth. The oil giant employed more than 45,000 people at the end of 2023, roughly half of them in the US. Chevron did not provide further detail about where the cuts would fall.\n\nThe company said last month it was looking to sell some of its assets and expand the use of robots in its operations, as part of a push to find $2bn to $3bn in savings. It has also cut back capital spending, even as overall production is expected to grow 6% annually over the next two years thanks to new wells in countries such as Kazakhstan. Separately the firm has seen its effort to acquire oil producer Hess stall, amid a legal battle with rival Exxon.\n\nEmployment in the oil and gas sector in the US has fallen sharply over the last decade, even as production continues to expand.

Additions to reserves were mainly from extensions and discoveries in the Permian and DJ Basins.\n\nExcluding impacts from asset sales and acquisitions, organic reserves replacement ratio was 45%, Chevron said, reminding investors that reserves associated with shale development are limited to a five-year planning and execution period per SEC regulations.\n\nDuring the past 10-year period, Chevron\u2019s reserves replacement ratio was 88%, it said.\n\nThe ratio below 100% means that Chevron is depleting reserves faster than it can replace them.\n\nThe $53-billion acquisition of Hess would help increase the reserves and the RRR thanks to Hess\u2019s 30% stake in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana where the operator Exxon has found more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources.\n\nHowever, the deal has yet to clear several milestones before closing. The most important \u2013 and potentially most problematic \u2013 is the arbitration that Exxon and CNOOC, the third partner in Guyana\u2019s prolific block, are seeking with Chevron over the proposed acquisition of Hess.\n\nExxon and China\u2019s CNOOC claim that their current partnership terms with Hess Corp in the Stabroek Block give them the right of first refusal to the acquisition of Hess\u2019s stake.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Between 1968 and 1982 there were only three Major Championships on the LPGA Tour\u2019s schedule, following the removal of the Women\u2019s Western Open from the Major Championship roster in 1967 and nothing replaced it until 1983.\n\nAmy Alcott won the first Chevron Championship Major (Nabisco Dinah Shore as it was named) in 1983. For her victory, Alcott received $55,000 of the $400,000 purse \u2013 the same purse and winning prize money from 1983 \u2013 1985.\n\nIn 1987, the first $500,000 purse was being competed for, and the winner that year, Betsy King, took home $80,000. The purse didn\u2019t increase until 1990 when Betsy King won The Chevron Championship (Nabisco Dinah Shore) for a second time. In 1990, King earned $90,000 from the $600,000 purse.\n\nThe first winner of The Chevron Championship (Nabisco Dinah Shore) to receive over $100,000 was Dottie Mochrie in 1992. Mochrie took home a cheque worth $105,000 as the purse had risen to $700,000.\n\nBy 1998, the purse had reached $1,000,000, and the winner that year, Pat Hurst, earned $150,000 \u2013 the same purse and prize money followed in 1999. The purse started creeping higher and higher from 2000 when the then-named Nabisco Dinah Shore became the Nabisco Championship (2000 \u2013 2001) and the Kraft Nabisco Championship (2001 \u2013 2014).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014 the purse grew from $1,250,000 in 2000 to $2,000,000 in 2014. However, the first winner of the multi-million dollar purse was Morgan Pressel in 2007. Every winner from 2007 to 2014 was paid $300,000 for their success.\n\nThe next purse increase came in 2015 which also saw The Chevron Championship renamed once again, this time to the ANA Inspiration (2015 \u2013 2021). The purse saw a 25% rise, which resulted in that year\u2019s champion, Brittany Lincicome, receiving $375,000 from the $2,500,000 purse. The purse rose by $600,000 over the next six years and the winner\u2019s share in that time grew by $90,000.\n\nIn 2022, The Chevron Championship adopted the name it goes by today and the purse received a major boost from $3,100,000 in 2021 to $5,000,000 just one year later. The first winner of the $5,000,000 purse was Jennifer Kupcho, and she received $750,000. Last year the purse had grown again by $100,000, which meant the 2023 Chevron Champion, Lilia Vu, earned $765,000.\n\nThis year the purse for The Chevron Championship received a well-deserved boost. When the LPGA Tour announced its record-breaking 2024 schedule the $5,2000,000 purse was revealed for the first Major Championship of the season. However, at the start of the tournament week, an announcement was made that the purse would be rising by just over 50% to $7,900,000. The Chevron Championship crowned Nelly Korda as its very first million-dollar Champion in 2024.\n\nYear Masters Champion Prize Money Purse 2024 Nelly Korda $1,200,000 $7,900,000 2023 Lilia Vu $765,000 $5,100,000 2022 Jennifer Kupcho $750,000 $5,000,000 2021 Patty Tavatanakit $465,000 $3,100,000 2020 Mirim Lee $465,000 $3,100,000 2019 Jin Young Ko $450,000 $3,000,000 2018 Pernilla Lindberg $420,000 $2,800,000 2017 So Yeon Ryu $405,000 $2,700,000 2016 Lydia Ko $390,000 $2,600,000 2015 Brittany Lincicome $375,000 $2,500,000 2014 Lexi Thompson $300,000 $2,000,000 2013 Inbee Park $300,000 $2,000,000 2012 Sun Young Yoo $300,000 $2,000,000 2011 Stacy Lewis $300,000 $2,000,000 2010 Yani Tseng $300,000 $2,000,000 2009 Brittany Lincicome $300,000 $2,000,000 2008 Lorena Ochoa $300,000 $2,000,000 2007 Morgan Pressel $300,000 $2,000,000 2006 Karrie Webb $270,000 $1,800,000 2005 Annika S\u00f6renstam $270,000 $1,800,000 2004 Grace Park $240,000 $1,600,000 2003 Patricia Meunier-Lebouc $240,000 $1,600,000 2002 Annika S\u00f6renstam $225,000 $1,500,000 2001 Annika S\u00f6renstam $225,000 $1,500,000 2000 Karrie Webb $187,500 $1,250,000 1999 Dottie Pepper $150,000 $1,000,000 1998 Pat Hurst $150,000 $1,000,000 1997 Betsy King $135,000 $900,000 1996 Patty Sheehan $135,000 $900,000 1995 Nanci Brown $127,500 $850,000 1994 Donna Andrews $105,000 $700,000 1993 Helen Alfredsson $105,000 $700,000 1992 Dottie Mochrie $105,000 $700,000 1991 Amy Alcott $90,000 $600,000 1990 Betsy King $90,000 $600,000 1989 Juli Inkster $80,000 $500,000 1988 Amy Alcott $80,000 $500,000 1987 Betsy King $80,000 $500,000 1986 Pat Bradley $75,000 $430,000 1985 Alice Miller $55,000 $400,000 1984 Juli Inkster $55,000 $400,000 1983 Amy Alcott $55,000 $400,000\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO TODAY\u2019S GOLFER: Print and Digital access, discounts and rewards!",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed how major capital expenditure (CapEx) commitments from top tech companies have been received by the market, especially in light of the introduction of DeepSeek. According to Cramer, investors had initially embraced these significant AI investments, with many tech giants committing large sums toward advancing artificial intelligence.\n\nOne such important venture was Stargate, an AI infrastructure project unveiled at the White House on January 21st, the first full day of Trump\u2019s presidency. He added:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re spending a hundred billion upfront and could go up to $500 billion over the next four years. Now some of them question whether these companies even have that kind of money, but hey, you know who didn\u2019t care? I mean Wall Street\u2026 Now, something big changed in recent weeks though, and that was the arrival of DeepSeek.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts On These 8 Stocks and the Packaged Goods Playbook and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer noted that DeepSeek, the Chinese generative AI tool, has demonstrated performance nearly on par with the top U.S. AI systems, but at a fraction of the cost, using far less hardware. He highlighted that although DeepSeek was launched in 2024, it only caught the attention of Wall Street and Silicon Valley in mid-January 2025 after a Chinese quant hedge fund released a white paper detailing the technology\u2019s creation. The paper\u2019s release on January 20th brought DeepSeek into the spotlight, and the market reacted strongly, triggering a significant tech sell-off.\n\n\u201cThe collective acts about DeepSeek caused a huge nasty tech sell-off\u2026 The still unanswered question that DeepSeek has forced investors to ask is whether or not developers of AI applications still need to spend huge amounts on infrastructure in order to get the best results.\u201d\n\nCramer mentioned that despite this uncertainty, the big tech companies have maintained their capital expenditure forecasts, and so far, they have not been penalized for sticking to these predictions. Cramer pointed out that these companies do not appear to be taking DeepSeek\u2019s impact seriously.",

You only have so much capital and so much time in the day,' Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, told the Journal.\n\n'Given the regulatory environment in California, I would be investing outside the state.'\n\nThe latest bill to be proposed on the matter was introduced on January 27 by Democratic state Senator Scott Wiener.\n\nIf passed the law would allow insurance companies and homeowners to hold oil and gas companies liable for climate-related disasters such as wildfires.\n\nCalifornia is still recovering from the deadly wildfires that destroyed large swathes of Los Angeles.\n\nThe state is also in the grip of an insurance crisis as large insurers are refusing to issue new policies or renew others that are at increased risk due to the rise of climate-related disasters.\n\nChevron refineries account for a third of the state's gasoline-production capacity.\n\nIts fuel-making plants are a century old and encompass nearly 4,000 acres in Northern and Southern California.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom's relationship with Chevron soured over environmental regulations\n\nThe Golden State already have consistently higher gas prices than any state but Hawaii\n\nSelling the facilities could prove tricky given the rising environmental liabilities and a shrinking pool of buyers, according to the Journal.\n\n'We used to have competitors. They're gone,' Walz, who runs Chevron's refining, pipeline and chemical businesses, told the publication.\n\nDemand for gasoline is also shrinking, down 10 percent in California since 2019, as more residents work from home and EV sales increase.\n\nThe state has a ban on the sale of gasoline-powered cars after 2035 and EVs now represent more than a quarter of new car sales in California.\n\nIn 1983 California had 40 operating refineries but the number has fallen to just 14 as of last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe softening demand has led to less oil exploration in the state, which imported more than 75 percent of its oil in 2023.\n\nChevron is not the only company leaving California, it follows Elon Musk's SpaceX, Oracle and Hewlett Packard that have all relocated to Texas.",

            "content": "Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) stock is up by 2.2% over the past week. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Chevron's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chevron\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chevron is:\n\n11% = US$18b \u00f7 US$157b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nChevron's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Chevron seems to have a decent ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 15%, we aren't very excited. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 37% net income growth reported by Chevron over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Chevron's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 40% in the same period.\n\nNYSE:CVX Past Earnings Growth February 10th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CVX?

Basically, it interferes with production of a protein in your blood that carries oxygen to all parts of the body.\n\nIt causes swelling, pain in your joints and anemia, just for starters. Long term, it can cause significant damage to your organs.\n\nTreatment includes frequent blood transfusions and pain meds.\n\nIn other words, Isaiah was dealt a tough hand in life, and while I haven\u2019t met him, I\u2019ve seen photos of him, and his smile is endearing.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to give Isaiah a helping hand, you can do so by purchasing tickets for the Old Dominion University men\u2019s basketball game on Thursday, Feb. 20, against Marshall.\n\nODU will donate $1 of each ticket sold to help fund Isaiah\u2019s dream vacation.\n\nTo purchase a ticket, CLICK HERE\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation and Chartway Credit Union\u2019s Chartway Promise Foundation asked Isaiah to make three wishes. He responded with DisneyWorld, Six Flags or perhaps a major water park, wherever he could ride a roller coaster or go on rides that are \"scary.\"\n\nODU\u2019s goal is to help pay for Isaiah\u2019s trip. But if $1 doesn\u2019t seem like enough and you want to donate more, CLICK HERE.\n\nIt\u2019s easy. I donated. It only takes a minute.\n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with Chartway Credit Union, it is the organization that purchased naming rights to Chartway Arena. Chartway spent millions of dollars on the sponsorship, which also includes scholarships for student-athletes and financial education.\n\nAnd, by the way, Chartway is the official credit union of ODU athletics.\n\nOf all of the corporate sponsors who work with ODU, I can\u2019t think of any who does more in the Hampton Roads community than Chartway.\n\nCredit unions aren\u2019t banks that may have branches all over Hampton Roads, but are often are headquartered in another state. Chartway is headquartered in Virginia Beach, and while it has branches in Texas and Utah, the vast majority of its employees branches and employees are in Hampton Roads.\n\nTowneBank, another ODU sponsor, is a notable exception \u2013 it is headquartered in Suffolk, and does a ton of work in the community.\n\nCredit unions are owned by its members, meaning I\u2019m a part owner because I have an account there. All profits are plowed back into the company, often to reduce fees for customers.\n\nAs such, credit unions tend to be interested and generous when it comes to helping their communities.\n\nChartway demonstrated its commitment to this region 20 years ago when it founded the Chartway Promise Foundation and it has since awarded $16 million to help more than 10,000 young people and their families who are dealing with medical hardships.\n\nIsaiah will attend the Marshall game and fans will learn more about his story when he is introduced late in the first half.\n\nIsaiah will be the sixth \u201cPromise Hero\u201d to receive a Make-A-Wish award at an ODU football for basketball game.\n\nIt is the third year that Chartway and ODU have partnered to not only give children a wonderful vacation, but also a chance to receive encouragement from thousands of fans.\n\nIf you're there, give Isaiah a nice ovation.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate our partnership with ODU so much,\u201d said Christine Wilson, president of the Chartway Promise Foundation. \u201cOur Promise Heroes are treated like royalty by the ODU staff, and we really appreciate that. It means so much to the kids.\n\n\u201cWorking with ODU also gives us a platform to reach more people and tell the stories of those children and all of the good work done by our foundation and how they can get involved.\u201d\n\nBrian Schools, Chartway Credit Union\u2019s president and CEO, calls what the foundation does \u201cpart of our community commitment to live up to our purpose by supporting medically fragile children and their families, bringing them hope, joy and smiles.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s pretty awesome.\n\n\u201cI wish more businesses in Hampton Roads operated like Chartway,\u201d Bryan Stephens, president and CEO of the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce, said last month at the opening of a Chartway branch at the Oceanfront.\n\n\u201cTheir culture is worthy of emulation by every business in every industry.\u201d\n\nMinium is ODU\u2019s senior executive writer.

The company is the 7th largest integrated oil company worldwide, the 2nd largest in the US, and has been in operation since 1879. Chevron was part of the original Standard Oil Company and is one of the 34 successor companies that were formed when it was broken up. Today, the company brings in roughly $160 billion in annual revenues and is the last remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOriginally called Standard Oil Of California the company grew quickly via mergers and acquisitions. It was hailed as one of the Seven Sisters to dominate the US and global production throughout the mid-20th century and became even bigger in 1985 when it merged with Gulf Oil. The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "BNEF\u2019s report also highlighted a clear divide between investment in well-established and emerging clean energy sectors. Proven technologies with scalable business models\u2014such as renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles, and power grids\u2014accounted for the bulk of 2024\u2019s investment, totaling $1.93 trillion, a 14.7% increase. This growth persisted despite challenges from policy changes, higher interest rates, and an expected slowdown in consumer demand.\n\nAlthough energy stocks fell short of investor expectations, global investment in the low-carbon energy transition grew by 11% in 2024, reaching a record $2.1 trillion, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s (BNEF) Energy Transition Investment Trends 2025 report. This growth was largely driven by increased investment in electrified transportation, renewable energy, power grids, and energy storage, all of which hit new highs last year. However, while total investment in energy transition technologies set a new record, its growth rate was slower than in the previous three years, when annual increases ranged from 24% to 29%.\n\n\u201cAs 2024 came to a close, markets responded to the environment for energy prices. In part, it reflects concern that Oil Petroleum Exporting Countries+ (OPEC+) may soon boost production, which would add to an already solid supply situation. The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn\u2019t well demanded. Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Europe are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global oil demand is lagging.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of 2024, energy sector stocks saw considerable fluctuations, rising by over 6% in November before declining nearly 10% in December. By the close of the year, the broader market\u2019s energy sector, which had been up nearly 20% at its highest point, finished 2024 with a return of just 5.72%. This performance fell well behind the wider market. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management, made the following comment about the performance of energy stocks:\n\nThe energy sector\u2019s presence within the broader US stock market has fluctuated over time. In the 1970s, it accounted for around 15% of the market, whereas today, it represents just 3.2% of the broader index, as reported by U.S. Bancorp Investments. However, energy consumption has increased since the 1970s, and its significance has not diminished. According to analysts, from an economic standpoint, energy stocks hold a more substantial role in the broader market than their current index weighting suggests.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best energy dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven as oil prices decline, an increasing number of fossil fuel companies are allocating a larger share of their profits to shareholders, indicating a shift in focus away from reinvesting in oilfield development. Some major oil firms have even taken on debt to maintain shareholder payouts. According to Bloomberg, four of the world\u2019s five oil supermajors borrowed a combined $15 billion between July and September 2024 to fund share buybacks, underscoring their commitment to rewarding investors. In addition, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago, as reported by Janus Henderson.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting energy companies across various sectors within the energy industry, including exploration and production, utilities, renewable energy, and oil refining and marketing. From this pool of companies, we identified 10 companies that prioritize distributing dividends to their shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Chevron Corporation (CVX) The Best Energy Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) ranks sixth on our list of the best dividend stocks from the energy sector. The American multinational energy company manufactures and sells a range of high-quality refined products. It recently announced a partnership focused on creating scalable power solutions using natural gas-fired turbines, incorporating carbon capture and storage to support the growing energy demands of US data centers. In addition, the company successfully launched gas production from the Sanha Lean Gas Connection project, securing a reliable natural gas supply for the Angola Liquefied Natural Gas facility. CVX has surged by over 4% since the start of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) delivered an exceptional performance, setting new records. Global production rose by 7%, while US output saw a remarkable 19% increase, reaching all-time highs. Looking ahead to 2025, growth is expected to continue, supported by the full-year impact of its PDC Energy acquisition, finalized in August 2023. In addition, key project launches in the Gulf of Mexico and continued expansion in the Permian Basin\u2014where production grew by 18%\u2014further strengthened its overall performance.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) maintained a strong cash position in FY24. The company generated an operating cash flow of $31.5 billion and a free cash flow of $15 billion. It returned almost $12 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Moreover, the company repurchased over $15 billion of its own shares in 2024, continuing its long-standing practice of share buybacks, which it has done in 17 of the past 21 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share, having raised it by 4.9% in January. This marked the company\u2019s 38th consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock supports a dividend yield of 4.48%, as of February 8.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was included in 63 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 64 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth more than $21 billion. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall, CVX ranks 6th on our list of best energy dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Chevron was part of the original Standard Oil Company and is one of the 34 successor companies that were formed when it was broken up. Today, the company brings in roughly $160 billion in annual revenues and is the last remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOriginally called Standard Oil Of California the company grew quickly via mergers and acquisitions. It was hailed as one of the Seven Sisters to dominate the US and global production throughout the mid-20th century and became even bigger in 1985 when it merged with Gulf Oil. The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Chevron (CVX 0.39%) has been a fantastic income stock over the years. The oil giant recently extended its dividend growth streak to 38 straight years. That's a rare feat, considering that only about 80 publicly traded companies in the U.S. have delivered 35 or more years of dividend increases. Chevron's track record is even more impressive because it operates in the volatile oil sector.\n\nThe oil industry's volatility can scare off some income investors. However, Chevron has proven that it pays a durable dividend that can withstand the oil sector's wild swings. The company is in an excellent position to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend (a 4.5% current yield compared to 1.2% for the S&P 500) in the future. Because of that, income-seeking investors won't want to overlook Chevron's payout.\n\nBuilt on a strong foundation\n\nChevron operates a globally integrated energy business. It produces oil and gas (upstream), manages midstream energy infrastructure to transport, process, and store some of its production, and owns downstream chemicals and refining assets. This strategy helps Chevron maximize the value of its production and acts as a natural hedge against commodity price fluctuations (downstream businesses benefit from lower prices). As a result, Chevron produces steadier cash flow than peers focused solely on the upstream segment of the oil market.\n\nLast year, Chevron produced $31.5 billion in cash flow from operations. That was more than enough money to cover its capital spending ($16.4 billion), enabling it to produce about $15 billion in free cash flow. That excess cash easily covered the oil company's dividend outlay of $11.8 billion.\n\nChevron returned all its remaining excess free cash flow -- and then some -- to shareholders by repurchasing $15.2 billion of its shares (retiring 5% of its outstanding shares). That brought its total cash returns to a record $27 billion last year. The company covered the deficit with its strong balance sheet and asset sales -- $7.7 billion from selling its Canadian assets and some non-core positions in the U.S.\n\nEven with those massive cash returns, Chevron maintained a strong balance sheet. \"The balance sheet is in excellent health, with net debt below our historical levels,\" stated CFO Eimear Bonner on the company's fourth-quarter conference call. The oil giant ended the year with a net leverage ratio of 10%, well below its 20%-25% target range.\n\nPlenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend\n\nChevron's strong financial profile has allowed it to grow its dividend at a healthy pace. It increased its payout by 5% for 2025. \"Over the past five years we have grown our dividend faster than the S&P 500 and nearly double the rate of our closest peer,\" said the CFO on the conference call. That above-average growth rate should continue.\n\nA big factor fueling that optimism is Chevron's expectations for free cash flow. CEO Michael Wirth said on the call: \"Chevron is poised for industry-leading free cash flow growth. We expect to add $10 billion of annual free cash flow in 2026.\"\n\nOne thing driving that outlook is the recent completion of its future growth project in Kazakhstan. The company expects to see a sustained increase in distributions from that investment in the future. \"At $70 Brent [the global oil price benchmark], expected free cash flow to Chevron is $5 billion in 2025 and $6 billion in 2026,\" noted the CEO on the call.\n\nChevron is also growing its production in the Gulf Coast region, \"where we produce some of the highest margin barrels in our portfolio,\" said Wirth. The company recently completed its Anchor and Whale projects, which are ramping up, and expects to bring Ballymore online this year. Chevron is also growing its production in the Permian Basin.\n\nIn addition, the company is working to reduce costs. It expects its capital spending to fall to a range of $14 billion to $16 billion in 2025. The company also aims to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of structural cost reductions by the end of next year.\n\nThere's lots of additional upside potential for Chevron's free cash flow from higher oil prices and its pending acquisition of Hess. The company believes it will win its arbitration case against Exxon, which would allow it to close that needle-moving deal in the third quarter. Buying Hess would make Chevron an even stronger oil company and further enhance its ability to grow its free cash flow in the coming years.\n\nA well-oiled dividend\n\nChevron has done a fantastic job paying dividends. It has proven the durability of its payout for nearly four decades. Meanwhile, it has delivered above-average dividend growth in recent years. That should continue, given the expected surge in the company's free cash flow. Because of that, Chevron's high-yielding payout is on a very sustainable foundation, making it an ideal option for investors seeking a lucrative passive income stream.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently pointed out some unexpected trends in the stock market this year, spotlighting a group of companies that have largely flown under the radar. These stocks, often overshadowed by the heavily discussed \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, the dominant tech giants, are making significant gains without the fanfare. Cramer called them \u201cquiet winners,\u201d emphasizing that many of these stocks, particularly those outside the tech sector, are not getting the recognition they deserve from Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nCramer elaborated further on this point, noting that the leading stocks in 2025 have emerged from an unexpected mix of sectors, making this trend all the more interesting. Cramer remarked that it is clear that there is a shift happening in the market, with industries beyond tech making significant strides, yet remaining largely underappreciated by the broader investing community.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the insurance industry has experienced a particularly strong few years, noting its impressive pricing power, which has translated into higher premiums. This, in turn, has allowed insurance companies to invest those premiums in the bond market, generating significant returns.\n\nAdditionally, Cramer argued that the market often gets the most obvious things wrong, which ends up costing investors dearly. In his usual candid style, Cramer emphasized that while no investment is entirely foolproof, certain stocks show more resilience than others. \u201cThe key is to buy them when they\u2019re down because they won\u2019t stay down for long,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe continued, acknowledging that some stocks have stumbled recently, but he believes that many of the non-tech winners from this year still have room to grow. His message to investors was clear: focus on these quieter, non-tech stocks, as they have the potential to deliver strong returns even as the tech sector struggles with occasional setbacks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 6. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nA caller asked if Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was still the greatest of all time but Cramer recommended being in Chevron instead.\n\n\u201cYou know, look, frankly, I\u2019d rather see you in Chevron if you could do that\u2026 but I, no, we wanna stay away from Exxon\u2026 It\u2019s just, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not where the action is.\u201d\n\nExxon (NYSE:XOM) engages in the exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas. In September 2024, Cramer expressed disappointment with the stock as he said:\n\n\u201cDevon is actually cheaper than Exxon Mobil Corporation. Exxon is expensive, with only a 3.4% yield. It\u2019s not much better than Chevron, which yields 4.7%. It\u2019s not a good time to own oil. Demand was never there, and prices are finally falling.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that over the past year, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has risen over 7% while Chevron stock has gained less than 1%.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Their display of protest included Palestinian flags, signs, banners and keffiyeh adorned car hoods. At each station they jumped out of their cars to pass out flyers and talk with customers fueling up for gas to let them know of Chevron\u2019s complicity in Palestinian energy apartheid. Their action concluded with a rally at Cupertino Memorial Park where the Raging Grannies led a politically charged singalong and chants. Speakers highlighted Chevron's ties with the still ongoing genocide.One day earlier in Oakland at another corporate owned Chevron station, and despite heavy rain, more than 30 activists held aloft fifteen foot high banners and stood near a larger-than-life grim reaper puppet that symbolized the world-wide human rights violations and climate desecration for which Chevron is responsible.",

            "content": "From the Margins of Chabad History: The first installment of a new Anash.org column uncovers a fascinating unknown letter in which the Frierdiker Rebbe movingly describes the nature of his work guiding his Chassidim. Pirsum Rishon\n\nAnash.org is excited to announce the launch of a new bi-weekly column, \u201cFrom the Margins of Chabad History.\u201d Written by Shmuel Super, this column will present forgotten and little-known fascinating episodes and characters from Chabad history, drawing information primarily from old newspapers, books, and manuscripts.\n\nIn honor of Yud Shvat, the first installment of this series is dedicated to a letter of the Frierdiker Rebbe that was published in a contemporary newspaper, and forgotten from Chabad history until now.\n\n***\n\nBy Shmuel Super\n\nOur letter comes from an unexpected source, the Haaretz newspaper from Tuesday, 22 Tammuz 5688 (July 10, 1928). On page 3, the newspaper contains an article about a joyous event celebrated in Chevron a few days earlier\u2014the first anniversary of the geulah of the Frierdiker Rebbe on Yud Beis Tammuz.\n\nThe article begins with a tribute to the longstanding close relationship between Lubavitch and Chevron, from days of Mitteler Rebbe until the current time. The writer highlights the Rebbe Rashab\u2019s activities to strengthen the Yishuv in Chevron, buying land and establishing Yeshivas Toras Emes.\n\nThe current Rebbe, he writes, played an important role in his father\u2019s activism on behalf of Chevron, and the Chabad Chassidim of Chevron accepted him as his father\u2019s successor. Therefore, the 12th of Tammuz was celebrated grandly, like a new Chabad Yom tov, joining Yud Tes Kislev on the calendar. A farbrengen was held on Shabbos at the home of Chevron\u2019s rov, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Slonim, and a public shalosh seudos was served in the shul. People from beyond the Chabad community attended the celebrations as well.\n\nThe article then takes a sharp turn, as the writer presents selections \u201cfrom a letter sent by the Rebbe to one of his Chassidim in Chevron.\u201d This letter was not included in the published Igros Kodesh of the Frierdiker Rebbe, and seems to have gone unnoticed by other researchers since.\n\nIn this letter, the Frierdiker Rebbe gives a very personal and moving description of his personality, avodas hakodesh, and experiences. The quotes from the letter, translated into English follow:\n\n\u201cI have not yet been able to properly read your letter, as the past few years have instilled in me an unavoidable habit\u2014to read only matters of action: brief presentations filled with abundant practical content.\n\n\u201cNecessity reveals strengths and talents; sometimes even the opposite of one\u2019s natural inclination. By nature, I enjoy reading literary writings, and all the more so if they are well-written, in clear language. But what can I do if time does not permit? I do not allow myself that which would bring me pleasure, for I am not for myself, meaning for my own sake\u2014I must be for others. May Hashem, in the merit of the holy forebears of blessed memory, assist me materially and spiritually. . . .\n\n\u201cMy work is a burdensome labor. In addition to my own toil in matters of Torah and avodah\u2014may Hashem help me\u2014I must read a vast number of letters daily. Among them are letters from individuals, written\u2014may Hashem protect us\u2014in blood; in tears of poverty, hardship, pressure, and distress. In the tears of those wavering between life and the reverse\u2014letters that would melt even a heart of stone. And my role is not only reading them, but also responding. This means entering into the writer\u2019s plight, standing in their place, sharing in their sorrow, wrapping myself in their suffering, and at the same time offering comfort and encouragement, to awaken in them emunah and bitachon, hope and berachos.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to put the events of the past few years into writing, and no person can fully describe them. This is already our fourth exile in thirteen years: from Lubavitch to Rostov, from Rostov to Leningrad, from Leningrad to Kostroma (a city of refuge, where I was sent to live for three years), and from Kostroma to Riga. And so, no matter how much I may desire to read and immerse myself, the secondary matters will interfere with my primary concerns. I have no doubt that explanation here is unnecessary, and you understand what I mean to say\u2026\u201d\n\nThe article cuts off the quote here, and then continues with further quotes from the letter in which the Rebbe recounts the fate of his renowned library:\n\n\u201cTo this day [my library] remains in Moscow, for since it was taken by the government, they have refused to return it. Over time, I purchased (with the commitment to pay gradually, over the course of around eight years in fixed monthly installments) the library of the bibliographer Mr. S. Wiener in Petersburg. But I haven\u2019t yet been able to organize the catalog properly, and in any case, it does not compare to my library in Moscow, which was entirely sifrei kodesh. In this Wiener library, there are also secular books, from the left wing.\u201d\n\nThe narrator interrupts again, reporting that the Rebbe expressed his great desire for both new and old books, as well as printed materials such as posters and single-page publications:\n\n\u201cThat is, things printed only on a single sheet, as explained in the Schwager-Frankel catalogue, No. 37 under the title \u2018Single Leaves.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy current situation does not allow me to purchase books. However, I believe that if my friends, wherever they may be, would be willing to dedicate a short time for me in this matter, I would be able to gather a significant number of printed items.\u201d\n\nThe writer doesn\u2019t tell us who the letter was written to, just stating that it was sent to \u201cto one of his Chassidim in Chevron.\u201d But we get a clue from the pseudonym under which the writer signs, \u201cHadani.\u201d Hadani was the pen name of Eliezer Dan Slonim, a member of the famous Slonim family of Chevron, descendants of the Mitteler Rebbe\u2019s daughter Rebbetzin Menucha Rachel Slonim. The son of Rav Yaakov Yosef Slonim, the rov of Chevron at the time, Eliezer Dan was more modern, serving as the manager of the Chevron branch of the Anglo-Palestine Bank and the Chevron correspondent for Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThis identification indicates that the letter may have been written to a member of the Slonim family. Judging from the tone, which appears to be addressing someone who is less of an \u201cinsider\u201d than the senior members of the Slonim family, it seems quite possible that the recipient of the letter was Eliezer Dan himself. We don\u2019t possess any other published letters from the Frierdiker Rebbe to Eliezer Dan, but we do know that just over a year later he was instrumental in obtaining permission for the Frierdiker Rebbe to enter the Me\u2019aras Hamachpelah during his visit to Chevron.\n\nWe also don\u2019t have a date for the letter, but it appears to have been recent, received not long before the article was published. In another letter written to a recipient in Eretz Yisrael during this period, the Frierdiker Rebbe expresses the same interest in receiving posters, periodicals, and books from Eretz Yisrael (dated 16 Iyar 5628, published in Igros Kodesh, vol. 2, pp. 60-61).\n\nTragically, Eliezer Dan Slonim was brutally murdered just a few weeks after the Frierdiker Rebbe\u2019s visit in the terrible massacre of the Jews of Chevron in 1929. The only survivor of his family was his infant son Shlomo. Hashem yikom damam.\n\n*\n\nHere is the Hebrew text of the quotes from the Frierdiker Rebbe\u2019s letter:\n\n\u201c\u05d8\u05e8\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e7\u05ea\u05d9

And he was frustrated.\n\nThis was the year the Civil Rights Act was passed, and while it was a substantial step toward racial equality, people of color still faced hurdles in their daily and professional lives. Though he already operated a service station, Jones felt that to truly own his business, he needed to also own the land it stood on, rather than rent it from someone else.\n\nLater that year, another station became available, and Jones bought it, along with the land it was on. The new station would become Jones Chevron\u2014and it became a cornerstone of the community. Jones would own it for 38 years, until his death.\n\nFuture generations of Jones\u2019 family were inspired by his drive to succeed.

Hill Sports Complex.\n\nThe Monarchs won just three games last season but have restocked their roster with several key recruits and transfers, with Murrell among the most notable.\n\nMurrell had 284 goals and 80 assists at Perryville High School in Perryville, Maryland.\n\n\u201cSarah may be our best player,\u201d Walton said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t play like a first year, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\"And you know, she was just dominant on both sides of the ball. It\u2019s incredible to see how much of a role she plays on defense, on offense and in the transition game.\u201d\n\nMurrell said she and all of her teammates expect to win this season.\n\n\u201cComing in, we knew we had talent here, and then we had transfer talent coming in too,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis team feels like no lacrosse team I\u2019ve ever played for before.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchs were scorching hot in the early going, as Murrell and Culhane tallied goals in the first three minutes and 17 seconds. Lydia Laney, a transfer from Xavier who had an assist on Culhane\u2019s goal, rolled around a defender and drilled a shot into the net just seven minutes and 14 seconds into the game to make it 3-0.\n\nKearston Jackson had an unassisted goal for Longwood early in the second period, but then Alex Kulinski, Murrell, Kayleigh Flanegan and Katie Pfeiler each scored for ODU to make it 7-1 heading into halftime.\n\nLongwood dominated the third quarter and narrowed the margin to 8-5 heading into the fourth period.\n\nMurrell then had an unassisted goal and Culhane scored on an assist from Sydney Taylor to make it 10-5 with 11:02 to go.\n\nLongwood scored again to make it 10-6 with 7:45 left. But then Bowen stood tall, picking up two key assists, including a point-blank shot at 5:45 that she knocked down and covered up.\n\n\u201cI told myself that I had to get this one, I couldn\u2019t allow a goal,\u201d she said. \u201cMy team needs this, we need the momentum swing, and I just got it.\u201d\n\nElla Bowen then scored back-to-back goals and Culhane her third goal with 11 seconds left.\n\nMegan Hopfensperger, a sophomore from Brentwood, Tennessee, had three assists and Tayor, a senior from Brentwood, New Hampshire, added two.\n\nLongwood was 8-10 last season and picked to finish sixth this season in the nine-team Big South, and Walton acknowledges tougher tests lie ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was so important for us to play well tonight, but also to win this game,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to the team about how winning is a habit and confidence is something that needs to be practiced.\n\n\u201cSo, we just want to be able to confidently practice winning habits right now. To start off the season with this win, it just puts us in a good position to get better and better.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchs hit the road for three games before returning home to host Campbell on Saturday, Feb. 22 at noon.

With this new policy, Chevron is in a challenging position. It is in continuous contact with the government to understand its objectives and limitations.\n\nThe license issued to Chevron under the Biden administration in 2022 allows it to remain the only major U.S. oil producer operating in Venezuela despite Washington\u2019s sanctions against president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime.\n\nCVX\u2019s Contribution to Venezuela\n\nDespite the sanctions, Chevron contributes around 20% to Venezuela\u2019s oil output. In 2024, this contribution helped boost Venezuela\u2019s oil exports to a five-year high, bringing the nation closer to its 1 million barrels per day production goal.\n\nWith these contributions in mind, the top Republican officials argue that Chevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela is indirectly supporting Maduro\u2019s government. The officials claim that CVX provides a financial lifeline that enables Maduro to enrich his administration and suppress civil rights.\n\nImpact of Revoked License\n\nWhile some Republicans are calling for the U.S. government to revoke Chevron\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela, the company is trying to make the officials in Washington understand the ramifications of a revoked license. In addition to Chevron\u2019s challenging position, the U.S. refiners will also be impacted badly as they depend on the heavy crude produced in Venezuela.\n\nCVX\u2019s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nSan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companiesthat participates in every aspect related to energy \u2014from oil production to refining and marketing. Currently, CVX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like SM Energy Company SM, Sunoco LP SUN and Gulfport Energy Corporation GPOR. While SM Energy and Sunoco currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Gulfport Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nDenver, CO-based SM Energy Company is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM\u2019s 2024 earnings indicates 15.11% year-over-year growth.\n\nDallas, TX-based Sunoco LP is a master limited partnership that deals with the distribution of motor fuel to roughly 10,000 customers, including independent dealers, commercial customers, convenience stores and distributors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SUN\u2019s 2024 earnings indicates 184.11% year-over-year growth.",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic, along with logistical and regulatory challenges, hindered progress.\n\nProduction Rates to Ramp Up Quickly\n\nChevron CEO Michael Wirth told analysts at the company\u2019s 4Q earnings call on 31 January that TCO \u201cexpects to achieve full production rates of 1 million BOE/D within the next 3 months\u201d based on the additional 260,000 bbl of expanded oil production capacity that the FGP adds to existing plants.\n\nIn April, Chevron commissioned Phase 1 of the two-step expansion, the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), which is designed to optimize the field and processing plants.\n\nUpgraded sour gas-injection technologies to enhance oil recovery lie at the heart of the FGP expansion along with the just commissioned 12-mtpa-capacity, third-generation processing plant, the third and last processing facility included in the expansion plan.\n\nDigital innovations have been integrated into the project including automated process controls, digital twin, real-time data visualization, wireless safety sensors, and electronic work permit systems.\n\nSPE 223452, authored by Tengizchevroil and presented at the 2024 SPE Caspian Technical Conference and Exhibition, spotlighted cutting-edge geographic information system SimOps maps as playing a critical role in optimizing project management.\n\nLatest Upgrades Across the Board\n\nThe FGP and WPMP are separate but complementary projects aimed at extending TCO\u2019s production plateau and keeping existing plants producing at full capacity.\n\nTaken together they represent installed power systems with five Frame 9 gas turbine generators, four large new compression trains with additional pumping capacity, a new centralized control center and enhanced sour-gas handling and reinjection to the field for long-term pressure maintenance, according to TCO.\n\nThe project\u2019s sour-gas-injection technology was already proven during TCO\u2019s 2008 expansion, and the WPMP maintains plant capacity by lowering the flow pressure at the wellhead and then boosting the pressure to the inlet requirements of the processing trains.\n\nDetails on the implementation of both of these key technologies used in the TCO upgrade are found in SPE 223475 which documents experience in resolving well startup challenges in TCO\u2019s high-pressure gathering system before conversion to low pressure, and SPE 203995 highlighting sour-gas injection.\n\nWith the 40-year Tengiz concession due to end in 2033, the investment community is already asking when and if Chevron and its TCO partners might open negotiations. \u201cAs we get through the ramp-up to see the plant and reservoir performance, we'll then be able to really turn our focus to the future,\u201d Wirth said after analysts raised the question at the 4Q earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe've got a long proud history in Kazakhstan and with the TCO partnership, and we certainly would like to extend the concession, but it has to work for everyone,\u201d Wirth said.\n\nWhile the FGP primarily targets increased production at Tengiz, its broader operational scope within TCO also covers the Korolev field. Combined, Tengiz and Korolev hold estimated recoverable crude oil reserves of approximately 7.5 billion bbl and 469 Bcm (approximately 16.6 Tcf) of gas, representing 12% of Kazakhstan\u2019s recoverable gas reserves, according to Chevron\u2019s Kazakh partner KazMunayGas.",

The company\u2019s long-term growth strategy includes a major acquisition of Hess HES, giving it a stake in Guyana\u2019s high-margin offshore fields. If this deal successfully materializes, it could provide a significant boost to Chevron\u2019s future earnings. AI and Power Generation: Chevron is leveraging its expertise in natural gas to supply power to AI-driven data centers, recognizing the soaring energy demand. The company recently formed a partnership in this regard with investment firm Engine No. 1. These facilities will be strategically located in the U.S. Southeast, Midwest, and West, with operations set to commence by late 2027. Unlike ExxonMobil, Chevron is focusing on forming partnerships rather than building and operating plants itself.\n\nChevron Corporation CVX delivered a mixed fourth-quarter performance, leaving investors uncertain about its future trajectory. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.06, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 and falling well below the prior year\u2019s $3.45. However, revenues came in at $52.2 billion, beating expectations and increasing 10.7% year over year. Despite the earnings miss, CVX hiked its quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.71 per share, translating to an attractive yield of around 4.5%. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Following the earnings release, Chevron stock fell 4.5% but is up nearly 6% year to date, outperforming ExxonMobil \u2019s XOM modest 2% gain. With mixed signals from the company\u2019s financials and operations, investors are left wondering \u2014 should they buy, hold, or sell CVX stock?\n\nStory Continues\n\nCVX\u2019s Refining Woes, Earnings Downgrades and Other Negatives\n\nWeak Refining Margins Weigh on Profits: Chevron\u2019s downstream segment reported a $248 million loss in Q4 \u2014 its first refining loss in four years \u2014 compared to a $1.1 billion profit in the prior year. This decline was due to lower refined product margins and higher operating costs in the U.S. The company\u2019s heavy exposure to West Coast refining, particularly in California, puts it at a disadvantage compared to ExxonMobil, whose Gulf Coast operations benefit from stronger refining economics. If this trend persists, it could continue to erode Chevron\u2019s overall profitability.\n\n\n\nFalling Free Cash Flow May Lead to Reduced Buybacks: Chevron\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) fell 46% year-over-year in Q4 to $4.4 billion, significantly trailing the $7.3 billion spent on dividends and share repurchases. With management unlikely to stretch its balance sheet further, buybacks could decline this year. This could dampen investor sentiment, particularly as ExxonMobil maintains aggressive capital returns.\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimate Downgrade Signals Uncertainty: Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chevron\u2019s 2025 earnings has moved lower, reflecting concerns over refining weakness and commodity price volatility. The company remains highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices, and any unexpected downturn in Oil/Energy markets could put further pressure on its earnings outlook.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA Word on Chevron\u2019s Valuation\n\nChevron\u2019s stock has corrected recently, making it appealing to value investors. With respect to forward 12-month Price/Earnings, the company currently trades at a discount relative to its larger rival ExxonMobil. This undervaluation is confirmed by a Zacks Value Score of B.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion: CVX is a Hold for Now\n\nChevron\u2019s Q4 results were a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The company\u2019s strong revenue growth, Permian Basin expansion, and shareholder-friendly dividend policy provide reasons for optimism. However, weak refining margins, a sharp decline in free cash flow, and lower earnings estimates create near-term headwinds. Given these conflicting signals, CVX stock appears fairly valued at current levels, making it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for now. Despite Chevron\u2019s relative undervaluation, investors may want to wait for a clearer outlook on refining performance and the Hess acquisition before making a decisive move.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Supermajor Chevron and investment firm Engine No. 1 formed a partnership to build a new company to develop scalable, reliable power solutions for US-based data centers running on natural gas. The joint development, in conjunction with GE Vernova, aims to establish multi-gigawatt-scale co-located power plants and data centers.\n\nThe first projects, which the companies refer to as \u201cpower foundries,\u201d will use seven GE Vernova 7HA natural gas-fired turbines, with deliveries beginning in late 2026. The projects are expected to serve data centers in the US Southeast, Midwest, and West regions.\n\nThe joint development plans to deliver up to 4 GW, the equivalent of powering up to 3.5 million homes, by 2027 with potential to expand. The company is also advancing site selection and engineering work while engaging with potential customers, Chevron CEO Michael K. Wirth told financial analysts during the company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call on 31 January.\n\nThe projects are expected to be designed with the flexibility to integrate lower-carbon solutions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expected to capture more than 90% of the CO 2 from the turbines, and renewable energy resources.\n\n\u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance,\u201d said Chris James, founder and chief investment officer of Engine No. 1. \u201cBy using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy, and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower. This partnership with Chevron and GE Vernova addresses the biggest energy challenge we face.\u201d\n\nChevron\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of ExxonMobil\u2019s announcement in December of a similar project to deliver gas-fueled electricity to US data centers.\n\nExxonMobil Plans Centralized Power Facility\n\nExxonMobil confirmed its intent to supply dedicated power to data centers, outlining plans in its December 2024 annual strategy document to offer \u201cfully islanded power with no reliance on gas grid infrastructure,\u201d with 90% of CO 2 emissions abated through CCS.\n\nExxonMobil executives, including CEO Darren Woods, later confirmed the project in a press call, mentioning that the company was in talks with potential customers and had already secured land for a 1.5-GW plant.\n\nThe plant could be operational within 5 years and would be about twice the size of the nuclear reactor for which Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to The New York Times.\n\nIf built, it would be ExxonMobil's first power plant not dedicated to supplying its own operations.\n\nThe company\u2019s existing CO 2 pipeline network along the Gulf Coast, Wyoming, and Montana would play a critical role in supporting the CCS component of the project.\n\nChevron To Build Smaller, Customized Power Plants\n\nChevron is taking a different approach, though the end goal and CCS component remain the same. Instead of constructing a single large plant to serve many customers, Chevron plans to build customized, smaller power plants. These plants will be less than a third of the size of ExxonMobil\u2019s centralized facility.\n\nChevron\u2019s experience in building and operating nearly 5 GW of reliable, behind-the-meter power at large projects, such as the Gorgon natural gas project offshore Australia and at its Tengizchevroil operations in Kazakhstan, positions the company to meet the growing demand for data center power. Wirth emphasized that Chevron\u2019s business model focuses on providing \u201chigh reliability at scale\u201d for \u201cpremium customers,\u201d without supplying power to the grid which would not deliver returns competitive with the company\u2019s portfolio.\n\nMeeting the Power Demand of Data Centers\n\nIn a recent note to investors, Goldman Sachs said the combination of renewables and energy storage could meet the lion\u2019s share of AI-fueled increased power demand at data centers, but a baseload top-up, likely either gas or nuclear, will be needed to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cOur conversations with renewable developers indicate that wind and solar could serve roughly 80% of data center power demand if paired with storage, but some sort of baseload generation is needed to meet the 24/7 demand,\u201d said Jim Schneider, digital infrastructure analyst for Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe investment giant believes renewable energy will account for about 40% of new plant capacity built to meet an expected 160% increase in data center power needs by 2030 against 2023 levels.\n\nAccording to Goldman, nuclear is the preferred option to step in as the baseload generation but given both the scarcity of existing unregulated nuclear plants and the difficulty of building a new one, it views natural gas as the more realistic option for most data centers.\n\nThat could create a potential bottleneck for data centers, with many utilities estimating that the wait to receive a large gas turbine could extend to 2029 if one were to enter the queue now, shifting the focus to smaller-scale natural gas peakers.\n\nGoldman concluded that roughly 50% of data center demand will need to be met with new capacity, and that the generation capacity that is added will likely be 40% natural gas combined-cycle gas turbines, 20% natural gas peakers, 25% solar, and 15% wind.\n\nApplying those figures to its demand estimates, Goldman says it implies roughly 47 GWs of incremental generation capacity through 2030.",

The company is the 7th largest integrated oil company worldwide, the 2nd largest in the US, and has been in operation since 1879. Chevron was part of the original Standard Oil Company and is one of the 34 successor companies that were formed when it was broken up. Today, the company brings in roughly $160 billion in annual revenues and is the last remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOriginally called Standard Oil Of California the company grew quickly via mergers and acquisitions. It was hailed as one of the Seven Sisters to dominate the US and global production throughout the mid-20th century and became even bigger in 1985 when it merged with Gulf Oil. The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Back in August, Chevron produced its first oil from a pioneering U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater field under extreme pressures. The field is expected to produce up to 75,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, with the company lining up two more offshore projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron is looking to close the gap between it and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) through the acquisition of Hess Corp. (NYSE:HES). Hess CEO John Hess says he's \"very confident\" that the company's planned $53 billion sale to Chevron will be completed.\n\n\"We're very confident that the merger is going to go through and we're getting prepared for that,\" Hess said at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy, Clean Technologies & Utilities Conference.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "By Harry Minium\n\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2013 The first two seasons in the Sun Belt Conference ended with painful losses for the Old Dominion men\u2019s basketball team.\n\nOn Wednesday night, before a Chartway Arena crowd of 5,474, the Monarchs won a big game, and also gained a measure of revenge.\n\nODU guard Sean Durugordon scored 20 points, had 13 rebounds, and blocked a three-point shot with 48 seconds left that helped blunt a late Texas State rally, as the Monarchs held off the Bobcats, 75-64.\n\nODU (11-13 overall, 7-5 Sun Belt) led by five, 69-64, when Durugordon blocked an attempted three-point shot by Texas State\u2019s Coleton Benson. Just 11 seconds later, R.J. Blakney blocked another three-pointer to again preserve the five-point ODU lead.\n\nTexas State was then forced to foul and Durugordon made four of four shots and Robert Davis Jr. two of two.\n\nDavis finished with 18 points and point guard Jaden Johnson had 14 points and five rebounds. Caelum Swanton-Rodger, the 7-foot transfer from Maryland, had one of his best efforts of the season as he scored 10 points and had nine rebounds.\n\nODU did not shoot well, but outrebounded Texas State, 45-27, and grabbed 23 offensive rebounds, including nine from Durugordon.\n\n\u201cI have not been more proud of our team than I am right now sitting here tonight,\u201d said Mike Jones, the ODU head coach. \u201cI hope I feel like this a lot more this season.\n\n\u201cThat was incredible. Once again, we had a great crowd and great energy. But I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the toughness we showed tonight, the togetherness we showed tonight.\u201d\n\nIt was the third win in the last four games for ODU, which appears to have righted the ship after losing three home games in a row in mid January. And this team is playing far better than the team that lost eight of its first 11 games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing up,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re trusting each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a more connected unit right now. As we grow together and things go wrong and something needs to happen, it\u2019s not like our guys are saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got the fix this,\u2019 because we got five guys on the court that are used to be that guy that fixes it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten much closer, much more on the same page. Our guys are just trusting each other.\u201d\n\nThere are few holdovers at ODU from the last two seasons, but Imo Essien, the point guard from Wylie, Texas, who is sitting out this season with an injury, informed his teammates of ODU\u2019s ill-fated Sun Belt Conference Tournament history the last two seasons.\n\nODU rolled into the 2023 Sun Belt Tournament with a 19-12 record and having won six of its last seven games. But the Monarchs played their poorest game of the year and fell to the Bobcats, 65-36, in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nA year later, the Monarchs led most of the way against Texas State in the first round of the tournament, but beset with foul trouble and hobbled by the flu, ODU fell to the Bobcats in overtime, 92-83.\n\n\u201cI told the guys about those games,\u201d Essien said. \u201cA lot of them knew it anyway.\u201d\n\nThat included Jones, an ODU graduate who watched the loss two years ago on TV while he was coaching at Maryland.\n\n\u201cI rarely got to watch an ODU game from start to finish, but I did for that game,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember Texas State kicking our rear ends.\u201d\n\nODU weathered two long cold streaks, the kind that might have caused the team to cave a few months ago.\n\nAfter taking a 4-0 lead, ODU missed its next 11 shots. The Monarchs trailed most of the first half but Davis made back-to-back three-point shots, and Durogordon a free throw in the final 2:41 and the Monarchs led, 38-35, at the half.\n\nBlakney gave ODU a 50-39 lead with 15:40 left and the Monarchs outscored the Bobcats 10-1 over a seven-minute stretch and led 51-49 with 6:36 left. Two minutes later, Blakney picked off a Texas State pass and dunked the Monarchs to an eight-point lead.\n\nODU has been shorn of depth by injuries and illness as Jones used just three players off his bench.\n\nStephaun Walker, the transfer from Robert Morris who averages 6.3 points and 7.1 rebounds, was in crutches after having surgery earlier this week.\n\nSubstitute forward Dani Pounds is out with an injury, although he is expected to return. Guard Devin Ceaser, who averaged 11.5 points, has missed 12 games and his status is still unclear.\n\n\"We are as banged up as we can possibly be,\" Jones said. \"To be able to get it done tonight, I could not be more proud of our team.\"\n\nODU ventures to Eastern Michigan on Saturday and then Georgia State and Georgia Southern next week before playing its final two home games against Marshall on Thursday, Feb. 20 and Georgia State on Saturday, Feb. 22.",

            "content": "Recently, the New Jersey Appellate Division, in Dorrell v. Woodruff Energy, Inc.,[1] vacated a 2018 judgment against Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cChevron\u201d) that had found Chevron liable for gasoline contamination. More specifically, the Appellate Division found that plaintiff\u2019s expert was not qualified to determine that the subject property was contaminated with gasoline because his methodology was flawed and wholly unsupported by any scientific resource.\n\nBackground\n\nPlaintiff Sandra Dorrell filed a second amended complaint in 2016 in which she claimed that Chevron was liable for private contributions under the New Jersey Compensation and Control Act (the \u201cSpill Act\u201d),[2] for gasoline contamination in the soil and groundwater on property she purchased in 1984.\n\nDuring trial, plaintiff called an expert witness, who the trial court qualified as an expert in subsurface investigations involving hydrocarbon contamination, but found he was not qualified to distinguish one type of petroleum product from another. The expert concluded that the soil and groundwater had been contaminated with petroleum products attributable to Chevron and judgment was entered against Chevron. Chevron appealed the judgment and the case was remanded to the trial court in order to conduct an N.J.R.E. 104 hearing to determine the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony at trial. The Appellate Division specifically focused its remand order on the reliability of the methodology employed by the expert to support his opinion that gasoline was a contaminant found at the property.[3] The Appellate Division noted that the In re Accutane Litigation[4] case had adopted aspects of the Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[5] test, requiring that the proponent apply a scientifically recognized methodology similar to how others in the expert\u2019s field practice the methodology.[6] The trial court conducted a two-day hearing and found that the expert had been properly qualified and had used a reliable methodology as the basis for his opinion concerning causation. Chevron appealed again.\n\nThe Appellate Division\u2019s 2024 Decision\n\nOn appeal, Chevron argued the lower court \u201cmisapprehended [the] remand order and erred by focusing on whether [the expert] was generally qualified to investigate spills, rather than on whether he was qualified to \u2018distinguish between petroleum products based on the chemical constituents in dissolved phase samples.\u2019\u201d[7] Applying an abuse of discretion standard, the Appellate Division reversed. The Appellate Division focused on the reliability of the expert\u2019s methodology. The plaintiff bore the burden of proving that there was gasoline contamination and the Appellate Division found that the record lacked evidence supporting the reliability of the methodology, including the fact that the expert failed to \u201ccite to a single scientific resource, article, journal, publication, test, or study supporting the reliability of that methodology, and he acknowledged he was unaware if there is any known error rate for the methodology he employed.\u201d[8] The Court went on to note that there were several reliable tests and investigative techniques the expert could have used, but he failed to employ any of them.[9] Consequently, the judgment against Chevron was vacated.\n\nThe Appellate Division\u2019s decision reiterates the requirement that an expert must clearly identify the methodology utilized to come to an opinion, including the expert\u2019s ability to identify the scientific sources he or she relied upon. For those litigating complex environmental cases, this serves as an important reminder that failing to establish the reliability of an expert\u2019s methodology could be fatal to your case.\n\n[1] Dorrell v.

Zeldin said he would, and also said he would be open to conversations about favorable policies for developing sustainable aviation fuels as well, Biomass Magazine first reported.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate also voted to confirm Chris Wright, former chairman and CEO of Liberty Energy, to lead the U.S. Department of Energy. Liberty Energy is an oil and gas company based in Colorado, though it did acquire a company in 2023 that delivers compressed natural gas, RNG or hydrogen to remote customers.\n\nWright will be tasked with implementing President Donald Trump\u2019s energy policy, which is focused on boosting oil and gas production. In his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d memo, issued on Jan. 20, Trump included biofuels among the kinds of energy production he\u2019d like to see increase.\n\nThere could also be cuts to programs that have previously supported the biofuels industry with the new administration.\n\nExperts said Wright could pause funding from the Loan Programs Office, which ramped up its investments considerably during the Biden administration. And the Rural Energy for America Program office, which has financed projects like dairy manure digesters, is on a list of programs whose funding was affected by Trump\u2019s attempt to freeze large swathes of federal funding. Judges in Rhode Island and Washington, D.C., have issued temporary restraining orders against the administration to allow funds to continue flowing for now.\n\nDespite the changes in Washington, projects continue to develop throughout the country. Read on for some RNG highlights from January.\n\nCredit pricing as of Feb. 3, 2025 D3 RIN prices: $2.433 Up from $2.420 in 2024 D5 RIN prices: $0.820 Up from $0.770 in 2024 $55 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in Oregon\u2019s Clean Fuels Program $73.82 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Source: EcoEngineers Carbon Market Snapshot, Feb. 3\n\nWM sets 2025 RNG projections\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call on Jan. 30, WM Chief Sustainability Officer Tara Hemmer said the company was planning to commission eight RNG projects in 2025.\n\nThe company commissioned four facilities in the fourth quarter of the last year, and expects RNG production to double from 2024 to 2025, according to its latest earnings report. The company now has seven out of its goal of 20 new RNG facilities built. The company spent $507 million in capital expenditures on its RNG projects last year, and expects to spend about $420 million to $450 million on such projects this year.\n\nWM does have additional landfill sites where it could build new biogas projects, though the company is still evaluating those, Hemmer said on the earnings call.\n\nBerQ RNG secures $110M in Michigan bond financing\n\nPrivate equity-backed BerQ RNG announced the closing of $110 million in Solid Waste Facilities Limited Obligation Revenue Bonds from the Michigan Strategic Fund on Jan. 27. The company said it would use the funds to build four dairy manure-to-RNG projects in Michigan.\n\nBerQ has previously commissioned a dairy project in Western, Michigan, and announced an agreement with Bright Renewables for four projects across Michigan and New York last year.\n\nBerQ operates in Canada and the United States, with offices in Ontario and Pennsylvania. It\u2019s backed by Lotus Infrastructure Partners. Lotus is the investment platform that succeeded Starwood Energy, which first invested in BerQ in 2021.\n\nWaga, University of California collaborate on RNG\n\nWaga Energy will design, build and operate an RNG production facility at the Bena Landfill in Bakersfield, California, through a contract with Kern County. The University of California system plans to purchase the RNG through a 20-year agreement, the company announced.\n\nThis is Waga\u2019s third project in California and 13th in the U.S., the French company reported. It predicts the facility will produce at least 550,000 mmBtus of RNG annually.\n\nBrightmark, Chevron collaboration achieves milestone\n\nA joint venture between Chevron and Brightmark has achieved gas delivery at 10 RNG projects across the Midwest, the entity announced this month. Brightmark RNG Holdings owns and operates 15 RNG projects in the region, according to a release.\n\nThe JV was first announced in October 2020 to build dairy RNG projects.

ExxonMobil reported Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $1.67, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55. However, total revenues dipped more than 1% year over year to $83.4 billion.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s production grew 20% year over year to 4,602 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), driven by high-margin projects in the Permian Basin and Guyana. The company\u2019s upstream segment saw a slight increase, contributing $6.3 billion in adjusted earnings, but refining and chemical divisions took significant hits. XOM was also impacted by asset impairments worth $608 million, including a Nigerian joint venture sale.\n\n\n\nChevron, on the other hand, posted a weaker-than-expected Q4 performance. While net income rose to $3.2 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier, adjusted earnings of $2.06 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19. Revenues climbed 10.7% year over year to $52.2 billion. A key setback was Chevron\u2019s downstream segment, which reported a $248 million loss \u2014 its first refining loss in four years \u2014 due to weak margins on refined products. Upstream earnings were stronger, rising to $4.3 billion, but overall production remained essentially flat at 3,350 MBOE/d.\n\n\n\nDespite ExxonMobil\u2019s stronger performance, both stocks faced downward pressure. ExxonMobil shares dipped more than 2%, while Chevron\u2019s stock fell 4.5%, reflecting broader market concerns over refining margins and oil price volatility.\n\nProduction Growth and Strategic Investments\n\nBoth ExxonMobil and Chevron made significant strides in production, yet their strategies diverged. ExxonMobil\u2019s output rose, with more than 50% of 2024 production stemming from the Permian Basin, Guyana, and LNG. By 2030, it expects over 60% of its total production to come from these high-margin areas.\n\n\n\nChevron\u2019s Permian Basin output grew 14% year over year to a record 992,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) edging closer to its 1 million BOE/d target. However, its total production remained relatively unchanged. The company is prioritizing long-term growth through its $53 billion acquisition of Hess HES, which grants it a stake in Guyana\u2019s lucrative offshore fields. However, a legal dispute with ExxonMobil over Hess\u2019s Guyana holdings could delay or derail the deal, adding uncertainty to Chevron\u2019s growth strategy.\n\nShareholder Returns and Capital Allocation\n\nExxonMobil rewarded investors with record shareholder returns, distributing $36 billion in 2024 through dividends and buybacks. It generated $36.2 billion in free cash flow, enabling these payouts without increasing debt. Chevron also returned a significant $27 billion to its shareholders, but its fourth-quarter 2024 free cash flow of $4.4 billion fell short of the $7.5 billion spent on dividends and buybacks.\n\n\n\nChevron hiked its quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.71 per share, while ExxonMobil has now increased its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years.",

But now, WTI oil prices are hovering between $70 and $75 per barrel -- giving up the bulk of their year-to-date gains.\n\nLet's dive into the key takeaways from ExxonMobil's and Chevron's results and discuss why both high-yield dividend stocks are worth buying in February.\n\n1. Strong results, all things considered\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron have been on a roller coaster over the last five years. The pandemic-induced crash led to steep losses for both companies in 2020. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, followed by an economic rebound, led to higher oil and gas prices. 2021 was a recovery year for both companies. But 2022 saw surging sales, earnings, and free cash flow (FCF).\n\nExxonMobil\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Sales and operating revenue (in billions) $398.68 $334 $339.25 Net income (in billions) $55.74 $36.01 $33.68 Diluted EPS $13.26 $8.89 $7.84 Capital and exploration expenditures (in billions) $22.7 $26.33 $27.55 FCF (in billions) $58.39 $33.45 $34\n\nChevron\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Sales and operating revenue (in billions) $235.72 $196.91 $193.41 Net income (in billions) $35.61 $21.41 $17.75 Diluted EPS $18.28 $11.36 $9.72 Capital expenditures (in billions) $12 $15.8 $16.4 Free cash flow (in billions) $37.6 $19.8 $15\n\nSince then, both companies have ramped up capital expenditures and announced major acquisitions. However, the return to expansion has coincided with lower oil and gas prices. 2024 saw lower sales and earnings for both companies, but context is key.\n\nFocusing on upstream alone, both companies are delivering excellent results thanks to low production costs and technological advancements. The main issue is the downstream business. In 2024, ExxonMobil earned just $4.03 billion in worldwide earnings in its energy products segment compared to $12.14 billion in 2023. Worldwide upstream earnings were higher in 2024 than in 2023 due to the integration of Pioneer Natural Resources and ExxonMobil's expansion offshore Guyana.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron reported a loss in its U.S. downstream business in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the full year, the U.S. downstream segment reported just $531 million in earnings compared to $3.9 billion in 2023. The international downstream segment eked out a $100 million profit in Q4, but had over $1 billion less in profit for the year compared to 2023.\n\nGiven the challenges of lower oil and gas prices and refining margins, ExxonMobil and Chevron had solid years. ExxonMobil, in particular, generated incredibly impressive free cash flow -- a testament to its efficiency improvements.\n\n2. Excellent balance sheets\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron are well positioned to deliver strong earnings in 2025, even at lower oil prices. Seventy-five percent of Chevron's oil investments have a break-even point below $50 per barrel, while ExxonMobil's corporate plan through 2030 is based around $65-per-barrel Brent crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices are over $76.75 per barrel at the time of this writing.\n\nWhat's more, both companies can afford to support long-term growth plans even during cyclical downturns thanks to their strong balance sheets.\n\nExxonMobil finished 2024 with a net debt-to-capital ratio of just 6.8% -- which is calculated by dividing its $41.7 billion in total debt minus $23.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents by total equity of $270.6 billion. Similarly, Chevron finished the year with $24.5 billion in debt, $6.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and a net debt ratio of 10.4%.\n\nGiven their size and the capital-intensive nature of the oil and gas business, both companies have very healthy balance sheets -- giving them flexibility to navigate a period of lower oil and gas prices.\n\n3. Sustainable capital return programs\n\n2024 showcased the impeccable profitability of ExxonMobil and Chevron -- even during mid-cycle conditions. Both companies returned boatloads of capital to shareholders without compromising the health of their balance sheets.\n\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil paid $16.7 billion in dividends and bought back $19.3 billion in stock -- reaffirming plans to spend $20 billion on buybacks per year through at least 2026.\n\nChevron spent $11.8 billion in dividends and $15.2 billion on buybacks. On Friday, it raised its dividend by 5% -- marking the 38th consecutive year Chevron has boosted its payout. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years.\n\nBased on its new dividend payout of $1.71 per share per quarter, Chevron has a forward dividend yield of 4.6% compared to 3.7% for ExxonMobil.\n\nQuality dividend stocks at a good value\n\nSizable yields, track records for annual dividend raises, and strong balance sheets make ExxonMobil and Chevron excellent high-yield dividend stocks for passive income investors to consider buying now. Lower oil and gas prices and a downturn in the refining industry have weighed down both companies. And yet, they still can return plenty of capital to shareholders and invest in long-term growth through higher capital expenditures.\n\nBoth companies sport reasonable valuations. Based on 2024 earnings per share and both stocks' closing prices on Jan. 31, ExxonMobil has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.6 compared to 15.3 for Chevron. That's a compelling value considering trailing earnings were hindered by the factors discussed.\n\nAdd it all up, and ExxonMobil and Chevron are no-brainer buys for investors looking to boost their passive income stream from the two strongest players in the oil patch.",

This protest marked the launching of a local campaign against the oil and gas company by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) \u2013 North Texas Chapter.\n\nSpeakers highlighted the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields off the coast of occupied Palestine, which are used to provide energy to Israeli military and prison facilities. They also called out the theft of indigenous land and resources around the world and Chevron\u2019s central role in the global climate catastrophe.\n\nDuring a speech, Sean Byrne of DSA North Texas called on participants to boycott Chevron gas, stating that Israel \u201cis a laboratory for how the nations of the imperialist world will deal with the waves of human beings displaced by the very climate catastrophe that they themselves have sown, with corporations like Chevron being among the worst culprits of this capitalism-driven environmental and social crisis.\u201d Byrne condemned comments by Chevron CEO Mike Wirth during a shareholder call the previous Friday, where he called for peace while simultaneously uplifting energy extraction projects that have helped enable the U.S.-backed Israeli genocide in Gaza.\n\nA member of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Dallas-Fort Worth, William Josef, called out the \u201cenergy apartheid\u201d practices of the Israel Electric Corporation, which bans many Palestinians from accessing the electrical grid and charges higher prices for electrical services to Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank than to the illegal Israeli settlements nearby.\n\nSpeaking in solidarity with the local campaign launch, Jumana Saadeh of the Dallas-Fort Worth Anti-War Committee (DAWC) and Code Pink Dallas said, \u201cToday, we say \u2018no\u2019 and stand against one of the many companies supporting and aiding in the oppression and genocide of the Palestinian people. Chevron has supplied and continues to supply energy and millions of dollars of tax revenue to a genocidal, apartheid racist state.\u201d\n\nDuring the protest, hundreds of cars passed by with many honking and waving in support. Simultaneously, many members of the organizations present, including the DFW Anti-War Committee, Jewish Voice for Peace, Code Pink, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation were assisting with a large protest in downtown Dallas against the Trump administration\u2019s attacks against immigrants.\n\n#PlanoTX #TX #AntiWarMovement #Palestine #Chevron #DSA #DFWAWC #JVP #CodePink",

More than a dozen cars loudly decorated drove ten miles through Mountain View and Cupertino in a noisy and colorful caravan, stopping to protest at corporate-owned Chevron stations.\n\n\n\nTheir display of protest included Palestinian flags, signs, banners and keffiyeh adorned car hoods. At each station protesters passed out flyers and talked with customers fueling up for gas to let them know of Chevron\u2019s complicity in Palestinian energy apartheid.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is a major economic partner of the Israeli government and fuels Israeli apartheid and war crimes,\u201d said organizer Bob Jung of Vigil4Gaza, a community led group that holds weekly demonstrations in Palo Alto. \u201cWhile a fragile truce has brought a welcome pause to the killing and destruction in Gaza, Israel is unrelenting in its occupation and apartheid. Just as in the case of South Africa, international boycotts will be an important tool to bring justice for Palestinians.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe demonstration concluded with a rally at Cupertino Memorial Park. The Raging Grannies led a politically charged singalong and rousing chants. Speakers highlighted Chevron's complicity with the still ongoing genocide. Dr. Yusra Hussain of Doctors Against Genocide and Donna Wallach of San Jose Against War spoke.

The ARTIC SS C helps producers achieve sustainability goals by dramatically reducing material waste and operational costs. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nTAUNTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Harpak-ULMA, a leading provider of smart, connected packaging solutions, introduces the ARTIC SS Chevron, an advanced horizontal flow wrap machine designed specifically for medical and pharmaceutical packaging applications. This innovative system minimizes film usage without compromising sterility or easy-open features to redefine packaging efficiency. By dramatically reducing material waste, the ARTIC SS Chevron helps producers achieve sustainability goals while lowering operational costs.\n\nUnlike traditional thermoforming solutions that require two films, the ARTIC SS Chevron uses a single roll of film, folded to create a secure, aseptic seal. This design eliminates the need for premade bags, reducing costs and giving producers greater control over their packaging process. The solution is well-suited for low-height medical devices such as bandages, gel pads, or wound care products.\n\nThe ARTIC SS Chevron eliminates the need for dual films, simplifying the overall packaging process while enabling quick and easy format or appearance changes to enhance operational versatility. The machine\u2019s quick changeover capability, achieved with a simple wheel adjustment, drastically reduces downtime and boosts productivity to offer a distinct advantage over similar solutions. Its single-film design reduces required materials inventory and associated costs. More importantly, in medical applications, where material validation is costly and time-consuming, the ARTIC SS Chevron eliminates the need to validate a second film.\n\nSeal options include Chevron, Sine Wave, and Straight-pack styles. The ARTIC SS Chevron employs integrated Tyvek\u00ae webbing instead of an entire sheet, providing a cost-effective, environmentally friendly sterilization solution. Tyvek\u00ae allows for common sterilization methods such as ETO or Gamma Radiation, while maintaining barrier properties. The package's offset edge design ensures easy separation for quick, aseptic access \u2014 a critical requirement in medical environments.\n\n\"Right-sized packaging\" is a key focus in today\u2019s medical packaging market, emphasizes Nick Kirichkow, Product Manager at ULMA Packaging. \u201cWhen people think of sustainability, they usually focus on \u2018recycling\u2019 \u2013 but that\u2019s just part of the story. Reducing waste throughout the production process by using as little material as possible \u2013 including essentially right-sizing the package design - can dramatically impact a producer\u2019s ability to achieve sustainability goals.\u201d\n\nThe ARTIC SS Chevron is a game-changer in a market historically reliant on preformed packages and high-changeover machines. By forming packs in-house with less material and lower cost, producers can improve control of their processes while reducing validation hurdles.\n\nThe ARTIC SS Chevron, along with ULMA\u2019s TFS 300 with vision inspection capabilities, will be showcased at the Sustainable Manufacturing Expo 2025 in Anaheim from February 4 to 6, 2025. Visit booth 901 to experience the innovative ARTIC SS Chevron in action and see its advanced use of single film with seamless Tyvek strip welding, perforation for gas sterilization, and its smart-connected design.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.harpak-ulma.com/medical-packaging-machines/ or call (508) 884-2500.

            "content": "Last year was one for the record books for Chevron (CVX 0.45%). The energy giant increased its global production by 7% and U.S. output by 19% to record levels. The company also returned a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe oil company is in an excellent position to build on last year's record performance in 2025. Here's a look at what fueled Chevron's record results last year and why this year could be another one for the record books.\n\nA well-oiled machine\n\nChevron produced record volumes last year. The oil company benefited from a full year of its acquisition of PDC Energy, which closed in August 2023, as well as from the startup of several key projects in the Gulf of Mexico and the continued development of its position in the Permian Basin, where production jumped 18%.\n\nThat growing production enabled Chevron to produce strong free cash flow amid weaker commodity prices. The company's cash flow from operations totaled $31.5 billion, while its free cash flow was $15 billion after accounting for about $16.4 billion in capital expenditures to maintain and grow its global asset base.\n\nChevron returned all its free cash flow and then some to shareholders last year. Total shareholder returns hit a record $27 billion as Chevron paid $11.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $15.2 billion in shares. Chevron covered the difference with its strong balance sheet. It ended the year with nearly $6.7 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 10.4%. That's well below its 20% to 25% target range. The company closed $7.7 billion in asset sales last year, including the $6.5 billion sale of its Canadian assets, to further strengthen its balance sheet.\n\nSet up to deliver another record year\n\nChevron has a lot of momentum heading into 2025. The company completed several projects in the Gulf of Mexico last year, including its industry-first high-pressure Anchor project in August, which will continue contributing to its production and cash flow growth this year. Meanwhile, it has completed two more major projects already this year. It started production at its Whale facility in the Gulf of Mexico and the future growth project in Kazakhstan last month. Add in the continued growth of its U.S. onshore business, and Chevron's production appears poised to set another record.\n\nThe company is also working to cut its expenses by $2 billion to $3 billion by the end of next year. In addition, Chevron expects to reduce capital spending this year to a range of $14.5 billion-$15.5 billion.\n\nThese catalysts have the company on track to produce even more free cash flow this year. CEO Michael Wirth sees the company adding $6 billion to $8 billion to its annual free cash flow by 2026 as its growth catalysts and cost-saving initiatives take hold.\n\nOn top of all that, the company is still working to close its proposed acquisition of Hess. The company initially expected that the deal, which it signed in October 2023, would be accretive to its cash flow per share this year. It's currently waiting for an arbitration hearing on the deal, which should occur in May. If Chevron wins, it expects to close the acquisition quickly.\n\nChevron's growing free cash flow positions it to continue returning more money to its investors. The company has already raised its dividend by 5% for 2025, continuing its more than three-decades-long streak of annual dividend increases. Meanwhile, the company aims to repurchase $10 billion to $20 billion of shares each year. Given its growing free cash flow and healthy balance sheet, it could continue to buy back shares in the upper half of that range.\n\nA cash-gushing and returning machine\n\nChevron delivered record production and cash returns last year, fueled by its high-return investment strategy and strong balance sheet. The company expects to grow its free cash flow this year, putting it in a strong position to return a lot of money to shareholders. This strategy should give the oil stock the fuel to grow shareholder value over the long term. That makes it a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those seeking income, given its 4.4%-yielding dividend.",

            "content": "The global energy sector is in transition, with major oil companies under pressure to cut emissions while staying profitable. Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil\u2014three of the world\u2019s biggest energy giants\u2014are taking different paths to navigate this shift. Their latest earnings reveal how each company is balancing investments in oil, gas, and low-carbon initiatives. While some struggle with declining profits, others are outperforming expectations. Beyond financials, their sustainability goals and net-zero targets set them apart. But are these commitments keeping pace with financial performance? Let\u2019s dive into their latest financial results and see which energy giant leads the charge toward a greener future.\n\nWho\u2019s Winning the Oil Game? A Financial Face-Off\n\nShell: Struggling Profits, Big Promises\n\nShell reported Q4 2024 earnings of $1.20 per ADS (American Depository Share), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 and significantly lower than $2.22 per ADS in Q4 2023. The company\u2019s revenue dropped to $66.8 billion from $80.1 billion, falling short of expectations by 16.6%. The decline was driven by weaker realized prices, reduced trading margins, and lower LNG sales.\n\nShell repurchased $3.6 billion in shares and increased its dividend by 5%, with plans for another $3.5 billion in repurchases in Q1 2025. Here is the oil giant\u2019s income per segment:\n\nUpstream : Profit fell to $1.7 billion from $3.1 billion, missing expectations due to lower oil and gas prices. Liquids prices fell 11%, while natural gas declined 7%.\n\nChemicals & Products : Reported a $229 million loss, reversing a $29 million profit from the previous year, due to lower margins and unfavorable tax movements.\n\nIntegrated Gas : Adjusted income dropped to $2.2 billion from $4 billion, missing the expected $2.8 billion due to a 14.3% drop in LNG sales.\n\nMarketing : Income rose to $839 million from $794 million, but missed expectations of $885 million.\n\nRenewables & Energy Solutions : Recorded a $311 million loss, down from a $173 million profit a year earlier, due to rising costs and adverse tax effects.\n\nChevron: A Mixed Bag of Losses and Growth\n\nChevron\u2019s Q4 earnings fell below Wall Street expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $2.06 versus the estimated $2.11. This led to a 4% drop in its stock price. The company\u2019s downstream segment posted a $248 million loss, compared to a $1.15 billion profit in Q4 2023. This is because refining margins weakened amid declining fuel demand in the U.S. and China.\n\nOil & Gas Production : Profits rose to $4.3 billion from $1.59 billion a year ago, despite a flat overall output of 3.35 million boepd (Barrels of oil equivalent per day). Permian Basin production grew 14% to a record 992,000 boepd.\n\nRefining : Weak jet fuel demand contributed to the company\u2019s first refining loss since 2020.\n\nChevron expects global output to grow 6-8% in 2025 and 3-6% in 2026. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 5% and reaffirmed share buyback plans of $10-$20 billion annually.\n\nExxon: Defying Expectations Amid Industry Headwinds\n\nExxon announced Q4 2024 earnings of $7.6 billion, or $1.72 per share, exceeding analyst estimates of $1.56. Despite lower oil prices, higher production helped offset the weaker refining margins of this big oil company.\n\nOil & Gas Production : Adjusted earnings rose to $6.28 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier. Production increased to 4.6 million boepd, driven by low production costs in the Permian Basin and Guyana projects.\n\nRefining : Earnings from gasoline and diesel production dropped sharply to $323 million from $3.2 billion a year earlier due to increased refinery capacity in Asia.\n\nExxon reported $33.7 billion in earnings for 2024, down from $38.57 billion in 2023, but highlighted strong operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe three energy giants all faced challenges in Q4 2024, with weaker refining margins and lower oil prices impacting profitability. However, Exxon outperformed expectations, while Chevron and Shell struggled with underwhelming results. All three companies remain focused on capital discipline, shareholder returns, and production efficiency moving forward.\n\nThe Green Pivot: Are Big Oil\u2019s Net Zero Pledges Enough?\n\nShell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil are charting distinct paths toward sustainability as the energy landscape evolves. Their climate commitments, emissions targets, and investment in renewables illustrate their vision for a lower-carbon future.\n\nEach of the energy giants has its own roadmap to net-zero emissions, with varying approaches and strategies. To have a clearer picture of how much carbon pollution each of them emitted in 2023, look at the image below.\n\nWhile some are making bolder moves in renewables, others remain focused on carbon capture and efficiency improvements. Understanding Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil\u2019s strategies provides insight into the future of the oil and gas industry.\n\nShell\u2019s Carbon Commitment: Big Talk or Real Action?\n\nShell aims to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 as part of its Powering Progress strategy. This commitment includes eliminating operational emissions and reducing the emissions from the energy products it sells.\n\nThe company has set several targets to achieve this goal:\n\n50% absolute emissions reduction by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2) compared to 2016 levels.\n\nEliminate routine flaring of natural gas by 2025 to curb carbon emissions.\n\nReduce methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and reach near-zero methane emissions by 2030.\n\n15-20% reduction in customer emissions from oil products by 2030 (Scope 3, Category 11, 2021 baseline).\n\nProgress Achieved\n\nBy the end of 2023, Shell had cut more than 60% of its emissions goal for 2030. The company\u2019s methane emissions intensity was 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas.\n\nShell tracks its emissions reductions through Net Carbon Intensity (NCI), which measures emissions per unit of energy sold. Key milestones include:\n\n6-8% reduction achieved in 2023 (from 2016 levels)\n\n9-12% reduction target for 2024\n\n100% reduction goal by 2050\n\nShell\u2019s strategy for 2030 balances energy security with sustainability. The company plans to reduce emissions by evolving its product mix and shifting towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, hydrogen, and renewables.\n\nShell has also invested heavily in carbon offset initiatives to negate its GHG emissions. However, under CEO Wael Sawan\u2019s leadership, the oil giant is reducing its focus on nature-based projects and is considering engineered carbon removals instead.\n\nToday, 70% of Shell\u2019s cash flow comes from Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, while 75% of its emissions come from Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions. Additionally, Shell has invested heavily in offshore wind projects, with plans to expand its renewable energy portfolio across multiple continents.\n\nChevron\u2019s Climate Play: Real Solutions or Greenwashing?\n\nChevron is investing $8 billion in lower-carbon energy projects from 2021-2028, including renewable fuels, carbon capture, hydrogen, and offsets. An additional $2 billion is allocated to reducing emissions within its operations.\n\nThe company is also developing new partnerships with tech firms to enhance energy efficiency and reduce its environmental impact.\n\nChevron targets net-zero upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050 but acknowledges that achieving this goal depends on technological advances, regulatory support, and viable carbon capture and offset mechanisms.\n\n2028 Carbon Intensity Targets\n\nChevron\u2019s plans to lower carbon intensity include:\n\n71 g CO\u2082e/MJ portfolio carbon intensity (Scope 1, 2, and 3)\n\n24 kg CO\u2082e/boe oil carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n24 kg CO\u2082e/boe gas carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n36 kg CO\u2082e/boe refining carbon intensity (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nGHG Reduction Initiatives\n\nChevron uses the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to optimize carbon reduction. The company has identified 150+ GHG abatement projects, with over $600 million in investments planned for 2024.\n\nBetween 2021-2028, Chevron expects $2 billion in GHG reduction investments, targeting 4 million metric tons (mt) of annual emissions reductions. Here are the company\u2019s other sustainability plans and strategies to achieve its ambitious 2050 net zero goal.\n\nMethane and Renewable Energy Expansion\n\nMethane emissions goal of 2.0 kg CO\u2082e/boe by 2028\n\nAdvanced methane detection programs, including satellite monitoring\n\nGrowing renewable fuels capacity to 100 mbd by 2030, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel\n\nSignificant CCUS investments, including Bayou Bend (Texas) and Gorgon (Australia)\n\nExpanding hydrogen production to 150 mtpa by 2030\n\nDeveloping advanced geothermal energy projects to enhance clean energy production\n\nSEE MORE: Chevron Reports Lower Q2 Earnings! What About Its Emissions?\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Bold Bet on Decarbonization\n\nExxonMobil has cut 23% of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds emissions since 2016. In 2023, its GHG emissions stood at 111 MMTCO\u2082e, marking a 2 MMT reduction from the previous year. The company is also exploring new ways to enhance energy efficiency across its global operations.\n\nExxonMobil aims for a 20% absolute reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2016 levels. The company aligns its emissions reductions with the Paris Agreement while emphasizing intensity-based reductions.\n\nBeyond burning down emissions in its own operations, Exxon is also helping other industries decarbonize. Its Low Carbon Solutions business focuses on hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry, power, and transportation. The oil giant seeks to lead in profitable, large-scale emission reduction solutions, with the following key strategies.\n\nKey Sustainability Actions\n\nInvesting in carbon capture , biofuels, and hydrogen\n\nAdvancing methane management with innovative detection technologies\n\nDeploying CCUS projects, including the world\u2019s largest CCUS facility at LaBarge, Wyoming\n\nDeveloping low-carbon solutions for hard-to-abate industries\n\nLaunching a $17 billion investment plan in lower-carbon solutions through 2027\n\nExploring direct air capture (DAC) technologies to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere\n\nREAD MORE: ExxonMobil\u2019s First-of-its-Kind Carbon Capture Solution for the U.S. Data Centers\n\nBig Oil\u2019s Race Against Time\n\nShell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil are taking different approaches to sustainability and emissions reduction. While Shell focuses on reducing absolute emissions and net carbon intensity, Chevron prioritizes carbon intensity reduction and methane management. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, is expanding CCUS and methane detection efforts to lower emissions.\n\nAs global climate policies tighten, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other energy companies should accelerate their transition strategies to meet net-zero targets.",

            "content": "Fueling domestic data centers with natural gas got a big boost in the last few days after Chevron Corp. agreed to help advance the artificial intelligence (AI) warehouses in the Midwest, Southeast and the West.\n\nIn partnership with investor Engine No. 1 and natural gas turbine manufacturer GE Vernova Inc., Chevron plans to build co-located power plants to serve data centers.\n\nInitially, the partners want to deliver up to 4 GW, with in-service for the first \u201cpower foundry\u201d targeting the end of 2027.\n\n[Charting the course of global markets: Did you know NGI provides daily data of Netback Prices, Arbitrage Curves, U.S. LNG Export Flow Data, Shipping Costs, Vessel Rate Curves (West of Suez) and more? Check out the LNG+ Data Suite now.]\n\n\u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance,\u201d Engine No. 1 founder Chris James said. \u201cBy using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower.\u201d\n\nThe power generation would not flow when starting up through the existing transmission grid, the partners noted. That would reduce the \u201crisk of increasing electricity prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe first foundry would use seven GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines, secured using a \u201cslot reservation agreement on an accelerated timeline.\u201d\n\nIntegrating \u2018Low Carbon Solutions\u2019\n\nThe foundries would have the \u201cflexibility to integrate lower carbon solutions, such as carbon capture and storage,\u201d enabling carbon dioxide to be sequestered from the turbines. Renewable energy resources also may be used.\n\nThe plans \u201cdirectly address the need for affordable, reliable energy to meet the significant demand for electricity to power U.S. data centers, enabling current and future generations of AI to be developed in the U.S.\u201d the partners said.\n\nChevron CEO Mike Wirth credited \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s vision for a new American golden age.\u201d The president, who declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d following his inauguration earlier in January, \u201cgives us the confidence to invest in projects that will create American jobs and strengthen our national security.\u201d\n\nOver time, the foundry model could be used \u201cto sell surplus power to the U.S. power grid, through future interconnects, supporting broader energy demands while keeping costs low,\u201d the companies noted.\n\nChevron\u2019s Quarterlies\n\nChevron also issued its fourth quarter results on Friday.\n\nU.S. oil and gas production increased 19% year/year in the fourth quarter to 1.65 million boe/d net. For the year, output averaged 1.60 million boe/d from 1.35 million boe/d in 2023.\n\nNet domestic natural gas production rose in the final three months of 2024 to 2.74 Bcf/d from 2.60 Bcf/d. For 2024, U.S. net natural gas production improved year/year to 2.68 Bcf/d from 2.11 Bcf/d.\n\nChevron fetched an average domestic natural gas price of $1.62/Mcf in the fourth quarter, flat year/year. In 2024, the company\u2019s U.S. gas prices averaged $1.04, compared with $1.67 in 2023.\n\nInternational gas and oil production averaged 1.7 million boe/d net in 4Q2024, compared with 1.8 million boe/d net in 4Q2023. Annual output in 2024 was nearly flat, averaging 1.7 million boe/d.\n\nIn the international business, Chevron\u2019s natural gas volumes were nearly flat in 4Q2024 at 5.44 Bcf/d net.

So do demand forecasts for the natural gas that will power those energy-hungry data centers.\n\nGas demand could increase by 10 Bcf/d by 2030 due to AI demand, a 28% increase over the 35 Bcf/d currently consumed for U.S. electricity generation, according to Wells Fargo.\n\nAppalachian gas giant EQT Corp. has told investors could result in as much as 18 Bcf/d in incremental demand by the end of the decade.\n\nEveryone along the energy value chain is excited about the chatter, from gas producers to gas transporters to the power plant operators themselves.\n\nOn Jan. 28, Chevron announced a new partnership to develop \u201cscalable, reliable power solutions\u201d for U.S.-based data centers running on natural gas. The partnership includes Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova.\n\nChevron has secured seven of GE Vernova\u2019s largest 7HA gas-fired turbines under a slot reservation agreement on an accelerated timeline.\n\nTurbine deliveries are expected to begin in late 2026, Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said during the company\u2019s Jan. 31 earnings call. In the meantime, Chevron continues to advance site selection and engineering work while engaging with technology customers.\n\nThe \u201cpower foundry\u201d projects will serve data centers in the U.S. Southeast, Midwest and West regions.\n\nWirth reminded analysts that Chevron already operates around 5 gigawatts (GW) of power generation for the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, the Tengiz Field Future Growth Project (FGP) in Kazakhstan and its various refinery assets.\n\n\u201cWe know how to build and operate large-scale power generation and integrate it to a core customer,\u201d Wirth said.\n\nChevron also has a \u201cvery large natural gas position\u201d in the U.S. to leverage for these projects, he said.\n\nLike its growing LNG business, Chevron sees supplying gas-fired power to data center customers as another profitable outlet for its bountiful gas reserves.\n\nRELATED\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Lake Charles LNG Closer to FID with Chevron Deal\n\nChevron power\n\nChevron produced over 2.7 Bcf/d from its U.S. upstream assets in the fourth quarter; U.S. liquids output averaged nearly 1.2 MMbbl/d.\n\nChevron\u2019s power foundries will be constructed off the broader grid, or \u201cbehind the meter,\u201d and won\u2019t further strain the nation\u2019s already beleaguered power grid infrastructure, Wirth said.\n\nHe said the behind-the-meter projects also shouldn\u2019t raise electricity costs for the average ratepaying consumer, like ratepayers are seeing in other parts of the country.\n\nA PJM Interconnection capacity auction last summer hit record highs, driven by rapidly increasing power demand and coal plant retirements. PJM is the grid operator for all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington D.C.\n\nChevron has no intention of being a merchant power player and selling electricity to the grid, Wirth said. Instead, the company will serve as backstop power supply for \u201cpremium customers.\u201d\n\nThe initial partnership with Engine No. 1 aims to deliver up to 4 GW of generation by the end of 2027.\n\nRELATED\n\nBYOP (Bring Your Own Power): The Great AI Race for Electrons\n\nExxon\u2019s CCUS advantage\n\nExxon Mobil also has a massive U.S. natural gas footprint, including growing volumes from its Permian Basin assets.\n\nU.S. gas production averaged about 3.26 Bcf/d in the fourth quarter, up from 3.14 Bcf/d the quarter before, Exxon said Jan. 31. U.S. liquids output averaged 1.47 MMbbl/d, up from 1.44 MMbbl/d in the third quarter.\n\nExxon also has a fully-integrated carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) arm to reduce emissions associated with the gas-to-power process\u2014a key advantage for the company in the tech companies\u2019 jockeying race for cleaner electrons.\n\nExxon owns the nation\u2019s largest carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) transport and storage network, picked up through a $4.9 billion acquisition of CCUS and E&P company Denbury Inc. in 2023.\n\nDecarbonization through CCUS is \u201cthe nexus\u201d of Exxon\u2019s data-center power strategy, Woods said.\n\nLike Chevron, Exxon\u2019s not interested in getting into the power utility business. Utility returns for power generation would not compete for capital within the supermajor\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\u201cBut leveraging the end-to-end system that we have for capturing, transporting and storing CO 2 is a huge advantage and brings a lot of value for hyperscalers who are looking to have decarbonized power and manage their emissions,\u201d Woods said.\n\nConversations with tech customers continue. Sites for projects have been selected.\n\nExxon outlined some high-level plans in its corporate update in December: It would construct a natural gas-fired plant capable of generating more than 1.5 GW of power.\n\nThe CCUS buildout would remove over 90% of the associated CO 2 emissions and transport them for permanent sequestration underground.\n\nAnd the projects would sit behind the meter, independent of utility timelines and concerns from ratepayers.\n\nDepending on how negotiations proceed, Exxon could have a site powered up and running by 2028 and fully decarbonized by 2029, Woods said.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a rough order or how to think about that [timeline], but we\u2019re well into the development phase,\u201d he said.\n\nRELATED\n\nExxon\u2019s Custom, Lightweight Proppant Boosts Permian EURs by 15%",

            "content": "Chevron (CVX 0.45%) holds a treasure trove of low-cost natural gas resources across the U.S. This lower-carbon fuel could play a significant role in powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. That technology requires a tremendous amount of electricity to power the specialized chips needed to run AI applications in data centers.\n\nThe energy company is taking a major step to capitalize on this opportunity. It's partnering with a leading investment firm (Engine No. 1) and GE Vernova (GEV 1.23%) to provide natural gas power solutions to U.S. data centers.\n\nA gas giant\n\nChevron is a major U.S. natural gas producer. The energy giant produced nearly 2.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day (Bcf/d) during the third quarter of last year. That's a significant increase from 2023's level when its average output through the first nine months was less than 2 Bcf/d. While it trails industry leader Expand Energy's more than 6.1 Bcf/d in production, Chevron is one of the top gas producers in the country.\n\nOne factor fueling the recent surge in Chevron's gas output was its 2023 acquisition of PDC Energy. That deal bulked up Chevron's position in the gas-rich DJ Basin of Colorado. Chevron has also been growing its associated gas output in places like the Permian Basin and the Gulf of America.\n\nChevron wants to get the most out of its vast natural gas resources. That's leading the energy giant to seek opportunities to supply gas to help power energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nPowering data centers\n\nChevron is teaming up with investment firm Engine No. 1 to build a new company to develop scalable, reliable natural gas power solutions for U.S. data centers. They're seeking to capitalize on the Trump administration's desire to leverage the country's abundant energy resources to turn the U.S. into an AI powerhouse. The administration recently unveiled a plan by several private sector companies to invest up to $500 billion into AI infrastructure, including building 20 data centers. Natural gas could play a key role in supporting these and other data centers because these massive facilities will consume a lot of power.\n\nEngine No. 1 and Chevron are also partnering with GE Vernova in their joint development initiative. They aim to establish the first multigigawatt-scale, co-located power plant and data center during President Trump's second term in office. The companies aim to develop \"power foundries\" built on U.S.-made GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines. They expect to build these projects next to data centers across the U.S. Southeast, Midwest, and West regions. The power produced by these gas turbines will initially flow directly into the data centers, not the power grid, which reduces the risk of rising power prices for the data center customers.\n\nThe partners intend to initially deliver up to four gigawatts of power for AI data centers. For perspective, that's enough to provide for the energy needs of 3 million to 3.5 million U.S. homes for a year. They initially plan to develop this capacity by the end of 2027, with the potential to expand the partnership in the future. They plan to design these projects with the flexibility to integrate lower-carbon solutions to reduce their carbon footprint, like carbon capture and storage and renewable energy.\n\nTheir strategy aims to create a scalable solution that the partners can deploy to help support the rapid growth in digital technology without burdening the country's existing power grid. In the future, this innovative model could eventually supply electricity to the U.S. power grid to support the energy needs of the broader economy while keeping power costs low.\n\nA potential accelerant\n\nChevron is leveraging its natural gas resources and expertise to help solve a key issue for data centers by providing them with more low-cost power. The company's partnership with Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova could enable the country to tap into its vast energy resources to unleash the power of AI. It could help accelerate the energy giant's growth in the coming years, making it an interesting partnership to monitor.",

The action was among multiple Bay Area weekend actions coordinated with the national campaign protesting Chevron's profits from genocide, apartheid and the climate crisis.In spite of the rain, organized by the, about thirty protesters held huge signs and banners and chanted and sang along the sidewalks at 55th Street and Telegraph.Chevron supplies fuel and gives millions of dollars in taxes to Israel as it enacts genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza\u2013\u2013violence that is continuing despite the recent ceasefire.The activists held aloft fifteen foot high banners designed by street muralist David Solnit. A larger-than-life grim reaper puppet was there to symbolize the world-wide human rights violations and climate desecration for which Chevron is responsible.This gas station is one of only a few in the area owned directly by Chevron.Chevron co-owns and operates two Israeli-claimed fossil gas fields in the Mediterranean\u2013\u2013Tamar and Leviathan\u2013\u2013and is currently the largest multinational player in Israel\u2019s fossil gas industry. In 2022 alone, Chevron\u2019s gas sale revenues from Tamar and Leviathan totaled $1.5 billion. That same year Chevron paid $462 million USD in taxes and royalties to Israel for its extraction activities\u2013\u2013funds that help bankroll Israel\u2019s systems of apartheid and illegal exploitation of Palestinian land and resources.Chevron is also failing to align with international commitments to phase out fossil fuels and limit global temperature rise. Among all investor-owned companies, Chevron has produced the most cumulative climate pollution in history. If the company were held partially accountable for the climate loss and damage caused by its pollution, it would owe $900 billion.Since the launch of the BDS Movement\u2019s global Boycott Chevron campaign, tens of thousands have taken the pledge to boycott Chevron gas stations, dozens of groups around the world have led pickets at Chevron, Caltex, and Texaco gas stations, and at least 3 cities have divested from Chevron.See all high resolution photos here",

The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are going to need to get some depth at the running back position as they struggled to find consistency in the backfield after letting running back Josh Jacobs leave as a free agent last season. This offseason, both Ameer Abdullah and Alexander Mattison are unrestricted free agents.\n\nAd\n\nWill TreVeyon Henderson be available for the Las Vegas Raiders?\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are one of a few teams that are in need of some additional production in their backfield. They finished last in the NFL with only 79.8 rushing yards per game and need to get a massive addition to help boost that number up.\n\nThere are some quality running backs in this draft class, such as Ashton Jeanty, Cam Skattebo, Omarion Hampton and Jordan James, to name a few. With teams not wanting to give the running back position a lot of money over the last few seasons, it will be difficult to see many teams consider the running back worth first-round money and with the depth at the position, he should be available by the time the Las Vegas Raiders are on the clock.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "PROFITS for Exxon Mobil and Chevron were slammed by slumping fuel margins as the prospect of US tariffs on two major oil suppliers threatens to make the refining business even worse.\n\nExxon posted a 67 per cent plunge in 2024 refining profits on Friday (Jan 31), and Chevron disclosed an even larger decline of 72 per cent. The biggest North American oil companies succumbed to the same forces slashing results for fuel producers around the world \u2013 a flood of new output amid stagnating demand.\n\nThose lacklustre performances in a key business line come as US President Donald Trump ramps up threats to lay steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both of which are crucial sources of crude for US-based refineries. Such levies \u2013 which Trump said may take effect as soon as the weekend \u2013 would increase the cost of making everything from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel.\n\nThe president vowed on Thursday to follow through on long-promised 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products, though he declined to say whether oil would be included in the list. His self-imposed effective date is Feb 1.\n\nRefineries in the US Midwest depend on Canadian oil for as much as three-fourths of their crude inputs. Meanwhile, Mexican supplies have long been a staple of Gulf Coast fuel-making plants designed to maximise output from so-called heavy crude. As the cost of buying oil from those two nations rises, it could create a knock-on effect for other types of crude as refiners clamour to secure replacement barrels with similar characteristics.\n\nChevron\u2019s domestic refineries tend to hug coastal areas, which means they have easier access to crude cargoes from overseas compared with inland competitors, said chief executive officer Mike Wirth.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\n\u201cWe tend to be more around the coasts so we\u2019ve got more flexibility because you can bring in product on ships as opposed to by pipeline from Canada,\u201d Wirth said during an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cLast year, less than 10 per cent of our feedstock came from either Mexico or Canada and so our company wouldn\u2019t probably feel it quite the way the others would. But it could create some impacts depending upon where your assets are.\u201d\n\nExxon\u2019s full-year refining earnings dropped to US$4 billion from US$12.1 billion in 2023, according to a statement on Friday. As for Chevron, its global fleet of plants earned just US$1.7 billion last year, down from US$6.1 billion.\n\nThe fourth quarter was especially stark for Chevron\u2019s US refineries, which lost almost US$350 million, according to a company release.\n\n\u201cThe largest downside surprise came from the oil major\u2019s US refining segment, which reported its first quarterly loss since early 2021 and was well below expectations,\u201d said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge.\n\nExxon shares rose 0.8 per cent at 9.33 am in New York. Chevron fell 2.5 per cent.\n\nLevies on Canada and Mexico could curtail shipments of roughly four million barrels a day of oil from the north and 500,000 barrels a day from the south. The nations are the top two sources of foreign crude for US refiners.\n\nValero Energy, the third-largest independent US refiner by market value, on Thursday warned that the industry may cut fuel production if Trump carries out his tariff threat. Mexico is Valero\u2019s biggest source of oil. Independent refiners are those that don\u2019t drill for crude.\n\nAcross all its business lines, Exxon posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of US$1.67 a share that exceeded the consensus forecast by 12 cents.\n\nChevron, meanwhile, reported quarterly earnings of US$2.06 a share, a nickel below expectations. The miss came a day after competitor Shell also disclosed disappointing end-of-year profits.\n\nExxon surprised investors last month by raising capital spending to more than US$30 billion annually over the next five years as CEO Darren Woods expands production to levels not seen since the 1970s.\n\nWoods has argued that new oil projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin, along with liquefied natural gas investments, have such high margins that they will drive Exxon\u2019s breakeven oil price down to just US$30 a barrel by the end of the decade, ensuring profitability however the energy transition pans out.\n\nThe international Brent crude benchmark averaged roughly US$74 a barrel during the fourth quarter, down 11 per cent from a year earlier. The slide pressured the biggest oil companies\u2019 capacity to fund shareholder-friendly outlays such as dividends.\n\nExxon generated US$36 billion of free cash in 2024 and handed nearly all of it to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, making it the sixth-highest cash distributor in the S&P 500 Index. The company intends to buy back US$20 billion of shares annually through 2026.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing higher and higher production but that production is coming at lower cost of supply, higher profit barrels,\u201d chief financial officer Kathy Mikells said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that all barrels are not created equal and ours are very advantaged.\u201d\n\nChevron raised dividends by 5 per cent even as profit underperformed. The company generated US$4.4 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, short of the roughly US$7.5 billion doled out in the form of dividends and buybacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building from strength to strength and have US$10 billion of additional free cash flow growth through the end of 2026,\u201d Wirth said. New projects in Kazakhstan and the newly named Gulf of America will drive the increase, he said. BLOOMBERG",

JHVEPhoto/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 directing the U.S. Department of the Interior to adopt the name \"Gulf of America.\" The order, titled Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness (RNTHAG), ordered the Interior Department to rename both the Gulf and Mount Denali.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe phrase Gulf of Mexico dates to the 1500s, hundreds of years before the creation of the United States of America. By the 18th century, and still before the founding of the U.S., cartographers were using several names to describe the body of water, but each used the term Mexico in some form.\n\nAs for Denali, Alaska Native peoples for centuries referred to the mountain as Denali. In June 1896, an American gold prospector who came to the then-U.S.-designated District of Alaska decided to rename the peak in honor of then-presidential candidate William McKinley, mostly because McKinley wanted to keep the U.S. under the gold standard, as opposed to the silver standard. McKinley would win the presidency in November 1896. More than a decade after McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Congress passed an act to establish Mount McKinley National Park.\n\nIn 2015, despite protests from some in McKinley's home state of Ohio, U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced the official change from McKinley to Denali. At the time, then-presidential candidate Trump said the name change was \"a great insult to Ohio.\"\n\nTrump's executive order does not force anyone to use the phrase \"Mount McKinley\" or \"Gulf of America.\" The Port of Galveston told Chron that Trump's order wasn't expected to impact its operations at the Gulf.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHouston-based ExxonMobil used the phrase \"U.S. Gulf Coast\" in its latest earnings report, according to CNBC. That's a phrase ExxonMobil has used in previous reports. Chevron has used the phrase \"U.S. Gulf of Mexico\" in past language.",

            "content": "Chevron Corporation, through a network of subsidiaries, engages in integrated energy and chemicals operations worldwide. The company is the 7th largest integrated oil company worldwide, the 2nd largest in the US, and has been in operation since 1879. Chevron was part of the original Standard Oil Company and is one of the 34 successor companies that were formed when it was broken up. Today, the company brings in roughly $160 billion in annual revenues and is the last remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOriginally called Standard Oil Of California the company grew quickly via mergers and acquisitions. It was hailed as one of the Seven Sisters to dominate the US and global production throughout the mid-20th century and became even bigger in 1985 when it merged with Gulf Oil. The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Chevron Embraces Gulf Of America Name Change The oil company aligns with Trump's directives, marking significant corporate shifts.\n\nChevron Corp. has officially begun to use the term \"Gulf of America\" to describe its operations located along the Gulf of Mexico, following President Donald Trump's directive to rename the marine area. This bold move signals not only Chevron's alignment with the current administration but also reflects the larger trend within corporate America as it embraces changes instituted by the Trump presidency.\n\nThe name change was enacted alongside a series of executive orders issued by Trump on his first day back in office, aimed at redefining U.S. geographical nomenclature for the sake of national pride and energy independence. \"That\u2019s the official position of the US government,\" asserted Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron, during a recent interview. \"If Google Maps is using it \u2014 then Chevron is using it,\" he declared, reinforcing the company\u2019s commitment to implementing this shift.\n\nChevron's earnings report last Friday marked the first formal acknowledgment of this name shift as the company referred to the gulf as \"Gulf of America\" five times explicitly within its documentation, including references to significant offshore projects. This adoption of language indicates the wider corporate enthusiasm for aligning with Trump's energy-centric agenda, aiming to boost oil production and restore regulatory frameworks favored by the industry.\n\nTrump's rationale for the name change aligns with his overarching ambition to have the U.S. recognized as the dominant force not only economically but also geopolitically. By renaming the Gulf, he stated he aimed to make the U.S. \u201cthe greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth.\u201d Anti-Biden sentiments have fueled these changes, as Trump's administration focuses on dismantling previous regulations enacted by the Biden government, which they claim stifle energy production.\n\nChevron's latest statements come as part of its larger strategy to make significant investments, demonstrating financial support for Trump's vision. Recently, the company announced it would be constructing new gas-fired power plants to supply electricity to major data centers, underscoring its intention to innovate under the auspices of the new administrative direction.\n\nDespite this, other major oil companies seem to be taking different paths. For example, both Hess and the UK-based Shell have chosen to retain the traditional name \"Gulf of Mexico\" within their quarterly reports, choosing not to conform to the renaming phenomenon initiated by Trump. Exxon Mobil, on the other hand, did not reference either name during its recent earnings call.\n\nNotably, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. announced it will also transition the name to \"Gulf of America\" on Google Maps when the U.S. Geological Survey updates its data. This adjustment will, nonetheless, only be visible within U.S. versions of the application, highlighting the nationwide ramifications of this local naming effort.\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, the oil industry has largely bolstered its support for policies aimed at increasing oil and gas production\u2014a sharp turn from the previous administration's efforts to promote renewable energy sources. The current administration has shown open advocacy for deregulation, promising to upend restrictions previously placed on liquefied natural gas and offshore drilling operations.\n\nChevron, which also revealed plans to shift its corporate headquarters from California to Texas\u2014a state favored for its business-friendly climate\u2014has previously aligned itself with Trump's objectives, donating $2 million to his inaugural committee. Bill Turenne, Chevron's spokesperson, commented, \"Chevron has a long tradition of celebrating democracy by supporting the inaugural committees of both parties. We are proud to be doing so again this year,\" showcasing the corporation's bipartisan engagement, yet making it clear where its current allegiance lies.\n\nCritics, including Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, have voiced their disapproval of the name change, labeling it problematic and unnecessary, particularly as it seeks to erase the historical and cultural significance associated with the region. Sheinbaum remarked earlier this month, asserting Google was misguided to adopt the name change.\n\nWhile Chevron takes steps to implement this new nomenclature, many observers remain concerned about its broader implications. The renaming serves as not just corporate alignment but as proof of Trump's intent to reshape American identity and policy landscapes, promoting nationalism even through the naming of geographic features.\n\nWith the executive order lacking any explicit legal authority to compel private entities to adopt the new terminology, Chevron\u2019s embrace of \"Gulf of America\" stands as emblematic of the company's existing affiliations and collaborative strategies with the current government. Observers of the industry will be keeping watch for how other corporations react moving forward, providing insight as to whether this name change is merely the beginning of larger ideological shifts within corporate governance.\n\nAt the intersection of energy policy, corporate allegiance, and national identity, the Gulf of America moniker is more than just a simple renaming\u2014it reveals the undercurrents of political sentiment sweeping through the oil sector.",

Worldwide and U.S. net oil-equivalent production increased 7 and 19 percent, respectively, from last year.\n\nThe company started up several key projects in the Gulf of America, including the industry-first, high-pressure Anchor project. In Kazakhstan, Tengizchevroil completed the Wellhead Pressure Management Project and recently started up the Future Growth Project. Chevron also repurchased over $15 billion of its shares in 2024, extending its track record of repurchasing shares in 17 out of the last 21 years.\n\n\u201cWe strengthened our portfolio and committed to reduce costs and maintain capital discipline, positioning us for significant free cash flow growth,\u201d Wirth concluded.\n\nThe company recently closed asset sales in Canada, the Republic of Congo and Alaska, progressed the acquisition of Hess Corporation, and announced a target of $2-3 billion of structural cost reductions by the end of 2026.\n\nFinancial and Business Highlights\n\nUnit 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 4Q 2023 2024 2023 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) % 7.6 % 10.1 % 5.1 % 10.1 % 11.9 % Capital Expenditures (Capex) $ B $ 4.3 $ 4.1 $ 4.4 $ 16.4 $ 15.8 Affiliate Capex $ B $ 0.6 $ 0.6 $ 0.9 $ 2.4 $ 3.5 Free Cash Flow (1) $ B $ 4.4 $ 5.6 $ 8.1 $ 15.0 $ 19.8 Free Cash Flow ex. working capital (1) $ B $ 1.0 $ 4.2 $ 7.1 $ 13.8 $ 23.0 Debt Ratio (end of period) % 13.9 % 14.2 % 11.5 % 13.9 % 11.5 % Net Debt Ratio (1) (end of period) % 10.4 % 11.9 % 7.3 % 10.4 % 7.3 % Net Oil-Equivalent Production MBOED 3,350 3,364 3,392 3,338 3,120 (1) See non-GAAP reconciliation in attachments\n\n2024 Financial Highlights\n\nReported earnings decreased compared to last year primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales, lower realizations, and severance charges, partially offset by the absence of charges for decommissioning obligations for previously sold assets, higher sales volumes and lower impairment charges.\n\nWorldwide and U.S. net oil-equivalent production set annual records. Worldwide production increased 7 percent from a year ago primarily due to nearly 18 percent growth in the Permian Basin and a full year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production.\n\nYear-end 2024 proved reserves were approximately 9.8 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent, subject to final reviews. The largest reductions were from production and the sale of oil sands and shale and tight assets in Canada, and the largest additions were from extensions and discoveries in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basins.\n\nCapex was slightly higher than 2023, primarily due to higher upstream investments. Affiliate capex was down $1.1 billion, primarily due to lower spend at the company\u2019s Tengizchevroil (TCO) affiliate in Kazakhstan.\n\nCash flow from operations was lower than a year ago mainly due to lower earnings and higher payments related to asset retirement obligations, partially offset by favorable working capital effects.\n\nCash flow from investing improved from last year driven by $7.7 billion of proceeds from asset sales in Canada and the U.S.\n\nThe company returned a record $27.0 billion of cash to shareholders during the year, including share repurchases of $15.2 billion and dividends of $11.8 billion. Over the past three years, the company has returned over $75 billion to shareholders.\n\nThe company\u2019s Board of Directors declared a 5 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to one dollar and seventy-one cents ($1.71) per share, payable March 10, 2025, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the corporation at the close of business on February 14, 2025.\n\nBusiness Highlights and Milestones\n\nStarted production at the industry-first 20,000 psi deepwater Anchor project, began water injection to boost production from the Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti fields, and started production from the Whale semi-submersible platform in the Gulf of America.\n\nStarted production at the Future Growth Project in January 2025, which is expected to ramp up total output to around one million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, and completed the Wellhead Pressure Management Project at TCO.\n\nRecently announced plans to jointly develop scalable power solutions using natural gas-fired turbines with flexibility to integrate carbon capture and storage to support growing energy demand from U.S. data centers.\n\nAchieved first gas on the Sanha Lean Gas Connection project, securing incremental natural gas supply to the Angola Liquefied Natural Gas facility.\n\nExtended the Meji field offshore Nigeria with a near-field discovery and added 20 years to the deepwater Agbami concession through 2044.\n\nUpgraded the Pasadena Refinery to increase product flexibility and expand the processing capacity of lighter crude oil by nearly 15 percent to 125,000 barrels per day.\n\nIncreased the company\u2019s exploration acreage position in the Gulf of America, Angola, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea, Uruguay and Namibia (subject to government approval).\n\nCompleted the sale of the company\u2019s interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project and Duvernay shale assets in Canada, certain assets in Alaska, and in 2025, the Republic of Congo.\n\nProgressed the company\u2019s pending merger with Hess Corporation by securing Hess stockholder approval and clearing Federal Trade Commission antitrust review.\n\nCompleted projects and operational changes designed to abate 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent from the company\u2019s operations.\n\nDrilled onshore and offshore stratigraphic wells to delineate carbon dioxide storage potential through the company\u2019s joint venture, Bayou Bend CCS LLC.\n\nLaunched a $500 million Future Energy Fund III focused on venture investments in technology-based solutions that have the potential to enable affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy.\n\nSegment Highlights\n\nUpstream\n\nU.S. Upstream Unit 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 4Q 2023 2024 2023 Earnings / (Loss) $ MM $ 1,420 $ 1,946 $ (1,347 ) $ 7,602 $ 4,148 Net Oil-Equivalent Production MBOED 1,646 1,605 1,598 1,599 1,349 Liquids Production MBD 1,189 1,156 1,164 1,152 997 Natural Gas Production MMCFD 2,743 2,694 2,604 2,684 2,112 Liquids Realization $/BBL $ 53.12 $ 54.86 $ 58.69 $ 56.24 $ 59.19 Natural Gas Realization $/MCF $ 1.62 $ 0.55 $ 1.62 $ 1.04 $ 1.67\n\nU.S. upstream earnings were higher than the year-ago period primarily due to the absence of charges from decommissioning obligations for previously sold assets in the Gulf of America and impairment charges mainly from assets in California, partly offset by lower realizations and severance charges.\n\nU.S. net oil-equivalent production was up 48,000 barrels per day from a year earlier and set a new quarterly record, primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin, partly offset by hurricane related impacts in the Gulf of America.\n\nInternational Upstream Unit 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 4Q 2023 2024 2023 Earnings / (Loss) (1) $ MM $ 2,884 $ 2,643 $ 2,933 $ 11,000 $ 13,290 Net Oil-Equivalent Production MBOED 1,704 1,759 1,794 1,739 1,771 Liquids Production MBD 797 834 851 823 833 Natural Gas Production MMCFD 5,437 5,550 5,661 5,494 5,632 Liquids Realization $/BBL $ 67.33 $ 70.59 $ 74.54 $ 71.38 $ 71.70 Natural Gas Realization $/MCF $ 7.67 $ 7.46 $ 7.31 $ 7.32 $ 7.69 (1) Includes foreign currency effects $ MM $ 597 $ 13 $ (162 ) $ 395 $ 376\n\nInternational upstream earnings were lower than a year ago primarily due to lower realizations, higher operating expense in part due to severance charges, impairments and lower liftings, partly offset by favorable foreign currency effects, largely in Australia.\n\nNet oil-equivalent production during the quarter was down 90,000 barrels per day from a year earlier primarily due to downtime at TCO, Canada asset sale and withdrawal from Myanmar.\n\nDownstream\n\nU.S. Downstream Unit 4Q 2024 3Q 2024 4Q 2023 2024 2023 Earnings / (Loss) $ MM $ (348 ) $ 146 $ 470 $ 531 $ 3,904 Refinery Crude Unit Inputs MBD 893 995 950 917 962 Refined Product Sales MBD 1,257 1,312 1,298 1,286 1,287\n\nU.S. downstream reported a loss in fourth quarter 2024.

            "content": "(Chevron by David Payl Morris/Bloomberg; Exxon by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nProfits for Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp were slammed by slumping fuel margins as the prospect of U.S. tariffs on two major oil suppliers threatens to make the refining business even worse.\n\nExxon posted a 67% plunge in 2024 refining profits on Jan. 31, and Chevron disclosed an even larger decline of 72%. The biggest North American oil companies succumbed to the same forces slashing results for fuel producers around the world \u2014 a flood of new output amid stagnating demand.\n\nThose lackluster performances in a key business line come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up threats to lay steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both of which are crucial sources of crude for U.S.-based refineries. Such levies \u2014 which Trump said may take effect as soon as the weekend \u2014 would increase the cost of making everything from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel.\n\nThe president vowed Jan. 30 to follow through on long-promised 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products, though he declined to say whether oil would be included in the list. His self-imposed effective date is Feb. 1.\n\nImage\n\nPipes at an oil-sands extraction site in Alberta. (Ben Nelms/Bloomberg)\n\nRefineries in the U.S. Midwest depend on Canadian oil for as much as three-fourths of their crude inputs. Meanwhile, Mexican supplies have long been a staple of Gulf Coast fuel-making plants designed to maximize output from so-called heavy crude. As the cost of buying oil from those two nations rises, it could create a knock-on effect for other types of crude as refiners clamor to secure replacement barrels with similar characteristics.\n\nImage Wirth\n\nChevron\u2019s domestic refineries tend to hug coastal areas, which means they have easier access to crude cargoes from overseas compared with inland competitors, said CEO Mike Wirth.\n\n\u201cWe tend to be more around the coasts so we\u2019ve got more flexibility because you can bring in product on ships as opposed to by pipeline from Canada.\u201d Wirth said during an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cLast year, less than 10% of our feedstock came from either Mexico or Canada and so our company wouldn\u2019t probably feel it quite the way the others would. But if could create some impacts depending upon where your assets are.\u201d\n\nExxon\u2019s full-year refining earnings dropped to $4 billion from $12.1 billion in 2023, according to a statement Jan. 31. As for Chevron, its global fleet of plants earned just $1.7 billion last year, down from $6.1 billion.\n\nThe fourth quarter was especially stark for Chevron\u2019s U.S. refineries, which lost almost $350 million, according to a company release.\n\n\u201cThe largest downside surprise came from the oil major\u2019s U.S. refining segment, which reported its first quarterly loss since early 2021 and was well below expectations,\u201d said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge.\n\nExxon shares rose 0.8% at 9:33 a.m. in New York. Chevron fell 2.5%.\n\nImage\n\nValero Energy Corp., the third-largest independent U.S. refiner by market value, on Jan. 30 warned that the industry may cut fuel production if Trump carries out his tariff threat. Mexico is Valero\u2019s biggest source of oil. Independent refiners are those that don\u2019t drill for crude.\n\nAcross all its business lines, Exxon posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.67 a share that exceeded the consensus forecast by 12 cents.\n\nChevron, meanwhile, reported quarterly earnings of $2.06 a share, a nickel below expectations. The miss came a day after competitor Shell Plc also disclosed disappointing end-of-year profits.\n\nExxon surprised investors last month by raising capital spending to more than $30 billion annually over the next five years as CEO Darren Woods expands production to levels not seen since the 1970s.\n\nWoods has argued that new oil projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin, along with liquefied natural gas investments, have such high margins that they will drive Exxon\u2019s break-even oil price down to just $30 a barrel by the end of the decade, ensuring profitability however the energy transition pans out.\n\nThe international Brent crude benchmark averaged roughly $74 a barrel during the fourth quarter, down 11% from a year earlier. The slide pressured the biggest oil companies\u2019 capacity to fund shareholder-friendly outlays such as dividends.\n\nExxon generated $36 billion of free cash in 2024 and handed nearly all of it to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, making it the sixth highest cash distributor in the S&P 500 Index. The company intends to buy back $20 billion of shares annually through 2026.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing higher and higher production but that production is coming at lower cost of supply, higher profit barrels,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that all barrels are not created equal and ours are very advantaged.\u201d\n\nChevron raised dividends by 5% even as profit underperformed. The company generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, short of the roughly $7.5 billion doled out in the form of dividends and buybacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building from strength to strength and have $10 billion of additional free cash flow growth through the end of 2026,\u201d Wirth said. New projects in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico will drive the increase, he said.",

U.S. fuel sales fell 3% year-over-year, Chevron said.\n\n\"This trend we have seen of margins softening through 2024 is something you can expect to continue to see, to extend into 2025,\" he said.\n\nWeak refining margins and lower oil prices during the fourth quarter also weighed on Exxon Mobil 's earnings, but the top U.S. oil producer beat analyst estimates. Exxon shares were down 1.6%.\n\nChevron remains locked in a bitter arbitration battle with Exxon over its proposed $53-billion takeover of Hess , which owns a 30% stake in Exxon's Guyana holdings.\n\nPrevious discussions to attempt to settle the dispute have ended and Chevron is focused on the arbitration, Wirth said.",

Chevron beat that sales forecast with a stick, doing $52.2 billion in business during the quarter. Profits, however, came in a nickel short at $2.06 per share.\n\nChevron Q4 earnings\n\nChevron's adjusted earnings didn't just miss analysts' forecasts. They also declined versus the preceding Q3 and Q4, falling 18% and 40%, respectively. The picture as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) looks a little better. GAAP profits declined 26% sequentially but were 51% better than what Chevron earned in Q4 2023.\n\nStill, GAAP earnings for Chevron lagged the adjusted number significantly. Chevron's Q4 GAAP profit was only $1.84 per share. The GAAP profit for all of 2024 was $9.72 per share, also down year over year. In a year when Chevron set a new record for production, growing worldwide production of barrels of oil equivalent hydrocarbons by 7%, that's disappointing.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) also slid significantly at this oil major. Chevron generated cash profits of $4.4 billion in Q4 and $15 billion for the full year, both numbers being worse than what the company reported a year ago.\n\nIs Chevron stock a buy?\n\nStill, CEO Mike Wirth says Chevron is taking steps to \"position\" the company for \"significant free cash flow growth\" in the future. Will this promise be enough to lift the stock?\n\nValued on its GAAP profit, Chevron sells for about 15.5 times trailing earnings. FCF lags reported net income, however, and at $268 billion in market capitalization, Chevron stock costs nearly 18 times FCF.\n\nEven paying a dividend yield north of 4%, Chevron will need to grow its profits in the mid-teens before I can call this stock a buy.",

            "content": "Today, acronyms tend to carry more weight than policies. The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is no different, having set tongues wagging before it was even established. At its helm, Elon Musk seems poised to disrupt what he sees as a bloated regulatory state. But as Musk tweets about ending bureaucracy, a quieter reality is emerging \u2014 disruption from the courts may eclipse DOGE\u2019s significance, as federal oversight has already begun shifting.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision last June to overturn the Chevron doctrine, a decades-long girding that underpinned regulatory authority, has rendered the regulatory landscape uncertain. But that uncertainty is not from the regulators. And as DOGE strides in, its purpose and efficacy may already be in question.\n\nThe crackdown on regulatory ambiguity\n\nFor nearly four decades, the Chevron doctrine allowed federal agencies to interpret ambiguous congressional statutes, with courts deferring to their expertise. This framework empowered agencies to draft and enforce regulations across industries, from environmental standards to labor protections.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Raimondo case, decided earlier in 2024, centered on whether the Department of Commerce could require fisheries to fund their own on-boat observers. The case put the Chevron doctrine in the cross hairs because the statute did not define where to get the funding, and the Department of Commerce urged the courts to defer to it for interpreting how to regulate the fisheries. The Supreme Court dismantled Chevron. The ruling shifted interpretive authority back to Congress, signaling an end to the era of deference to agency judgment. Ambiguous or indirect mandates from Congress are now targets for legal challenge, threatening, but not yet undoing, the foundation for countless regulations on the books.\n\nThe decision sends a clear message: Congress must take responsibility for specificity for an agency to make regulations under an act. But in a legislature marked by partisanship and inertia, even with the Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, this clarity may be more aspiration than reality.\n\nThe DOGE dilemma\n\nDOGE\u2019s founders argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron decision strengthens their hand. Vivek Ramaswamy, who was initially named DOGE\u2019s co-leader with Musk but has since exited, recently called it a \u201cmandate to dismantle\u201d overreaching federal oversight. Musk echoed this sentiment, heralding DOGE as a solution to regulatory inefficiency.\n\nYet legal experts suggest the opposite: The ruling may render DOGE\u2019s mission redundant. Executive agencies, including DOGE, have always held the authority to pare back regulations. What Chevron provided was the latitude to enforce them. Regulations will now hinge on Congress stating clear guidance on what new laws do and don\u2019t do \u2014 though the institution is notorious for vague statutes and underfunded initiatives.\n\nIronically, DOGE\u2019s success may depend on a legislative body that often opts for ambiguity over action. Congress has historically relied on agencies to fill in the gaps for loosely worded laws. Post-Chevron, such delegation is untenable. But the shift underway to hold Congress to specify its intent does not reveal any new way for the executive branch to bump off regulations. It could always do that. DOGE\u2019s ambitious plans to streamline and deregulate may prove symbolic rather than substantive.\n\nThe implications for industry\n\nIndustries are already seizing the opportunity to challenge long-standing regulations. In corporate boardrooms across the country, legal teams are combing through federal rules, prioritizing those without a clear statutory basis.\n\nThe potential ripple effects are immense:\n\nCommoditized industries (sectors like oil and gas) likely driven by cost-cutting could see weakened safety and environmental standards as companies race to the bottom.\n\nSpecialized markets (industries with high barriers to entry) may thrive under self-regulation, using innovation and quality to outcompete rivals.\n\nBut self-regulation brings risks. Examples litter history \u2014 think pre-2008 financial markets \u2014 where deregulation led to drastic consequences.\n\nThe new regulatory battleground\n\nThe true battle for the regulatory future isn\u2019t at DOGE or in executive agencies; it\u2019s in Congress. Legislative precision and funding are the keys to what regulations will exist and whether they are enforceable.\n\nTake the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the pandemic. Congress crafted a nearly self-executing statute that authorized and funded the Small Business Administration (SBA) to deliver billions in loans with minimal ambiguity. By contrast, the Department of Commerce\u2019s failure to secure ongoing funding for fishery observers set the stage for the Loper case and unraveling Chevron.\n\nThe lesson is clear: Specificity in legislation matters. But achieving it requires Congress to overcome its entrenched reliance on broad strokes.\n\nThe legacy of DOGE and Chevron\n\nAs DOGE embarks on its mission, it will do so in a regulatory environment already reshaped by the courts. The Chevron doctrine, once a pillar for executive authority, is gone. What remains is a more constrained, accountability-focused framework that demands precision from Congress and vigilance from industries.\n\nFor DOGE, the irony is inescapable. Its purpose \u2014 to streamline federal regulation \u2014 was feasible under Chevron and remains feasible now. Not much has changed with executive authority to excise regulations. But the judiciary has shifted the center of gravity from the executive branch to the legislature.\n\nThe Supreme Court has opened the door to a less-regulated America. The verdict on whether this new landscape fosters innovation and growth or descends into chaos will depend on Congress\u2019 willingness to adapt and industries\u2019 commitment to responsible governance. In this new era, DOGE may find itself a secondary player, not the protagonist Musk envisions.\n\nFor now, the regulatory future lies not in the hands of disruptors or agencies but in the hallowed, often-gridlocked halls of Capitol Hill.\n\nRelated Content",

Revenue is expected to cross the wires at $86.33 billion, which would be up from $84.34 billion last year, according to TradingView.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Exxon has beaten EPS estimates in three periods, while it beat revenue expectations twice over the same period.\n\nAmong analysts, the one-year price target for Exxon averages $129.04, or an 18.5% increase from Thursday\u2019s $108.93 stock price. Twenty analysts have issued a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the stock, 11 have given it a \u201chold\u201d rating and only one consigned it to a \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nFor Chevron, analysts see EPS coming in at $2.11, while revenue is expected to total $46.6 billion. That would be down from EPS of $3.45 and revenue of $47.18 billion a year ago.\n\nChevron has beaten EPS and revenue estimates in three of the last four reporting periods.\n\nThe average one-year price target for Chevron among analysts is 177.39, or a 13.24% increase from Thursday\u2019s stock price of 156.65. Nineteen analysts have a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock while 10 have a \u201chold rating.\u201d There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cstrong sell\u201d ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Exxon XOM earnings\n\nExxon is trading about 1.6% higher on the month after dropping 8.8% in December, which marked the biggest monthly decline since October 2023.\n\nThe 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossed below the longer-term 200-day SMA back in December, a bearish technical signal known as a death cross. Since then, XOM has traded below the falling 50-day SMA, although prices have recovered somewhat since the death cross generated. That said, prices need to recapture the 50-day SMA before it could stage a recovery.\n\nThe options market expects a move of +/- 2.12 points, or 2% of the current stock price. That is a much smaller expected move compared to companies in the S&P 500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Chevron earnings\n\nChevron is trading in an advantaged technical structure vs. XOM, with prices holding above the 50- and 200-day SMAs. CVX is up over 8% since the start of the year, steadily outpacing XOM. A bull flag pattern has taken shape over the last two weeks of trading, indicating a potential breakout to the upside is on the cards.\n\nThe expected move for CVX per the options market calls for +/- 3.04 points, or 2% of Thursday\u2019s 156.78 stock price. This is about the same as XOM and doesn\u2019t offer many options for traders selling premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "Chevron Corporation CVX, Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova recently collaborated on an ambitious initiative to develop natural gas power plants to support the surging energy demands of AI-driven data centers. The venture aims to create a multi-gigawatt-scale power plant that should be co-located with the data center.\n\nThe news comes amid rising competition in artificial intelligence between the United States and China. The recent launch of DeepSeek\u2019s AI chatbot has intensified this race, with many users eager to test the rival of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and observe if DeepSeek, which has been developed at a very low cost, has been able to match America\u2019s leading AI companies.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Stargate Initiative to Build AI Infrastructure\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump made major decisions to advance America\u2019s Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiative. The president approved an executive order that would revoke earlier government policies and remove the hurdles to AI innovation.\n\nThe president also talked about a joint venture, Stargate, formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which will invest about $500 billion in AI infrastructure. Stargate is expected to build new data centers and deal with the energy demands needed to develop the evolving AI market in Texas. The new entity will start with an initial investment of $100 billion and has an opportunity to reach five times the initial amount.\n\nCVX\u2019s Energy-AI Convergence\n\nWith the acceleration in AI initiatives, meeting energy demands holds primary importance. Chevron and its partners aim to address the biggest energy challenge by generating domestic natural gas to fuel AI-driven data centers and secure AI leadership. The partnership also has the potential to drive productivity gains across the economy and restore America as an industrial superpower.\n\nThe first project of Chevron and its partners, called \u2018power foundries\u2019, is aimed at leveraging seven American-made GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines that will serve the data centers in the Southeast, Midwest and West regions of the country. In order to avoid an electricity price rise for consumers, the partnership plans not to overburden the existing transmission grids with the flow of new power generation. The partnership aims to deliver about 4 gigawatts of electricity, which has the potential to power 3-3.5 million U.S. homes by the end of 2027.\n\nCVX\u2019s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nCalifornia-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.Currently, CVX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

He draped himself in the Israeli flag after crossing the finish line.\u201cI felt pride that we have so many people who bring pride to our country with their remarkable achievements,\u201d said Elad Shoshan, consul of Israel to the Southwest United States (whose office is in Houston). \u201cI felt honored to have somebody such as Haimro representing us, Israel, being so humble and with so much talent.\u201dSegel \u2013 relying on his experience as an agent for professional runners \u2013 and Shoshan, using his contacts, reached out to Alame and expressed their desire to host a celebration in his honor. Alame excitedly agreed.In the ride from the hotel to the party, Shoshan and Alame immediately began a conversation about Petah Tikva (a suburb of Tel Aviv) where Alame lives and Shoshan grew up. One of the neighborhoods, Yoseftal, is where they both lived.The neighborhoods of Yoseftal and Dado are sister neighborhoods to the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. Funds from the Federation have supported infrastructure projects and social programs since 1982.\u201cThere are a lot of Houston family names on buildings there because we\u2019ve devoted a lot of attention and resources toward that small community,\u201d said Oren Mushin, a board member of Heights Kibbutz with Segel. The Houston Federation helped coordinate the celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a bashert thing,\u201d said Mushin.Shoshan, Segel, Mushin and Alame, as well as fellow Israeli Godadaw Belachew (who finished 17th in the marathon with a time of 2:14:36), spoke to the crowd, who learned about the party that afternoon through the Heights Kibbutz and Jewish Federation\u2019s Young Adult Division.\u201cIt was so beautiful. He was almost in tears. You could tell how much he was touched by the outpouring of support from our community,\u201d Segel said of Alame\u2019s remarks, which he delivered in Hebrew.\u201cWhen you come to a race like this from the other side of the world, it is sort of an isolating and lonely experience. To be able to go into somebody\u2019s house and have 30 people around you who are cheering you on and giving you hugs and congratulating you, I think, is an overwhelmingly warm feeling. You could tell he was really touched by that.\u201dShoshan intends to keep in touch with Alame and looks forward to welcoming him back in January 2026 to defend his Houston Marathon championship.",

The announcement explained,\n\nThe first projects, which the companies refer to as \u2018power foundries\u2019, are expected to leverage seven U.S. made GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines, secured under a slot reservation agreement, on an accelerated timeline. The projects are expected to serve co-located data centers in the U.S. Southeast, Midwest and West regions. Power generation is not designed to flow initially through the existing transmission grid, reducing the risk of increasing electricity prices for consumers.\n\nChevron credits the Trump administration\u2019s Day One executive actions on unleashing American energy and enhancing U.S. leadership on AI, citing \u201cthe need for affordable, reliable energy to meet the significant demand for electricity to power U.S. data centers.\u201d\n\nThis energy abundance phrasing signals a major departure from past net-zero rhetoric used by major corporations, including Chevron. In fall 2021, Chevron announced it was adopting a 2050 net-zero (decarbonization) guideline for tracking scope 1 (emissions directly attributed to a company) and scope 2 (emissions indirectly attributed to a company) emissions. Exxon Mobil, a direct competitor of Chevron, similarly walked back commitments to renewable energy projects last year due to the \u201cmarket\u2019s renewed acceptance of fossil fuels\u201d and plans to construct new natural gas plants, as well.\n\nPer the most available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) natural gas, nuclear energy, and coal account for 78% of current U.S. electricity generation. Nuclear operates about 93% of the year, while natural gas and coal facilities can be powered at maximum capacity for 56.6% and 40.2% of the year, respectively.\n\nSolar and wind, by comparison, only function for 25% and 35% of the time, due to their intermittency, respectively. Even renewable energy proponents concede these sources can\u2019t sufficiently be dispatched to supply reliable, uninterrupted power and note energy storage units are equally expensive.\n\nWith rising global electricity demand, especially from AI data centers, tech companies have similarly abandoned or softened their net-zero climate commitments and pledged investments in natural gas and nuclear energy projects. Additionally, major U.S. financial institutions have withdrawn from global climate groups in the wake of energy policy shifts from the Trump-Vance administration.\n\nTo learn more about energy abundance, go HERE.",

            "content": "The two companies will collaborate with GE Vernova, a power generation equipment provider, to establish a multi-gigawatt power plant using seven GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines. The turbines were acquired under a slot reservation agreement\u2014a contract that allows a buyer to reserve a specific time slot for a service or activity\u2014to support an accelerated deployment timeline.\n\nUS oil and gas major Chevron and San Francisco-based hedge fund Engine No. 1 have partnered to develop and scale natural gas-powered power plants to serve co-located data centers in the Southeast, Midwest, and West of the US.\n\nAccording to reporting from the FT, the project is expected to cost up to $8 billion.\n\nThe partnership aims to develop up to 4GW, with an in-service target date at the end of 2027. If the initial deployment is successful, the companies suggest that there is potential for further expansion.\n\nChris James, founder and chief investment officer of Engine No. 1, said: \u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance. By using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy, and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower.\u201d\n\nThe power generated by the turbines will directly feed the data centers in an off-grid system. The project will also be designed with the ability to integrate carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce its emission profile, the release stated. Chevron has invested in several CCS projects to date. Most recently, in April, it announced a direct investment in CCS firm ION Clean Energy.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pro-American energy policies and commitment to energy and AI dominance give us the confidence to invest in projects that will create American jobs and strengthen our national security,\u201d Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron, said.\n\nEngine No. 1 is an activist and impact-focused investment firm founded in 2020. In 2021, it became the talk of Wall Street in its campaign against fossil fuel giant ExxonMobil\u2019s board. The firm demanded reform in its focus on fossil fuels, arguing that it threatened future returns.\n\nDespite owning only 0.02 percent of the company, Engine No. 1 convinced Exxon's three largest shareholders, Blackrock, Vanguard, and Slate Street, to back the plans. This led Exxon to expand its board, add a director with a background in sustainable investing, and invest in CCS.\n\nReacting to the partnership with Chevron, Chris James argued that the investment is consistent with the Exxon campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not a pivot. The Exxon campaign was focused on governance and capital allocation as a way to create value for shareholders. It was not about ideology or fossil fuels or renewables,\u201d James told the FT.\n\n\u201cThis partnership with Chevron and GE is about allocating capital in an economy that is undergoing a re-industrialisation and needs dramatically more power . . . This will lead to value creation for shareholders.\u201d\n\nNotably, Chevron\u2019s deal with Engine No. 1 follows ExxonMobil's commitment to developing natural gas capacity specifically for the data center sector. In December, Exxon revealed it was planning to develop a 1.5GW natural gas-fired power plant dedicated to the data center sector.\n\nThe announcements by both oil and gas companies reflect a broader market move, as natural gas demand increases to meet the rising energy demand of artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nWith the reelection of Donald Trump to the presidency, the expectation is that regulations for new gas generation and pipelines will be streamlined to make good on his promise to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d Data centers stand to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this move.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that the first Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, would be directly powered by an onsite natural gas. Developers of the project submitted an application to site a 360.5MW power plant that will feed the data center behind the meter.\n\nLate last year, Meta announced a new $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, northeast Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana will build and operate 2.26GW of on-site natural gas generation, which will power the center.",

By comparison, in the same months of 2024, prices declined to $71.99, $69.95, and $70.12 per barrel. This year-over-year drop highlights the weaker oil price environment in Q4 2024.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, natural gas prices presented mixed signals. In Q4 2024, U.S. Henry Hub average prices were $2.20 in October, $2.12 in November and rebounded to $3.01 in December. While prices started lower than the same months in 2023 \u2014 $2.98, $2.71 and $2.52, respectively\u2014the late uptick adds complexity to the picture.\n\n\n\nChevron\u2019s production, however, offers a more encouraging story. Output increased 6.9% in the previous quarter, driven by contributions from PDC Energy\u2019s acquisition, new projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and steady gains from the Permian Basin. For Q4 2024, Chevron\u2019s total production volume is estimated at 3,342 thousand barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MBOE/d), according to Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\n\n\nTaking these factors together, Zacks forecasts Chevron\u2019s total upstream income to reach $3.7 billion for the quarter\u2014 more than doubling the $1.6 billion reported in Q4 2023. This significant growth underscores the interplay of improved production and market dynamics.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the downstream unit is likely to have been a headwind for Chevron again. CVX\u2019s refining segment, contributing just over 10% to total earnings in the first nine months of 2024, faces challenges from oversupplied markets. Crack margins have fallen quarter over quarter, with new refineries in the Middle East and Nigeria adding to global capacity. Despite upcoming closures in 2025, near-term struggles could have weighed on downstream profitability. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVX\u2019s fourth-quarter downstream income is pegged at $115 million, implying a plunge from $1.1 billion recorded in the year-ago period.",

            "content": "Chevron\u2019s announcement is the latest example of just how much the promise of A.I. \u2014 a voracious electricity consumer \u2014 is reshaping the economy. Oil producers are recalibrating their strategies and leaning into power generation, a business that many of them had previously sworn off because it was much less profitable than drilling and processing oil and gas. Just last month, Exxon said that it, too, wanted to get into the business of selling electricity to data centers.\n\nBut in a reminder that the prospects for A.I. data centers and growing electricity demand are highly uncertain, technology and energy stocks tumbled on Monday. Investors were unnerved by the stunning advances in A.I. made by an unfamiliar Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, that said it had made its gains using a modest number of computer chips that consumed relatively little energy. Shares of chip-maker Nvidia tumbled 17 percent and the stock of Constellation Energy, a large power producer, closed down more than 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the potential for markets to surprise you,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. But he added that being early to market and keeping its costs low would protect Chevron against the possibility that power demand growth falls short of current expectations.\n\nHis company is hardly alone.\n\nMany power producers are bulking up, and many are investing in natural gas generating capacity specifically. Constellation, which has a large fleet of nuclear power plants, agreed this month to buy rival Calpine, which owns many natural gas plants, for $16.4 billion. And last week, NextEra Energy said it was planning to build more gas-fueled power plants.\n\nExpectations for how much and how quickly U.S. electricity demand will rise vary widely. What\u2019s clear is that data centers are likely to consume a lot more of the country\u2019s power than they do today. A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that the facilities are poised to use up to 12 percent of U.S. electricity in 2028, up from 4.4 percent in 2023.",

(NYSE: CVX) announced today the formation of a partnership to build a new company to develop scalable, reliable power solutions for United States (U.S.) based data centers running on U.S. natural gas. Early actions of the Trump Administration are setting the critical foundation to encourage investment leveraging America\u2019s energy abundance to enable America\u2019s AI leadership. The joint development, in conjunction with GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), aims to establish the first multi gigawatt-scale co-located power plant and data center during President Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThe first projects, which the companies refer to as \u201cpower foundries,\u201d are expected to leverage seven U.S. made GE Vernova 7HA natural gas turbines, secured under a slot reservation agreement, on an accelerated timeline. The projects are expected to serve co-located data centers in the U.S. Southeast, Midwest and West regions. Power generation is not designed to flow initially through the existing transmission grid, reducing the risk of increasing electricity prices for consumers.\n\nThe companies\u2019 plans directly address the need for affordable, reliable energy to meet the significant demand for electricity to power U.S. data centers, enabling current and future generations of AI to be developed in the U.S. The joint development plans to deliver up to four GW, the equivalent of powering 3-3.5 million U.S. homes, with initial in-service targeted by the end of 2027 and potential for project expansion beyond this capacity. The projects are expected to be designed with the flexibility to integrate lower carbon solutions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) \u2014 which is capable of capturing >90% of the CO2 from the turbines \u2014 and renewable energy resources.\n\nChris James, founder and chief investment officer of Engine No. 1, said, \u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance. By using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower. This partnership with Chevron and GE Vernova addresses the biggest energy challenge we face.\u201d\n\nMike Wirth, chief executive officer and chairman, Chevron Corporation, said, \u201cWe are proud to play our part in bringing to fruition President Trump\u2019s vision for a new American golden age, powered by our enormous energy resources and unrivaled workforce. President Trump\u2019s pro-American energy policies and commitment to energy and AI dominance give us the confidence to invest in projects that will create American jobs and strengthen our national security.\u201d\n\nScott Strazik, chief executive officer for GE Vernova, said, \u201cWe are excited to enable the advancement of data center growth in the U.S. by supporting delivery of critical power needs to customers using innovative solutions. GE Vernova is uniquely positioned to provide the energy systems and support required to make this large-scale endeavor possible, as the leading U.S. energy manufacturer.\"\n\nThe rapid growth of digital technology, including the rise of data consumption, cloud computing and AI-powered solutions, requires cost-effective and scalable solutions to enable growth and avoid burdening the existing grid. Over time, this innovative model is designed to sell surplus power to the U.S. power grid, through future interconnects, supporting broader energy demands while keeping costs low.\n\nIn addition to providing affordable, reliable energy to a rapidly growing part of America\u2019s economy, the joint development is expected to create thousands of jobs and help the reindustrialization of the U.S.\n\nAbout Engine No. 1\n\nEngine No. 1 is an investment firm that builds and invests in companies that are driving the reindustrialization of the United States.

The company\u2019s AI Assistant, which is powered by DeepSeek-V3, already has surpassed rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple\u2019s app store in the U.S.\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nThe news brought a market rout for chipmaker and AI leader Nvidia, which lost $589 billion in market value on Jan. 28. It also \u201ccalls into question the significant electric demand projections for the U.S. [as] AI represents ~75% of overall U.S. demand forecasts through 2030-35 in most projections,\u201d according to a note Monday from investment bank Jefferies\u2019 power and utilities research team.\n\nHow much electricity demand could be curtailed by an AI model using significantly less computing power? Researchers are scrambling for an answer, but DeepSeek\u2019s reported efficiency improvements at least suggest that forecasts of exponential power demand growth may need to be redone.\n\nJefferies in its note wrote that the DeepSeek news would threaten \u201cthe bull thesis on independent power producers and most integrated utilities [that] is entirely dependent on data centers.\u201d U.S. utilities and energy companies involved in the data center space also saw their stock prices take a hit, as did shares of advanced nuclear technology companies including NuScale and Oklo.\n\nThe Jefferies\u2019 note also said that \u201ca slowdown in data center projections \u2026 would have an adverse impact on the higher premium utilities that investors expect to increase rate base.\u201d But the bank also thinks Monday\u2019s market selloff was overblown, calling DeepSeek\u2019s launch \u201cpart of an ongoing evolution, not revolution\u201d in the AI and software markets.\n\nConcern, or Opportunity?\n\nShould U.S. power companies planning investments to meet electricity demand from data centers be worried? The answer likely is somewhere in between. Energy majors outside of the generation space continue to bet on data centers. Chevron, the second-largest oil and gas company in the U.S., has announced it is working with investment firm Engine No. 1 on a plan to build natural gas-fired power plants that would directly supply data centers.\n\nEngine No. 1, based in San Francisco, California, is known for winning a proxy battle against Exxon Mobil in 2021. Interestingly, Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil and gas group, in December said it was planning a 1.5-GW gas-fired power plant that would serve data centers.\n\nChevron and Engine No. 1 said they have ordered equipment and looked at sites that could host power plants and data centers, and said a first facility could be operating by year-end 2027.\n\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence is one of the most important technological breakthroughs in recent history, igniting productivity gains across our global economy,\u201d wrote Mike Wirth, Chevron\u2019s chief executive, in a social media post. \u201cToday, Chevron announced a joint development with Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova to help meet the demand for scalable, reliable power solutions to enable advancements in Artificial Intelligence. The partnership will work directly with customers to develop power generation that is dedicated to and co-located with data centers. The power generators will leverage Chevron\u2019s natural gas capabilities and utilize turbines manufactured by GE Vernova.\u201d\n\nThe companies jointly said they expect to build 4 GW of gas-fired generation to supply data centers, and could potentially develop more capacity. Said Wirth, \u201cThe projects, which will be managed by our Chevron New Energies organization, will also be designed with flexibility to integrate lower-carbon solutions, such as carbon capture and storage and renewable energy sources.\u201d\n\nChris James, founder and chief investment officer of Engine No. 1, in a statement said, \u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance. By using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower. This partnership with Chevron and GE Vernova addresses the biggest energy challenge we face.\u201d\n\nData Center Deals\n\nTwo recent announcements highlight the interest for energy companies in the data center space. Nuclear power giant Constellation earlier this month said it was buying Calpine in a multibillion-dollar deal, in large part to acquire Calpine\u2019s extensive fleet of gas-fired power stations. NextEra Energy, which has a current portfolio of about 1.6 GW of gas-fired generation, last week said it plans to build more gas-fueled plants alongside GE Vernova.\n\nThe past year was filled with announcements of technology companies securing power purchase agreements for their AI efforts, across nuclear power, natural gas-fired generation, renewable energy, and even coal-fired power stations. President Donald Trump on Jan. 22 announced an AI joint venture, called Stargate, that could include $500 billion in investment from companies such as OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The dollars for data centers included a suggestion from Trump that they could be powered with \u201cgood, clean coal.\u201d\n\nTrump, even before taking office, in early January announced that Damac Properties, a company controlled by Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani, would make at least a $20 billion investment to build data centers in the U.S. That followed a pledge in December from Japanese billionaire investor Masayoshi Son, who during an appearance with Trump said he would invest $100 billion in U.S. projects. Blackstone, the global investment management company, in an October note said it estimates the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers during a five-year stretch, with another $1 trillion coming from international investors.\n\nThomas Byrne, CEO and co-founder of New York-based CleanCapital, a renewable energy investment firm, provided POWER with his insight into what that means for the U.S. energy sector, and renewable energy in particular.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s announcement of a $20 billion investment in data centers will be accompanied by immense new energy needs,\u201d said Byrne. \u201cThe only way to support such load growth in such a short time is by building more clean energy, specifically solar and energy storage.\n\nByrne continued: \u201cRight now, over 2,500 GW of clean energy generation capacity is backlogged in interconnection queues across the country, the majority of which is solar and energy storage. Our industry is already operating at a breakneck pace, creating scalable and reliable clean energy solutions ready for deployment but roadblocked by permitting and bureaucratic delays. As the new administration aims to attract more investments like this one\u2014and fulfill its promise of lowering the cost of energy by half in 18 months\u2014it must prioritize our energy infrastructure; you cannot have one without the other.\u201d\n\nEnter VPPs\n\nMathew Sachs, senior vice president, Strategy & Product, for CPower, said data center demand also can be served by virtual power plants, or VPPs. Sachs told POWER: \u201cThe No. 1 driver for VPPs is going to be load growth driven by computing and facility load for AI and data centers. AI is like a modern-day Manhattan Project. It\u2019s become imperative for the U.S. to lead, for both security and economic reasons. Given the security concerns, we would not be surprised to see the federal government get involved to ensure there\u2019s enough power for AI.\u201d\n\nSachs added, \u201cWherever the supply comes from, we will have to deal with transmission and distribution constraints within the existing grid infrastructure. However, we can\u2019t rapidly build out infrastructure, so we\u2019re going to have to rely on resources we already have in the near-term. That means turning to VPPs, which can meet increases in demand now.\u201d\n\nWherever power demand from data centers ultimately lands, analysts who have spoken with POWER agree it will create both opportunities and challenges for electric utilities and grid operators. Nick Schweissguth, director of Product and Commercial Enablement at LiquidStack, a company that manufactures advanced liquid cooling solutions for data centers, told POWER: \u201cAI will strain the power grid, spurring new data center builds in unexpected locations. The power grid is bracing for an unprecedented challenge as AI data centers\u2019 appetite for power threatens to overwhelm existing infrastructure. This energy crisis will spur action from both utility companies and data center operators.\u201d\n\nSchweissguth said, \u201cUtility companies will embark on massive infrastructure upgrades to meet surging demand, from advanced energy storage to smart grid solutions. Data center operators will adopt a \u2018follow the power\u2019 strategy, extending and diversifying new-build locations far beyond traditional locales.\u201d\n\nSome analysts in the equities space said the DeepSeek model, if proven, could create more interest in development of AI infrastructure, and bring more investment from U.S. tech groups and others. J.P. Morgan Wealth Management\u2019s Global Investment Strategy team in a note Monday wrote, \u201cJevons Paradox states that increased efficiency can lead to increased consumption of a resource. Lower costs for AI models could lead to faster adoption by corporations and households.\u201d\n\n\u2014Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.",

FGP is the third processing plant in operation at the Tengiz oilfield, which expands sour gas injection capability and is expected to ramp up output to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), the U.S. supermajor said.\n\nThe Tengiz oil field, located in western Kazakhstan, is the country\u2019s biggest field and ranks as the world\u2019s deepest producing supergiant oil field and the largest single-trap producing reservoir in existence, Chevron says. The estimated oil in place in Tengiz is 3.2 billion tons, or 25.5 billion barrels. Tengiz and the nearby Korolev field, both operated by Tengizchevroil, are located about 6 miles (10 km) east of the Caspian Sea.\n\nWhile the Kazakhstan development is set to boost Chevron\u2019s crude oil production and cash flow, it could further complicate Kazakhstan\u2019s efforts to compensate for overproduction as part of its commitment to the OPEC+ alliance.\n\nKazakhstan, a non-OPEC producer, is part of the OPEC+ group and has been struggling, alongside Russia and Iraq, to fall in line with its assigned output quota as part of the OPEC+ agreements.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Instead, its harvested LNG will now be funneled to Chevron and distributed from there.\n\n\"We believe that Lake Charles is the most compelling LNG project on the Gulf Coast and we continue to make significant progress towards full commercialization of this project.\" Tom Mason, president of Energy Transfer's LNG unit, said.\n\nWhy is LNG so controversial?\n\nWhile \"natural\" might suggest that natural gas \u2014 and therefore LNG \u2014 is a clean or renewable fuel, this is not the case. As the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) phrased it on its website, \"LNG, derived from cooling fossil gas to store and transport over long distances, is part of the array of fossil fuels standing in the way of climate progress.\"\n\nIn fact, research from Cornell University found that transporting natural gas might be even more harmful to the planet than simply burning coal, as methane leaks during the process allow even more toxic compounds to escape into the atmosphere, the New Yorker reported.\n\nAnd while many energy companies tout LNG as a \"greener\" option than traditional coal, experts on the subject agree that this is essentially no more than greenwashing \u2014 supporting the continued use of a fuel that is actively contributing to the planet's overheating crisis.\n\nWhat's being done to counteract this?\n\nAdvocates for clean energy were dismayed by the 20-year Chevron deal, especially since it comes during an era when scientists agree there is no more time to delay reducing emissions.\n\nIf humans hope to avoid suffering the brunt of the damages that result from an increasingly hot atmosphere \u2014 from severe wildfires and storms to threats to agriculture and a loss of biodiversity \u2014 we need to focus on transitioning to clean energy, not supporting dirty fuel sources.\n\nFortunately, many researchers, companies, and policymakers are hard at work innovating to reduce emissions. From looking into alternative fuel sources like hydrogen and vegetable oil, to developing electric semi trucks, to creating plastic alternatives made from seaweed, there are many ways to invest in a cooler, more resilient future.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

But its exports depend almost entirely on a pipeline that runs through Russia to the Black Sea, putting it effectively under Moscow\u2019s control.\n\nFlows could also be impacted by Kazakhstan\u2019s agreement with OPEC and other major oil producers to curtail global supply in recent years.\n\nThe expansion is expected to reach full capacity of 260,000 barrels per day by June, lifting overall production at Tengiz to around 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, Chevron\u2019s head of international exploration and production Clay Neff told Reuters.\n\nChevron shares were down 0.25% at 1240 GMT.\n\nTengiz is one of the world\u2019s deepest and most complex fields due to high levels of sulphur and harsh weather conditions.\n\nThe expansion has suffered delays and huge cost overruns since launching in 2012. Investment was \u201cat the low end\u201d of $48 billion to $49 billion, Neff said, making it one of the world\u2019s most expensive developments.\n\nChevron has a 50% stake in the Tengizchevroil joint venture which it operates, with Exxon Mobil holding 25%, Kazakh oil firm KazMunayGas 20% and Russian oil producer Lukoil the remaining 5%.\n\nTengizchevroil is expected to generate $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion next year at an average Brent price of $60 a barrel, Neff said. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently trading at around $80 a barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this project allows us to do is not only increase production today but also extend the life of the field over time,\u201d Neff told Reuters.\n\nThe expansion is part of Chevron\u2019s plans to increase its own production by around 3% per year over the next five years along with strong growth in the US Permian shale basin.\n\n(By Ron Bousso; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

            "content": "Oil is a volatile commodity, a fact that needs to be taken into consideration when buying an oil-related stock. However, there are different ways to view this fact from an investment perspective. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) offer three very different ways to dip your toes into oil stocks if you have $200, or more, to put to work. Here's a quick look at each one.\n\n1. Chevron covers all the carbon energy bases\n\nChevron is what is known as an integrated energy major. That means it invests in the upstream (oil and natural gas production), midstream (pipeline), and downstream (chemical and refining) segments of the broader energy industry. This diversification helps to even out earnings in what is a very volatile sector because each segment of the industry operates just a little bit differently. For example, when oil prices are low and the upstream business is suffering, the downstream businesses will be benefiting from low input costs.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nWhile Chevron's diversification across the energy sector doesn't mitigate the impact that oil price swings have on the top and bottom line, it does soften the swings. That, along with the company's focus on having a strong balance sheet, have helped it survive through industry downturns while continuing to reward investors with dividend increases all along the way. Chevron's dividend has been increased annually for 37 consecutive years, which is pretty incredible given the wild oil price swings that have occurred over that span. If you want a reliable, high-yield energy stock (Chevron's yield is 4% today), Chevron is probably one of the best options out there.\n\n2. Devon Energy is anything but reliable\n\nWhile Chevron is focused on consistency, Devon Energy offers pretty much the exact opposite. This company is focused on the U.S. upstream sector, producing oil and natural gas in key domestic energy basins. With no other businesses to offset the inherent volatility of selling these commodities, Devon's top and bottom lines are highly variable. That, in turn, leads the stock to rise and fall in dramatic fashion, moving right along with the big swings in energy prices. While it isn't a great idea to try to time markets, if you have a constructive view of oil prices, Devon Energy is likely to lead to more upside than investing in Chevron would. That said, remember that there's more downside risk, as well.\n\nWhile this big-picture dynamic is likely to be the driving force when making an investment in Devon Energy, there are other factors of note. Devon Energy is a well-respected company with operations in multiple regions of the United States. It has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet, 10+ years of drilling inventory, and a low break-even point, so it can make money even if oil prices are a little weak. So buying Devon Energy isn't like throwing caution to the wind. It is more like making an educated bet on higher energy prices that won't likely fall to zero if you are wrong.\n\n3. TotalEnergies is for investors that want to hedge their bets\n\nTotalEnergies competes directly with Chevron, since both are globally diversified integrated energy giants. Chevron is probably a better choice for most investors given that it has a more impressive dividend history. However, TotalEnergies has one very important thing that Chevron largely lacks: material exposure to electricity and clean energy. The company's integrated power division, as it is called, made up around 10% of adjusted net operating income through the first nine months of 2024. This figure grew 20% year over year.\n\nTotalEnergies has made a material commitment to clean energy, which offers a hedge of sorts for investors that are worried about the future of carbon fuels. But what's really notable about this is that TotalEnergies made this shift without cutting its dividend, which is what European peers BP and Shell did when they made similar clean energy commitments in 2020. Even more interesting, BP and Shell have started to walk back those commitments while TotalEnergies has continued to push forward. With an attractive 5.5% dividend yield, TotalEnergies is a good choice for investors looking for more than just oil.\n\nThree ways to play oil\n\nThere's no single right way to invest in oil stocks -- use the way that makes the most sense to you. Chevron is a great choice if you simply want to buy and hold a diversified energy stock with an attractive yield and reliable dividend. Devon Energy is appropriate for more aggressive investors that think oil prices are heading higher. And TotalEnergies is a good call for investors that want oil exposure, but think that clean energy is going to be an increasingly important part of the global energy pie.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Devon Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Chevron has launched a $48 billion project to develop a major oilfield in Kazakhstan, one of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.\n\nThe oil giant\u2019s announcement underscores its commitment to expanding its presence in the energy-rich OPEC+ nation, which continues to play a pivotal role in the global oil market.\n\nChevron expects Kazakhstan\u2019s Tengiz oil field, one of the largest of its kind in the world, to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nThat comes after the Fortune 500 company said that its 50 percent-owned affiliate Tengizchevroil LLP began pumping oil from an expansion project at Tengiz. That project is eventually expected to boost crude output by 260,000 barrels per day at full capacity, and the 1 million-barrel milestone is seen later this year.\n\nRead also: Chevron targets $6-8 bln in free cash flow growth by 2026\n\nChevron said the Tengiz oil field, which has been in operation for decades, is \u201cthe world\u2019s deepest producing supergiant oil field and the largest single-trap producing reservoir in existence.\u201d\n\nKazakhstan is among the group of OPEC allies that have joined with the oil cartel to form OPEC+. The Central Asian country pumped about 1.8 million barrels per day late last year.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump is demanding that OPEC boost oil supplies to lower prices, Chevron still sees a cash gusher, even if prices drop sharply from current levels of about $78 a barrel. OPEC+ and OPEC have some influence over oil prices but market forces, geopolitical conflicts, and demand are significant factors in determining the prices people pay at the pump.\n\nClay Neff, president of Chevron international exploration and production, told the New York Times that Tengiz will generate $4 billion in free cash flow for the company this year and $5 billion in 2026, assuming oil prices of $60 a barrel.\n\nChevron\u2019s other partners in the Tengizchevroil venture include KazMunayGas (20% stake), Fortune 500 rival Exxon Mobil (25%); and Russia\u2019s Lukoil (5%).\n\nRead also: Chevron discovers new 17,000 bpd oil field\n\nSeparately, an Exxon executive downplayed hopes for a sudden surge of liquid natural gas exports. That\u2019s despite Trump\u2019s flurry of post-inauguration moves to boost the energy sector, including LNG shipments.\n\nPhilippe Ducom, Exxon Mobil Europe president, told Bloomberg there are limited supplies this year and that European countries are reluctant to commit to long-term deals.\n\n\u201cThe problem is you don\u2019t find gas from one day to the next,\u201d he said on the sidelines of an energy conference in Berlin. \u201cSignificant new LNG capacity is only coming on stream in 2026-2027.\u201d\n\nNigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, Chevron plan to ramp up oil exploration follows a recent oil discovery in the Niger Delta, which has the potential to produce up to 17,000 barrels per day.\n\nThe discovery, termed a \u201cnear-field find,\u201d was made with the Meji NW-1 well within Petroleum Mining Lease 49, according to a statement from Chevron released on October 18. The block is located in the shallow offshore region of the Western Niger Delta.\n\nIn the statement, the company explained that the discovery supports Chevron\u2019s broader global exploration strategy, which focuses on identifying new resources that can extend the life of existing assets and enable faster development and production.\n\nOladehinde Oladipo Dipo Oladehinde is a skilled energy analyst with experience across Nigeria's energy sector alongside relevant know-how about Nigeria\u2019s macro economy.

The Bills' quarterback has often played better in the regular season but the Chiefs' star has the upper hand in the playoffs.\n\nLast year, Kansas City lost at home in the regular season before beating Buffalo on their home turf to make it to the AFC Championship. Even in 2024, Josh Allen was fantastic in beating Patrick Mahomes earlier in the year when the Bills ended up ending the Chiefs' unbeaten record until that point.\n\nAd\n\nNow, Buffalo has to travel to Kansas City to make it to the Super Bowl. A win for Josh Allen will see him travel to his first-ever title game. A victory for Patrick Mahomes will give him the chance to win his third straight ring and fourth overall.\n\nThe difference could very well be Taylor Swift's boyfriend. Travis Kelce has again shown his worth in the playoffs after a relatively quiet season by his own standards. He was critical in their victory last year over the Bills and the Chiefs fans will expect him to do the same tonight as well with Taylor Swift watching.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

ODU had a total of 12 assists in the three games.\n\nConversely, the Monarchs had 15 assists Saturday night, and shot well, making 31 of 63 shots (49.2%). They also outrebounded the Chanticleers, 43-35, and got a monster performance from their bench, which outscored the Coastal bench, 47-12.\n\nThat stat was helped by the fact that Robert Davis Jr., ODU\u2019s leading scorer for the season, did not start. Davis had 23 points and a career-high five assists off the bench.\n\nBut it also helped that ODU got two season-best scoring performances off the bench.\n\nCaden Diggs, a 6-foot-7 freshman from Waldorf, Maryland, came off the bench to score a career-high 10 points while Donovan Raymond, a 6-10 transfer from Hampton, added a season-high eight points, six rebounds and two assists.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of our guys for stepping up tonight,\" Jones said. \"You know, Caden, playing 23 minutes, doing the things that we know he's going to do a lot in his college career, it's great to finally see that happen for him.\n\n\"I tell Donovan every chance I get that his best basketball is ahead of him, that he's just got to stay patient and keep working.\n\n\"The cool thing about those two, and this is not to say that our other guys don't work, but Caden and Donovan are the most consistent guys in their individual workouts. There's not a day where they are not in the gym separately, on their own with a coach or a manager, getting their workouts in.\n\n\"They deserve the minutes they got tonight.\"\n\nSean Durugordon had 14 points and 10 rebounds and Stephaun Walker pulled down eight rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team that\u2019s not healthy right now,\u201d Jones said when asked about Davis not starting and 18 combined points from Diggs and Raymond.\n\nPoint guard Jaden Johnson was sick and did not practice this week. He started, but went to the bench with two fouls less than four minutes into the game and did not play the rest of the first half.\n\nODU was so far ahead in the second half that Jones was able to rest Johnson the rest of the game.\n\nJones was pleased with how unselfish his players were. .\n\n\u201cWhen we win, we\u2019re going to have about 15 assists,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t win, we\u2019re going to have single digit assists.\n\n\u201cTonight it is glaring when we share and glaring when we don\u2019t. I was happy to see that and I\u2019m happy to see that the message was received by our team.\n\n\u201cAlso, the result tonight reinforces that message.\u201d\n\nIt was the sixth loss in a row for the Chanticleers (8-13, 1-8), who seemed discombobulated by ODU\u2019s swarming man-for-man defense, which denied Coastal open shots. Coastal made just 15 of 54 shots (27.8%).\n\nJones said assistant coaches Ryan Nadeu, Odell Hodge, and graduate assistant Jason Wade \u201cdid a tremendous job preparing our guys.\u201d\n\nODU jumped on Coastal early and did not let up. Davis made a fallaway three-pointer almost nine minutes into the game to give the Monarchs their first double-digit lead, 16-6.\n\nThe lead was up to 15 late in the first half when the Monarchs blew the game open. Diggs made two jump shots, Davis a layup and a jumper and Durugordon two three throws over a two-minute stretch as the Monarchs took a 24-point lead.\n\nCoastal\u2019s Jordan Battle, the junior guard from Norfolk Collegiate, trimmed the margin to 21 with a three-point shot with 16 seconds left.\n\nODU didn\u2019t let up in the second half as the Monarchs twice extended the lead to 28 in the second half. Jones began emptying his bench with five minutes left as all 15 healthy players on the roster played.\n\nJones said his team drew a lot of energy from the crowd.\n\n\"With the results we've had the last week and a half, thank you, thank you so much to our fan base,\" he said.\n\n\"I've said it in here (the post-game press room) many times, and it seems a lot of times it's been after a loss, but to be able to play in front of these fans, it's truly a blessing,\" he said.\n\n\"The energy we felt when we walked out of the locker room today was tremendous. This is a special place, I'm lucky, I'm blessed, to be coaching here. We're lucky, we are all blessed to play in front of these amazing fans.\n\n\"Thank you, Monarch Nation.\"\n\nNOTES: The crowd lifted ODU\u2019s home attendance average to 5,131 for the season, which remains best in the Sun Belt. Arkansas State is a close second at 4,984. ODU has led the Sun Belt all three seasons since it joined the league in 2021-22 . . . ODU hits the road for most of the next month as the Monarchs play 7 of their 10 remaining games away from Chartway Arena. ODU is at App State on Wednesday, Jan. 29, and James Madison on Saturday, Feb. 1. . . . ODU\u2019s remaining home games are against Texas State (Feb. 5), Marshall (Feb. 20) and Georgia State (Feb. 22).",

            "content": "Crude oil prices are expected to slip in 2025, continuing the trend from 2024, which saw prices dragged down by weak Chinese demand and a supply glut. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted global oil demand to grow by under a million barrels per day in 2025, a significant slowdown compared to the two million barrels per day increase in 2023. Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects Brent oil prices to fall to $70 per barrel this year, citing increased oil supply from non-OPEC+ countries that will likely outpace the rise in global oil consumption. BMI noted that the first half of 2025 is likely to see a supply glut as substantial new production from the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil comes online. If OPEC+ plans to roll back voluntary cuts materialize, the oversupply will further pressure prices.\n\nGlobal natural gas prices have rallied since mid-December 2024, driven by cold weather and geopolitical tensions. Ukraine\u2019s recent halt of Russian gas flow to several European nations on New Year\u2019s Day has introduced greater uncertainty to the global gas markets. As long as the cutoff remains in place, gas prices are likely to remain elevated. BMI forecasts gas prices to rise by about 40% in 2025 to $3.4 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), driven by growing demand from the LNG sector and higher net pipeline exports. LNG will continue to drive new consumption, supported by rising export capacity and strong demand in Europe and Asia, according to BMI analysts.\n\nGold prices, which notched a series of all-time highs in 2024, are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2025. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, a gold investment services firm, attributes this optimism to investors\u2019 pessimism about geopolitics and government debt. Gold\u2019s role as a hedge against risk and inflation makes it an attractive asset in uncertain times. JPMorgan analysts also forecast a rise in gold prices, particularly if U.S. policies become more disruptive, leading to increased tariffs, elevated trade tensions, and higher risks to economic growth. Gold prices, which rose about 26% in 2024, are forecast to reach $3,000 per ounce in 2025.\n\nAccording to Sabrin Chowdhury, the head of commodities analysis at BMI, commodities in general will face pressure across the board in 2025. The strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to cap demand for commodities priced in the greenback, making them more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by a sluggish global economic outlook, which will dampen demand for raw materials and energy resources.\n\nThe year 2025 is shaping up to be a mixed bag for commodity markets. While global commodity prices are largely expected to fall due to a sluggish economic outlook and a resurgent U.S. dollar, certain commodities such as gold and gas are poised for a rally. Industry experts and market participants are closely monitoring these trends, particularly in the context of China\u2019s economic policies and global geopolitical developments.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ) stands against other best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSilver is expected to see price increases in 2025, driven by strong industrial demand. Silver is used in a variety of applications, including solar panels, automobiles, jewelry, and electronics. The demand for solar power, in particular, is expected to remain resilient, and the metal\u2019s supply is limited.\n\nCopper, a key material in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and power grids, may see a dent in prices in 2025. The metal reached a record high in May 2024, largely due to a squeezed market and the global energy transition. However, a potential deceleration in the energy transition, driven by policy shifts, might dampen the \u201cgreen sentiment\u201d that bolstered prices in 2024. John Gross, president of John Gross and Company, a metals management consultancy, expects copper prices to trend lower in 2025 due to a cocktail mix of high interest rates, elevated interest rates, and a stronger dollar, which will weigh on all metals markets.\n\nIron ore prices are forecast to drop in 2025, driven by an oversupply resulting from Chinese policies and geopolitical factors. Goldman Sachs expects prices to decline to $95 per ton in 2025, citing the expected U.S. tariffs on China, the changing nature of Chinese stimulus, and the introduction of new low-cost supply. Despite China likely importing a record amount of iron ore this year, the market is expected to move into a surplus, leading to a decline in prices.\n\nThe global commodity markets in 2025 are expected to be characterized by a mix of trends, with some commodities facing headwinds while others continue to rally. However, commodities are a solid investment option due to their inherent scarcity and long-term value as demand continues to grow.\n\nWhy Chevron Corporation (CVX) Is One of the Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?\n\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used commodities ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies that are involved in mining, trading or processing of commodities.

            "content": "Washington Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu may have helped his team trounce the Detroit Lions, 45-31, in their divisional round matchup on Jan. 19, but he's paying a price for it.\n\nAd\n\nNFL insider Tom Pelissero revealed that Luvu was fined $16,883 for a roughing the passer call against him, where he hit Lions quarterback Jared Goff in the head and neck area on a block following a pivotal pick-six. No flag was thrown on the play, but Luvu is being fined nonetheless. Additionally, Luvu is being fined an additional $16,883 for an illegal hip-drop tackle on running back Jahmyr Gibbs that occurred just a few plays later. No flag was thrown on that play either.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nThis brings Luvu's total in fines up to $33,766 for plays in which no flags were thrown during the game. Of course, the financial blow is likely lessened by the fact that Luvu and the Commanders are NFC Championship-bound this weekend, Jan. 26.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nFrankie Luvu and the Commanders' impressive postseason run\n\nThe Washington Commanders have been one of the more compelling stories this NFL postseason. After amassing a 12-5 record during the regular season behind rookie quarterback sensation Jayden Daniels, the Commanders have been tearing through the NFL playoffs with sheer determination to reach the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe Commanders picked up a big Wild Card Round victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 23-20, to start things off. Next, Daniels and company pulled off a major upset against the Detroit Lions, thwarting the Super Bowl favorites. Now, the Commanders will face off against division rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game, where the winner will punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\nAd\n\nSyndication: Detroit Free Press - Source: Imagn\n\nBoth teams have played each other twice this season already, splitting their series 1-1 ahead of Sunday's matchup. If Daniels can lead his team to victory over Jalen Hurts and Philadelphia, he'll become the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to start a Super Bowl. Of course, Washington shouldn't look past Philadelphia just yet, as the Eagles have been playoff regulars for the past several years, playing in a Super Bowl as recently as 2023 when they were defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAd\n\nThe Eagles are equally motivated, as Jalen Hurts is seeking the first Super Bowl victory of his NFL career, as he wasn't yet on the team when the Eagles defeated the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots for the Lombardi Trophy in 2018. That Eagles squad was led by Nick Foles, who was filling in for the injured Carson Wentz that season.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will visit the Philadelphia Eagles for the NFC Championship game tomorrow (Sunday, January 26, 2025) from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "There is the power of the president, and then there is the power of the courts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has used his first days to try to remake government and society. In some cases, the president will have the powers he assumes, but a torrent of a legal challenges will show that, in other cases, he does not.\n\nMany of those cases will come down to just how much power the courts decide federal agencies will have to carry out Trump\u2019s plans. And a Supreme Court decision from last year will likely matter a lot here.\n\nMarketplace Senior Washington Correspondent Kimberly Adams recently joined \u201cMarketplace Morning Report\u201d host Sabri Ben-Achour to explain what\u2019s known as the \u201cChevron deference\u201d and what may come in its place since SCOTUS overturned it. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nSabri Ben-Achour: So Chevron deference was the idea that whenever there is a debate over a regulation something unclear about it, a court should give deference to the federal agency involved in interpreting it, give the federal agency the benefit of the doubt. Remind us why the Supreme Court rolled that whole thing back.\n\nKimberly Adams: So opponents of this idea had been complaining for a long time that federal agencies were overreaching in their rules and regulations, and effectively doing the work of Congress. And, in a series of cases, the Supreme Court agreed. So now when there\u2019s a disagreement over some federal agency\u2019s policy, the deference is supposed to go to the Court\u2019s interpretation of whatever law was being used to justify the regulation, rather than the agency\u2019s interpretation.\n\nBen-Achour: Now, this move was celebrated by conservatives at the time, but now it is a conservative administration that\u2019s in charge of these agencies. So is this a good thing for the Trump administration?\n\nAdams: Potentially. I\u2019ve talked to several conservative lawyers and economists who see the ruling, along with the administration friendly to regulatory rollbacks, as a good combination. Devin Watkins is an attorney at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nDevin Watkins: We\u2019re now looking and trying to decide exactly how much power these agencies have to interpret things and, for interpretations that the agencies have had in the past, how many of those are actually valid.\n\nAdams: [That\u2019s] with the idea that past regulations that may be on shaky ground post-Chevron could get struck down in court. This has come up a lot in the context of the planned Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBen-Achour: This shift in policy, this end to the deference given to a government agency, that could work against the Trump administration, right?\n\nAdams: Right. I mean, just like old regulations can be challenged, so can new ones. Neil Chilson is head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute, which is a think tank focused on technology and innovation.\n\nNeil Chilson: In areas with big rule-making agencies \u2014 and so if you think EPA, Department of Energy, transportation and telecommunications \u2014 those are probably the big spaces where the courts will apply a less deferential approach.\n\nAdams: So we may see opponents of new rules and regulations coming out of the Trump White House deploy this tool as well to get a court to limit the reach of what these agencies can do without Congress under Trump.",

Central Asia\u2019s largest producer has instead announced plans to raise oil output in 2025.\n\nThe work on expanding Tengiz, among the world\u2019s biggest oil fields that represents about 1% of global production, has seen delays and cost overruns. Now, the field will generate $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 for Chevron and $5 billion in 2026 at oil prices of $60, Neff said.\n\nMost of the lighter-grade oil will go to Europe and Asia, he added. Tengiz currently produces about 700,000 barrels of crude per day.\n\nChevron \u201cachieving this in January likely bodes well for the company, given the prior delays with the projects\u201d in Kazakhstan, RBC Europe Ltd. analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note on Friday.\n\nTengiz is central to Chevron\u2019s pledge to grow its global production, and the delays have weighed on the company\u2019s stock.\n\nNeff stressed the importance of the Kazakhstan asset in the upstream portfolio. With 1 million boed in 2025, it\u2019s about the same as Chevron\u2019s U.S. Permian Basin output, which is also expected to reach 1 million barrels a day this year\n\nChevron plans, however, to reduce its capital expenditures by about 10% in the Permian, which covers the region of West Texas and New Mexico.",

Polson, chairman and managing partner at Fisher Phillips, said Wednesday during a webinar hosted by the law firm.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision last summer in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo is a source of much of this hand wringing. The ruling overturned the Chevron doctrine, which held that US courts should give substantial deference to federal agency decisions.\n\n\u201cAnd that has started a massive shift in the way that the power structure exists in our country and it took it away from the federal agencies and shifted it to the courts,\u201d Polson said.\n\nThe Chevron doctrine, which was named after a landmark 1984 ruling involving the oil and gas company, had required courts to defer to an agency\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of ambiguous laws passed by Congress. Although critics argued that it gave federal agencies too much power in drafting regulations, proponents warned that overturning Chevron would threaten the agencies\u2019 ability to draft regulations in areas such as the workplace, healthcare, the environment and nuclear energy, making it more difficult to implement laws passed by Congress. Medicare and Medicaid regulate nursing home and home care, so many facilities and agencies are subject to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulations. But all long-term care providers also are affected by the actions of other federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and its Wage and Hour Division and Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe Chevron decision \u201cis going to create a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Polson said. \u201cThe regulation on which a business may function that creates the platform for the business may get struck down. And then it\u2019s just swirling in a world of uncertainty. And another fear is that in addition to the courts stepping in, because that will be their job, the states will step in. And that means 50 different sets of rules. And we have grave concerns about that.\u201d\n\nEffect on differing state regulations, legislation\n\nThe decision will hurt business between states, Polson noted.\n\n\u201cWe write often about the so-called patchwork that\u2019s in the slide of state regulation and state legislation and the impediment to business,\u201d he said. \u201cOur economy, our business system is built upon an assumption that you can do business across state lines, interstate commerce without interference. And yet, this patchwork at some point will become a bit of an iron curtain between the states, making it very difficult for businesses to operate across state lines, and Loper and the Chevron doctrine going away could make that a lot worse.\u201d\n\nPolson noted that the High Court\u2019s ruling already has affected employers. For example, he said, the Labor Department\u2019s overtime rule and the Federal Trade Commission noncompete ban were overruled using this decision.",

The elimination of that 40-year-old precedent last June may upend the regulatory landscape across the Rocky Mountain West. It is woven deep within almost every lawsuit involving energy development, the Endangered Species Act, forest management, pollution control, water use and similar federal fighting words.\n\n\u201cWhat kinds of public lands cases does it affect? I would say every one,\u201d Montana environmental law attorney Tim Bechtold said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of a single timber sale case, ESA case or water case where Chevron wasn\u2019t in the background.\u201d\n\nChevron deference arose from the 1984 Supreme Court decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Federal judges first look to Congress for laws governing federal actions. But if the law wasn\u2019t clear, or Congress delegated rule-making power to a federal agency, \u201cChevron deference\u201d directed judges to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law, as long as it was reasonable. The presumption was that those agencies had the scientific, financial or technical experts needed to administer the will of Congress.\n\nFor example, the Endangered Species Act gives grizzly bears protection as a threatened species in all the Lower 48 states. When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published its new rule for recovering grizzlies , it revised that 48-state range to just Washington and parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. This area is known as a Distinct Population Segment, or DPS.\n\n\u201cThe Fish and Wildlife Service has a policy that allows for listing and delisting geographically discrete populations,\u201d said Earthjustice attorney Tim Preso of Bozeman. \u201cThose distinct population segments, and the Service\u2019s authority to declare their discreetness and significance, was upheld by the courts on Chevron grounds. It\u2019s fundamental to ESA cases.\u201d\n\nStakeholders challenging a government action might present their own experts in court, hoping to show the government\u2019s position was unreasonable or unfounded \u2014 what the law calls \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Chevron deference made that a high bar, because it directed judges to assume the administrative agency had the best collection of facts.\n\n\u201c[Supreme Court Chief Justice John] Roberts declared ... judges \u2014 not agency experts \u2014 should have the final say on what\u2019s best for all of us, no matter how complicated or technical the subject matter.\u201d \u2013 Robert Klee, Yale Center for Business and the Environment\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens wrote the original Chevron opinion, and noted that judges \u201c are not experts in the field , and are not part of either political branch of Government.\u201d In other words, someone with a juris doctorate degree may know little about grizzly population dynamics, mine waste hydrology or forest regeneration rates, but they will have to make decisions on those highly technical fields. Agencies do have experts in those fields, and Stevens noted, they are responsive to voters who can elect new political leaders if they don\u2019t like the current ones.\n\nBut in the Supreme Court case Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo last June, a six-justice majority ruled that judges \u201cmust now exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency acted within its statutory authority, even when a statute is ambiguous,\u201d according to the Sidley Environmental and Energy Brief of the case . The review added it anticipated challenges to Environmental Protection Agency regulations, especially those related to the Clean Air Act. That law, passed 54 years ago, has no reference to climate change yet is being used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service this month ruled that grizzlies, like Bear 793 (aka Blondie) and her cubs, would remain on the endangered species list. Decisions like this, with the elimination of Chevron deference, could be left up to federal judges, not FWS. Photo by Charlie Lansche\n\nRobert Klee at the Yale Center for Business and the Environment said Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 ruling replaced judicial humility with hubris\n\n\u201cRoberts declared that there must always be a \u2018single, best meaning\u2019 of a statute, and judges \u2014 not agency experts \u2014 should have the final say on what\u2019s best for all of us, no matter how complicated or technical the subject matter,\u201d Klee wrote. \u201cThis seismic shift resets the balance of power between branches of government (generally favoring the courts) and between regulators and regulated industries (generally favoring the regulated).\u201d\n\nIn her dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan warned of a \u201cmassive shock to the legal system\u201d as stakeholders unhappy with federal regulations act on this chance to rewrite the rulebooks. But that could cut multiple ways, as both defenders and developers of public lands have hit agency roadblocks in court.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of federal agencies, like the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, which manage most of the federal public lands, that have been largely captured by the entities they regulate \u2014 timber companies, mining interests, etc.\u201d Stanford Law Professor Deborah Sivas wrote. \u201cThese agencies often seek Chevron deference for pro-development and pro-extraction rules and decisions. Many of our community partners in those circumstances might well be happy to see Chevron gone.\u201d\n\nEarthjustice\u2019s Preso added that the opinion appears to discourage re-litigating old cases decided by Chevron deference.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court wasn\u2019t looking to totally upset the apple cart on every past decision where Chevron played a role,\u201d Preso said. \u201cFor example, the DPS decision would get some consideration as precedent, because it was decided under a different rule of Chevron than today. But going forward, when statutory interpretation comes up, it\u2019s the judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d",

            "content": "Expectations are sky-high for the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Many Venezuelans, including leading voices in the opposition, grew tired of the Biden administration\u2019s unwillingness to bring serious financial consequences to the Maduro regime following its brazen election theft in July 2024. Specifically, members of opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and president-elect Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia\u2019s teams have called for the suspension of Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licenses permitting the Maduro regime to operate jointly with Western oil companies to pump Venezuelan oil. The Biden administration rebuffed these calls and kept the licenses intact.\n\nOriginally, the Biden administration lifted sanctions on the Maduro regime in exchange for democratic concessions and promises of a freer and fairer election. Almost immediately, the regime violated these agreements and failed to keep its long-term promises on democratic openings and human rights. After announcements of Venezuela sanctions \u201csnap back,\u201d the Biden administration began issuing licenses\u2014this time, on national security grounds and without transparency. Indeed, when asked directly about the licenses and the lack of justification for maintaining them, Biden administration officials struggled to explain why the licenses remained active when the conditions under which they were granted would mandate their revocation. Biden administration officials constantly reiterated that sanctions policy is under constant review.\n\nThe result has been clear. After getting caught red-handed by an organized and competitive opposition, Maduro nevertheless maintains an important financial lifeline\u2014funded by Western oil companies\u2014despite clamping down on the opposition and pushing Venezuela to one of the world\u2019s most repressive authoritarian regimes that is actively committing, according to the International Criminal Court, crimes against humanity.\n\nNevertheless, by the end of 2024, Venezuela achieved a four-year high in both oil production and export. Given the decrepit state of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, this would be an impossible task without the assistance and partnership of Western oil firms. Venezuela\u2019s democratic opposition has estimated that Maduro has raked in billions operating joint ventures\u2014in the ballpark of $500 million per month. This is real money that Maduro can use to pay off regime insiders and maintain power.\n\nThe Trump administration has an opportunity to move in a different direction. In his Senate confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio addressed the issue of oil licenses for Venezuela. \u201cThey have these general licenses where companies like Chevron are actually providing billions of dollars of money into the regime\u2019s coffers, and the regime kept none of the promises that they made,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that needs to be re-explored.\u201d Trump, too, said recently that the United States does not need Venezuelan oil and should revisit the issue of licenses. In his first 24 hours, Rubio held a meeting with Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez to express his support.\n\nReticence on Licenses\n\nThe Biden administration justified the use of oil licenses for the Maduro regime with several principal arguments. Those arguments are summarized, examined, deconstructed, and ultimately, rejected here.\n\nOil Licenses Provide Greater Transparency in the Industry.\n\nPartly as a result of sanctions and mostly because of pervasive corruption, the Venezuelan oil industry has been impaired by economic informality, increasing its inefficiency and opacity. Under sanctions, oil exports have been deviated to black markets, with big discounts that favored corruption and reduced fiscal incomes. Nontraditional firms, including shell corporations, have increased their role in the oil industry. The cryptocurrency scandal overseen by the now-imprisoned former oil minister Tareck El Aissami, which resulted in the deviation of billions of dollars through fraudulent invoices and payments in cryptocurrency, is representative of these challenges.\n\nThe Biden administration argued that oil licenses brought transparency back because traditional oil firms\u2014Chevron, Maurel & Prom, Eni, and Repsol\u2014have displaced nontraditional firms. Meanwhile, exports are conducted through regular channels\u2014with no black-market discounts. Requirements from OFAC on reporting ensure publicly available data.\n\nHowever, this position does not consider how Chevron, Maurel & Prom, Eni, and Repsol perform oil activities. These firms signed contracts governed by the so-called 2020 Anti-Blockade Law, which covers production and commercialization activities, abolishes checks and balances, and enforces confidential conditions. Therefore, the new oil contracts, including agreements to distribute oil rents between private investors and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA), are confidential. Licenses have not restored transparency in the Venezuelan oil industry due to the Anti-Blockade Law.\n\nOil licenses have not brought the expected transparency on where Maduro is spending oil money and the extent to which he is receiving royalties and tax revenues. The regime stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago. Neither the regime nor any of the companies operating in Venezuela have made public the terms of the agreements allowing them to operate. Furthermore, oil activities not covered by the licenses, including the operations of PDVSA, and China and Russia\u2019s joint ventures, result in opaque incomes.\n\nLastly, General License 41, which authorized Chevron to operate joint ventures in Venezuela, prohibits the payment of \u201cany taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela,\u201d giving the false impression that Maduro will not receive any income, mainly based on royalties and taxes. However, as many analysts concluded, Maduro gets a share of the income derived from the oil activities of Chevron, Maurel & Prom, Eni, and Repsol. The exact amount of that share is unknown because of the confidential rule imposed by the Anti-Blockade Law. Moreover, in what would appear to be a clear violation of General License 41, Bloombergreported recently that Chevron filed millions in taxes in Venezuela.\n\nTherefore, there is no public information about how much money the Maduro regime captured from oil revenues or how those incomes are spent. Taking aside the confidentiality imposed by the Anti-Blockade Law, the management of the Maduro regime\u2019s national budget is not subject to checks and balances, transparency, or accountability, explaining why Venezuela is considered among the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\nAccording to some specialists, the regime\u2019s take could be 50 percent of the production undertaken by Chevron, Maurel & Prom, Eni, and Repsol. That production accounts for approximately one-third of Venezuela\u2019s total output. Based on this estimation, OFAC licenses may have provided an income of up to $3.2 billion annually to the Maduro regime. Rather than enforce transparency, this income has enhanced the fiscal capacity to advance in corruption and systematic human rights violations.\n\nOil Licenses Provide a Modest Contribution to Global Energy Security, Especially for Gulf Coast Refineries Accustomed to Refining Venezuelan Crude\n\nThe Biden administration also argued that Venezuela had resumed its role as a strategic energy partner of the United States following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast now have access to a reliable oil supply from Venezuela.\n\nHowever, Venezuela\u2019s oil supply is unstable because Maduro has not tackled the root cause of the oil industry\u2019s collapse: predatory institutions that expropriated private property rights and suppressed PDVSA\u2019s technical autonomy. As CSIS has explored elsewhere, the numbers do not add up. To resume production to the famed levels of 1998, when Chavismo first took over the country, the oil industry will require major institutional reform and political stability. But Maduro cannot provide either of those conditions; rather, the regime has promoted an institutional solution based on the Anti-Blockade Law, which exacerbates the country\u2019s rule of law challenges. There is a reason, after all, that Chevron\u2019s production has remained relatively stable at approximately 220,000 barrels per day.\n\nOil Licenses Can Relieve Sanctions Pressure and Thereby Reduce Migration, Another Key U.S. Objective with Venezuela\n\nThe outflow of refugees and migrants from Venezuela is one of the largest displacement crises in the world, with almost 7.8 million migrants and refugees as of December 2024\u2014even bigger than Syria or Ukraine, both countries that are at war or had internal conflict. The root causes that generated this unprecedented flow of migrants and refugees remain unchanged: democratic breakdown, repression, and a lack of basic human rights combined with a deep economic crisis driven by mismanagement, devastating policies, 800 percent inflation, and a kleptocracy that has characterized the Chavez and Maduro regimes for the last 25 years.\n\nEven though some still blame the imposition of U.S. sanctions for degrading standards of living in Venezuela, the reality is that Venezuela\u2019s economic and humanitarian deterioration hit the hardest in 2014, before the application of broad U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Biden administration viewed sanctions relief as a means to ameliorate the economic drivers of migration from Venezuela. However, the numbers continued to increase while Biden was in office. Federal authorities reported nearly one million encounters at the southern border with Venezuelan nationals last year. This further evidences the fact that, contrary to Maduro\u2019s rhetoric, sanctions themselves are not what is fueling the migration crisis. Rather, the regime has been remarkably successful at centralizing the wealth accumulated from sanctions relief at the top, while Venezuela\u2019s middle and lower classes remain out in the cold.\n\nNot only have targeted economic sanctions limited Maduro\u2019s ability to finance his regime\u2019s activities by reducing oil and illegal mining earnings, but they have also strained his inner circle. His control over state institutions and assets is slipping along with public confidence in his regime, which was evidenced by his epic loss in the July 2024 presidential election.\n\nOil Licenses Can Help Better Human Rights Practices in the Country with the Western Private Sector Present\n\nThe Biden administration has argued that human rights practices could improve with incentives to maintain the oil licenses and Western oil companies present in Venezuela. But more oil money gives Maduro more resources to fuel repression and human rights violations. Although government revenues have been used in the past to bankroll social programs, Maduro\u2019s regime has always neglected to provide basic necessities to Venezuelans, such as food, clean water, medicine, and electricity. Instead, the regime usually profits directly from these revenues, funding illicit projects, buying the loyalty of military officials, and increasing arbitrary detentions of members of the opposition, human rights defenders, and social leaders.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recently released a report stating that the Maduro regime\u2019s repression and political persecution have intensified in response to citizen protests against his electoral fraud. Around 300 spontaneous demonstrations have been violently suppressed by state security forces and pro-regime civilian groups. The regime\u2019s Operation \u201cTun Tun\u201d has resulted in at least 25 deaths, more than 2,000 arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, acts of torture, and other grave human rights violations. Security forces are still conducting raids without warrants, mass arrests, and perpetrating systematic violence against innocent Venezuelans.\n\nThese human rights violations and practices of \u201cstate terrorism\u201d stem from the fact that the executive branch has taken control of most state institutions. Coupled with widespread corruption, the regime has acted with total impunity\u2014even when they expropriated over 1,000 companies in the early 2000s. Therefore, the country\u2019s lack of constitutional order and rule of law represents a risk for the Western private sector, being at the mercy of a regime that can punish companies instantly if not in compliance with regime demands. Sadly, oil-rich Venezuela is at the dire end of economic indices from the World Bank and the World Economic Forum and represents no incentive for either national or international companies to do business or to promote better human rights.\n\nOil Licenses Keep the \u201cAxis of Authoritarians\u201d at Bay in Venezuela\n\nSome analysts express concern for a concert of powers\u2014China, Russia, and Iran\u2014that support Maduro and see his survival as existential to their national interest. In general, these analysts believe U.S. policy has pushed this bloc of countries closer together by encouraging the sharing of sanctions-busting strategies, corruption schemes, and the transplantation of survival strategies, rather than the axis of authoritarians realizing their mutual interests can be best pursued together and with coordination. The Biden administration worried that the partnership of the axis countries would prevent the United States from peeling any one country off the alliance and therefore away from Maduro.\n\nHowever, Maduro long ago made his bed with the authoritarian axis. For years, he has been ensconced in a web of authoritarian leaders. Following the Biden administration\u2019s sanctions lifting on the Maduro regime, the regime could send its oil practically anywhere in the world. Despite a wide-open playing field, China remained the top destination for Venezuela\u2019s oil in 2024. In addition, licenses have not displaced the role of China and Russia, which are still relevant players in Venezuela\u2019s production and will remain in that role under the Maduro government. Notably, China needs to control oil production to ensure the repayment of billions in debt facility by past loan agreements.\n\nOil Licenses Keep U.S. and Western Oil Companies from Being Expropriated and Turned Over to Axis Countries\n\nAnother concern frequently cited is the potential for the Maduro administration to expropriate Western oil operations in the event of licenses being revoked. Many analysts also cite a fear of expropriation being to the benefit of Russia, Iran, and China, which might move in to take over these operations. This set of concerns is not new for the Trump administration\u2014a license for Chevron in the first Trump administration mandated it cease activity in Venezuela, except for the ability to maintain equipment and pay staff, thus reducing the likelihood of expropriation.\n\nFurther, there are many \u201cif-then statements\u201d contained in this line of argument.\n\nIf Maduro expropriates in response to the revocation of licenses\n\nIf fellow authoritarians express an interest in a greater role in the Venezuelan oil industry\n\nIf Maduro then hands Western operations to axis powers\n\nThere is reason to believe, however, that Russia, China, and Iran do not have much interest in growing their presence in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. China has lent more than $60 billion to Venezuela and would like its money back. Iran is girding for a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign and reeling from economic hardship and the loss of its so-called axis of resistance in the Middle East. And Russia, perhaps the most likely Venezuelan partner interested, has a financial interest in seeing less oil on the international market\u2014even sanctioned oil\u2014to keep its own coffers full and thus fund its war machine in Ukraine.\n\nReturning to a Pressure Campaign\n\nThe arguments in favor of maintaining oil licenses have not held up, while the conditions on the ground in Venezuela have changed dramatically since July 2024. U.S. sanctions policy, too, should change accordingly.\n\nSanctions should continue to be leveraged as an instrument of pressure against the Maduro regime. Polling demonstrates that the longer Maduro stays in power, the more Venezuelans will flee. Although Maduro has promised to keep migrants in Venezuela, he cannot make these promises in good faith. Venezuelans are fleeing because of Maduro\u2019s theft and subsequent repression.\n\nAlthough oil licenses are not the only element of U.S. policy toward Venezuela that is likely to change, the most basic starting point for pressure against Maduro is a revocation of current oil licenses allowing Western firms to partner with PDVSA.\n\nRyan C.

Wagner fighters have left their mark across Africa, Syria, and Ukraine \u2014 most notably in the grinding battles in the country's Donetsk Oblast, where they spearheaded Russia's offensive from 2022 to 2023.\n\nHowever, in June 2023, Prigozhin fell out with the Kremlin and led an armed rebellion, only to abruptly call it off after negotiations with Putin. Two months later, in August 2023, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, an incident that many independent observers have pinned on Putin as the likely orchestrator.\n\nWagner's activities in Africa\n\nIn March 2021, Igor Smirnov wrote an email to Prigozhin's Concord Group, saying that retired Russian officers were expected to take part in attacks on foreign infrastructure facilities in West Africa.\n\nSmirnov, allegedly a former Russian intelligence officer who claimed to be working for oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was attempting to frame or warn the group. Khodorkovsky's spokesman Maxim Dbar told the Kyiv Independent that he did not know Smirnov, and he had never worked for Khodorkovsky.\n\nSmirnov claimed that \"a group of Russians is contacting many armed groups in West Africa, including Ansaru, an Al Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria.\"\n\n\"In exchange for attacks on Western oil companies, jihadists are helping to arm militants in the Niger Delta under a direct agreement with the Russians,\" Smirnov said. \"After the first attacks on Western companies, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb will take responsibility for that.\"\n\nSupporters of Niger's National Council of Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) wave the Niger national flag (R) and flag bearing the logo of private military company Wagner, as they protest outside the Niger and French airbase to demand the departure of the French army from Niger, in Niamey on Sept. 16, 2023. (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe also claimed that he had video and audio recordings implicating a Wagner mercenary in the negotiations about the attacks.\n\n\"All of this will soon come crashing down on your company, which destabilizes the situation in West Africa, cooperates with terrorists, and is waging an indirect war against the West,\" Smirnov added.\n\nIn another email, Smirnov also accused Wagner Group of extorting money from U.S. oil company Chevron in exchange for the security of the company's pipelines in Nigeria. He claimed that the extortion had been \"documented by Khodorkovsky.\"\n\nHe also attached a video that allegedly shows an associate of Wagner Group's chief of staff, Andrei Troshev, meeting with Nigerian warlord Asari Dokubo.\n\nThis is not the first time Wagner mercenaries stand accused of illegal activities in Africa.\n\nJournalist Orkhan Dzhemal, film director Alexander Rastorguyev, and cameraman Kirill Radchenko were killed in the Central African Republic in 2018 while investigating the activities of Wagner mercenaries there.\n\nIn 2019, Khodorkovsky's Dossier Center published an investigation according to which Wagner Group could have been behind the murder.\n\nChevron did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKilled Wagner fighters\n\nThe emails obtained by Channel 24 also reveal the consequences of Wagner Group's participation in Russia's offensives in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, including the Battle of Bakhmut, in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWagner Group recruited thousands of convicts who were pardoned by Putin in exchange for military service.\n\nThe convicts routinely took part in human wave attacks in Bakhmut and other areas, suffering disproportionately high casualties in the grinding offensives.\n\nStarting from January 2023, many people sent emails to Wagner asking the company about their killed relatives and compensation for their deaths.\n\nIn January 2023, Ekaterina Merzlyak wrote that a 25-year-old Wagner fighter had been killed in December 2022 and later buried in the village of Krasnoselkup in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District.\n\n\"Fellow villagers are outraged that not a single representative of the local authorities showed due respect to the parents of our hero,\" she said. \"They did not assist with the organization of the funeral or with transportation. There was complete silence as if nothing had happened.\"\n\nScreenshot of Wagner mercenary group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the \"Razgruzka Vagnera\" Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)\n\nMerzlyak also wrote that his \"father had to transport the coffin himself with a trailer over a bumpy winter road for five hours, despite the fact that our administration finds it easy to bring in some singer by helicopter for City Day celebrations.\"\n\nThe correspondence also contains emails written by prison inmates' mothers asking Wagner to recruit their sons.\n\n\"Dear Yevgeny Viktorovich (Prigozhin), I am asking for your help! Please help my son redeem himself,\" one of them wrote to Prigozhin in November 2022. \"My son went to Moscow to earn a living. Unfortunately, he got into trouble there and ended up in pretrial detention.\"\n\nShe wrote to Prigozizhin, asking him \"to help my son get to the front\" and saying that \"he is very eager for your help!\"\n\nA man named Andrei Lapshin wrote in April 2023 that his 15-year old son, a cadet at a military school, is \"deeply engaged in the patriotic agenda, sees his future in the ranks of Russian law enforcement agencies and is an avid fan of Wagner Group.\"\n\n\"Therefore, I would like to ask for your help in possibly arranging a job for him during the summer break \u2014 so that he doesn't waste his time working at some chain caf\u00e9 or as a courier, but rather gets involved in a real, serious, necessary, and useful task for our Motherland,\" Lapshin added.\n\nSome other emails were more critical of Wagner Group's activities.\n\nA woman named Dinara Satanova wrote in July 2023 that the hands of Wagner Group's leadership were \"stained with the blood of our children, husbands, and brothers.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the facts of killings, abuse, denial of medical assistance, and starvation, despite all efforts to conceal them,\" she said.\n\nSatanova said that Wagner's drive to recruit convicts was \"like slave trade from which the company made millions.\"\n\n\"You have destroyed and ruined our families, our children,\" she said. \"On what grounds were children under the age of 22 recruited? Mothers were not informed, and no consent was given.\"\n\nFood poisoning scandal\n\nApart from military activities, the correspondence covers Concord Group's food procurement schemes.\n\nIn 2019, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's team exposed Concord Group's low-quality food deliveries to schools and kindergartens in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which resulted in the poisoning of hundreds of children.\n\nAmid the scandal, many parents sent emails to Concord Group and demanded compensation.\n\nIn response to the accusations, in August 2019, Prigozhin accused Navalny and his associate Lyubov Sobol of orchestrating the poisoning, according to the leaked correspondence.\n\nHe claimed that Navalny and Sobol \"extorted 300 million rubles ($3 million) to avoid stirring up a scandal regarding the children.\"\n\nA portrait of late head of Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, displayed at a makeshift memorial in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 27, 2023. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We have made significant progress in this investigation and do not rule out the possibility that the poisoning incident was the result of a blatant act of sabotage, as numerous facts suggest,\" Prigozhin said. \"As you know, Sobol is a person willing to commit any crime to become a politician... We have witnesses who confirm that Sobol was directly involved in the children's illness.\"\n\nHe claimed that Sobol and Navalny \"could have been the masterminds and organizers of this terrible crime.\"\n\nDespite Prigozhin's claims, even a Russian court recognized in 2019 that Concord Group was to blame for the food poisoning and ordered it to pay compensation.\n\nNavalny himself survived a poisoning attempt in 2020.\n\nA joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent by agents of Russia's Federal Security Service.\n\nIn February 2024, Navalny died in a Russian prison. Independent experts say that he was either killed intentionally or died due to harsh conditions and lack of medical treatment.\n\nNavalny's team did not respond to a request for comment.",

The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices topped $80 per barrel on Jan. 15 after closing out 2024 closer to $70 per barrel. Geopolitical policy is driving higher prices.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the U.S. hit Russia with strict sanctions, driving up prices. To quote a press release by the U.S. Department of State: \"The United States is imposing sanctions today on more than 200 entities and individuals involved in Russia's energy sector and identifying more than 180 vessels as blocked property. This wide-ranging, robust action will further constrain revenues from Russia's energy resources and degrade [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's ability to fund his illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nAssuming consistent demand, higher oil prices can increase oil companies' profits. But if demand falls due to an economic slowdown, it can erode some benefits of higher profit margins.\n\nAs the two largest U.S. oil and gas companies by market capitalization, ExxonMobil (XOM -0.93%) and Chevron (CVX 0.41%) are natural choices for investors looking for dividend stocks in the oil patch. But that doesn't necessarily mean these two majors will benefit the most from higher oil prices.\n\nConsistency you can count on\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron have geographically diverse global production assets with sizable refining segments and low-carbon ventures. They also have rock-solid balance sheets and decades of dividend increases -- 42 consecutive years for ExxonMobil and 37 years for Chevron.\n\nIn December, ExxonMobil updated its corporate plan, including new cost savings targets, earnings and cash-flow expectations, capital return program goals, and more through 2030. By defining clear objectives over five years, ExxonMobil is holding itself accountable and painting a big picture for long-term investors to look past quarterly results.\n\nSimilarly, Chevron expects to deliver further structural cost savings of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2026 while maintaining a low-cost, high-margin production portfolio.\n\nExxon and Chevron are avoiding overexpansion, which would leave them more vulnerable during a downturn. So investors shouldn't expect either company to aggressively ramp up spending just because oil prices are going up. Rather, the focus is to turn a profit even during periods of mediocre oil prices to support capital expenditures and dividend increases.\n\nIn its latest corporate plan update, ExxonMobil charted a path toward a breakeven level of $30 per barrel Brent (the international benchmark) by 2030. Through 2030, it expects to generate $110 billion in surplus cash at $55 per barrel Brent and $280 billion in surplus cash at $85 per barrel Brent. The key is to leave room for upside potential without betting the farm on oil prices going up.\n\nSince both companies are focused more on production quality than quantity, the bulk of excess profits would probably go toward higher stock buybacks.mChevron sports a slightly higher dividend yield of 4.1% compared to 3.6% for ExxonMobil, but both companies can be excellent passive income sources and foundational energy stocks to buy now.\n\nHigher risk, higher potential reward\n\nThe greatest beneficiaries of higher oil prices are leveraged companies or companies with higher breakeven levels. Higher oil prices have a way of making even low-quality businesses look attractive. However, only the best businesses can do well when the tide goes out during periods of lower oil prices.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY -1.90%), Diamondback Energy (FANG -1.53%), and Devon Energy (DVN -3.06%) aren't bad businesses, but they are pure-play exploration and production (E&P) companies that all made splashy acquisitions in 2024. These acquisitions can help all three companies produce outsize free cash flow when oil prices are high. However, they can also leave balance sheets strained when oil prices are low.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy, and Diamondback Energy have far higher financial debt-to-equity leverage ratios than ExxonMobil and Chevron -- showcasing how the capital structure of these E&Ps is more dependent on debt.\n\nEach E&P pays a dividend, but they aren't nearly as reliable as ExxonMobil and Chevron. Occidental Petroleum slashed its quarterly payout to just $0.01 per share in 2020. Diamondback and Devon have historically paid variable dividends that fluctuate based on the business's underlying performance, making them inconsistent options for investors looking for a predictable passive income stream.\n\nHowever, E&Ps can outperform the majors and the energy sector when oil prices are going up. For example, Devon Energy is up 17.4% year to date at the time of this writing compared to an 8.8% gain for the energy sector.\n\nMaintain a long-term view with the energy sector\n\nBefore investing in the energy sector, it is important to understand how different industries within the sector respond to oil prices and each company's risk/potential reward profile.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron may not boom to the same extent as leveraged E&Ps when prices are rising, but they also have raised their dividends even during brutal industrywide slowdowns. Both provide a good starting point for investors who are new to the sector and are seeking foundational holdings, whereas most E&Ps are riskier but also have higher potential rewards.\n\nIf you're still looking for an E&P to buy now, consider ConocoPhillips (COP -0.57%). It is arguably the highest-quality company in the industry, has a low cost of production, and has a path for dividend growth.\n\nLong-term investors should focus more on the companies that have what it takes to perform well no matter the cycle rather than trying to make a quick buck by betting on the riskiest names during an upswing in oil prices.",

The Monarchs finish the four-game home stand Saturday against Coastal Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play and execute an offense in which we are willing to share (the ball), in which we\u2019re willing to play for one another,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWhen ODU (8-12 overall, 4-4 Sun Belt) won at Louisiana and South Alabama on a recent road trip, \u201cour assist numbers were way up. We averaged about 15 assists per game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at way less than 10 now. I think that is a very glaring stat that anybody in our program should be able to look at and say, \u2018Hey, this is an issue.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pointing fingers at any one person. This is a collective thing. We\u2019ve got to coach them to share the ball better. They\u2019ve got to execute to share the ball better.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchs took nine more shots than JMU (11-9, 4-4) and outscored the Dukes 21-19 from the foul line. But JMU shot well, making 25-of-46 shots (54.3 percent) while ODU shot poorly (18-of-55, 32.7).\n\nJones said some of those misses were the result of poor shot selection.\n\nRobert Davis Jr. led ODU with 23 points while freshman guard Jaden Johnson added 14 and senior Sean Durugordon 10 points, 10 rebounds, and five steals.\n\nODU still led, 25-22, with 5:42 left in the first half following a Davis three-point shot.\n\nBut then the bottom fell out, as JMU went on a 15-2 run and took a 10-point lead, 37-27, a 20-point swing over 12 minutes.\n\nBryce Lindsay, a transfer from Texas A&M, scored 12 of JMU\u2019s 15 points during the comeback.\n\nJohnson\u2019s jump shot with three seconds left allowed ODU to trim to the lead to eight, 37-29, at the half.\n\nODU center Caelum Swanton-Rodger trimmed the lead to five with a pair of foul shots three minutes into the second half.\n\nBut then JMU went on a quick, 10-0 run, as Mark Freeman made a layup, Eddie Ricks III a three-point shot, and Ricks and AJ Smith back-to-back breakaway dunks.\n\nSmith\u2019s free throw made it 47-32, JMU, four minutes into the second half.\n\nSwanton-Rodger trimmed the lead to 58-50 with a layup six minutes into the second half, but that was as close as ODU would get.\n\nJones called the turnout of 6,008 \u201camazing\u201d given the four inches of snow that fell in Norfolk. More than 700 students picked up tickets on Wednesday.\n\nThe temperature dipped below 20 by the time the game ended.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that as frustrated and bothered as I am, that I say that ultimately, we are so blessed to be able to play where we play, to coach where we coach,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith the weather as cold as it is, for people to fight through the snow, for students to come out like they did, I can\u2019t thank Monarch Nation and our student body enough.\n\n\u201cIt really means so much to me. It warms my heart to see the support that we get. This is why this place is as a special as it is. I just can\u2019t wait for us to start playing like it.\u201d\n\nNOTE: A moment of silence was held in the first half for Gerard \u201cJerry\u201d Patrick Brunick, Jr., who passed away on Dec. 19.\n\nA native of Jacksonville, Florida, Jerry met his wife, Linda, while attending ODU. Both were avid ODU basketball fans and began supporting the Old Dominion Athletic Foundation.\n\nJerry was appointed to the ODAF Board of Trustees in 1989 and served on the board through 2023.

The shift from physical wallets to digital platforms is becoming increasingly common. Cash App has become a prominent player in the digital financial space, steadily growing in popularity. This mobile payment service allows users to send, receive, and request money from individuals and businesses alike. Since its launch in 2013, Cash App has become one of the most widely used digital wallets in the US, competing with other platforms like Venmo and Zelle. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reported that Cash App now boasts over 56 million accounts, with Block, its developer, earning over 50% of its gross profit from the app in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends\n\nThe pandemic served as a catalyst, speeding up the rising trend of app usage, especially in the financial sector. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, people increasingly relied on online platforms for shopping, highlighting the importance of contactless payments. This change in consumer habits drove a surge in app usage, enabling a smooth transition to remote and contactless transactions. Zelle, the peer-to-peer money transfer app, reported a 27% increase in network transactions during the first half of 2024, with nearly $500 billion in payments processed. In the first six months of the year, consumers and businesses completed 1.7 billion transactions across 143 million accounts, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThis mainly highlights the promising future of online payments and their continued growth across upcoming generations. In fact, Block CFO Amrita Ahuja shared with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that Cash App\u2019s payment services are particularly popular among younger consumers. Ahuja pointed out that the Cash App card, a free Visa debit card, has gained significant traction with this demographic. She also highlighted that Cash App successfully engages the younger generation through initiatives like a family program, which enables adults to sponsor accounts for teenagers.\n\nThat said, with success comes increased risk. Recently, Cash App has faced challenges, as the CFPB accused the platform of enabling widespread fraud and misleading its users. In 2023, Hindenburg Research, a well-known short seller, claimed that Block had inflated the number of Cash App users and highlighted illegal activities on the app. Block dismissed the report as \u201cfactually inaccurate and misleading.\u201d In its enforcement action, the CFPB stated that Block is legally obligated to investigate and resolve disputes regarding unauthorized transactions, but described the company\u2019s efforts as \u201cseverely lacking.\u201d Instead, Block reportedly directed users to request their banks to reverse transactions, which Block would subsequently deny. As a result, Block will pay up to $120 million in refunds to consumers, establish a 24-hour customer service program, and pay a $55 million fine.",

            "content": "What is a mine? That shouldn\u2019t be an impossible question. You would think that the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) would have a reasonable definition\u2014after all, they\u2019re charged with regulating (you won\u2019t believe this) safety and health at mines. But when MSHA inspectors showed up at KC Transport\u2019s facility in Emmett, West Virginia, it became clear that their definition was muddy at best.\n\nThat\u2019s because KC Transport\u2019s repair shop isn\u2019t a mine. It\u2019s not even particularly near any mines. KC Transport is a trucking company and its facility in Emmett is a service yard for their trucks.\n\nSo why were mine inspectors trudging about? Well, KC Transport is sometimes hired to haul coal. And the Secretary of Labor, who ultimately oversees MSHA, claimed that even though the trucks being repaired were not hauling coal or driving on a haul road, they and the maintenance yard were legally a \u201cmine\u201d subject to federal regulation under the Mine Act. But under the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, every gas station, chapel, or restaurant that caters to miners and their well-being could be a mine. If that interpretation were a canary, it\u2019s a canary that\u2019s dead before arrival at the mine entrance.\n\nKC Transport, with help from PLF, has been fighting MSHA\u2019s power grab over their facility for years. Throughout the process, the government has relied on and benefited from Chevron deference\u2014which required judges to defer to MSHA\u2019s interpretation of the Mine Act so long as it was merely reasonable, even if other interpretations would be more in line with the text of the law.\n\nTheir case ultimately landed at the Supreme Court last February, shortly before the Supreme Court overturned Chevron v. NRDC\u2014the case that created Chevron deference\u2014when it ruled in Loper Bright. After it decided Loper Bright, the Supreme Court sent KC Transport\u2019s case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to be decided without deference to MSHA.\n\nThis week, after years of litigation, KC Transport will finally get a fair hearing in court without the government getting a thumb on the scale. The DC Circuit is set to hear arguments in the case on January 24. It will be the first case after Loper Bright where the DC Circuit will have to say what the law is without applying the doctrine of deference.\n\nLoper Bright was a momentous step\u2014but only a step\u2014toward reining in the power and caprice of executive agencies. Even with Chevron overturned, there is still much to be hammered out by the courts to determine how much leeway agencies will get in interpreting the laws that empower them.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re litigating cases like KC Transport: It\u2019s one of the cases that will shape what the post-Chevron world will look like.\n\nAnother PLF case, Foster v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, was also sent back to lower courts after Loper Bright was decided. Like KC Transport, Foster\u2014in which a South Dakota family is fighting an erroneous wetland designation\u2014is once again winding its way through the legal process, this time freed from deference to the government.\n\nAnd in dozens of other cases, we\u2019ve notified the courts that they\u2019re no longer bound to defer to the government\u2019s interpretation of the law and that they can fully consider our argument and decide what the law means for themselves.\n\nThere is work to be done, and our clients are blazing a trail that will benefit every American.",

Jan. 17, 2025, capping the latest round of oil industry consolidation.\n\nThe antitrust authority, in a 3-2 decision in both cases, prohibited former executives from serving on boards or advising the companies after it \u201cuncovered troubling evidence of public statements by US oil executives as well as direct private communications between those same executives and high-level OPEC representatives that were aimed at persuading rivals to join them in colluding to cut back oil production, which would increase oil prices for Americans,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement addressing both final approvals.\n\n\u201cThis relief will help ensure that these companies seek to respond to their rivals by competing rather than subordinating their independent decision-making to the goals set by a cartel,\u201d Kahn said.\n\nMerger management\n\nIn the Exxon-Pioneer merger, the FTC prohibited founder and former Pioneer chief executive officer Scott Sheffield from serving on Exxon\u2019s board or from serving in an advisory capacity in any way to the Exxon board or Exxon\u2019s management.\n\nRepublicans on the commission blasted the majority\u2019s decision, saying \u201cthe majority fabricated one of the most ludicrous theories of harm in its merger-enforcement history\u201d in its initial complaint against Sheffield for possible collusion.\n\n\u201cThe complaint butchered both the economics and law of coordinated effects, provided absolutely no reason to believe the law has been violated, and ignored the public interest by using its complaint to obtain a consent agreement that targeted an individual who was not party to the agreement,\u201d said Melissa Holyoak, who dissented on behalf of herself and colleague, Andrew Ferguson.\n\n\u201cTo prove that the Exxon Complaint was not mere transient amnesia, the majority regurgitated its theories of harm a few months later in a complaint that challenged Chevron Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Hess Corporation,\u201d she added.\n\nHolyoak and Ferguson alleged the move was political. \u201cToday\u2019s vote should vacate the [FTC\u2019s previous] order, but instead the majority\u2019s pre-inauguration swan song disregards the public interest. As the new administration replaces the old, the public interest considerations will be more than lip service, and the continuing viability of this order should be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nThe Exxon-Pioneer merger, which marks the operator's largest since buying Mobil decades ago, more than doubles ExxonMobil's Permian basin production (OGJ Online, Nov. 6, 2023). The combined company will produce about 1.3 MMboe/d from the Permian, with 2027 output growing to an estimated 2 MMboe/d.\n\nIn the Chevron-Hess deal, the FTC prohibited Hess chief executive officer John Hess from serving on the Chevron board. But in a change from the initial order, the antitrust agency said Chevron could consult John Hess \u201csolely related to interactions and discussions with (a) Guyanese government officials about Hess\u2019s oil-related and health ministry-related activities in Guyana, and (b) the Salk Institute\u2019s Harnessing Plants Initiative.\u201d\n\nChevron agreed to acquire Hess in October 2023 for $53 billion, further diversifying the energy company\u2019s portfolio by adding the Stabroek block interests offshore Guyana and Bakken acreage to the company\u2019s existing US shale position. The deal increases Chevron\u2019s estimated 5-year production and free cash flow growth rates that the company says will extend into the next decade (OGJ Online, Oct. 23, 2023).",

            "content": "That said, high yields aren\u2019t automatically a bad sign. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks, as it shows how much income an investor can expect relative to the stock's price. However, to fully benefit from high yields, other factors like the company\u2019s cash flow, payout ratio, and dividend growth must also be considered. If these metrics are strong, high-yield stocks can still be appealing. Some reports have pointed out the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields increase, returns generally rise, and risk decreases. Hartford Funds conducted research factoring in annualized standard deviation, which measures a portfolio\u2019s return volatility, with a higher standard deviation indicating greater historical risk. The report found that from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios delivered an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps\u2014companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.\u201d\n\nOne such example is a report published by Newton Investment Management. According to the report, high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods between 1940 and 2021. The report also revealed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividends in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios surpassed low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While this result provides useful information, it doesn\u2019t offer details about the market conditions at the time, giving only a broad picture of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have paid close attention to how dividend stocks perform during market volatility, as the need for consistent income becomes more pronounced in such times. As a result, they suggest considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also have a strong history of dividend growth.\n\nDividend stocks have been investors\u2019 favorites for a long time now. Over the years, these equities have performed better than the broader market. That said, when it comes to dividend investing, opinions often split down the middle between those seeking high yields and those favoring dividend growth. Though analysts recommend buying stocks with proven tracks of dividend growth, the appeal of high yields is hard to ignore. According to analysts, investors should steer clear of yield traps and focus on companies that consistently increase the value returned to shareholders. However, those advocating yields have plenty to say about the significance of dividend yields.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe ideal situation would be when dividend growth and high yields go hand in hand, as many companies have demonstrated that this is achievable. With that being said, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with high yields to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks that have yields above 4%, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge fund investors having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company reported a 7% increase in global production for Q3 2024 compared to the previous year, setting a new record for the quarter. It continues to perform well in the Permian and has completed significant turnarounds at TCO and Gorgon ahead of schedule. These projects, along with other new initiatives expected to launch by 2025, are projected to boost Chevron's Gulf of Mexico production to 300,000 barrels per day by 2026.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong earnings for Q3 2024, with revenues of $50.67 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations by $1.63 billion. Additionally, global production grew by 7% year-over-year, reaching almost 3.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). This growth was fueled by record production in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of PDC Energy.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has also been drawing investor attention due to its wide-ranging operations and strong cash flow. The CEO recently shared that the company is on track to increase its free cash flow by $6 billion to $8 billion next year, while also reducing costs by several billion dollars. These expected results are anticipated to stem from new or expanded oil production projects in Kazakhstan, US shale, and the offshore Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn addition to all other developments, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) showed a strong cash position in the latest quarter, generating $9.7 billion in operating cash flow, up from $46.3 billion during the same period last year. The company returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Thanks to this cash flow, the company has maintained a dividend growth streak of over 37 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. The stock's dividend yield on January 20 came in at 4.04%.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 63 hedge funds held stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared with 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $21 billion.\n\nOverall CVX ranks 5th on our list of the best high-yield dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Chevron Corporation, through a network of subsidiaries, engages in integrated energy and chemicals operations worldwide. The company is the 7th largest integrated oil company worldwide, the 2nd largest in the US, and has been in operation since 1879. Chevron was part of the original Standard Oil Company and is one of the 34 successor companies that were formed when it was broken up. Today, the company brings in roughly $160 billion in annual revenues and is the last remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOriginally called Standard Oil Of California the company grew quickly via mergers and acquisitions. It was hailed as one of the Seven Sisters to dominate the US and global production throughout the mid-20th century and became even bigger in 1985 when it merged with Gulf Oil. The merger with Gulf Oil resulted in the rebranding from Standard Oil Of California to Chevron (a brand used by the company outside its California jurisdiction) and then ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2005 when that merger took place. The company rebranded again in 2005 to what we know today as Chevron Corporation.\n\nChevron Corporation is now based in San Ramone, California, and has operations in 180 countries. The company employs more than 42,500 people who operate 5 refineries and 8,000+ Texaco, Chevron, and Standard Oil service stations in the US alone. The company's Exploration and Drilling operations produced a record 3.1 million barrels per day and its US refineries process more than 1 million barrels per day. At the end of 2021, the company has more than 11.3 billion barrels of proven oil and liquid-equivalent reserves and boasted a 112% reserve replacement rate.\n\nThe company operates in two segments, Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream segment explores new reserves, develops known reserves, produces petroleum and gas products as needed, transports, processes, pipes, stores, and markets petroleum worldwide. The Downstream segment refines and markets the full line of petroleum-based products including but not limited to fuels such as gas, diesel, and aviation fuel, as well as lubricants, petrochemicals, and plastics. The company transports products via pipeline, rail, marine vessels, and truck.\n\nChevron recognizes the need to lower the world\u2019s carbon output and is working toward that end. The company\u2019s strategy is two-pronged and includes reducing its own carbon output while investing in green and lower-carbon technologies. The company\u2019s goal is to invest $10 billion or more into lower carbon energy sources and technologies by 2028.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has been paying a dividend since 1989 and it has raised it every year since its inception.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The competition regulator finalized an agreement that bars Hess' chief executive from holding a board position at Chevron, to settle antitrust concerns surrounding the companies' merger.\n\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has finalized an agreement that bars Hess Corp.\u2019s chief executive from holding a board position at Chevron Corp., to settle antitrust concerns surrounding the companies\u2019 merger.\n\nThe competition regulator first announced the ban September 30, 2024, as a condition to clear Chevron\u2019s $60 billion purchase of smaller rival Hess. The companies also announced at the time the FTC had concluded its extended review of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.\n\nThe FTC has now published the final consent order resolving antitrust concerns it has raised over the combination. It voted 3-2 to approve the agreement. The publication opens a 30-day public comment period.\n\nThe decision states that John Hess should not hold a board, advisory or representative position at Chevron.\n\nThe FTC alleges the Hess chief executive had talks with officials of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) about controlling oil production and that such a position at Chevron would give him a stronger platform to rally the industry on keeping barrels more expensive.\n\n\u201cMr. Hess communicated publicly and privately with the past and current Secretaries General of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and an official from Saudi Arabia\u201d, the FTC said last September. \u201cIn these communications, Mr. Hess stressed the importance of oil market stability and inventory management and encouraged these officials to take actions on these issues and speak about them at different events\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr. Hess further encouraged his OPEC competitors to stabilize production and draw down inventories\u2026 As Mr. Hess has noted publicly, there is a direct correlation between inventory levels and oil prices\u201d, the FTC added. \u201cReductions in crude oil exploration and production generally lead to higher oil prices and higher prices for products derived from oil, including transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, and heating oil\u201d.\n\nHess responded at the time by saying John Hess\u2019 communications with industry officials did not mean to harm competition. \u201cMr. Hess\u2019 public and private communications with OPEC officials were consistent with his communications with U.S. government officials, the International Energy Agency and global business leaders on what will be needed to ensure an affordable and orderly energy transition\u201d, the company said in a statement.\n\nJohn Hess said in the statement, \u201cFor more than 10 years, I have advocated for a significant increase in global investment, both in oil and gas and renewable energy, to have the necessary supply to keep energy affordable and secure for American consumers in the future\u201d.\n\nIn a separate statement then, Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that our Board of Directors will not get the benefit of his [John Hess] decades of global experience, but we look forward to drawing upon his knowledge, relationships and experience in Guyana through his service as an advisor to Chevron\u201d.\n\nThe companies\u2019 agreement with the FTC allows John Hess to serve as a Chevron advisor or representative in engagements involving government officials in Guyana, where Hess holds a stake in the Stabroek block.\n\nWhile the FTC concluded its statutory review of the merger, Chevron and Hess have yet to complete the transaction, pending international arbitration involving Hess\u2019 partners in Stabroek \u2014 Exxon Mobil Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp.\n\nThe FTC had set a similar condition for ExxonMobil\u2019s $64.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. On May 2, 2024, it said it has prevented ex-Pioneer chief executive Scott Sheffield from holding a board or advisory position in ExxonMobil.\n\nPioneer said at the time the FTC accusation \u201creflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. and global oil markets and misreads the nature and intent of Mr. Sheffield\u2019s actions\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, Mr. Sheffield focused on legitimate topics such as investor feedback on independent oil and gas company growth and capital reinvestment frameworks; unfair foreign practices that threatened to undermine U.S. energy security; and, through dialogue with government officials, the need to sustain a resilient, competitive and economically vibrant oil and gas industry in the United States\u201d, Pioneer said.\n\nAlong with the final agreement with Chevron and Hess, the FTC concurrently finalized the decision that settles its antitrust concerns over the ExxonMobil-Pioneer merger. ExxonMobil had already announced the completion of the merger May 3, 2024.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the final consent order requires that for a period of five years, Exxon shall not nominate, designate, or appoint any Pioneer employee or director, other than certain named individuals, to the Exxon board\u201d, the FTC said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn addition, under the final order, Exxon, for a period of 10 years, will agree to certain Clayton Act Section 8 attestation and reporting obligations\u201d.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 on the agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

That is only a small portion of the $170 million Trump\u2019s inauguration committee has announced it raised.\n\nEmily Leach, spokesperson for Public Citizen, said the watchdog group is only tracking donations that are $1 million or more. She said the public knows that Trump\u2019s inauguration committee has raised $170 million only because the committee has disclosed as much. The committee\u2019s contributions won\u2019t become public until 90 days after the inauguration.\n\nLeach said Chevron is the only company in the oil and gas industry that has publicly said it would be donating to the committee, but it did not disclose how much.\n\nOne reason why the amount raised is noteworthy is because this will be the most expensive inauguration in history. Trump raised $107 million for his first inauguration. President Joe Biden, by contrast, raised $62 million for his inauguration in 2020. Former President Barack Obama raised $53 million for his first inauguration in 2009, which at the time was record setting.\n\nCorporations often make large donations to both sides of the aisle for presidential inaugurations. Chevron donated $525,000 to Trump\u2019s first inauguration in 2017 and $1 million to Obama\u2019s second inauguration in 2013. Chevron did not donate to Biden\u2019s 2020 inauguration because Biden prohibited donations from the oil and gas industry for his inauguration.\n\nCritics of the incoming Trump administration are concerned over the significant influx of corporate money and the potential influence it could have on the in-coming president over the next four years.\n\nChevron and Trump\u2019s inauguration committee did not respond to a request for comment.",

YPF is the current leader testing multi-bench pad development on its Vaca Muerta asset, Rystad Vice President of Upstream Research Radhika Bansal told Hart Energy.\n\nProducers have mainly targeted Vaca Muerta\u2019s Lower and Middle benches due to their high effective porosities, high total organic content and low water saturations, according to Enverus Intelligence Research.\n\nRELATED\n\nChevron Pushing Longer Laterals in Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta Shale\n\nBarriers to growth\n\nThe involvement of the supermajors bodes well for Vaca Muerta Sur\u2019s momentum, experts say.\n\nBut the pipeline\u2019s construction still faces hurdles\u2014including financing. Producers with stakes in the pipeline have agreed to cover 30% of the project\u2019s roughly $3 billion price tag.\n\nThe remaining 70% is supposed to come from a syndicate of international banks, Bansal said.\n\n\u201cWe actually think this is going to be a crucial thing this year for Argentina\u2014seeing [financing] occurring,\u201d Lara said.\n\nRegulatory and political instability have been barriers for international capital to be deployed within Argentina. The Incentive Regime for Large Investments (R\u00e9gimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones or RIGI) aims to address those concerns.\n\nThe RIGI ensures certain tax breaks and other benefits for large-scale investments that spur economic development and employment within Argentina. RIGI projects may also freely import and export goods without prohibitions or restrictions.\n\nTo be covered under RIGI, projects require a total minimum investment of US$2 billion, with at least $400 million deployed in the first two years of development.\n\nQualifying export projects will enjoy stability in taxes, customs, foreign exchange matters and dispute resolution mechanisms for 30 years after startup.\n\nVMOS aims to complete construction on the Vaca Muerta Sur extension during the fourth quarter of 2026 and commence commercial operations by summer 2027.\n\nBut depending on the fundraising process and the RIGI regulatory structure, that could be an ambitious timeline for Vaca Muerta Sur, Lara said.\n\n\u201cThe commitment is there; the investment is going to come,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when are you going to have it built?\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nVista CEO: Bidding for Exxon\u2019s Vaca Muerta Assets \u2018Very Competitive\u2019",

The second exploration phase is expected to last three years and its minimum requirement pertains to completing the collection and assessment of 3D seismic data.\n\nGreece has been hoping that its waters could hold giant natural gas resources, similar to the ones discovered in the Eastern Mediterranean offshore Egypt and Israel.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "You should always aspire to have a good understanding of the companies you decide to invest in. There will be times when Wall Street throws you a curve ball, of course, but most of the time, businesses are fairly easy to understand. The core business model is what you need to think about if you are comparing oil industry players Devon Energy (DVN -3.05%) and Chevron (CVX 0.43%). Here's why most investors will probably want to err on the side of caution.\n\nOil is a volatile commodity\n\nThere are subtle differences in the quality of crude oil depending on where it is drilled, but, for the most part, it is just a commodity product. When supply and demand are out of alignment, the price of oil can rise or fall in dramatic, and sometimes swift, fashion. There are other factors that impact oil prices, too, including global economic activity and geopolitical events. Oil price volatility is the norm, not the exception.\n\nThis is likely the single most important fact investors need to know about the oil industry. Once you understand this, you can make a more educated decision about whether or not you want to own oil stocks. And if you decide you do want oil exposure in your portfolio, you can use this understanding to decide which kind of oil company you want to own.\n\nThe broader energy sector is usually broken down into three subsets. Pure-play oil and natural gas extractors fall into the upstream segment. Pipeline and storage operators, which generally charge fees based on volumes for the use of their infrastructure assets, comprise the midstream segment. And refining and chemical businesses are classified as downstream. Each segment has its own dynamics: In the upstream and downstream arenas, performance tends to be more volatile, based on fluctuating commodity prices, while the toll-takers of the midstream are generally more consistent performers over time.\n\nDevon Energy is an aggressive oil play\n\nDevon Energy's a pure-play U.S. oil and natural gas producer -- squarely in the upstream segment -- so its top and bottom lines will fluctuate along with oil prices.\n\nTo be fair, there are things to like about Devon Energy. For example, it has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet, so it is financially strong. It has generally attractive production costs, which means it can turn a profit even when oil prices are on the low side. And it has ample opportunities for growth with around a decade's worth of drillable inventory in its portfolio. Add in a dividend that yields nearly 4% at the current share price, and Devon Energy could be attractive to investors who have a positive outlook on the future of energy prices.\n\nThat said, if you think energy prices are likely to fall or remain moribund, Devon Energy probably won't be a great choice. Those outcomes are highly likely to mean that Devon Energy's financial results will be weak and, thus, its stock price performance will be less than desirable. As goes oil, so goes Devon Energy.\n\nChevron is the better choice for most investors\n\nWhile Devon Energy is totally focused on production, Chevron's businesses are spread from the upstream through the midstream and all the way into the downstream. This diversification helps soften the impacts of the energy sector's ups and downs on its results. That's not to suggest that Chevron's revenues and earnings won't fluctuate along with oil prices, but the surges and tumbles won't be quite as severe as they would be for a pure-play producer like Devon Energy.\n\nThat shows up most notably with regard to Chevron's dividend, which it has increased annually for 37 consecutive years. That's a record that Devon Energy doesn't even come close to matching. Chevron's dividend yield at the current share prices is around 4.2%, a little bit more than Devon is offering. And Chevron has among the lowest levels of leverage in its peer group, with a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 0.17. For reference, Devon's ratio is a much higher 0.62.\n\nChevron's low leverage is important. It gives the oil giant more flexibility to take on more debt as needed during the inevitable industry downturns so that it can continue to invest in its business and pay dividends. When oil prices recover, as they always have historically, it pays down its debts, leaving it ready to repeat the process when the next downturn arrives. Investors benefit from owning a reliable dividend stock that has proven it can perform well through the entire cycle. If you are simply looking to add some oil exposure to your portfolio for diversification purposes, Chevron will be a much better choice than Devon Energy.\n\nIf you understand these investments you'll know what stock to pick\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Devon Energy, and it is, in fact, a well-respected energy producer. But its stock is only a good choice for investors who have a constructive view of oil and natural gas prices. That's just how its business works, since its top and bottom lines are so tied to commodity prices.\n\nChevron's results will fluctuate, too, but likely not to the same degree, thanks to its diversified exposure to the broader energy sector. That will make it a better choice for most investors, and particularly for investors looking to live off of the dividends their portfolios generate.",

Maria Gomez, who traveled all the way from Miami to cheer for her brother, shared her enthusiasm for the event.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s so cold, but you gotta cheer on the family,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Chevron Houston Marathon, which began in 1972, has grown to become the city\u2019s largest single-day sporting event. The race includes a 26.2-mile course that winds through some of Houston\u2019s most iconic neighborhoods, including Memorial Park, Hermann Park, the Heights, and Downtown. Known for its flat and fast course, it draws elite runners from across the globe aiming for personal records and competitive times.\n\nParticipants of all skill levels gathered early in the morning to take on the challenge, while thousands of supporters lined the streets, holding signs, playing music, and cheering runners on at every turn. Ashley Rainey, a runner and spectator, emphasized the camaraderie of the event:\n\n\u201dWe are runners, and we are here supporting because it\u2019s our favorite thing to do,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many Houstonians, the marathon is more than just a race\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity to unite the community and showcase the city\u2019s vibrant spirit. Supporter Russell Durant shared his thoughts on the experience:\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s been cold, but it\u2019s awesome seeing everyone out here. The route is great,\u201d he said.\n\nLibby Rowland, another supporter, encouraged people to get involved and cheer on the runners.\n\n\u201dJust get out here and cheer them on,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the event concluded, the Chevron Houston Marathon once again proved to be a celebration of resilience, determination, and the enduring strength of Houston\u2019s community spirit.",

            "content": "By Harry Minium\n\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2013 Unlike its last outing just two days earlier, the Old Dominion men\u2019s basketball team competed hard, if not always well, against a very physical opponent and played with poise down the stretch.\n\nAlas for the Monarchs, the outcome was still the same Saturday afternoon.\n\nODU rallied from a 17-point deficit to take a one-point lead in the final minutes, but fell to Georgia Southern, 67-63, before an alumni game crowd of 5,739 at Chartway Arena.\n\nODU (8-11 overall, 4-3 in the Sun Belt) began the week in first place in the conference. The back-to-back losses dropped them into a four-way tie for fourth.\n\nMike Jones, ODU\u2019s Head Coach, was critical of his team following a 62-43 loss to App State, but two days later, was not critical of the effort against Georgia Southern.\n\n\u201cToday, I think we played hard, and we played very physical,\u201d he said. \u201cEffort was not the problem.\u201d\n\nClearly, it wasn\u2019t a problem on the boards.\n\nODU won the rebound margin by a huge margin, 53-33, including 32 offensive rebounds. The problem was that the Monarchs could not put the ball in the basket.\n\nThe Monarchs made 21 of 71 shots (29.6%) and only 4 of 19 three-pointers (21.1%).\n\nThe Monarchs shot 27 foul shots to just eight for Georgia Southern but missed 10 of them.\n\n\u201cThe missed field goals, you know, obviously, that\u2019s going to be a glaring thing off the stat sheet,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that\u2019s going to be the glaring thing on film, too.\n\n\u201cAnd then, obviously, we missed a lot of free throws.\n\n\u201cWe have to execute better.\u201d\n\nRobert Davis Jr., ODU\u2019s leading scorer for the season, had 20 points in spite of an aggressive defensive effort against him employed by Georgia Southern (10-9, 3-4).\n\nSean Durugordon had 11 points and 17 rebounds. R.J. Blakney added nine points and 10 rebounds and Stephaun Walker 11 points.\n\nThe game at times resembled street ball as the refs let both teams go at it.\n\nLate in the game, point guard Jaden Johnson drove the lane, shoved a player out of his way and put the ball in the basket. No foul was called.\n\nIt was the same way at both ends of the court, as a few plays later, Johnson was shoved out of the way underneath the Georgia Southern basket.\n\n\u201cI hear our fans complaining about the refs,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey let a lot go.\n\n\"But they let it go evenly on both sides. And that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d\n\nODU scored a season-low 43 points against App State, and appeared headed for a similar day early-on Saturday. The Monarchs missed 13 of their first 15 shots and then 20 of 24 and found themselves trailing, 28-11, with just six minutes remaining in the first half.\n\nSlowly but surely, they played themselves back into the game.\n\nDurugordon made a layup, and then had a steal and a layup, and the Monarchs trimmed the lead to eight, 30-22, at the half.\n\nDavis made a three-pointer with 14:38 to trim the lead to four. A minute later, Walker made a three-pointer to cut the lead to one.\n\nJohnson gave ODU its first lead, 56-55, with 4:19 left, bringing a loud and supportive crowd to its feet.\n\nDurugordon gave ODU its last lead, 60-59, on a second-chance shot in the lane with 2:22 left.\n\n\u201cBut we could not get that one stop we needed,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAdante\u2019 Holiman, a transfer from UTSA, gave Georgia Southern the lead for good on a driving layup with two minutes left. He led all scorers with 28 points.\n\nODU trailed by three, 66-63, with 22 seconds left and the Monarchs were forced to foul.\n\nNate Brafford made a shot with 20 seconds left to advance the lead to four, and then Davis missed two, long three-point shots just before the final buzzer sounded.\n\nThere was a festive halftime alumni celebration as several dozen former players, coaches and managers were introduced, including the 1975 Division II national championship team, which was feted Friday night, 50 years after winning the title.\n\n1975 ODU national championship team finally gets its championship rings\n\nJones presented the coaches and players with their rings on Friday night.\n\nOn Saturday, three former ODU head coaches were among the alumni introduced -- Jeff Jones, Blaine Taylor and Oliver Purnell, who played on the 1975 championship team. All three drew loud ovations.\n\nBilly Allen, the son of the late coach Sonny Allen, accepted a ring for his family and was introduced to the crowd.\n\nFormer NBA players Cal Bowdler and Dave Twardzik were among the alumni announced at halftime.\n\n\"I enjoyed my interaction with all of the alums, but those guys in particular, the guys who played on that 1975 team, they're the reason why we all love ODU,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I was honored to be able to be a part of that event last night, to be able to spend some time with all of those gentlemen and also all the alums who came back.\n\n\"All of which contributes a little to how disappointing this loss was.\"",

            "content": "USA HALF-MARATHON RECORDS UNDER SERIOUS THREAT IN HOUSTON ON SUNDAY\n\nBy David Monti, @d9monti\n\n(c) 2025 Race Results Weekly, all rights reserved - Used with permission\n\n\n\nHOUSTON (18-Jan) -- Ryan Hall's USATF half-marathon record of 59:43 was set here in 2007 at the Aramco Houston Half-Marathon, and despite the introduction of \"super shoes\" in 2016, which use carbon plates to help propel runners forward, Hall's record has yet to be broken. Hall, now 42, set that mark as a 24 year-old while making his half-marathon debut.\n\n\n\n\"My plan was to just see how I felt,\" Hall told Race Results Weekly that day. \"I was just going with the race pace I could maintain.\"\n\n\n\nAmerica's best road runners of the last decade --Dathan Ritzenhein, Galen Rupp, Leonard Korir, and Hillary Bor-- have been unable to break the record giving Hall's mark a mythical quality. But a new crop of athletes are ready to try on the streets of Houston on Sunday, including Olympians Conner Mantz, Joe Klecker and Morgan Pearson. For them Hall's record is definitely top of mind.\n\n\n\n\"There were a lot of races to pick from, but the most exciting one for me was always Houston,\" Klecker said at a press conference yesterday. The 28 year-old, who is coached by 2009 World Half-Marathon Championships bronze medalist Dathan Ritzenhein, is trying the distance for the first time and wants to run fast. \"I've seen the field and there's people in this race who have run faster than that record. So, if I go in there and try to win, and if I feel good push for it, it's possible. From the stuff I've done in training I believe it indicates that it's a doable goal.\"\n\n\n\nKlecker did his build-up with Pearson, an Olympic silver medalist in the triathlon mixed relay, who is a gifted runner. Pearson, 31, ran a 1:01:08 half-marathon in Valencia last October a week after he wrapped up his triathlon season in Malaga. He was clearly excited by the chance to run fast here. He called his result in Valencia an \"OK race\" and would like to go faster.\n\n\n\n\"I was left wanting more,\" Pearson said of his run in Valencia. He added: \"After Valencia, I hope to improve my time.\"\n\n\n\nMantz, 28, the 2024 USA Olympic Trials Marathon champion who won the 2021 USATF Half-Marathon Championships in a personal best 1:00:55, was motivated to run here based in part on the strength of the field. He had a terrific year in 2024 culminating in an eighth place finish at the Paris Olympic Marathon and a sixth place showing at the TCS New York City Marathon. His time at New York of 2:09:00 was the fastest ever by an American on New York's tough course.\n\n\n\n\"With this elite field there's a ton that's possible,\" Mantz said. \"With a field like this you can definitely get fast times and the American record could go down. Part of the reason I wanted to come here was it's a fast course, and you have Morgan and Joe and plenty of other elite Americans running here. I want to be in that race whether I'm ready or not.\"\n\n\n\nThe other top Americans include Olympians Clayton Young (1:01:18 PB) and Hillary Bor (1:01:20), Diego Estrada (1:00:49), Frank Lara (1:01:00), and Futsum Zienasellassie (1:01:21). The fastest international athletes are Jemal Yimer of Ethiopia (58:33 PB), Gabriel Geay of Tanzania (59:42), Abe Gashahun of Ethiopia (59:46), and Wesley Kiptoo of Kenya (1:00:43). Yimer has won the race twice.\n\n\n\nNot to be overlooked is the possibility of a USA record on the women's side. Last year, Weini Kelati came to this race and ran a national record 1:06:25 in her debut. She's back this year and is ready to run fast.\n\n\n\n\"It was my first half-marathon last year and I didn't know how it was going to be,\" said Kelati, whose last race was a 4:29 road mile in Hawaii in December. She continued: \"I'm just really excited, and we'll see how well I can race because training has been really, really good. And I'm just excited to be here.\"\n\n\n\nAmanda Vestri, who ran 1:08:12 in her half-marathon debut in Orlando last month, is also running here, but doesn't expect to be challenging Kelati, she said. Other top Americans include Natosha Rogers (1:09:36 PB), Lindsay Flanagan (1:09:37), Lauren Hagens (1:09:41), and Susanna Sullivan (1:09:42). The fastest international women are Buze Diriba of Ethiopia (1:06:24) and Jessica Warner-Judd of Great Britain (1:07:07).\n\n\n\nCold and windy conditions are expected here for Sunday, which may slow the race down. At the 6:45 a.m. start, the temperature should be about 35F/2C.\n\n\n\nThe Aramco Houston Half-Marathon is a World Athletics Gold Label Road Race. Race winners will receive $15,000 in prize money, and breaking the course records (59:22 for men and 1:04:37 for women, respectively) is worth a $15,000 bonus. American record breakers can earn a bonus of $10,000.\n\n\n\n\"I really don't know what's possible,\" said Mantz. \"It's a blast. I love competing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Four of the top athletes entered in the 2025 Aramco Houston Half-Marathon (left to right): Conner Mantz, Joe Klecker, Morgan Pearson and Jemal Yimer (photo by Jane Monti for Race Results Weekly)\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Weini Kelati winning the 2024 USA Olympic Team Trials 10,000m (photo by Jane Monti for Race Results Weekly)",

Following years of authoritarian rule and withering economic sanctions, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had agreed to work toward a democratic presidential election. The White House, in return, granted him a financial lifeline: a permit for U.S. energy giant Chevron to pump and export Venezuelan oil.\n\nOil wells roared back to life and massive tanker ships returned to Venezuela\u2019s coast to be filled with heavy, hard-to-refine crude destined for the U.S.\n\nMaduro\u2019s promised election was neither fair nor free, and the longtime president was sworn in this month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes. Yet, the sanctions reprieve the U.S. offered \u201cto support the restoration of democracy\u201d is still helping fill state coffers.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition says Maduro\u2019s government has earned billions of dollars from exports allowed by the permit.\n\nThe White House has ignored calls from the main opposition coalition, as well as Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress, to cancel a permit that now accounts for around a quarter of the South American country\u2019s oil production.\n\nSenior administration officials have struggled to explain why the permit has been left in place under questioning by reporters, saying only that sanctions policy toward Venezuela is frequently reviewed. President Joe Biden told reporters last week he \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough data\u201d to adjust oil-related sanctions before he leaves office Monday.\n\nA lifeline for Venezuela\u2019s economy\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and once used them to power Latin America\u2019s strongest economy. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production steadily decline from the 3.5 million barrels per day pumped in 1999, when the fiery Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took power and began his self-described socialist revolution, to less than 400,000 barrels per day in 2020.\n\nCalifornia-based Chevron Corp., which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.\n\nThe joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels a day in 2019, but the following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by then-President Donald Trump forced Chevron to wind down production.\n\nIn 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a 30% decline in the country\u2019s economic activity, Venezuela\u2019s Central Bank reported year-over-year inflation of over 1,800%. For many, rummaging through garbage in search of food scraps or valuable items became a common activity.\n\nLocked out of world oil markets by U.S. sanctions, Venezuela sold its remaining oil output at a discount \u2014 about 40% below market prices \u2014 to buyers like China and other Asian markets. It even started accepting payments in Russian rubles, bartered goods or cryptocurrency.\n\n\u2018Saint Chevron\u2019\n\nOnce Chevron got a license to export oil to the U.S., its joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000 barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from 2019. That oil is sold at world market prices.\n\nThe terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or royalties to Venezuela\u2019s government. But the company sends money to the joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA.\n\n\u201cWhat Chevron is doing is buying oil from joint ventures,\u201d Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodriguez said. \u201cThis purchase of oil is what generates the revenue of the joint ventures,\u201d and that revenue pays taxes and royalties to Venezuela\u2019s government.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how Venezuela\u2019s government, which stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago, uses this revenue. Neither the government nor Chevron have made public the terms of the agreement allowing the company\u2019s return to Venezuela.\n\nChevron did not answer questions from The Associated Press regarding the joint ventures, including payments made to Venezuela\u2019s treasury.\n\n\u201cChevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement.\n\nEconomist Jos\u00e9 Guerra, a former economic research manager at Venezuela\u2019s Central Bank, said the license\u2019s impact is partly reflected in the nation\u2019s foreign cash reserves, which increased by roughly $1 billion between February 2022 and November 2024, according to the institution\u2019s data. The government uses its dollar reserves in part to maintain an artificially low exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivar.\n\n\u201cThe only explanation is that Chevron exports without discounts, it exports everything \u2014 the 200,000 barrels go abroad \u2014 and that is what is feeding the reserves,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cI call it Saint Chevron.\u201d\n\nCritics say the permit has not encouraged democracy\n\nThe outcome of Venezuela\u2019s presidential election, and a subsequent campaign of repression, have prompted new calls to rescind the licenses.\n\n\u201cIn the end, one wonders, and quite rightly so, why the Biden administration continues to maintain a license whose objective was not achieved,\u201d said Rafael de la Cruz, who is an adviser to the opposition campaign of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. He said the opposition has estimated that Maduro\u2019s government has received about $4 billion through the operation of the joint ventures.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the July 28 election hours after polls closed. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, while the opposition collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines showing its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin. U.N. experts and the U.S.-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.\n\n\u201cThe election was stolen. Therefore, the basis for any lifting of sanctions doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Elliot Abrams, who was special representative for Venezuela during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cSo, why isn\u2019t the administration then reimposing the full sanctions?\u201d\n\nMaduro continues to boast of his resistance to U.S. influence. \u201cVenezuela will not be colonized or dominated, neither by carrot diplomacy nor by stick diplomacy,\u201d he said after taking the oath of office on Jan. 10. \u201cVenezuela must be respected.\u201d\n\nRenewed sanctions could fuel migration\n\nThe disputed results have deepened Venezuela\u2019s protracted social, economic and political crisis, which has has pushed millions into poverty, stunted hungry children\u2019s growth and driven entire families to migrate. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have already left their homeland since Maduro became president in 2013.\n\nRodriguez said in a December analysis that a U.S. government decision to revoke Chevron\u2019s license or further tighten sanctions \u201cwould have discernible effects on migration.\u201d He estimated that more than 800,000 Venezuelans could emigrate between 2025 and 2029 if Chevron\u2019s license is canceled.\n\nAfter Maduro\u2019s inauguration, Biden defended his decision not to toughen sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil sector, explaining that the idea is \u201cstill being investigated in terms of what impact it would have and whether or not it would just be replaced by Iran or any other\u201d country\u2019s oil market.\n\n\u201cIt matters what would happen afterwards,\u201d he told reporters.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nCompiled and published by Fortune Magazine, the Fortune 500 is an annual list that ranks the biggest US companies by revenue. In total, the Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ a workforce of 31 million around the globe.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks to Buy\n\n2024 proved to be a big year for large-cap stocks, as the broader US market achieved gains of nearly 25%, piggybacking on a 26% performance the year before. Large-cap stock funds, with the heaviest tilt toward growth stocks, performed the best last year, even as the market\u2019s rally somewhat broadened from the handful of mega tech companies that have led much of the bull market.\n\nHowever, the tailwinds that propelled the market to new heights are beginning to recede, as the rate of monetary policy easing slows down, long-term interests swing upward, inflation becomes sticky, and the US economy is slowing down. Moreover, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and his much-rumored tariffs could also herald a more volatile period for markets, as they could further fan inflation fears and put pressure on stock prices.\n\nThat said, the expected upcoming fluctuation isn\u2019t going to be something that the mega corporations haven\u2019t dealt with before. A 2023 report by J. P. Morgan revealed that despite the considerable volatility during the period, large-cap stocks gained around 162% between 2013 and 2023, galvanized primarily by big tech. Another 2023 report by CNBC unveiled that large US companies outperformed other investments between 2003 and 2023, with average returns of 9.3%. However, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as despite the stability and reliability large-cap stocks are known for, investors had to survive drops of 56.8% during the 2007-2009 bear market, 33.9% in 2020, and 25.4% in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the few tech giants regularly making headlines with their gains, large-cap dividend stocks could also be an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable, significant, and growing stream of income. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the broader US large caps are expected to post an 8% increase in dividend payments in 2025, compared to the 6.4% uptick in 2024, 5.1% gains in 2023, and the 10.8% increase witnessed in 2022.\n\nLarge-cap companies tend to have more robust balance sheets compared to their smaller counterparts, enabling them to navigate through market fluctuations more smoothly while also returning value to their shareholders. Corporations in the US have continuously grown their considerable cash stockpiles since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to the economic resilience we have witnessed recently. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group revealed that as of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, up 12.6% from the same period in 2024 and $1.28 trillion more from their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we referred to the top 50 companies among the Fortune Global Rankings. Then, we picked out 12 US-listed companies with the highest dividend yields as of January 13, 2025, and ranked them by their number of hedge fund investors according to the Insider Monkey database as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nDividend Yield: 4.26%\n\nMarket Cap: $281.5 billion\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) manufactures and sells a range of high-quality refined products, including gasoline, diesel, marine and aviation fuels, premium base oil, finished lubricants, and fuel oil additives.

The company also generated $9.7 billion in operating cash flow, up from $6.3 billion in the prior quarter. Additionally, it returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. Chevron Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:CVX) dividend growth streak spans over 37 years, placing it on our list of the Dogs of the Dow Dividend Stocks to Invest In.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s Q3 2024 worldwide production increased by 7% from the prior year and set a third-quarter record. The company continues to see strong performance in the Permian, executing major turnarounds at TCO and Gorgon ahead of schedule. These projects, combined with additional project startups through 2025, are expected to grow the oil giant\u2019s Gulf of Mexico production to 300,000 barrels per day by 2026.\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) also remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet further by divesting its non-core positions at significant value. The company has announced asset sales in Canada, Alaska, and Congo, which will contribute before-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion pending regulatory approvals. The company is also saving cash by optimizing and improving its capital efficiency. Chevron has reduced its capital expenditure budget from around $40 billion a decade ago to around $15 billion in 2025, reflecting its commitment to spending rationalization. The company\u2019s focus on boosting its free cash flow could result in higher returns for its shareholders, making it an attractive option for investors looking for stable income in the energy industry.\n\n63 hedge funds tracked by IM held a stake in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) at the end of Q3 2024, with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway holding the largest stake worth nearly $17.5 billion.\n\nOverall, CVX ranks 7th on our list of best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Beyond his 3,731 passing yards and 28 touchdowns, he's chasing history in the playoffs.\n\nAd\n\nThe Bills quarterback carries multiple performance incentives into the Ravens matchup. A league MVP award would net him $1.5 million. An AFC Championship victory adds another $1 million, while a Super Bowl triumph brings $2.5 million more.\n\nAllen's influence extends beyond the field. His endorsement portfolio includes Nike, Microsoft and PepsiCo, generating over $4 million annually. He's also invested in companies like RX3 Growth Partners and TMRW Sports.\n\nThe timing of contract discussions coincides with a pivotal moment in Bill's history. Only three AFC quarterbacks - Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning - have won Super Bowls in the past decade.\n\nAd\n\nAllen's current deal pays just $14.5 million next season, despite four years remaining on the $258 million extension. The structure feels outdated given his evolution into an NFL superstar who made history with a passing, rushing and receiving touchdown in one game.\n\nThe stakes keep rising for Sunday's playoff battle. Sports Illustrated estimates Allen's net worth around $70 million, but his next contract could push that figure significantly higher. As the Bills pursue their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994, both the team and quarterback understand the value of maintaining their strong partnership.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Like Smith, Jones has asthma, a condition she believes is connected to growing up in Sweeny and working in industry all her life.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019d want to emit more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nDebate on facility\n\nThe Chevron Phillips chemical facility, along with the adjacent Phillips 66 refinery, has been operating in Sweeny for over 80 years. The facility makes over 11 million lbs a day of ethylene, an ingredient used in plastic production, and employs just over 1,800 workers \u2013 some of whom reside locally.\n\nThe annual impact of the Sweeny complex is about $1.7 billion to the regional economy.\n\nHowever, the company is one of the worst offenders for toxic releases into the air and noncompliance with drinking water, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, with the community around Chevron Phillips having worse particulate matter and Ozone than 91 and 90 percent of the United States, respectively.\n\nParticulate matter and ozone pollution are linked to increases in asthma, COPD and heart disease, among other conditions.\n\nJose Trevino, the facility\u2019s plant manager, emphasized that a big reason for the permit change is the environment and supporting the facility\u2019s goals of producing less carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by way of intensity. Carbon intensity means the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy produced.\n\n\u201cThe (current) ethylene unit has been in operation for 55 years. We are installing a new furnace to replace (it),\u201d Trevino told the crowd on Tuesday. \u201c We\u2019re taking this opportunity to implement new technology that\u2019s going to support our commitment of lowering our carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nThe new furnace will produce twice as much using 30 percent of the energy. It will also produce less nitrogen oxide gas, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n\nHowever, residents expressed concerns that less intensity means little in direct relation to their community. Sue Page, a resident of nearby Surfside Beach, spoke up over concerns over increased pollution versus carbon intensity.\n\n\u201cThis feels like if I puffed smoke in your face weakly compared to if I puffed smoke in your face a bit more strongly,\u201d said Page. \u201cYou\u2019re still getting the smoke. It\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\nSue Page addresses TCEQ and Chevron officials during a public meeting about a TCEQ air quality permit on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025, in Brazoria . (Mark Felix for Houston Landing)\n\nPollutants such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds will increase in emissions.\n\nOther community members highlighted the company\u2019s recent history with violations as a reason to mistrust them. In the past five years, there were 191 unplanned emissions events reported by Chevron Phillips to the TCEQ.\n\nIn 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency fined Chevron Phillips for violating the Clean Air Act and state air pollution control laws at its Cedar Bayou, Port Arthur and Sweeny facility locations. The company had failed to properly monitor its industrial flares, which caused excess emissions in harmful air pollution.\n\nIn the resulting consent decree, the company agreed to pay $118 million in upgrades and compliance measures, including a fenceline monitoring system. In an email exchange with the Houston Landing, Chevron Phillips Chemical confirmed it does have an air monitoring system at the facility that has been in place for over a year and it publicly reports readings on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nHealth and engagement\n\nA few years back, Smith\u2019s wife, Dorothy, passed away from an asthma attack in their home in Sweeny after 42 years of marriage. Smith called 9-1-1 when she called out from the bedroom saying she couldn\u2019t breathe, but even after emergency responders arrived and took her to the hospital, they lost her.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t pronounce her really gone until she got to the hospital, but I knew she took her last breath,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd things haven\u2019t been the same since.\u201d\n\nThe rate of asthma in Sweeny is worse than 67 percent of Texas and nearly 50 percent of the United States. Smith, along with Jones, knows more people with asthma and COPD than not. Jones\u2019 good friend passed away from respiratory issues just earlier this January and her father and her uncle passed from heart attacks before that.\n\nIn a statement to the Houston Landing, Chevron Phillips Chemical said emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide at the Sweeny facility have decreased between 2020 and 2023.\n\nA person addresses TCEQ and Chevron officials during a public meeting about a TCEQ air quality permit on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025, in Brazoria . (Mark Felix for Houston Landing)\n\nThe community in Sweeny has also had issues with drinking water, which the city says is due to aging infrastructure and a chemical called manganese infiltrating the water supply. The Phillips 66 Refinery, adjacent to the Chevron Phillips Chemical Complex, has also discharged more wastewater from its refinery than allowed by the state-imposed limit 42 times between 2019-2021, according to the EPA\u2019s enforcement database.\n\nBecause of this, residents generally drink bottled water on top of concerns over air pollution.\n\n\u201cThe plant should take a little more responsibility,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI mean, you know people are complaining about these things. You can\u2019t put a bandaid on it and expect it to be fixed.\u201d\n\nAll of these concerns and more pushed Jones to work on environmental justice in the community, though reaching everyone about these concerns can be difficult. The turnout at the TCEQ public meeting was lower than she anticipated. She says this was partially because she only started outreach the Saturday before, having been caught up in the holidays.\n\nThelma Scott, founder of the nonprofit SAFE Diversity Communities, addressed the concern of engagement with the Chevron Phillips representatives \u2013 expressing concerns over members of the community being left out.\n\n\u201cI have over 500 family members that live in this county, some that live here in Sweeny, some in Brazoria, but nobody knew about this meeting at all or they didn\u2019t understand the terms that you have in your data,\u201d Scott told the representatives.\n\nIn response, Trevino with Chevron Phillips said the company has a strong commitment to ensure that we are communicating and engaging with community members.\n\n\u201cWe will be glad to go out there and provide necessary information, contact information so we can have a conversation,\u201d Trevino told the crowd. \u201cA conversation and future out what\u2019 the appropriate thing for us to engage on questions and concerns you might have.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nRepublish This Story Republish our articles for free, online or in print.",

            "content": "In April, Namibia\u2019s national oil company signed a deal with CVX to grant it an 80% working interest in an offshore block in the Walvis Basin. This agreement highlights CVX\u2019s deepened commitment to the country and the significant role Namibia plays in its long-term exploration plans.\n\nDespite the disappointing results at Kapana 1X, CVX remains committed to Namibia\u2019s potential. The company has indicated that it will continue to explore the region, leveraging the insights gained from the Kapana well. CVX\u2019s ongoing investment in Namibia\u2019s oil exploration sector aligns with its broader strategy to expand the company\u2019s global footprint and secure access to new energy resources.\n\nGovernment\u2019s proactive approach to nurturing a business-friendly environment has been key in encouraging foreign investments. This has resulted in a surge of activity in the oil sector of Namibia, with multiple international companies vying for exploration rights and production contracts.\n\nNamibia has become a focal point for global oil exploration, attracting the attention of industry giants such as CVX and Shell plc SHEL. The country\u2019s offshore basins, particularly the Orange Basin and Walvis Basin, have seen significant exploration and discoveries in recent years. In offshore Namibia, companies have encountered some of the most promising oil finds of this century, signaling vast untapped potential.\n\nThe Kapana 1X well, which was drilled in the PEL90 block, is a significant milestone in CVX's exploration efforts in the Orange Basin of Namibia. Although the well did not yield commercially viable hydrocarbons, CVX described the findings as an essential contribution to understanding the basin\u2019s geology. The data from Kapana 1X will undoubtedly help shape future exploration strategies in the region. The failure to find commercial reserves does not signal the end of CVX\u2019s efforts in Namibia but rather highlights the challenges inherent in deepwater exploration.\n\nChevron Corporation CVX, one of the world\u2019s leading oil companies, recently announced that the company did not discover commercially viable hydrocarbon reserves in its Kapana 1X exploration well in Namibia\u2019s Orange Basin. Despite this setback, the company has highlighted that the well provided significant geological insights and valuable data regarding the basin\u2019s potential. CVX\u2019s continued interest in Namibia, alongside the growing interest from other major oil companies, highlights the nation's status as a key player in Africa\u2019s rapidly developing oil exploration landscape.\n\nStory Continues\n\nShell\u2019s Recent Setback: A Contrast to CVX\u2019s Optimism\n\nWhile CVX remains optimistic about Namibia\u2019s future in oil exploration, other companies, such as Shell, have faced challenges. Shell recently announced a significant write-down of approximately $400 million related to an offshore oil discovery in Namibia. The company deemed the find commercially unviable, illustrating the volatility and high risks associated with deepwater exploration.\n\nThese setbacks are not uncommon in the exploration industry, particularly in uncharted or underexplored territories. The risks involved in offshore drilling, especially in deepwater areas, are considerable. Despite the financial hit, Shell\u2019s decision to withdraw from the discovery does not diminish Namibia\u2019s attractiveness as an oil exploration destination, as other players like CVX continue to see long-term potential in the region.\n\nGrowing Competitive Landscape in Namibia\u2019s Oil Sector\n\nNamibia\u2019s oil industry is rapidly becoming more competitive with multiple major oil companies vying for a piece of the action. The recent exploration results, both positive and negative, are shaping the future of the country\u2019s oil sector. As companies like CVX and SHEL invest in exploration, the stakes are high and the potential rewards are even higher.\n\nChevron\u2019s ongoing exploration activities in Namibia, including its significant stake in the Walvis Basin, are poised to position the company as a major player in the region\u2019s oil sector. While challenges remain, the company\u2019s willingness to continue its efforts highlights the long-term potential of Namibia\u2019s offshore oil fields.\n\nWhat Lies Next for CVX in Namibia?\n\nLooking ahead, CVX\u2019s future in Namibia appears promising, despite the challenges faced during the Kapana 1X well\u2019s exploration. The company has indicated that it plans to continue exploring the Orange Basin and other areas within Namibia. With its significant working interest in the Walvis Basin and its accumulated knowledge from ongoing exploration efforts, CVX is well-positioned to make future discoveries in Namibia that could significantly alter the country\u2019s oil landscape.\n\nAs exploration continues, the focus will likely shift toward more targeted drilling efforts, utilizing the data and insights gained from earlier wells to refine the exploration strategy. CVX\u2019s deepening involvement in Namibia is likely to contribute to the country\u2019s growing reputation as a critical oil hub in Africa with the potential for large-scale oil production in the coming decades.\n\nOverall, Namibia\u2019s oil industry is still in the early stages but has a lot of potential for growth, especially in the Orange and Walvis Basins.

ODU entered Thursday having won five of its last six games.\n\nWhile the Jaguars had a diminutive lineup, App State (10-7, 4-2) is one of the Sun Belt\u2019s biggest teams and is second in the league in defense.\n\nApp State was led by CJ Huntley, a 6-foot-11, 221-pound graduate student, who had 26 points and 12 rebounds. Jalil Beaubrun (6-9, 240 pounds) added 10 points and seven rebounds.\n\nThe Monarchs shot poorly, making 15 of 49 shots (30.6%) and had just four assists and 11 turnovers.\n\n\u201cThis game was very disappointing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very well coached team over there, a big physical team, and they played the game they needed to play to beat us here tonight. We did not do what we needed to do to win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, but it\u2019s part of the process. We\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nODU trailed, 29-18, after a first half that started very slowly. ODU missed its first eight shots and trailed, 14-1, five minutes into the game.\n\nGuard Sean Durugordon, who had 10 points, made ODU\u2019s first shot with 13:30 left in the first half, which trimmed the App State lead to 16-6.\n\nODU went on another cold streak and Myles Tate made a layup with 11:05 left and the Monarchs trailed, 23-6.\n\nODU rallied a bit in the final minutes, with Robert Davis Jr., who led ODU with 11 points, making a driving layup with 48 seconds left to trim the lead to 29-18.\n\nJones said the Monarchs managed to keep the game relatively close in the first half with its defense.\n\n\u201cI was impressed with our defense\u201d late in the first half, he said. \u201cI called a timeout out just under 12 minutes and they had 23 points. They finished the half with 29.\n\n\u201cThey scored six points in about 11 minutes.\n\n\u201cThat Old Dominion defense will give you a chance to beat anybody. But we needed that for 40 minutes and we did not get that.\n\n\u201cThe physicality, you know, the fight that we had for that time period, that physicality wears you down. They had four guys 6-9 or bigger and we just didn\u2019t answer the bell tonight.\u201d\n\nSeven-foot ODU center Caelum Swanton-Rodger missed most of the first half with two fouls and was assessed his third foul 45 seconds into the second half when Beaubrun made a layup.\n\nThe Monarchs trailed by double-digits the rest of the way. App State scored four consecutive baskets over a two-minute stretch, capped by Tate\u2019s layup with 4:34 left that gave the Mountaineers a 20-point lead.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be a battle, we knew it was going to be a fight,\u201d said point guard Jaden Johnson, who had eight points and seven rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe got kicked in the mouth tonight, but we can\u2019t let this game affect us. We\u2019ve been playing well, so we\u2019re going to continue that trend and just look forward to Saturday and being able to get a win.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s game is the second of a doubleheader with the ODU women's basketball team, who host Texas State at 1.\n\nIt is alumni night for both teams.\n\nODU will honor the 1975 men\u2019s team that won the Division II national championship 50 years ago. It was the first national title for ODU.\n\nMost members of that team, including Wilson Washington and Oliver Purnell, will be honored at halftime.\n\nTen family members of the late Sonny Allen, who coached the 1975 Monarchs, will attend the game, including his son, Billy Allen, who played for his father at SMU and Nevada.\n\nODU will also honor the 40th anniversary of the 1985 women's basketball national championship team and 45th anniversary of the 1980 national championship team. Members of the 1979 national championship team will also be honored.\n\nMarianne Stanley, who coached all three ODU national championship games, will be in attendance.",

This success highlights renewable natural gas\u2019 potential and fosters new opportunities for transport, industry, and consumers.\u201d\n\nChevron said it estimates the project sites could result in a reduction of more than 318,000 tons of CO 2 equivalent annually.\n\nThe circularity centers are Mondovi in Wisconsin; Paullina, Centerville, Kirkman and Sanborn in Iowa; Montpelier in Ohio; Milbank and Hurley in South Dakota; and Coopersville in Michigan, which is supplied by two locations, the company said.\n\nTo date, Brightmark\u2019s RNG circularity centers have reduced emissions by more than 1.2 million tons of CO\u2082 equivalent, according to the release. That is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by planting and growing nearly 20 million trees for 10 years, Chevron said.",

With diverse upstream and downstream activities, Chevron remains well-positioned to navigate industry volatility while driving advancements in energy and sustainability. CVX is slated to announce its fiscal Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Friday, Jan. 31.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts expect the oil company to report a profit of $2.24 per share , a 35.1% dip from $3.45 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of the past four quarters while missing on another occasion. CVX surpassed the consensus EPS estimate by a 1.6% margin in the most recent quarter.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect CVX to report EPS of $10.22, marking a decline of 22.2% from $13.13 in fiscal 2023 . Nevertheless, EPS is expected to rebound in fiscal 2025, anticipating a 7.4% year-over-year growth, reaching $10.98.\n\nShares of Chevron have lagged behind the broader markets over the past 52 weeks, gaining 7.5% , while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has risen 24.4% , and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLE ) has returned nearly 12% on a YTD basis.\n\nShares of CVX rose 2.9% on Nov. 1 primarily due to better-than-expected Q3 results , including EPS of $2.51 and revenue of $50.7 billion, both surpassing the consensus. The outperformance was driven by record production from the Permian Basin and contributions from the PDC Energy acquisition, which bolstered U.S. upstream output. Investors were also encouraged by Chevron's strong free cash flow of $5.6 billion, which supported robust shareholder returns, including $2.9 billion in dividends and $4.7 billion in share buybacks. Despite a decline in profit from weaker oil prices and narrower downstream margins, the company\u2019s operational resilience and efficient capital allocation supported the stock's rise.\n\nAnalysts' consensus view on CVX stock remains bullish, with a \"Strong Buy\" rating overall. Out of 22 analysts covering the stock, 15 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" two \"Moderate Buys,\" and five give a \"Hold\" rating. This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 13 analysts suggesting a \"Strong Buy.\"\n\nThe average analyst price target for CVX is $176, suggesting a potential upside of 11.2% from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Free gloves also will be distributed during a pre-race event on Friday and Saturday.\n\nRob Salinas/Houston Public Media\n\nTemperatures in the 40s are expected on Sunday for the start of the annual Chevron Houston Marathon.\n\nFrank Billingsley, a meteorologist, executive producer and host at Houston Public Media, said a cold front will arrive this weekend.\n\n\"It should be good marathon weather, temperature-wise, but what we'll have to watch for is that wind,\" Billingsley said. \"The winds might not be completely calmed down by Sunday morning.\"\n\nThe flat terrain in Houston is considered gold for many runners looking to achieve a new milestone in the event. Race director for the Houston Marathon Committee, Carly Caulfield, has assisted at 25 races over the years. With Sunday's cold forecast, Caulfield said the Houston Marathon Committee plans to communicate expected weather conditions to the runners so they can prepare.\n\n\"We want to encourage layering, so wear more than you think you're going to need,\" Caulfield said.\n\nRob Salinas/Houston Public Media\n\nWarming buses will be located at five different locations along the 26-mile route, offering opportunities for runners to warm up.\n\n\"The winds downtown can be particularly harsh,\u201d Caulfield said. \u201cThere's a tunneling effect downtown, so the winds feel worse down there than in other parts of the race. So, at the start line expect it to be windier than anywhere else.\"\n\nDuring the Houston Marathon Health & Fitness EXPO , free gloves will be given away to assist runners in keeping their hands warm. The EXPO is scheduled for 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Friday and 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nNeil Gandhi, the assistant medical director at the emergency department for Houston Methodist Hospital, shared what runners should keep in mind.\n\n\"I think it's important for these folks to stay hydrated,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cUnderstand that their muscles are going to contract a little bit less efficiently during the race. So, that might cause them to change some of their pace; they also may be fatigued a little more quickly.\"\n\nRob Salinas/Houston Public Media\n\nGandhi encouraged runners to cover potentially exposed areas, like their fingers, toes and ears.\n\n\"Your body is going to be really focused on maintaining its core body temperature, so what that means is your body is going to shunt or divert blood flow to keep all of your core organ systems functioning optimally \u2014 your brain, your heart, your lungs,\" Gandhi said. \"You can start to see constriction of blood vessels in your extremities. This can lead to symptoms of numbness in your hands and feet.\"\n\nCaulfield said the race has made an impact in the lives of not only runners but on causes that impact the Houston area.\n\nThe Run For a Reason charity program, which started in 1995, has raised more than $39 million to benefit various charitable organizations, including causes for assist the homeless, food banks, childhood illnesses and cancer.\n\nA course map can be found on the marathon website.",

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.65%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 2.45%.\n\nThe oil company's stock has climbed by 5.93% in the past month, exceeding the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 7.35% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.31%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Chevron in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on January 31, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.42, showcasing a 29.86% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $47.27 billion, indicating a 0.19% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Chevron. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 4.83% lower within the past month. Chevron is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nIn the context of valuation, Chevron is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 13.88. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.92, so one might conclude that Chevron is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that CVX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.37. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.77.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 45, which puts it in the top 18% of all 250+ industries.",

A deal has not been finalized. The loan had other suitors, including Houston-based Hines, and former landlords DivcoWest and Blackstone.\n\nParamount and an unidentified partner bought Market Center in 2019 for $722 million, or $969 per square foot. In late 2023, the real estate investment trust wrote its investment down to zero, telling analysts last year that its value had sunk below the value of the debt used to acquire it.\n\nMarket Center, once known as Chevron Towers, includes a 22-story tower built in 1964 at 555 market, and a 40-story tower built in 1975 at 575 Market.

CEO Greg Flynn declined to comment to the Business Times.\n\nFlynn could bring in a capital partner \u2014 likely a deep-pocketed group to help provide the requisite amount of equity to close the deal, according to the newspaper. Or it could obtain money from a larger group of investors.\n\nIn August, it partnered with Ellis Partners to buy a 108,800-square-foot office building at 631 Howard Street for $36.4 million, or $334 per square foot.\n\nWhile Flynn has picked up distressed properties in San Francisco, the company and Chicago-based Gem Realty Capital defaulted on two office buildings in November whose appraised value dropped 76 percent in five years at 222 Kearny Street and 180 Sutter Street.\n\nFlynn Properties, founded in 1994, owns more than 3 million square feet of tech office buildings on the West Coast, plus 114 hotels in 29 states, as well as two luxury resorts in Mexico, according to its website.\n\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew",

Still, questions arose regarding the timing and which part (detention/retention ponds or park amenities) would be constructed first, so the board did not approve the master plan.\n\nRepresentatives of RDG Planning and Design and Halff Associates will be present at the study session to outline how both components must be a collaborative, unified effort.\n\nChevron Deference\n\nChevron Deference is a legal principle from the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc. It requires courts to defer to a federal agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency administers. This doctrine has influenced how courts review agency decisions, often giving agencies significant leeway to implement regulations.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court has curtailed Chevron Deference, signaling a shift toward requiring courts to scrutinize agency interpretations of laws more closely. The decision emphasizes limiting agency power, asserting that courts should independently interpret ambiguous statutes rather than defer to agencies. This ruling could restrict federal agencies' regulatory authority, increasing judicial oversight and potentially reshaping the administrative state.\n\nThe city attorney has prepared an opinion on this matter and will attend the meeting on how the recent ruling could impact or be applied to the city\u2019s consent decree with the EPA and the Department of Justice.\n\nUtility Advisory Committee Charter\n\nThe previous charter was proposed at the Jan. 7 meeting, but some board members felt the committee had too much autonomy. The main shift in the proposed charter is the centralization of authority in the Board of Directors. This limits the Utility Advisory Committee's ability to act independently and shifts some preparatory responsibilities to the committee itself.\n\nAct 235 of 2015\n\nAlso on the agenda is the board\u2019s annual compliance with Act 235 of 2015 to assemble and organize the City of Fort Smith governing body for 2025. Act 235 requires that \u201cmembers of a governing body elected for each city or town shall annually in January assemble and organize the governing body.\u201d\n\nThe board already has adopted the meeting dates for 2025. To comply with the requirement of Act 235, the board has to review the provisions in the Municipal Code, which establishes the procedures for setting agendas and conducting meetings of the governing body.",

            "content": "A group of civil society organizations is urging President Joe Biden to issue a pardon for environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, saying that the \u201cscorched-earth\u201d campaign against him pursued by Chevron is a \u201cstain\u201d on the U.S. legal system.\n\nThe groups said that Donziger has been the subject of a series of abuses of the U.S. court system, pointing out that a UN working group has previously found that his nearly three years in detention were carried out in violation of international law.\n\n\u201cMr. Donziger\u2019s case is a stain on our nation\u2019s justice system and casts a chill on advocates for human rights and environmental justice,\u201d the groups said in the letter, sent on Monday.\n\nThe letter was signed by 16 groups, including environmental groups like Greenpeace and other advocacy groups like Veterans for Peace and the National Lawyers Guild. The letter effort was spearheaded by Defending Rights & Dissent.\n\nDonziger has become a well-known figure in the environmental movement for a lawsuit he led with Indigenous communities against Texaco, now owned by Chevron, for illegal dumping of waste in Ecuador \u2014 and the legal firestorm that followed. Documents and testimonies found that Chevon had collaborated with a law firm to pursue charges that advocates have said were frivolous and meant to serve as a deterrent to environmental activists wishing to take on Big Oil.\n\nOthers, including Amnesty International, have also called for Biden to pardon Donziger.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to me is a major breach of the right to a fair trial,\u201d Donziger recently told Amnesty International in an interview. \u201cAnd I think the only way to really correct this as a country is for President Biden to pardon me and to make a strong statement to remedy the human rights violations in my case.\u201d\n\nA pardon \u201cwould send a signal that President Biden, who claims to be a climate president and a rule of law president, can walk the walk, not just do the talk. And it would be a really important opportunity for him to stand up for the principles that he purports,\u201d Donziger went on.\n\nAfter Donziger obtained a landmark win in Ecuadorian court against Chevron, Chevron filed a lawsuit slapping him with Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) charges.\n\nIn a highly abnormal move, the judge in the suit ordered Donziger to turn over his communications, including his electronic case files, as part of the trial. The judge held him in contempt of court when he refused, then appointed a private law firm that had previously worked for Chevron to prosecute him. Donziger was sentenced to pre-trial arrest, and then sentenced to prison, where he served nearly 1,000 days \u2014 making him the only known case of a lawyer being held in detention for misdemeanor contempt charges.\n\nLegal experts have noted that Donziger\u2019s case was \u201crigged\u201d against him, showing the vast power that major oil and gas companies hold against environmental and climate advocates in the U.S.\n\nIn the letter to Biden, the civil society groups pointed out that reports have shown that Chevron covertly met with the law firm appointed to prosecute Donziger 32 times over the course of his case.\n\n\u201cThe coordination between Chevron and the private law firm prosecuting Mr. Donziger illustrates the irregularities in the case,\u201d the groups said. \u201cThe irregularities of the proceedings against Mr. Donziger and unusual harshness of his treatment constitute a grave injustice and threaten free speech protections in our society.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t is clear this was an abuse of the legal system by Chevron to punish Mr. Donziger. This corporate hijacking of the legal system not only visited a severe injustice upon Mr. Donziger, it sent a chilling message to other human rights and environmental advocates,\u201d said Chip Gibbons, policy director for Defending Rights & Dissent. \u201cPardoning Mr. Donziger is not only necessary to right the wrong that has been personally done to him, but to help undo the broad chill to free expression rights this case has done.\u201d\n\nLast month, a group of 34 lawmakers, led by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Massachusetts), also wrote a letter to Biden asking him to issue a pardon for the lawyer.\n\n\u201cPardoning Mr. Donziger would instead send a powerful message to the world that billion-dollar corporations cannot act with impunity against lawyers and their clients who defend the public interest,\u201d the letter said.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump.

            "content": "The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Loper Bright case stands to have significant ramifications for various federal agencies, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB or Board). The ruling centered around the scope and limits of regulatory authority and could lead to substantial changes in how the NTSB operates and enforces its mandates.\n\nBackground of the Loper Bright Decision\n\nThe Loper Bright case was a landmark decision that scrutinized the extent of deference courts are required to give a federal agency's interpretations of its own regulations, commonly known as \"Chevron deference.\" The Supreme Court's ruling emphasized a stricter interpretation of statutory authority, limiting the discretionary powers of agencies in areas where Congress has not explicitly granted authority. This decision is poised to alter the landscape of administrative law, necessitating a careful examination of how federal agencies conduct their regulatory functions.\n\nImplications for the NTSB\n\nAs an independent federal agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents and promoting transportation safety, the NTSB may face several challenges as a result of the Loper Bright decision. The primary impacts could include:\n\nIncreased Scrutiny of Investigative Procedures\n\nThe NTSB's investigative procedures may come under increased scrutiny, requiring the Board to ensure that its actions are firmly grounded in statutory authority. Challenges can be expected with regard to how and when the NTSB allows entities it investigates to release information that the entity already had before an accident. Although the NTSB's enabling statute does permit the agency to determine the manner in which its investigations are conducted, including who may participate in the investigation, see 49 U.S.C. Section 1134(d), the statute is not as prescriptive when it comes to the Board's longstanding practice of prohibiting the release of what it classifies broadly as \"investigative information.\"\n\nUnder longstanding NTSB regulations, entities under investigation are prohibited from releasing information in the entities' own records absent NTSB approval. Although the NTSB typically works with these entities and eventually gives permission, the restrictions can cause significant frustration during what would otherwise be standard releases, such as during discovery in civil litigation, state and local law enforcement and regulatory investigations, public records requests and statements to the press by the entity itself. Although this prohibition has been challenged before, courts in those instances were bound by Chevron deference. But no more.\n\nIt is foreseeable that a plaintiff's counsel, eager to access information from a defendant that is under investigation by the NTSB, will not be willing to wait 12-24 months for the NTSB to allow discovery to proceed. On the opposite side, defendants often want to put out press releases and other information that shows they are not to blame for an accident. Post Loper Bright, both sides may take this opportunity to challenge the NTSB's regulations.\n\nCollaborations and Partnerships\n\nThe NTSB often collaborates with other federal agencies as well as industry stakeholders to enhance transportation safety. The Loper Bright decision might necessitate more explicit agreements and clearer delineation of authority in these collaborations. The Board may need to seek additional congressional authorization for joint initiatives or partnerships that involve regulatory actions.\n\nRole of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\n\nThe proposed establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could further change the dynamics within the NTSB. DOGE's role in ensuring that federal agencies adhere to statutory mandates means that the NTSB's investigative activities may undergo additional layers of oversight. This could both ensure greater accountability and place constraints on the NTSB's flexibility in addressing urgent safety concerns.\n\nWith DOGE's involvement, the NTSB might need to prioritize actions that have explicit legislative support while seeking additional approvals for broader initiatives. Enhanced oversight could lead to more rigorous assessments of safety recommendations, potentially delaying their implementation but ensuring they are thoroughly vetted.\n\nMitigating Potential Challenges\n\nTo navigate the potential challenges posed by the Loper Bright decision and the involvement of DOGE, the NTSB can take several proactive steps:\n\nSeek Legislative Clarification\n\nThe NTSB can work with Congress to seek clarifications or amendments to its enabling legislation. This would help ensure that the Board's authority during investigations is explicitly defined and aligned with the new legal framework established by the Loper Bright decision. Legislative support could provide the Board with the necessary tools to continue its mission effectively.\n\nEnhance Transparency and Accountability\n\nThe Board can enhance its transparency and accountability by clearly documenting the statutory basis for its actions. By providing detailed explanations of how its investigative procedures align with congressional mandates, the NTSB can strengthen its position against potential legal challenges going forward.\n\nStrengthen Interagency Coordination\n\nImproving coordination with other federal agencies and stakeholders can help the NTSB navigate the complexities of the new regulatory environment. By fostering stronger partnerships and ensuring that collaborative efforts are supported by clear and explicit authority, the Board can continue to promote transportation safety effectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Loper Bright decision marks a pivotal moment for federal agencies, including the NTSB. While the ruling presents significant challenges, it also offers an opportunity for the NTSB to strengthen its regulatory framework and enhance its effectiveness. By proactively addressing the implications of the decision and engaging with DOGE's oversight functions, the NTSB can continue to fulfill its mission of promoting transportation safety and preventing accidents.\n\nThe shifting legal landscape underscores the importance of clear statutory authority and robust regulatory practices. As the NTSB adapts to these changes, its commitment to safety and excellence is expected to remain unwavering, ensuring that it continues to serve the public and uphold the highest standards of transportation safety.\n\n20 Posts in 20 Days Leading to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20\n\nHolland & Knight's Transportation & Infrastructure Industry Sector Group is prepared to assist industry clients in adapting to the anticipated changes by the new administration.

And Super Bowl-winning guard Mark Schlereth hates it.\n\nAd\n\nSpeaking on 93.7 The Fan, he said that it reeked of selfishness - not a trait that is expected of players on championship-caliber teams:\n\n\"Great things happen when you care more about the people you play for than you do about youself. And I doubt George Pickens cares about anybody more than himself. That's a recipe for losing. Those are things that I just can't tolerate.\"\n\nAd\n\nHe continued by chastising Mike Tomlin for not being able to instill discipline in his charge:\n\n\"You cannot let that guy become a distraction. I understand he's a world-class talent. I don't care. That's a level of selfishness, and you wonder why you don't win championships. You wonder why you can't win a playoff game.\"\n\nThroughout the 2024 regular season and playoffs combined, George Pickens finished with a total of 64 receptions for 987 yards and four touchdowns.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Chevron (CVX 0.21%) already produces a lot of cash. The oil giant had hauled in more than $10 billion in free cash flow during the first nine months of last year, giving it a bounty to pay dividends and repurchase shares.\n\nIt's working to produce an even bigger gusher of excess cash by 2026, with it in the position to increase its annual tally by $6 billion to $8 billion. Here's a look at what's fueling the oil giant's bullish view.\n\nMultiple growth catalysts\n\nChevron CEO Michael Wirth recently stated his belief that the company can boost its free cash flow by $6 billion-$8 billion by next year. That's a hefty increase. He outlined several catalysts that position the oil company to produce an even bigger gusher of excess cash over the coming years.\n\nOne notable driver is the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is working to grow its output in the region from 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) last year to 300,000 BOE/d by 2026. Just this week, Chevron and partner Shell started producing oil from their Whale facility. The project, 40% owned by Chevron, should reach a production peak of 100,000 BOE/d during its first development phase. Chevron also recently started production at its Anchor project and began water injection operations at two legacy fields to boost their output.\n\nOn top of that, the company expects to start up a new project in Kazakhstan this year. It also continues to develop its U.S. onshore assets in the Permian and DJ basins. High-margin production from these projects will help supply the company with additional cash flow.\n\nChevron is also working to reduce its expenses by \"a couple billion dollars,\" stated Wirth. These cost cuts will fall right to the bottom line and boost its free cash flow.\n\nFinally, despite a setback, Chevron continues to feel \"very confident\" that it will be able to close its needle-moving acquisition of Hess. While rival Exxon and China's CNOOC, Hess' partners in Guyana, have proven to be obstacles in closing the deal, Chevron believes it will win its arbitration hearing. It can promptly close its acquisition if it does.\n\nChevron initially anticipated that buying Hess would help it more than double its free cash flow by 2027, assuming $70 oil. Even without Hess, the company was on track to deliver more than 10% annual free cash flow growth during that period (which assumed $60 oil) due to the strength of its organic expansion projects.\n\nWhat will Chevron do with all that extra cash?\n\nChevron already produces more cash than it needs to fund its operations and expansion. That's evident in its capital return program. During the third quarter, Chevron returned a record $7.7 billion of cash to shareholders, including about $4.7 billion in repurchases and paying roughly $2.9 billion in dividends. That exceeded its free cash flow ($5.2 billion), as the company used its strong balance sheet to return more money to shareholders.\n\nEven with those additional debt-funded returns, Chevron ended the period with an 11.9% leverage ratio, well below its 20% to 25% target range. That percentage will trend down in the near term after the company agreed to sell its Canadian assets in a $6.5 billion deal, which is part of its strategy to sell $10 billion to $15 billion of noncore assets through 2028.\n\nGiven Chevron's low-leverage balance sheet, it will likely continue returning the bulk of its excess cash to shareholders. The oil giant will undoubtedly maintain its streak of increasing its dividend (over 35 straight years). It has delivered peer-leading dividend growth over the last five years, including giving investors an 8% raise in early 2024. It could continue to grow the dividend at an above-average rate.\n\nChevron will also likely aim to repurchase shares near the top end of its $10 billion to $20 billion annual target range. That's enough to retire about 6% of its outstanding shares each year at its current valuation.\n\nChevron will likely use any additional excess cash to further strengthen its already elite balance sheet. That would give it even more financial flexibility during the next oil market downturn. The company currently has the balance sheet capacity to fund its capital program, a growing dividend, and repurchase shares at the low end of its target range through 2027 if oil averages $50 a barrel.\n\nA well-oiled machine\n\nChevron expects to add several billion dollars to its annual free cash flow over the next couple of years. That would give the oil giant even more money to return to shareholders through a growing dividend and meaningful repurchase program. That combination of growing cash flow and cash returns could give the oil producer the fuel to outperform its peers in the coming years.",

USA would extend the lead to double-digits for the first time at 5:54 after Corey finished in the paint making the score 30-20. ODU finished the first half down six, 39-33.\n\nPounds got the second half started quickly for ODU, finishing an and-one to cut the USA lead back to three at 18:43. Davis came back a minute later at 17:37 and made a three plus the foul to give ODU a 40-39 lead. Durugordon made a three-pointer off a USA turnover to take a 51-47 lead at 11:10 before a made shot in the paint by JJ Wheat at 10:43 and a three-pointer by Brown at 10:05 gave the Jaguars back the lead 52-51. Old Dominion regained the advantage at 4:16 from a layup by Durugordon assisted by Davis before Wheat went 50% at the line to tie the game at 3:52, 61-61. Both teams went scoreless until the 00:59 mark when Wheat finished in the paint to put South Alabama up 63-61. USA proceeded to apply a full-court press on ODU but Sean Durugordon found an angle and took it right to the hole and finished with 39 seconds remaining to tie the game at 63 and send it to overtime.\n\nThe Monarchs got on the board first in overtime at 4:19 from a put-back layup from Durugordon to take the lead 65-63. Robert Davis Jr. knocked down his eighth three of the night to put ODU up by five at 2:33. Down the stretch, Durugordon went 3-for-4 at the free throw line to give ODU an eight point lead. ODU\u2019s defense held USA to 0-8 shooting in overtime and forced one turnover.\n\nODU heads back to Norfolk to open up a four-game homestand, taking on App State on Jan. 16.",

            "content": "Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 11 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn hilly, upscale Pacific Palisades, home to Hollywood stars such as Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal who lost houses in the fire, officials have placed the origin of the wind-whipped blaze behind a home on Piedra Morada Drive, which sits above a densely wooded arroyo.\n\nWhile lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton Fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes.\n\nThe next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines.\n\nJohn Lentini, owner of Scientific Fire Analysis in Florida, who has investigated large fires in California including the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, said the size and scope of the blaze doesn\u2019t change the approach to finding out what caused it.\n\n\u201cThis was once a small fire,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cPeople will focus on where the fire started, determine the origin and look around the origin and determine the cause.\u201d\n\nSo far there has been no official indication of arson in either blaze, and utility lines have not yet been identified as a cause either.\n\nUtilities are required to report to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) when they know of \u201celectric incidents potentially associated with a wildfire,\u201d Terrie Prosper, the commission's communications director, said via email. CPUC staff then investigate to see if there were violations of state law.\n\nThe 2017 Thomas Fire, one of the largest fires in state history, was sparked by Southern California Edison power lines that came into contact during high wind, investigators determined. The blaze killed two people and charred more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers).\n\nOn Friday, Southern California Edison filed a report with the CPUC related to the Eaton Fire in the hills near Pasadena, an area the utility serves.\n\nEdison said it has not received any suggestions that its equipment was involved in the ignition of that fire, but that it filed the report with state utilities regulators out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d after receiving evidence preservation notices from insurance company lawyers.\n\n\u201cPreliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,\u201d the utility reported.\n\nWhile lightning, arson and utility lines are the most common causes, debris burning and fireworks are also common causes.\n\nBut fires are incited by myriad sources, including accidents.\n\nIn 2021, a couple's gender reveal stunt started a large fire that torched close to 36 square miles (about 90 square kilometers) of terrain, destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton.\n\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires were still burning with little containment on Friday. Winds softened, but there was no rain in the forecast as the flames moved through miles of dry landscape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to put that thing out until it\u2019s ready to go out.\u201d (AP)",

            "content": "When it comes to reputable investment options, investors frequently turn to the portfolios of celebrated investors like Warren Buffett. Two distinct companies featured in Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio are American Express and Chevron, each offering unique investment merits.\n\nAmerican Express, a prominent name in finance, primarily operates as a payment services provider. While it may be best known for its premium credit card offerings, its appeal lies in serving a segment of affluent customers who tend to spend more and are less affected by economic downturns. This stability leads to consistent transaction fees that underpin its business model.\n\nIn stark contrast, Cheron functions within the energy sector, managing a comprehensive range of oil and natural gas operations. This breadth offers some insulation against fluctuating energy prices, but Chevron\u2019s financial performance remains closely intertwined with market trends in oil and gas.\n\nFor conservative investors, American Express might seem like the safer choice, particularly given its strong revenue groundwork. However, the stock\u2019s recent surge in price raises concerns about its valuation, as it now trades at much higher multiples compared to historical averages. With a low dividend yield of 0.9%, potential investors might find it less appealing.\n\nOn the flip side, Chevron boasts a robust dividend yield of 4.4%. Its long-standing policy of annual increases in dividends reveals effective management strategies despite the volatility tied to energy prices. Thus, for those seeking attractive dividends without the pressure of overpaying, Chevron emerges as a more favorable option at this time.\n\nInvesting in American Express vs. Chevron: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nUnderstanding the Investment Landscape\n\nInvesting in reputable companies like American Express and Chevron can provide different benefits for investors depending on their risk tolerance, investment strategy, and financial goals. Both companies, part of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, offer distinct advantages and considerations.\n\nAmerican Express: Features and Insights\n\nAmerican Express (Amex) is not just a credit card provider; it encompasses an extensive range of payment solutions that appeal primarily to higher-income customers. Here are some key insights:\n\n\u2013 Market Positioning: Amex\u2019s focus on affluent clientele not only offers stability but also promotes a higher average transaction volume due to its premium services and products.\n\n\u2013 Revenue Model: The company generates consistent revenue through transaction fees, which are less sensitive to economic fluctuations compared to other financial services.\n\n\u2013 Risks: The high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently exceeds historical averages, raising concerns among traditional value investors.\n\nChevron: Advantages and Limits\n\nChevron Corporation is a major player in the energy sector, managing a diverse portfolio that includes oil and natural gas operations. Here\u2019s what you should know about this energy giant:\n\n\u2013 Strong Dividend Yield: With a dividend yield of 4.4%, Chevron is appealing to income investors. The company has a solid record of annual dividend increases, signaling confidence in its operational stability.\n\n\u2013 Income Stability: The diversified nature of Chevron\u2019s operations offers some protection against volatile oil and gas prices, though it remains sensitive to overall market trends.\n\n\u2013 Sustainability Initiatives: Dealing with market demand for greener energy solutions, Chevron is investing in sustainable energy technologies, which may position it favorably in the evolving energy landscape.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nAmerican Express\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong brand loyalty and customer base.\n\n\u2013 Stable revenue influenced by affluent spending patterns.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 High current valuation may deter new investors.\n\n\u2013 Low dividend yield limits appeal for income-focused investors.\n\nChevron\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Attractive dividend yield for income investors.\n\n\u2013 Diverse energy portfolio providing operational resilience.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Financial performance highly correlated with unpredictable energy market trends.\n\n\u2013 Regulatory risks and environmental concerns linked to fossil fuel operations.\n\nMarket Comparison and Predictions\n\nMarket Trends: With rising inflation and economic uncertainties, investors may gravitate toward companies with robust dividend policies such as Chevron for passive income. Conversely, American Express may attract those with a high-risk tolerance looking for growth given its premium branding and potential for future revenue growth as consumer spending rebounds.\n\nSecurity and Sustainability Aspects\n\n\u2013 Chevron\u2019s Sustainability Focus: Chevron is actively seeking to reduce its carbon footprint and invest in renewable energy. This strategic pivot could enhance its long-term market position.\n\n\u2013 American Express and Consumer Security: The company places a high emphasis on fraud prevention and cybersecurity, which is critical for maintaining customer trust in its offerings.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing between American Express and Chevron depends on individual investment strategies and tolerance for risk. For those focused on dividends and energy sector stability, Chevron may be the better choice. In contrast, growth-oriented investors might find American Express\u2019s premium brand attractive despite its high valuation.\n\nFor more insights into investment strategies, explore a range of resources at Berkshire Hathaway.",

            "content": "Investors often scour the portfolios of well-known investors for stock ideas. When they do that with Warren Buffett's portfolio of stocks, owned within his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.23%) (BRK.B 1.48%), they'll find a collection of iconic companies. Two that present very different investment propositions today are American Express (AXP -1.49%) and Chevron (CVX 0.21%). While these two companies are very different, that dichotomy might be the biggest selling point for Chevron.\n\nWhat do American Express and Chevron do?\n\nAmerican Express hails from the finance sector, describing itself as a globally integrated \"payments\" company. That's a pretty vague description. What most people will know American Express for is its namesake credit card. It competes with the likes of Mastercard and Visa. But there's a nuance here because American Express has long focused on higher-end customers. Such customers often spend more and are more resilient to economic volatility, leading to a fairly strong business foundation for this card issuer. So, the fees it collects for processing transactions are highly reliable over time.\n\nChevron couldn't be more different. It operates in the energy sector with a globally diversified portfolio of oil and natural gas production, transportation, and processing assets. Having exposure to the entire energy sector, from the upstream (production) to the downstream (processing), helps to soften the ups and downs, but Chevron's top and bottom lines are still going to track along with energy prices. Energy prices are prone to dramatic and swift swings.\n\nWhich is better: American Express or Chevron?\n\nFrom a big-picture perspective, conservative investors looking at Warren Buffett's portfolio will probably prefer American Express' business model. That said, there's a small fly in the ointment here. Since late 2023, American Express' share price has roughly doubled. That is a substantial advance in a very short period of time for such a large company.\n\nAt this point, American Express looks expensive in terms of all of the traditional valuation measures. To put some numbers on that, the company's price-to-sales ratio is 3.3x versus a five-year average of 2.5x, and its price-to-earnings ratio is 22x versus a longer-term average of roughly 18x. While it would be understandable if investors liked American Express' business model, with its annuity-like revenue stream, it would be hard to suggest that the entry price is attractive right now, noting that the 0.9% dividend yield is near its lowest levels of the past decade.\n\nOn the other hand, Chevron is offering a dividend yield of 4.4%. While that yield has been higher in the past, notably during the deep oil downturn that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic, the yield has been in the top half of the range over the past decade. And, notably, Chevron's stock hasn't doubled in price in roughly a year. In fact, the stock has gone mostly nowhere.\n\nWhile oil prices are the driving force at Chevron, long-term income investors have been well rewarded for sticking around just the same. The energy giant has increased its dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. That shows management knows how to navigate the sector's inherent volatility. And while there's no way to predict oil prices, if you are looking for a dividend stock and don't want to overpay, Chevron seems like a more attractive choice than American Express right now.\n\nDo your own homework\n\nWarren Buffett has an incredible investment record, but he isn't always right. Just because he owns a stock today doesn't mean he would buy it at the current price. So, you shouldn't just look at his list of holdings and start picking stocks. You need to dig in a little bit further. American Express is a good example of what you can end up with if you don't, given that it looks expensive right now. On the other hand, Chevron could be an attractive dividend stock, given its high yield and long history of dividend increases. That is, of course, assuming you are willing to suffer through the inherent volatility of the energy sector.",

The Ravens, who have won four in a row, will host Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nOn Saturday, Pittsburgh will try to contain Baltimore's strong offense, but they also need to find a way to put points on the board. They will need their star receiver George Pickens to perform at his best in order to do that.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nExploring George Pickens' availability status for tonight's Wild Card game\n\nGeorge Pickens is not dealing with any injuries, as the Pittsburgh Steelers didn't include him in their injury reports this week. This indicates the receiver will take his usual WR1 role when his side takes on the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium on Saturday night.\n\nPickens sustained a hamstring injury during practice in December 2024, which kept him out of the lineup for three games. He has, however, participated in two games since making his comeback in a Week 17 home game against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAd\n\nThose three games Pickens missed last month were the first he missed in his three-year career.\n\nWhen the Steelers lost to the Ravens in Week 16, they were without Pickens, and their passing approach appeared to be out of rhythm without their best receiver in that game. The team will likely look to get him going early against Baltimore.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nHow has George Pickens performed this season?\n\nGeorge Pickens has not played well since he recovered from a hamstring injury he suffered ahead of Week 14. In his first game back, he only recorded three catches for 50 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 17. As if that wasn't bad enough, he looked even worse in the regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nThe third-year receiver had a terrible day against the Bengals, with an unusual stat line of three drops, one reception and zero yards.\n\nPickens recorded 59 catches for 900 yards and three touchdowns in 14 regular season games, which is not good enough. Even after missing three games due to injury, a receiver of his caliber should have no trouble posting 1,000 yards.\n\nIf the Steelers want to have any possibility of winning their wild-card game against the Ravens on Saturday, Pickens must perform well.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

The deal has been approved by its shareholders and also gained clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with the qualification that the chief executive of Hess Corporation cannot join the Chevron board.\n\nThe arbitration, which is taking place under the International Chamber of Commerce rules, is slated to be heard in May 2025, and the final decision is expected by September 2025.

The exceptional output demonstrates the block\u2019s excellent reservoir quality, predicting higher-than-expected output from future projects. With six projects \u2014 three operational and three in progress\u2014 the block is aimed at producing about 1.3 million b/d (barrels of oil per day) by 2027. However, Hess forecasts that the figure could reach 1.7 million b/d due to operating efficiency and productivity. Beyond these, unsanctioned projects like Hammerhead and Longtail are also planned for 2028-2029, further boosting the block\u2019s output with promising returns.\n\nThe current results and the future prospects of Guyana\u2019s Stabroek Block are motivating factors for Chevron for the alleged Chevron-Hess merger deal.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d\n\nCramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn\u2019t the case with banks. He shared \u201cThis is a group that when you look at it, they\u2019re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There\u2019s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.\u201d He added \u201cThe valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there\u2019s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There\u2019s the inexpensive market and we\u2019re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a diversified oil company with a presence from the oil field to the pump. The firm is currently struggling to complete its $53 billion buyout of Hess Corp. which would enable it to expand production in the US and increase its presence in Guyana. However, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u2019s oil rival Exxon and Hess are currently engaged in arbitration over Hess\u2019 Guyana operations. Cramer commented on the firm\u2019s stock struggling despite returning capital:\n\n\u201cChevron being a classic example of a company that\u2019s been returning a lot of capital and it\u2019s just been a dog. Which is amazing cause Mike Wirth is a fantastic CEO.\u201d\n\nOverall, CVX ranks 14th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the start of oil production from the Whale semi-submersible platform in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, owns 40% working interest in Whale, with Shell Offshore Inc. owning 60% interest as operator.\n\nThe milestone is Chevron\u2019s latest following a year when it achieved first production from its industry-first high-pressure Anchor project and commenced water injection operations at two projects to boost production at the company\u2019s Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti facilities in the Gulf.\n\n\u201cProduction from Whale brings Chevron another step closer to reaching 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by 2026,\u201d said Bruce Niemeyer, president, Chevron Americas Exploration & Production. \u201cAs a leading leaseholder in the Gulf, where we produce some of the lowest carbon intensity oil and natural gas in the world, Chevron is well positioned to continue growing affordable, reliable production in the U.S. while delivering higher returns and cash flow.\u201d\n\nEstimated peak production is 100,000 gross boe/d, with up to 15 wells in the first phase of development. Featuring energy-efficient gas turbines and compression systems, Whale leverages a simplified design model that is expected to deliver lower emissions, lower costs and higher returns.\n\nWhale is approximately 200 miles (320 km) southwest of Houston on Alaminos Canyon Block 773 in more than 8,600 feet (2,620 m) of water. It\u2019s approximately 10 miles from the Shell-operated Perdido spar platform, where Chevron U.S.A. Inc. owns 37.5% interest.\n\nAbout Chevron\n\nChevron is one of the world\u2019s leading integrated energy companies. We believe affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to enabling human progress. Chevron produces crude oil and natural gas; manufactures transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals and additives; and develops technologies that enhance our business and the industry. We aim to grow our oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen and other emerging technologies.

The defeat brings Louisiana to a record of 4-12 and 2-2 in the Sun Belt.\n\nA layup by Caelum Swanton-Rodger, a pullup in the paint by Jaden Johnson, and a pair of free throws got ODU out to a six-point lead to start the game. By the 13:26 mark, ODU had grown the lead to 10 (14-4) after a made free throw by freshman Caden Diggs. For the remainder of the half the Ragin Cajuns chipped into the Monarch lead and after a 12-0 run held their first lead at the 4:38 mark (23-21) after Kyndall Davis made a driving layup. Durugordon answered back with made threes on back-to-back possessions as both sides traded the lead in the last minute of the half. R.J. Blakney made a three-pointer assisted by Johnson with five seconds remaining to give ODU a 32-30 lead at halftime.\n\nLouisiana got off to a strong start to open the second half to jump out to a 39-34 lead, its largest of the night. The Monarchs stormed back with a run of their own, a nine-point run to take back the lead 43-39 after a made free throw by Durugordon. A Dani Pounds pick-and-pop three at the 9:08 mark grew ODU\u2019s lead to double-digits for the first time in the second (57-47). The closest ULL would be able to claw back to was nine points from then on, closing out the 11-point victory.\n\nDurugordon finished with 20 points, the third time this season he has scored 20+ points. The transfer from Siena went a perfect 8-8 from the free throw line along with grabbing a team high seven rebounds. ODU had three players score in double figures, with Robert Davis Jr. and Johnson both scoring 13 points in the win. Johnson finished with six assists, five rebounds, and went 5-6 from the line. Davis had two assists including a full court pass to Blakney for a fastbreak layup and two made threes in 39 minutes played. Blakney went 3-4 from the field and grabbed six boards in his 21 minutes of action. He also swatted two blocks and snagged one steal.\n\nAs a team, the Monarchs shot 45% from the field (22-49), 77% at the free throw line (20-26), and 33% from beyond the arc (7-21). ODU led for 33:49 of the game and their largest lead was 13.\n\nThe Monarchs travel to South Alabama for a Sun Belt Conference matchup on Saturday, Jan. 11 at 3 p.m.",

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this oil company have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Chevron belongs, has lost 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $2.44 per share, indicating a change of -29.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20%. This estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.67 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "ExxonMobil (XOM) is the largest and most profitable oil and gas company in the U.S. and is also one of the largest companies in the world. As of Jan. 9, 2025, the company had a market capitalization of more than $469 billion with more than 14 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nIt is a major integrated energy company with many energy commodity interests, including electrical power generating operations. At the core of its business is the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and natural gas. In 2023, ExxonMobil earned $36 billion and had net oil-equivalent production of 3.7 million barrels per day. XOM had a dividend yield of 3.70% as of Jan. 9, 2025.\n\nThis is a look at some of Exxon Mobile's top competitors, which include Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell.\n\nKey Takeaways ExxonMobil is the largest and most profitable oil and gas company in the U.S. with domestic and global rivals.\n\nChevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company.\n\nConocoPhillips is a U.S.-based energy exploration and production company.\n\nPreviously known as Royal Dutch Shell, Shell PLC is a London-based energy company that also invests in alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\nChevron Corporation\n\nOriginally headquartered in San Ramon, California, Chevron (CVX) announced a move to Houston, Texas in August 2024. Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company, with a market capitalization of about $267.9 billion and an average daily trading volume of more than seven million shares as of Jan. 9, 2025. The company has integrated petroleum, chemicals, mining, and power generation operations.\n\nChevron had total earnings of $21.3 billion in 2023, and its annual per-share dividend payout has consistently risen each year. The company's average oil-equivalent production was 3.1 million barrels per day. CVX returned $26.3 billion to shareholders in 2023 in the form of $11.3 billion in dividends and $14.9 billion in share repurchases.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) is a Houston-based company that positioned itself as an exploration and production company within the oil and gas industry. The company engages in the worldwide exploration, production, transportation, and marketing of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and liquefied natural gas.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, 2025, the company's market capitalization was $131.45 billion, and its average daily trading volume was 6.57 million shares. At that time, COP paid a dividend yield of 3.07%.\n\nConocoPhillips earned a total of $11 billion in 2023, and it produced over 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company also had another 6.8 billion barrels of reserves for the year.\n\nShell PLC\n\nOriginally from the Netherlands and known as Royal Dutch Shell, this company is now based in London and simply goes by Shell (SHEL). The company had a market capitalization of more than $198.7 billion as of Jan. 9, 2025, with more than 4.2 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nShell had net earnings of $28 billion in 2023 and ended the year with reserves of nine billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nShell also invests in alternative energy sources. The company has interests in numerous wind energy projects in North America, Europe, and Asia, including multiple in its original home of the Netherlands. It anticipates that its future growth will come from its upstream operations, where technological advances will help the company find new liquid and natural gas reserves. The company also has growth strategies in integrated gas and underwater drilling.\n\nIs ExxonMobil a Downstream or Upstream Company? ExxonMobil is considered an integrated company, which means it has upstream and downstream operations. As part of its upstream operations, the company explores, extracts, and ships raw materials. The majority of its profits are derived from its upstream operations. XOM's downstream operations involve the manufacturing and distribution of crude oil products.\n\nWhat Does Downstream Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry? The term downstream refers to a side of the oil and gas industry that involves converting oil and gas into finished products. Downstream operations results in the production of natural gas, gasoline, and other types of energy sources. Energy companies that are exclusively involved in downstream activities are directly linked to end users. Many companies, though, are involved in downstream, midstream (refining), and upstream (exploration and extraction).\n\nWho Are ExxonMobil's Largest Institutional Shareholders? The largest institutional shareholders of ExxonMobil are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street. They held 432.11 million (9.83% of outstanding shares), 306.81 million (6.98% of outstanding shares), and 221.68 million (5.04% of outstanding shares), respectively. These figures are as of Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nExxonMobil is a U.S.-based crude oil and natural gas company with operations around the world. Since it has upstream and downstream operations, it explores, produces, transports, manufactures, and sells crude oil and gas products. Although XOM competes with rivals Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell domestically and abroad, it retains the top spot in the United States.",

CEO Michael Wirth is betting big on expanded oil production from U.S. shale, Kazakhstan, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 2026, Chevron's Gulf operations alone will churn out 300,000 barrels daily, up from last year's 200,000. Meanwhile, Wirth sees natural gas stepping into the limelight as AI data centers hunger for energya move that could outpace nuclear energy for now. It's clear: Chevron isn't just surviving the energy transitionit's steering the ship.\n\nAnd then there's the $53 billion prize: Hess Corp. Chevron's takeover of Hess is barreling toward the finish line, with arbitration over Exxon Mobil's (XOM) challenge expected to wrap by September. Hess CEO John Hess isn't sweating it, calling Exxon's claims baseless and declaring Chevron's deal rock-solid. Once sealed, this merger hands Chevron a hefty slice of Guyana's oil-rich Stabroek block, positioning it for a stronger foothold in global oil markets. This isn't just a merger; it's a power move.\n\nFor investors, the signals are clear: Chevron is playing a long game that's as bold as it is strategic. From pioneering deepwater oil fields to doubling down on natural gas and sealing game-changing deals, this is a company laser-focused on growth while keeping an eye on the future of energy. Chevron's moves now could shape its dominance for years to come.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made clear on Wednesday that he will not miss the Biden administration, briefly breaking from the diplomatic language major oil executives typically adopt when discussing politics. Wirth slammed President Joe Biden's decision to ban new oil and gas drilling in 625 million acres of waters along the U.S. coasts, while indicating that he looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration. \"It's one last gasp of poor politics from an administration that never really understood energy investment in America,\" Wirth told CNBC's Brian Sullivan in a wide-ranging interview. The CEO said it is possible that oil will be discovered in those waters, and they should be free for development if resources are found. President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he will revoke Biden's ban on his first day in office, though this may require an act of Congress rather than a simple executive order. Wirth said Chevron would \"certainly support efforts to reverse the ban that President Biden enacted.\" The CEO said he expects Trump will encourage investment in U.S. energy across the board. Also, the administration will likely be stacked with officials friendly to the oil and gas industry. The president-elect, for example, has picked Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy . \"We've got an incoming administration, particularly in some of the key agencies, that has deep energy experience, deep energy knowledge,\" Wirth said. Trump campaigned on a platform to unleash energy production, but Wirth sought to temper expectations on that front. The U.S. is already the largest oil producer in the world, the CEO said, indicating that production growth will likely slow in the coming years. \"There's still some upside, but probably not growth at the rate that we've seen over the last number of years as particularly some of these new shale plays begin to mature,\" Wirth said. The Biden administration accelerated the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S. through the Inflation Reduction Act, but Wirth said oil, coal and natural gas still represent the backbone of the energy system. The CEO sees a big opportunity for natural gas on the horizon as artificial intelligence data centers consume a growing amount of electricity. Wirth said Chevron will help supply these data centers with gas , hinting at more specific announcements on the horizon. \"These data centers need 24/7 power at a high degree of reliability,\" Wirth said. \"Wind and solar are intermittent. Coal is going out of the system. And so we really do see a big opportunity for natural gas over the next several years.\"",

America\u2019s second largest oil and gas company expects to achieve these results thanks to the start of new or expanded oil production projects in Kazakhstan, growth in U.S. shale and offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\n\nChevron has projected oil production growth in the Gulf of Mexico to clock in at 300,000 barrels per day by 2026, up from 200,000 last year. Back in August, Chevron produced its first oil from a pioneering U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater field under extreme pressures. The field is expected to produce up to 75,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, with the company lining up two more offshore projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron is looking to close the gap between it and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) through the acquisition of Hess Corp. (NYSE:HES). On Monday, Hess CEO John Hess said he's \"very confident\" that the company's planned $53 billion sale to Chevron will be completed.\n\n\"We're very confident that the merger is going to go through and we're getting prepared for that,\" Hess said at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy, Clean Technologies & Utilities Conference on Tuesday.\n\nHess expects that an arbitration panel over Exxon Mobil's right-of-first-refusal claim on Hess' 30% stake in Guyana's huge oil discovery will make its final decision by late August or September with the hearing set to commence in May.\n\n\"I think it should be wrapped up by September,\u2019\u2019 Hess said. \"The three arbitrators that are in-place now have been very clear. That's when their decision is going to be rendered. And once that's done, we'll close our deal.\"\n\nExxon has been trying to stop the merger with the future of the deal resting on whether the transaction would involve a change of control of Hess' Guyana subsidiary. Exxon claims Hess should have first given it the opportunity to purchase its stake in the prized Guyana asset, and that Chevron structured the deal in a way to bypass Exxon\u2019s right of first refusal if it\u2019s triggered by a change of control in Guyana.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

It has been a clear-cut case of abuse of the justice system by a major corporation to target and harass human rights defenders \u2013 and how the case is closed will set an important precedent.\n\nDuring the period until the transfer of power to the Trump administration on 20 January, Biden must use the opportunity to issue a pardon to Donziger.\n\nSteven Donziger was a young environmental lawyer when he was invited to the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest to investigate a case of pollution by Chevron-then Texaco- in 1993. What he witnessed was beyond any expectation: a grotesque system of pollution dumping that deliberately harmed the environment and local communities \u2013 all, in his view, in an attempt to save money by the company, an allegation which Chevron denies. Representing Indigenous and rural communities harmed by the pollution, Steven won the case in Ecuador. As a result, Chevron, which subsequently purchased Texaco, was ordered to pay 9.5 billion dollars in damages. The company refused to comply with the ruling and instead launched a myriad of legal complaints at Steven and others involved in the case, entangling him in a long legal battle.\n\nNow, over 30 years since he first visited the Amazon, Steven is still dealing with the retaliation from taking an oil giant to court.\n\nDuring this extensive legal battle with Chevron, Steven has faced multiple violations of his right to a fair trial. In the process, he was charged with contempt of court for refusing to hand his computer and other devices containing his privileged attorney-client material from the lawsuit against Chevron to the court. Steven said that he \u201crefused to do so as a matter of protecting my clients\u2019 legal rights and their lives, because doing so would put their lives in jeopardy\u201d. The US Attorney declined to prosecute him on this contempt charge. Ordinarily, this would have ended the legal proceedings for this charge. Instead, the presiding judge in New York requested the case be continued and appointed a private law firm to prosecute Steven in place of the government.\n\nThe maximum sentence for the contempt charge was 180 days. Yet, Steven Donziger spent over four times this length deprived of his liberty (under house arrest in New York City, then in a prison in the state of Connecticut, and later in a halfway house in New York) for refusing to hand over his computer while he challenged the order and fought his contempt charge. He was ultimately convicted of the contempt charge and was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which he served 45 days, and also spent time in a halfway house. But despite having served this sentence, his case still continues year after year.\n\nInternational human rights mechanisms, including the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, concluded that Steven\u2019s deprivation of liberty was arbitrary after identifying that this situation constituted legal harassment in the form of a SLAPP suit: Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation. What this means is that the lawsuit by Chevron following Steven\u2019s discovery, and subsequent victory, in Ecuador is meant to force him into silence. This creates a chilling precedent for human rights defenders in the US and around the world, and Chevron denies this claim. Despite the intimidation, Steven continues with his work, determined to get the reparations that the people he has defended all these years deserve.\n\nAmnesty International sat down with Steven to hear his story, and how it has unraveled since he first visited the Amazon over 30 years ago (the text is minimally edited for length).\n\nWhat inspired you to become an environmental lawyer?\n\nGrowing up, my mom had a big influence on me. And when I was a teenager or even younger, we would go to protests in my hometown for various issues. It had a big impact on me, and something switched on in me at that time, and it\u2019s never turned off. When I went to law school, I went with the idea that I would use whatever legal skills I could gain and develop to help people who otherwise would not have access to high levels of legal talent because of a lack of funds. That was what motivated me to go to law school, and after that, through circumstance, I sort of fell into this case in Ecuador and became an environmental lawyer.\n\nHow did you come to represent an Ecuadorian village in such a grand-scale case against Chevron/Texaco?\n\nOther than a broad sense that I wanted to do justice work as a lawyer, I really wasn\u2019t 100% sure where it would take me, so I didn\u2019t start out in the profession wanting to become an environmental lawyer. What happened was, I was brought down to Ecuador with a group of people to investigate what we had been told was awful oil pollution caused by Texaco. We went down there in April of 1993, and I saw it with my own eyes. I talked to people who lived in the area, and at that point, there was no turning back. I got involved in this case, and little by little, it essentially took over the bulk of my professional life for a number of years.\n\nHow were the Indigenous people in Ecuador being impacted by the pollution in the Amazon?\n\nWhat I saw on that first trip was shocking. I expected to see pollution, but I didn\u2019t expect to see hundreds of open-air pools of oil waste gouged out of the jungle. It was leaching into the soil and groundwater and being piped off into rivers and streams that local communities were using for their drinking water. One of the most shocking things is that the system was so clearly engineered to pollute, what I saw was not the result of an accidental spill. It was part of a design plan to save money at the expense of the health, and really lives, of thousands of people who are living in the area. And it manifested in really disturbing ways. For example, Texaco would suck the waste oil out of these pits that I described, and they would put it in tanker trucks that would drive around on the dirt roads and spew it out the back from a giant hose onto the road. Most of the people I knew couldn\u2019t even afford to buy a pair of shoes, nor based on their culture, did they even need shoes, and they would walk barefoot along these oil slick roads. There was oil, fresh oil, and old and crusted oil on their bodies, and the only way to get it off was to use toxic alcohol to rub it away. People were being exposed multiple times a day to cancer-causing oil waste. And it wasn\u2019t just the oil on the roads, it was in the water. People were drinking contaminated water. You could see it in the water. Formerly fresh water sources in this beautiful ecosystem had been contaminated. You could see it in the air. When it would rain, and it rains a lot in the Amazon, often the rain would come down with soot \u2013 they called it black rain. The only way people thought they could get clean water in this environment was to put out old barrels that Texaco had left behind on the roofs of their homes to capture rainwater, but more often than not, the rainwater itself was contaminated. There was no escape from the oil, there were multiple exposures a day to extremely harmful toxins, many of them carcinogenic. It was clear that this was a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.\n\nI\u2019ve only just talked about people, but this is one of the most biodiverse areas of the world and thousands of animal and plant species were suffering the same fate from exposure to the oil, dying of cancer and otherwise being harmed by a deliberate decision by an American oil company to dump its toxic waste into this beautiful area. It was enormous, they had six different oil fields in this concession with hundreds of well sites. Each well site had multiple open air, toxic waste pits that were filled with oil waste unlined, and they had pipes from these pits going into streams and rivers that people were drinking out of. The magnitude of the disaster in Ecuador was, in terms of its scope and maybe its overall harm and the amount of area it affected, possibly unprecedented in the world. The most shocking thing about it was that it was deliberate. I couldn\u2019t get around that, I studied the practices of Chevron/Texaco and the industry as a whole and a lot of this was just standard practice.\n\nThis case against Chevron and the ensuing retaliation against you has come to define your global image. When you first came to be involved in this case, did you think it was going to be such a defining aspect of your life?\n\nNo, I really thought it would end in three years. It\u2019s been over 30. I thought it was so bad that all we needed to do was get the case moving, and it was so obvious they had a major liability. I thought we could sit with the lawyers, and we could hopefully come to a resolution, because clearly, they had made billions of dollars of profit from the operations in Ecuador over 25 years, and there was no reason they couldn\u2019t take a portion of that and use it for a proper cleanup. We went into court believing in the law, and they came to court wanting to weaponize the law to evade accountability. They used the court as a way to exercise their power and try to intimidate those who try to hold them accountable. We\u2019ve seen that time and again.\n\nWhen we first filed in US courts, they wanted it in Ecuador, and they got it, but as a condition of that agreement they promised to accept jurisdiction. Yet we got to Ecuador, and they challenged the jurisdiction. They promised to pay in the adverse judgment, and we won the case, but they refused to pay. Not only that, but they sued me for $60 billion for a civil RICO case (Editor\u2019s note: the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, is a US federal law that involves extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed involving an ongoing criminal organization). Then, the criminal contempt of court charge came out of my appeal of an order that I hand over my computer and confidential case files. The judge in the civil case \u201csanctioned\u201d me for not turning my things over by confiscating my passport. I still haven\u2019t turned over my computer and simply refuse to do so as a matter of protecting my clients\u2019 legal rights and lives, because that would put their lives in jeopardy. They still have my passport.\n\nThe US attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute you for the criminal charge of contempt of court. When this happens, how does the court usually proceed in most instances? As an attorney, why do you think your case was handled differently? What does this say about the US justice system?\n\nThere was no basis to charge me with contempt, either civil or criminal, in my view. But even if there was, this was handled in an extremely irregular, and I would argue, questionable, if not outright corrupt, way. The way a normal criminal contempt case is handled is that a judge charges criminal contempt of court; it\u2019s the only crime a judge can charge, because charging decisions come out of the prosecutor\u2019s office, the executive branch, not out of the judicial branch. It\u2019s an extreme measure, very rarely employed.\n\nIn my case, there was also a problem with the lack of impartiality of the court which human rights mechanisms have found to be in breach of the right to a fair trial. I believe the way they prosecuted me was to try to destroy me, because I was the main lawyer driving the case. A normal criminal contempt case is charged by a judge and then goes to a prosecutor who prosecutes it before another judge. So, it\u2019s sort of removed from the bias of the charging judge.\n\nIn my case, the prosecutor looked at the evidence and refused to take the case forward. That should have been the end of it. Instead, this judge appointed a private corporate law firm to step into the shoes of the US government and prosecute me directly.\n\nIt was inappropriate to continue to appoint a private law firm to prosecute me after the prosecutor rejected the prosecution. And this sort of segues to why President Biden needs to act on this and pardon me.\n\nWhat happened to me is a major breach of the right to a fair trial. There are international decisions, including from the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, against the US government for its treatment of me, for arbitrarily detaining me in violation of international law. And I think the only way to really correct this as a country is for President Biden to pardon me and to make a strong statement to remedy the human rights violations in my case.\n\nIt obviously would help me do my work again, because I still can\u2019t travel or practice law, but equally as important, it would send out a message that human rights matter. Human rights really do matter and we\u2019re not going to be a country that starts to lock up its human rights lawyers or environmental activists. As found by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the courts overstepped its bounds and failed to be truly impartial, violated the separation of powers doctrine, and went way beyond the judicial function. It was a judicial power grab, and the ultimate issue here is, are we going to respect the rule of law in the United States of America or are we going to make exceptions when human rights lawyers are a little too successful in their work?\n\nYou have mentioned that the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention got involved and issued an opinion in your case. Can you tell me what they said about your situation, and the remediation measures they recommended?\n\nThey ordered the government to immediately release me from my detention, which the government never did. I ended up spending almost three years deprived of my liberty on a misdemeanor. I spent 993 days in detention on a charge that carried a maximum sentence of 180 days. I spent over four times the maximum length of my sentence in detention, which among other violations rendered the detention arbitrary. The Working Group also ordered the government to launch a full and independent investigation into the circumstances that led to my arbitrary detention and to make the necessary legislative amendments to ensure that this situation doesn\u2019t occur to others in the future. However, the government has not even acknowledged the opinion of the Working Group and has not taken any measure to implement their recommendations.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: beyond the recommendations Steven delineated above, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also recommended that the US government \u201ctake the necessary steps to remedy the situation without delay\u201d, align it with international norms as known by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and inform the Human Rights Council of progress made in implementing its recommendations, as well as any failure to take action. The Working Group referred the case to the Special Rapporteur for compliance with human rights obligations in relation to the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous waste, and to the \u2018independence of judges and lawyers\u2019. The US government has not acknowledged the opinion of the Working Group.]\n\nNow, you and your supporters, including Amnesty International, are calling for you to be pardoned. Can you explain what this would mean to you, and what it could mean for your case?\n\nIf President Biden were to grant a pardon, I think it would bring enormous recognition that this is just fundamentally wrong and a violation of the Constitution. But more importantly, it would send a signal that President Biden, who claims to be a climate president and a rule of law president, can walk the walk, not just do the talk. And it would be a really important opportunity for him to stand up for the principles that he purports. The case in Ecuador does not depend on me getting a pardon, but a pardon would make it clear, or even more clear, to any judge in any country who might consider enforcing the judgment against Chevron, that Chevron\u2019s entire theory that somehow they were the ones victimized by the people of Ecuador rather than the other way around, is a completely false and manufactured narrative.\n\nHow can people around the world support you?\n\nThe best way is to go to our campaign website: freedonziger.com \u2013 Sign the petition to the White House, donate \u2013 as I can\u2019t work and am reliant on the goodwill of people all over the world to help pay my legal fees and keep me and this work moving \u2013 and call the White House at +1-202-456-1111, what that means is, when the operator at the White House answers you simply say, I\u2019m calling to urge President Biden to pardon Stephen Donziger, this is a grave injustice, this is a stain on the reputation of our country, and it must be corrected.\n\nElizabeth Haight, the interviewer and author of this article, is a volunteer with Amnesty International\u2019s team for North America. She is a University of Georgia graduate pursuing law school and a career in international law.\n\nAmnesty International thanks Steven Donziger for participating in this interview.",

            "content": "The oil market might finally be getting its act together, according to John Hess, CEO of Hess (NYSE:HES) Corporation. Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech and Utilities Conference, he pointed to stronger-than-expected demand and shrinking inventory buildsdown to 500,000 barrels per day from the earlier forecast of 1 million. For investors, that's a signal the market's tightening, even with China's economic wobble and higher production from non-OPEC players. Meanwhile, Hess's big play is in Guyana, where its joint venture with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and CNOOC plans to double down on offshore operations. By 2027, six vessels will be pumping out oil, yet that's just scratching the surface of the region's jaw-dropping 11 billion barrels of reserves.\n\nBut it's not just about Guyana. Hess's shale game remains steady, with 200,000 barrels flowing dailyan output they're confident will hold steady for the next decade. Hess said that efficiency is the name of the game at the moment, signaling a shift as shale moves past its explosive growth phase. Still, the industry isn't free from drama. Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) $53 billion bid to buy Hess has hit turbulence, with Exxon and CNOOC challenging the deal over rights to Guyana's assets. The final call on this arbitration standoff? Expected late Q3, and it could be a nail-biter.\n\nFor investors sizing up Hess, the story is all about resilience and long-term vision. Whether it's doubling down in Guyana, steadying the shale ship, or navigating geopolitical risk, Hess seems well-positioned for what's next. If the merger clears the hurdles, it could unlock even more value. For now, though, the energy market remains a battlefield of opportunity, and Hess is holding a few of the strongest cards.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "January 7, 2025\n\nFour Ward and Smith team members delivered concise, actionable insights on projected governmental and policy changes resulting from the recent elections, the Corporate Transparency Act, the implications of the Chevron decision, and evolving topics related to labor/employment law.\n\nThe high-energy session kicked off the firm\u2019s annual In-House Counsel seminar.\n\nOverturning of Chevron\n\nJustin Hill, a labor and employment attorney, shared his take on a legal change that reduced the ability of federal agencies to interpret a law, transitioning decision-making power back to the courts. In a 1984 case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, deference was given to federal agencies in ambiguous matters yet to be addressed by Congress.\n\n\u201cThis just meant agencies could look at a statute and make an interpretation about it, and unless it was outlandish or impermissible, it was essentially the final say. This stood for decades, but now, the courts are bringing power back to their side of the scale,\u201d noted Hill.\n\nWith the Supreme Court decision overturning the Chevron deference, Hill anticipates more challenges to interpretations made by agencies such as the EEOC, the NLRB, OSHA, and the Department of Labor. The increase in challenges may also create inconsistencies between the courts' rulings.\n\n\u201cObviously, different courts are run by different people, and they don\u2019t make decisions the same way,\u201d Hill said, \u201cso this could lead to more cases going up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nA similar case that made an impact was Corner Post v. Board of Governors. \u201cThis has already become a tool for employers to fight back since it allows them to challenge federal rules for six years, beginning on the date of injury,\u201d Hill explained.\n\nPrior to the decision, the six-year statute of limitations began at the time a rule was finalized. Now, it begins on the date a plaintiff was injured by a regulation.\n\nThe Supreme Court undermined the historical powers of the NLRB in another recent decision, the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy. \u201cIt is now impermissible for the SEC to impose financial penalties through administrative law judges,\u201d added Hill.\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision was based on the rationale that imposing a financial penalty without providing the employer with a jury trial violated the Seventh Amendment.\n\nOn the surface, transferring an employee to a lateral position with similar pay and benefits may seem harmless. However, in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, it was determined that it may be a violation of Title VII and, therefore, discriminatory.\n\nE.M.D Sales, Inc. v Carrera could have significant implications, as it involves the burden of proof employers must satisfy to apply for Fair Labor Standards Act exemptions. \u201cThe Court has been hearing oral arguments on this very recently, so it\u2019s an evolving issue,\u201d said Hill.\n\nWhether a former employee can sue over discrimination related to post-employment benefits under the ADA is currently being challenged in Stanley v. City of Sanford, Florida. \u201cA few of these cases will be decided fairly soon, and we are closely monitoring them, so feel free to connect with us for article updates or let us know if you have any questions,\u201d concluded Hill.\n\nElection Recap and Session Preview\n\n\u201cThe good news is there will be no more political ads, texts, or calls next year,\u201d joked Trafton Dinwiddie, a government relations advisor who focuses on state lobbying in North Carolina. The elections are over, and Dinwiddie noted that Attorney General (AG) Josh Stein won the governor seat by a historic margin.\n\nCongressman Jeff Jackson, also by a significant margin, took the AG spot for 2025. Lieutenant Governor-elect Rachel Hunt, daughter of North Carolina\u2019s longest-serving Governor Jim Hunt, will lead the North Carolina Senate. The Republicans are maintaining their supermajority in 2025, and no major changes in the leadership are expected.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Mike Causey won re-election; Attorney Luke Farley will be the new Secretary of Labor, and Elaine Marshall was re-elected as Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cThe auditor race was interesting since neither of the two candidates had ever run for office,\u201d noted Dinwiddie. \u201cAlso, with the passage of Senate Bill 382 just two days ago, the auditor will now be the head of the state board of elections, which is unprecedented in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nIn a race that garnered significant media attention, Mo Green won the North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction position. The department has many outward-facing roles, and Green will work with a supermajority in the NC Senate. The NC House is one seat away from a supermajority.\n\nDinwiddie expects a similar dynamic between the House, Senate, and Governor\u2019s Office next year, as AG Stein traveled the same path to leadership as Governor Cooper.\n\nBoth parties have indicated an interest in tightening the state budget. The smart money is that this will amount to a pursuit of new revenue sources, with a renewed interest in allowing between three and five casinos across the state.\n\nRelief funds for the victims of Hurricane Helene are at the top of my mind. \u201cThe senate just passed another relief bill for $227 million, bringing the total to over $1 billion, but the need is unimaginable. Some estimates place the total between $40 and $50 billion,\u201d said Dinwiddie.\n\nBefore the congressional session is over, Dinwiddie believes that $25 to $30 billion will be allocated to North Carolina for water and road infrastructure, housing, business, and economic losses. \u201cInterstate 40 is still closed, but it could open up soon to slow down traffic,\u201d added Dinwiddie.\n\nIn a recent update, President Biden said the government would cover 90 percent of the funds in the categories of Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance. Usually, the government only reimburses around 75 percent of these costs, so it\u2019s being viewed as a win for recovery efforts.\n\nNon-Competes, Overtime Pay for White Collar Employees, and the NLRB\n\nEmily Massey, a labor and employment attorney, outlined three topics that have made employers shift their favorites and reassess the strategic odds of sweeping employment law changes in 2025. \u201cOne is the ban on noncompete agreements has effectively been\u2026banned,\u201d laughed Massey.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a proposal in April that would have prohibited the use of most noncompete agreements. In a nationwide injunction, a district court in Texas blocked the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe reasoning was the rule was overly broad, so the FTC had to fold and go home. They are appealing, but it\u2019s doubtful the appeal will go anywhere,\u201d added Massey.\n\nWith the Trump administration in power, it is a safe bet the economic landscape in 2025 will be more business-friendly. \u201cThe FTC upped the ante when it comes to non-competition agreements; however, it simply raised awareness among employees and executives, who may be much less likely to sign them,\u201d noted Massey.\n\nA key takeaway is to review existing noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements. Ensuring these agreements are narrowly tailored, reasonable, and fair can help make them enforceable.\n\n\u201cThis varies state by state, and notably, we\u2019ve seen both red states and blue states pass laws aimed at limiting the enforcement of non-competes,\u201d Massey commented.\n\nAnother potential game changer is the modification of white-collar exemptions for overtime pay. Under the Trump administration, the baseline for companies to avoid paying overtime to salaried exempt employees was increased to $684/week in 2020.\n\nA rule under the Biden administration increased the threshold to $844/per week in July of 2024. It was set to increase to $1,128/per week on January 1, 2025, but Judge Sean Jordan of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated the entire 2024 rule from the US Department of Labor.\n\nAccordingly, the base salary test reverted to $684/week, and though Massey believes an appeal is possible, it is unlikely to go through given the change in presidential administrations. \u201cThis is not a sure thing, however, because it was the first Trump administration that increased this basis,\u201d said Massey, \u201cso if your company raised salaries because of the rule that went into effect in July, you\u2019re probably ahead of the game, because we do expect to see increases to account for inflation.\u201d\n\nClassifications related to independent contractors may also change. \u201cThe Biden administration effected a change to the definition of independent contractors versus employees. This will likely revert to the prior rule,\u201d added Massey.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may become more business-friendly under the Trump administration. \u201cThe General Counsel of the NLRB has been very active over the past three to four years,\u201d Massey explained. \u201cShe has issued some very controversial memoranda, so we think these will be rolled back, and she will be politely (or maybe not politely) removed from her duties.\u201d\n\nThis is similar to the ripple effect that the FTC created regarding non-competes, as it\u2019s possible that employees now have more awareness of their rights. \u201cIt could, therefore, be worthwhile to review what your company\u2019s obligations are under the National Labor Relations Act, especially as it pertains to retaliating against employees for engaging in protected concerted activities,\u201d concluded Massey. \u201cAnd as always, we\u2019re here to help if you need it.\u201d\n\nCorporate Transparency Act\n\nEd. Note: Since the In-House Counsel Seminar, the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Sherman District) issued a preliminary injunction against the Corporate Transparency Act. For more information, see this article.\n\nMatthew Jones, a business attorney, shed light on the Corporate Transparency Act. \u201cThis was created to prevent fraud and money laundering by terrorists and other bad actors,\u201d Jones explained.\n\nThe Act requires certain private domestic and foreign entities to file beneficial ownership information with the Federal Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). There are twenty-three (23) exemptions; however, the most common exemptions include:\n\nCertain tax-exempt entities (i.e. public charities, private foundations, social welfare organizations, etc.);\n\nLarge companies with over 20 employees and sales exceeding $5 million; and,\n\nWholly owned subsidiaries of certain exempt entities.\n\nIt is important to note that the wholly owned subsidiary exemption does not include money-transmitting businesses, pooled investment vehicles, and entities assisting tax-exempt entities. Companies such as insurance providers, utility companies, and Commodity Exchange Act registered agencies are typically exempt, as these entities already operate in heavily regulated industries.\n\nThe Act applies to entities created by filing a document with the Secretary of State or a Native American tribe. A foreign company with operations in the US will also have to report ownership information.\n\nUnder the Act, a beneficial owner is an individual who (a) directly or indirectly exercises \u2018substantial control\u2019 over a reporting company; or (b) a person who directly or indirectly controls 25 percent or more of the \u2018ownership interests\u2019 of a reporting company.\n\nThe information to report to FinCEN includes the legal name, trade name, DBA, taxpayer ID, and street address. \u201cThis is \u2018eyes only\u2019 for the government, so there\u2019s no need to worry about it,\u201d noted Jones.\n\nThe fines are $500 for every day a violation continues. Criminal penalties can total up to $250,000 and/or five years imprisonment. If the behavior is deemed part of a pattern of criminal activities, the penalties could spiral up to $500,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment.\n\nThe good news is that inaccurate reports can be corrected without penalty as long as they are corrected within 90 days. Negligent violations are also not penalized.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway with filing is to be proactive,\u201d concluded Jones, \u201cbecause who wants to give the federal government the option of prosecuting?\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series highlighting insights from our 2024 In-House Counsel Seminar.

            "content": "During President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, the FTC initiated in-depth investigations into at least six major oil and gas mergers, including Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Chevron Corp.\u2019s $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corp.\n\nThis was a departure from previous administrations that brought few challenges to horizontal mergers of energy exploration and production companies, recognizing these companies operate in increasingly global markets.\n\nBiden\u2019s FTC alleged that Pioneer founder and former CEO Scott Sheffield and Hess CEO John Hess had attempted to collude with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies and other US oil companies to curtail production and drive prices higher.\n\nThe FTC claimed its enforcement actions sought to prevent Sheffield and Hess from gaining a larger platform from which to pursue anticompetitive behavior. To resolve the FTC\u2019s concerns, Exxon and Chevron agreed to prohibit Sheffield and Hess from taking a seat on their respective boards of directors.\n\nOne year prior, the FTC filed an enforcement action against EQT Corp.\u2019s acquisition of an oil and gas production company from Quantum Capital Group, arguing that the right for Quantum\u2019s CEO to join the board of EQT would have created an unlawful \u201cinterlock\u201d between the two companies\u2019 boards. It was the commission\u2019s first case of this kind in over 40 years.\n\nConcerns about board interlocks also appeared in the complaint against Exxon/Pioneer due to Sheffield\u2019s role on the board of Williams Companies, which the FTC viewed as a direct competitor to Exxon.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that these deals would have received the same degree of scrutiny in a Trump administration. Republicans Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson\u2014Trump\u2019s new pick to lead the FTC\u2014weren\u2019t yet commissioners during the EQT investigation. But their dissenting statements in the Exxon and Chevron cases argued that the transactions didn\u2019t violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which bars mergers and acquisitions that could create a monopoly or reduce competition.\n\nIn their view, nothing about the proposed transaction itself would have substantially lessened competition, though the executives\u2019 conduct may have warranted a separate investigation. The considerable time the commission spent investigating labor market concerns in recent energy deals also seems less likely in a Republican-controlled FTC.\n\nStill, energy companies shouldn\u2019t expect a free pass in a Trump administration, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s stated desire to speed up energy-related antitrust reviews. Transactions directly affecting consumer energy prices, such as those involving retail fuel outlets, terminals, and refineries, are likely to face scrutiny, reflecting bipartisan focus on ensuring affordable energy for consumers.\n\nDuring the previous Trump administration, the FTC filed complaints and obtained divestitures in at least five transactions involving retail fuel outlets. Similarly, the FTC under Biden forced divestitures in at least three retail fuel transactions. The Department of Justice enforced the Clayton Act\u2019s Section 8 prohibition on board interlocks under both the Trump and Biden administrations as well.\n\nThe burgeoning growth of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency sectors\u2014industries that Trump vigorously supports\u2014and their consequent strain on the national energy grid present a unique challenge. The increasing demand for data centers and supporting infrastructure requires a careful balance between fostering technological advancement and ensuring stable energy prices.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s political appointees to the FTC and Justice Department will play a pivotal role in navigating these complex issues, assessing whether consolidating natural gas production, power generation, or data infrastructure could harm these nascent technologies or lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nWhile a shift toward traditional enforcement may signal less aggressive scrutiny in upstream energy deals compared with the Biden-era FTC, bipartisan concern with consumer energy prices and energy market stability means that antitrust compliance will remain critical.\n\nLegal counsel should prepare clients for continued scrutiny of transactions involving midstream or downstream assets, board interlocks, and the intersection of energy markets with emerging industries such as AI and cryptocurrency.\n\nRead the article on Bloomberg Law here.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will have a conference on Jan. 10 to determine whether to hear arguments in Big Oil\u2019s appeal of a Hawaii State Supreme Court decision which allowed a climate lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu against the companies to continue.\n\nHonolulu is seeking to hold Shell, ExxonMobil, Sunoco, BP, Chevron, and other major fossil fuel producers accountable for the costs of climate change in the area and initially filed the lawsuit in state court in March 2020, according to court documents. Honolulu filed an amended complaint in 2021 and courts have declined to dismiss the case or move it to federal jurisdiction in the intervening years, ultimately culminating with a decision by Hawaii\u2019s Supreme Court denying the fossil fuel producers\u2019 motion to dismiss in October 2023.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one of at least 86 climate cases filed against fossil fuel producers since 2015. Supreme Court justices, however, will consider whether to hear the case after the U.S. solicitor general said the official United States position is the Court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction, which Shell called a reversal from prior opinions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court docketed the case in March, following an appeal from Shell, on behalf of the rest of the respondents, arguing that the state supreme court erred by finding the case was not pre-empted by federal laws. The Supreme Court justices asked for the official U.S. position on the appeal in June, and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar delivered the nation\u2019s view early last month.\n\nPrelogar\u2019s Dec. 10 brief said the United States\u2019 official opinion was that the U.S. Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to weigh in on the decision, and \u201ceven if it did [have jurisdiction], further review at this time would be unwarranted.\u201d Prelogar said that the fossil fuel producers have not proved that any other appellate court would have reached a different decision. Additionally, she said constitutional issues of pre-emption of the lawsuit by federal laws or the Clean Air Act have yet to be addressed by the trial court or the Hawaii Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe existence of those pending constitutional issues counsels against review now, which would risk piecemeal review of federal issues by this Court,\u201d Prelogar said. Prelogar also said that even if the oil producers theory that the Clean Air Act would preclude them from being pursued for actions that took place outside of the state, the government\u2019s position is the suit could still be pursued for in-state deceptive practices or pollution.\n\nHowever, Shell and the other respondents categorized Prelogar\u2019s brief as a reversal of the government\u2019s prior position on Clean Air Act preemptions in a Dec. 23 response brief to the Court.\n\n\u201cThe Government reverses its position that the Clean Air Act preempts claims in these climate cases seeking damages for the alleged effects of transboundary emissions from artfully pleaded causes,\u201d the petitioners wrote. \u201cThat reversal deepens an acknowledged conflict only this Court can resolve.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners \u2014 which also include Phillips 66 Company, ConocoPhillips, Aloha Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Woodside Energy Hawaii \u2014 said the government makes no explanation for reversing its prior positions, and an \u201cescalating spate of state-court lawsuits seeking damages for global emissions \u2026 requires urgent review.\u201d\n\nFollowing the oil producers\u2019 response, the justices scheduled a conference to determine the next steps for the case, which will take place this Friday, according to the case docket.",

The decision to keep Jordan Love and other key players on the field has sparked debate among fans and analysts.\n\nAd\n\nThe ripple effects of these injuries could reshape Green Bay's playoff strategy. Watson's speed and size make him Love's primary deep threat in the passing game. His absence would allow opposing defenses to press coverage more aggressively.\n\nWillis represents the Packers' only backup option at QB. While capable, he lacks playoff experience. The drop-off from Love to Willis could prove significant in high-stakes playoff matchups.\n\nLaFleur's management of his roster continues to raise eyebrows. Even after losing Love and Watson, running back Josh Jacobs remained in the game taking carries. This persistence with playing starters might force Green Bay to navigate the playoffs without its offensive cornerstones.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

They need to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday afternoon to finish with an identical 9-8 record to Cincinnati. If their records are tied, Joe Burrow and company will have the advantage since they defeated Denver in their Week 17 matchup and thus have a better head-to-head record in the tiebreaker.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nHowever, that is not all that the Bengals need. Miami currently has an 8-8 record and knows that they can get into the playoffs if they defeat the Jets and the Chiefs beat the Broncos. In that case, they will also have an identical 9-8 record to Cincinnati, but they hold the tiebreaker over Denver.\n\nTherefore, for the Bengals to make the postseason, the Broncos need to lose their game to the Chiefs, and the Dolphins must either tie or lose against the Jets. Both of them are tough asks because Kansas City is likely to rest its starters because they have already clinched the top seed in the AFC, and New York is one of the worst teams in the NFL with a 4-12 record. Therefore, Cincinnati's chances of making it past the regular season are still very low.\n\nAd\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nBengals' playoff scenario amid 9-8 record\n\nSportskeeda's Playoff Predictor only serves to reinforce that. We ran a simulation and we finished with the Broncos taking the final seventh seed, whereas the Bengals and the Dolphins missed out.\n\nSportskeeda Playoff Predictor Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, both Denver and Miami won against their opponents, which is likely given what we have identified before. However, there is some reason for hope too for Cincinnati.\n\nAd\n\nThe Chiefs might be playing their backups, but they would be hungry to prove their worth. Additionally, they are the two-time Super Bowl champions and current AFC top seed. Andy Reid is one of the smartest coaches out there and he will be looking to win this game. Last year, he rested his players in the final match against the Chargers too, and eked out a 13-12 win.\n\nSimilarly, the Dolphins might be favorites to beat the Jets but they might have to do so without Tua Tagovailoa, who is doubtful for this game. He is battling a hip injury and his production might be down even if he features. Miami really does not have a good alternative to their starting quarterback and New York might be fired up to finish this season on a high in their home stadium.\n\nAd\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nTherefore, the Bengals are not quite out yet. However, they need a lot of things to fall into place tomorrow to make it to the playoffs as the seventh seed. And whichever team has the pleasure of doing so will only find the road ahead tougher as they would have to travel to Buffalo to face Josh Allen and the second-seeded Bills.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Running back Gus Edwards is also out with an ankle injury.\n\nWill Los Angeles Chargers rest starters for Week 18 vs Raiders?\n\nIn a nutshell, no. Jim Harbaugh made it clear that the team is looking to go all-in to put their name across as the fifth seed in the conference.\n\nAd\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing to move up,\u201d Harbaugh told the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019d love to be in the fifth seed. That gives you a chance to have a playoff game at home, even in the divisional round. That\u2019s where things stand for us, the plan for us is to win. That\u2019s been the mindset from the beginning.\u201d\n\nA loss to the Chargers will see them take home the sixth seed since Pittsburgh already lost to Cincinnati last night. If they beat the Raiders, they will have to travel to Houston to take on the Texans, who have locked up the No. 4 seed in the AFC.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

The defeat brings Southern Miss to a record of 6-9 and 1-2 in the Sun Belt.\n\nIn the first half, neither side could find a definitive edge. USM got out to a seven-point lead at the 9:49 mark after a made layup by Deantoni Gordon. ODU fought back and grabbed its first lead of the game at the 5:27 mark after a Robert Davis Jr. three and a made free throw. Davis finished the first half with 12 points and two threes while Durugordon finished the first half with 11 points.\n\nUSM\u2019s Andre Curbelo scored a team high 10 points and five assists.

USM was able to snatch back the lead, 48-46, at the 14:58 mark after a Curbelo fast break layup. The Golden Eagles stretched their lead to five at 12:05 after three second-chance free throws from Alfred Worrell Jr. scored it 55-50. The Monarchs fought the deficit back and regained the lead 56-55 after a tip-in layup by Caelum Swanton Rodger went in at 8:03. Christian Watson gave Southern Miss its final lead of the night with a three, 63-62, but Jaden Johnson retook the lead for ODU and Stephaun Walker stretched the lead to 66-63. With the score tied at 68, Johnson made a driving layup and was fouled to give ODU a 71-68 lead after hitting the foul shot. Durugordon hit a trio of foul shots down the stretch to secure the Monarch win.\n\nDavis led the Monarchs in scoring with 18 points on the night and matched his career high in assists (4). Durugordon finished with 16 points, a team leading nine rebounds, he went 8-11 from the charity stripe and had a career high four steals. Johnson played all but 30 seconds in the win and had a career high nine assists and with one turnover. Caelum Swanton-Rodger matched his career high 12 points tonight and grabbed eight boards. R.J. Blakney played 27 minutes and shot 75% from the field.\n\nAs a team, Old Dominion shot 46% from the field (25-54), 76% from the stripe (22-29), and grabbed 32 rebounds - 10 of which were offensive rebounds. ODU scored 32 points in the paint, 16 off turnovers by USM. Old Dominion found victory despite only shooting 11.8% from deep (2-17). ODU had to be successful around the margins of the game, because USM shot 52.6% from deep (10-19) and shot 45% from the field (23-51). The Golden Eagles grabbed 34 rebounds.\n\nOld Dominion will get ready for a two-game road trip down south for Sun Belt Conference action, battling Louisiana in Lafayette before heading to Mobile, Alabama to take on South Alabama.",

Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nLast week's injury occurred when Miami Dolphins linebacker Chop Robinson grabbed Ford's ankle just before right tackle Jack Conklin fell on him. Following the injury, Ford limped off to the locker room and was later seen in the blue medical tent for further evaluation.\n\nAd\n\nFord did not practice during the week and will not play in the Browns' game against the Ravens, per the team's injury report.\n\nThe Browns subsequently placed Ford on the injured reserve list, along with tight end David Njoku (knee) and running back Pierre Strong Jr. (concussion), as reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter. Consequently, D'Onta Foreman and John Kelly will have to handle the team's backfield workload on Saturday afternoon.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nHow has Jerome Ford performed this season?\n\nFollowing Nick Chubb's season-ending knee injury in Week 2 of last season, Jerome Ford took over as the Browns' starting running back. The former fifth-round pick finished the 2023 season with 813 rushing yardsand four rushing touchdowns, while also contributing 44 receptions and five receiving touchdowns.\n\nCleveland's 2024 season began with Ford as the starting running back for the first six games until Chubb returned to action against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7. However, in Week 15 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Chubb broke his foot, allowing Ford to return to the starting RB1 position.\n\nAd\n\nFord played in 14 games this season before being placed on IR on Friday. He led the Browns with 565 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. He also contributed 37 catches on 43 targets for 225 yards. The 25-year-old running back also averaged 25.9 yards on 59 kickoff returns.\n\nJerome Ford is expected to remain with the Browns through the 2025 season, but his role next year will depend on the team's offseason decisions to strengthen its running back department.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Natural gas prices recently jumped 20% in a single day. That's a pretty shocking move but, frankly, not all that unusual when it comes to energy prices. If you are looking at the broader energy sector and trying to figure out which stock to buy as 2025 gets underway, your best option is probably going to be an integrated energy giant like ExxonMobil (XOM -1.03%) or Chevron (CVX 0.23%).\n\nHere's how these two U.S. energy giants stack up and why you might want to pick Chevron.\n\nThe benefits of integration\n\nAs the natural gas example above highlights, energy prices are highly volatile. That often leads to massive swings in the prices of energy producers. Energy producers live in the upstream segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nThere are, however, two other segments, the midstream and downstream. Midstream companies own things like pipelines and collect fees from companies that use these assets to transport energy commodities. It is a relatively stable segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nMeanwhile, downstream companies use oil and natural gas to produce chemicals and other refined products. Downstream companies often benefit from lower energy prices, though it is important to note that chemicals and refined products are often commodity products themselves subject to their own, sometimes volatile, price dynamics.\n\nIntegrated energy companies like Exxon and Chevron have exposure to all three segments of the broader energy industry. Although oil and natural gas prices are still the driving force behind financial results, having exposure to the midstream and downstream helps to soften the peaks and valleys.\n\nFor most investors, going with an integrated energy company will be the best choice. And sticking to the industry giants, a list that includes Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies, will probably be the best individual option. In this regard, Exxon and Chevron are interchangeable with any of the others on the list.\n\nDividends that keep going up\n\nThat said, Exxon and Chevron stand out in a very important way. They have both increased their dividends annually for decades. BP and Shell cut their dividends during the early days of the pandemic in 2020. TotalEnergies didn't cut its dividend at that point, but it just doesn't have the same track record of regular dividend growth that Exxon and Chevron have. Exxon and Chevron have shown a material dedication to investors and that quickly winnows down the choice from five to two.\n\nBut Exxon's streak of annual dividend increases is better. The energy giant has hiked its dividend for 42 consecutive years. Chevron's streak is \"just\" 37 years long. Clearly, this is something of a fine distinction, since both are very impressive dividend streaks. However, Exxon still gets the edge, even if it is only a slight advantage.\n\nA higher yield with Chevron\n\nThe other side of the dividend, however, is the dividend yield. On this front, Chevron wins hands down with a 4.5% yield. Exxon's yield is a lower 3.7%. That may not seem like a huge difference on an absolute basis, but percentage wise Chevron's yield is 20% higher. That's a very big difference that will likely be of interest to income-focused investors.\n\nThat outcome, however, has to be juxtaposed against the risk of a dividend cut. Because energy prices, and thus earnings, are so volatile, the dividend payout ratio isn't a great indication of dividend sustainability in the energy sector. You have to focus on a mix of the company's commitment to the dividend (which is good for both Chevron and Exxon) and financial strength. In this case, Chevron and Exxon have similarly low debt-to-equity ratios, suggesting that their leverage is modest.\n\nIn fact, this is part of the long-term plan, as both add debt during industry downturns so they can continue to fund their businesses and dividends. When energy prices recover, as they always have historically, the companies pay down the debt they took on. Although you wouldn't be taking on massive risk with Exxon, the added yield from Chevron still wins out here from a risk/reward basis.\n\nTemporary headwinds at Chevron\n\nThe next question to ask when comparing Chevron and Exxon is why there is a dividend yield discrepancy. The answer is pretty simple -- Exxon is performing better right now on some key industry metrics, including return on capital employed. Chevron is also in the middle of buying Hess, but the deal is being held up because of business relationships Hess has with other companies, including Exxon. Investors are clearly worried that Chevron just isn't hitting on all cylinders right now.\n\nThat is a legitimate concern and, perhaps, it is appropriate that Chevron's yield is higher. However, if you think in decades and not days this could also be an opportunity. Given Chevron's long and successful history, financial strength, and diversified business model, it seems highly likely that it will eventually muddle through this patch of weakness. And even if the Hess deal falls apart, the $250 billion market cap company is large enough and financially strong enough to simply find another acquisition candidate if it wants to.\n\nAll in, Chevron is trailing behind Exxon today. But investors are getting paid for the added risk this poses via the higher dividend yield. That will probably be an attractive risk/reward trade-off for most investors.\n\nIt could go either way with Exxon and Chevron\n\nYou wouldn't be making a massive mistake if you bought Exxon over Chevron in 2025. But, at the same time, Chevron appears to offer some compelling advantages over Exxon, particularly if you are focused on maximizing the income your portfolio generates. With similar business models, similar financial strength profiles, and similar commitments to shareholder returns (highlighted by their strong dividend track records), choosing higher-yielding Chevron seems like the right call for 2025.",

            "content": "Natural gas prices recently jumped 20% in a single day. That's a pretty shocking move but, frankly, not all that unusual when it comes to energy prices. If you are looking at the broader energy sector and trying to figure out which stock to buy as 2025 gets underway, your best option is probably going to be an integrated energy giant like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) or Chevron (NYSE: CVX).\n\nHere's how these two U.S. energy giants stack up and why you might want to pick Chevron.\n\nThe benefits of integration\n\nAs the natural gas example above highlights, energy prices are highly volatile. That often leads to massive swings in the prices of energy producers. Energy producers live in the upstream segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nThere are, however, two other segments, the midstream and downstream. Midstream companies own things like pipelines and collect fees from companies that use these assets to transport energy commodities. It is a relatively stable segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nMeanwhile, downstream companies use oil and natural gas to produce chemicals and other refined products. Downstream companies often benefit from lower energy prices, though it is important to note that chemicals and refined products are often commodity products themselves subject to their own, sometimes volatile, price dynamics.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIntegrated energy companies like Exxon and Chevron have exposure to all three segments of the broader energy industry. Although oil and natural gas prices are still the driving force behind financial results, having exposure to the midstream and downstream helps to soften the peaks and valleys.\n\nFor most investors, going with an integrated energy company will be the best choice. And sticking to the industry giants, a list that includes Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies, will probably be the best individual option. In this regard, Exxon and Chevron are interchangeable with any of the others on the list.\n\nDividends that keep going up\n\nThat said, Exxon and Chevron stand out in a very important way. They have both increased their dividends annually for decades. BP and Shell cut their dividends during the early days of the pandemic in 2020. TotalEnergies didn't cut its dividend at that point, but it just doesn't have the same track record of regular dividend growth that Exxon and Chevron have. Exxon and Chevron have shown a material dedication to investors and that quickly winnows down the choice from five to two.\n\nBut Exxon's streak of annual dividend increases is better. The energy giant has hiked its dividend for 42 consecutive years. Chevron's streak is \"just\" 37 years long. Clearly, this is something of a fine distinction, since both are very impressive dividend streaks. However, Exxon still gets the edge, even if it is only a slight advantage.",

In 2024, countries with high job postings in the industry included the US, India, and the UK, while countries with high year-on-year (YoY) growth in job postings included Sweden and United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, there has been a noticeable increase in job opportunities from non-US companies in locations outside of the US, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\n\nSherla Sriprada, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cIt is noteworthy that even though the US continues to account for a majority of jobs posted by several key players, other countries across different continents are also seeing hiring activity by these companies. Interestingly, US-headquartered companies are also seen posting good number of jobs in other nations. The US accounts for a significant number of jobs but companies also seem to be looking to tap opportunities beyond the US as well.\u201d\n\nExxon and Chevron, two major players in the oil and gas industry, also saw a decline in job postings. Most of the job postings by these two companies were for the US. Meanwhile, they also posted a significant number of jobs for the Philippines, Argentina, and India locations. In 2024, Exxon posted 144 jobs in Bengaluru, India, and Chevron posted 58 jobs, where they have both set up offices.\n\nExxon is focusing on EM lithium products in the US and lubes operations in Argentina, whereas Chevron is looking at supply and trading bulk operations in Argentina and complying with GHG/methane regulations in the US.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s LNG affiliate in India supports the upstream business and provides consultant services for other ExxonMobil upstream affiliates and conducts LNG market-development activities.

We didn't get to the free throw line.\"\n\n\"That's not who we are,\" he added. \"We're a better team than that.\"\n\nArkansas State early-on appeared to be feeling the effect of a long layoff as the Red Wolves\u2019 last game came 12 days earlier, a 97-67 victory over Coastal Carolina on Jan. 21.\n\nThe Red Wolves missed their first eight shots and didn\u2019t draw any net until almost seven minutes into the game.\n\n\"We missed an opportunity there,\" Jones said. \"We should have had 15 points.\"\n\n\"If they looked up and saw they were in a little deeper of a hole, that changes the game. That changes the way they look at things.\"\n\nTerrance Ford Jr. broke the ice for the Red Wolves on a layup with 13:15 in the half which began a 19-2 Arkansas State run capped by Rashaud Marshall\u2019s layup five minutes later that gave the Red Wolves a 19-8 lead.\n\nIt was 24-10 with six minutes left when ODU retook momentum from Arkansas State by closing out the half with a 19-8 run.\n\nThe Monarchs next play this Saturday at 4 p.m. when they host Southern Miss at Chartway Arena.\n\nIt will be a quick turnaround for Johnson, who played 36 minutes, and Davis, who played 37.\n\n\"Everyone has to get their rest and then lock in on Southern Miss so that we can get the win,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"We have to turn the page and quickly,\" Jones added. \"If you didn't make your free throws tonight, I expect to see you in the gym tomorrow morning shooting free throws.\n\n\"We need to put this one behind us.\"",

            "content": "The three-judge panel ruled that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have the authority to impose net neutrality rules on internet service providers (ISPs). The FCC sought to reclassify ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act in order to impose policies meant to prevent them from discriminating against different internet traffic, like by slowing speeds or blocking content.\n\nBut the judges disagreed with the agency\u2019s interpretation of how ISPs could be classified and were emboldened by the recent downfall of Chevron deference, a legal doctrine that instructed courts to defer to regulatory agencies in many cases. After the Supreme Court did away with that principle in 2024, courts became more free to favor their own interpretations over the judgment of expert agencies. Net neutrality was immediately seen as a prime target to be struck down without Chevron. While the DC Circuit Court of Appeals upheld previous iterations of net neutrality, the Sixth Circuit judges note that it relied on Chevron to do so. \u201cUnlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC\u2019s reading of the statute,\u201d they write.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that the workings of the Internet are complicated and dynamic, and that the FCC has significant expertise in overseeing \u2018this technical and complex area,\u2019\u201d the ruling says, citing an earlier decision. After the fall of Chevron, it continues, \u201cthat \u2018capability,\u2019 if you will, cannot be used to overwrite the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d\n\nThis left the judges free to wax philosophical about phrases like \u201coffering of a capability\u201d and \u201cinformation services,\u201d finely parsing the distinction between those and more heavily regulated telecommunications services. \u201cThe existence of a fact or a thought in one\u2019s mind is not \u2018information\u2019 like 0s and 1s used by computers,\u201d one part of the ruling reads. It asserts that \u201cspeaking reduces a thought to sound, and writing reduces a thought to text ... during a phone call, one creates audio information by speaking, which the telephone service transmits to an interlocutor, who responds in turn,\u201d but \u201ccrucially, the telephone service merely transmits that which a speaker creates; it does not access information.\u201d\n\nNet neutrality was already in danger, even before this ruling came out \u2014 in a suit filed against the FCC by broadband industry associations. The appeals court had already blocked the net neutrality rules from taking effect. During oral arguments in October, the three Republican-appointed judges prodded attorneys about the correct interpretation of the Communications Act and about deference to agency expertise. With President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 under whom net neutrality was previously repealed \u2014 due to take office in mere weeks, this could be the last we hear about the attempt to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers for a while.\n\nFCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on lawmakers to take up the mantle of creating rules to safeguard the open internet. \u201cConsumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\u201d she says in a statement. \u201cWith this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.\u201d\n\nRepublican Commissioner Brendan Carr, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency once he assumes office, issued a lengthy statement calling the ruling \u201ca good win for the country.\u201d He calls net neutrality rules an attempt by the Biden administration to \u201cexpand the government\u2019s control over every feature of the Internet ecosystem\u201d and says the push for the rules was a waste of time. While he\u2019s pleased with the ruling, he adds, \u201cThe work to unwind the Biden Administration\u2019s regulatory overreach will continue.\u201d",

            "content": "The FCC\u2018s effort to establish rules of the road for internet service has been sidelined again, as a federal appeals court has blocked the latest version of net neutrality regulations.\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the FCC did not have the authority to implement the rules, which require that ISPs treat all traffic equally. The rules also aimed to limit ISPs from establishing \u201cfast lanes\u201d and \u201cslow lanes,\u201d depending on who paid for preferential treatment.\n\nWhile the FCC has gone back and forth for nearly two decades on net neutrality, depending on whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House, the latest decision casts doubt on any future effort to establish robust regulations. That\u2019s because the Supreme Court last year reversed a precedent that gives deference to federal agencies in interpreting laws they enforce. The precedent stemmed from a 1984 case, Chevron vs. NRDC, and came to be known as \u201cChevron deference\u201d or the \u201cChevron doctrine.\u201d\n\nA three-judge panel noted that the net neutrality rules \u201cissued during the Biden administration\u2014undoes the order issued during the first Trump administration, which undid the order issued during the Obama administration, which undid orders issued during the Bush and Clinton administrations.\u201d Applying the most recent Supreme Court decision, the judges wrote, \u201cmeans we can end the FCC\u2019s vacillations.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe FCC under President Barack Obama passed the most robust set of net neutrality rules, establishing their legal footing by reclassifying internet serves as a Title II telecommunications service, or a common carrier. The latter regulatory maneuver drew widespread opposition among major telecom companies like Comcast and AT&T.\n\nThe latest appellate decision held that broadband internet service was actually an \u201cinformation service,\u201d meaning that the FCC lacked authority to impose rules under Title II. The judges also ruled that mobile service could not be regulated as a common carrier.\n\nThe FCC under President Donald Trump largely reversed the FCC rules, but they were reinstated when Democrats regained control of the agency during President Joe Biden\u2019s term.\n\nFCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel acknowledged that the latest ruling means that the fate of net neutrality likely rests with Congress.\n\n\u201cConsumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWith this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.\u201d\n\nThe end of \u201cChevron deference,\u201d meanwhile, could prove to complicate Trump administration efforts to establish its own regulations. The incoming chair of the FCC, Brendan Carr, opposed reinstating the rules. But he has called for the FCC to take action on the way that major internet platforms, like Facebook and YouTube, moderate their third-party content, arguing that they have had a bias against voices on the right. Any action is likely to be opposed by tech giants and challenged in court.\n\nNCTA-The Internet & Television Association and other industry groups said in a statement that the \u201cruling confirming that broadband internet access is an \u2018information service\u2019 is not only the proper reading of the statute but a victory for American consumers that will lead to more investment, innovation, and competition in the dynamic digital marketplace. Since the birth of the internet, bipartisan Administrations and policymakers have recognized the virtues of a light-touch approach to broadband regulation. Today\u2019s ruling will cement the United States\u2019s position as the world\u2019s most advanced digital marketplace.\u201d\n\nAndrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counsel at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, an intervenor in the case, said in a statement that the decision \u201cmisreads the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in finding the broadband is not subject to the regulatory requirements of Title II of the Communications Act. Among other things, that deprives the FCC of the power to protect national security, insure that competitive broadband suppliers can have access to necessary distribution outlets and endangers wireless access programs for low-income consumers.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the appellate judges \u201crejected the statutory analysis of Justice [Antonin] Scalia \u2013 the only telecommunications expert ever to sit on the Supreme Court \u2013 and found that the \u201cbest reading\u201d of the statute does not permit the FCC to regulate internet providers in many important ways. This is bad for consumers, for businesses that rely on the internet, and for protecting broadband networks from intrusions by nation states.\u201d\n\nIn a 2005 Supreme Court dissent, Scalia argued that the FCC should regulate internet service providers as telecommunications services and not information services.\n\nSchwartzman noted that the appellate judges gave a narrow reading to the Supreme Court decision repealing the so-called \u201cChevron doctrine.\u201d Schwartzman also noted that the court also did not rely on internet providers\u2019 broader arguments over the agency\u2019s authority, known as the \u201cmajor question doctrine,\u201d \u201cso that the FCC will retain the power to regulate various aspects of broadband service without future Congressional action.\u201d",

It\u2019s the conclusion of a decades-long fight for a more equitable internet\u2014and a harbinger of what may await other consumer protections in the years to come.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the technicalities of net neutrality, but the basic thing the Federal Communications Commission wanted was the power to prevent broadband providers from engaging in bandwidth discrimination, slowing speeds for certain customers or to certain sites. Those protections existed under the Obama administration but were rolled back shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017. You probably won\u2019t feel much near-term impact; we\u2019re largely back to the status quo, and Spectrum is unlikely to immediately try slowing down YouTube to get you to watch its own cable news channels. But that\u2019s also why the way the Sixth Circuit arrived at its decision may be even more alarming than the ruling itself.\n\nThe three-judge panel frequently cited Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference. Under Chevron, courts were required to defer to regulatory agencies when it came to deciding how relevant laws should be interpreted when their provisions were unclear. Now, courts are free to decide for themselves. And the Sixth Circuit did exactly that.\n\n\u201cUnlike past challenges that the DC Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC\u2019s reading of the statute,\u201d the ruling reads. \u201cInstead, our task is to determine \u2018the best reading of the statute\u2019 in the first instance.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the court substituted the subject matter expertise of the FCC with its own.\n\n\u201cIt's a sad day for democracy when giant corporations can forum-shop for industry-friendly judges to strike down some of the most popular consumer protection rules in history,\u201d says Evan Greer, director of the digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future. \u201cThe court citing Loper Bright here is an alarming harbinger of industry-friendly rulings to come.\u201d\n\nAnd not just on issues affecting the broadband industry. The Sixth Circuit showed today how courts might use the end of Chevron deference to shape all sorts of policy, from tech to the environment to health care to pretty much any area where legislative ambiguity reigns.\n\nCritics of Chevron argued that Congress too often delegated the work of interpreting policies to unelected bureaucrats working for federal agencies, says John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Knowledge. \u201cNow we have the alternative: The first panel of judges to hear an issue can set nationwide policy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s at least one way out of this imbalance of power, Bergmayer says: Congress can pass a bill that explicitly says agencies have the authority to interpret laws. That seems unlikely, though, in a GOP-led legislature that\u2019s wary of\u2014or outright hostile toward\u2014the administrative state.",

He joined an elite group as the ninth running back in the league's 105-year history to rush for 2,000 yards.\n\nAd\n\nHis average of 125.3 rushing yards per game is the highest in the 17-game era and the most since Derrick Henry's 126.7 in 2020.\n\nThe record chase has sparked interesting historical parallels. O.J. Simpson first set the mark with 2,000 yards in 14 games in 1973, averaging 143.1 yards per game. Dickerson surpassed this in 1984, needing 15 games to break Simpson's record with 215 yards in his penultimate game.\n\n\"I know we don't really speak about that, but in reality, [O.J.] rushed for 2,000 in 14 games,\" Barkley told reporters on Sunday. \"ED, it took him 15 to do it. So if anything, it's like, why are we even having the conversation?\"\n\nNick Sirianni's choice mirrors past scenarios where individual records met team priorities. Similar to Barry Sanders in 1997 (237 yards shy) and Adrian Peterson in 2012 (who came within eight yards), Barkley's chase adds another chapter.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

The Bengals are perennial playoff contenders, and they have one of the best one-two offensive punches in football with Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase.\n\nAd\n\nHowever, this season hasn't gone according to plan, and the Bengals are just hanging on to their playoff hopes entering Week 18. Cincinnati is 8-8 ahead of its last game of the regular season and will need some help from other teams to make the postseason.\n\nThus, ahead of Week 18, let's examine the scenarios needed for the Bengals to enter the playoffs.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\nHow do the Cincinnati Bengals make the playoffs?\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals must win their last game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6) to make the playoffs. That'll be Joe Burrow and Co.'s fifth straight win, an impressive achievement. However, they'll need astonishing luck to sneak into the postseason.\n\nNext, the Bengals need the Miami Dolphins to lose their Week 18 road game against the eliminated New York Jets. The Dolphins are currently 8-8, and a loss will drop them to 8-9, thereby giving the Bengals the edge in the battle for the final wildcard slot.\n\nAd\n\nFurthermore, they'll need the Denver Broncos to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18. This might be a tough ask since the Chiefs will likely rest their starters after securing the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Thus, the Broncos will have all the motivation needed ahead of their last game of the regular season.\n\nIf the Miami Dolphins and Denver Broncos lose while the Bengals win, the Bengals will qualify for the playoffs as the seventh-best team in the AFC.\n\nAd\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nHow did the Cincinnati Bengals get here?\n\nNo matter the results in Week 18, the Bengals performed well below their preseason expectations. The team was tipped to be one of the squads to beat in the conference, but now it needs help from an eliminated and out-of-sorts Jets unit and their sworn rivals, the Kansas City Chiefs, to qualify for the postseason.\n\nThe Bengals' season turning point was their two three-game losing streaks. They opened the season with a losing streak after dropping matchups against the New England Patriots, Chiefs and Washington Commanders. They endured another losing streak between Weeks 10 and 13 after dropping games to the Baltimore Ravens, LA Chargers and Steelers.\n\nSo, the Cincinnati Bengals might spend the playoffs at home despite Joe Burrow having an MVP-caliber season and Ja'Marr Chase being on the verge of the Triple Crown. They'll need a startling amount of luck in Week 18 to avoid such a letdown.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

However, it would also be sensible to wait until Indy gives the player a final status before the game and then pick him in your fantasy team.\n\nThe Colts will have three practice sessions before facing Jacksonville, and the team can monitor Richardson's progress after his back injury.\n\nPer reports, Richardson injured his back in Indy's Week 16 win over the Tennessee Titans.

The quarterback has also rushed for 499 yards and six touchdowns across 11 games.

He is averaging 14.9 points per game.\n\nAlthough the Colts (7-9) are out of the playoff race, they can finish the season on a high with a win against their divisional rivals, the Jaguars (4-12).

Instead, the player could get an extra week of rest before Philly targets the postseason.\n\nAd\n\nThe other option would be to allow Goedert to get some reps against New York on Sunday to bring him up to speed with his teammates.\n\nNonetheless, the Eagles will decide on Goedert's final status after he returns to practice.

He previously missed three games earlier in the season due to a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Eagles will aim to finish the regular season on a high to carry some momentum into the playoffs.

            "content": "This story was originally published by High Country News.\n\nIn recent years, U.S. Supreme Court decisions have undercut federal agencies\u2019 ability to curb pollution and fight climate change. Several cases decided in 2024 continued this trend, systematically shifting the power to make and enforce environmental regulations over to the judicial branch.\n\nThough it will likely take years to know the full consequences of this year\u2019s rulings, legal experts say they have profound implications as to how federal agencies can respond to the threat of climate change. Congress passed the majority of the laws that protect our lands and waters decades ago, and with an increasingly polarized political environment, legislators have passed few new environmental regulations since. In the past few decades, Congress has in effect tasked federal agencies with adapting existing laws to our new climate reality, said Chris Winter, executive director of the University of Colorado Law School\u2019s Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment. But with an increasingly conservative Supreme Court in place, these laws have come under increased scrutiny, including in several of the court\u2019s 2024 landmark decisions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant was Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which overturned the 1984 Chevron doctrine, a powerful legal tool that gave federal agencies the ability to interpret and enforce ambiguous or unclear laws. For decades, the courts have largely deferred to agency experts in crafting and enforcing regulations, since those agencies typically have greater expertise in their subject areas than judges do. By eliminating Chevron, the court transferred the authority to clarify the meaning of a written law to the judicial system.\n\nLoper Bright has already raised \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d about whether or how agencies should create and enforce environmental regulations, according to Winter. The last few years have signaled a structural change in the balance of power between courts and federal agencies, he said, with courts now working hard to rein in federal regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, industry groups eager to roll back regulations have filed lawsuits in conservative states with business-friendly judges. In federal courts in Wyoming, Utah and Montana, for example, groups representing farmers, ranchers and the fossil fuel industry have cited Loper Bright as a precedent for suing the Biden administration to overturn the 2024 Public Lands Rule, which designated conservation as a legitimate \u201cuse\u201d for public lands in line with extractive uses like mining, grazing and logging. As of Sept. 6, Loper Bright has been cited in 110 federal cases, according to the advocacy group Democracy Forward. \u201cThese days, it doesn\u2019t feel like you can really think deeply about the law. It is simply a political battle,\u201d said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit public-interest environmental law firm. Altogether, the body of law emerging from the court has \u201cprioritized politically oriented property rights and economic rights,\u201d Schlenker-Goodrich said. \u201cIn other words, corporate rights and corporate power.\u201d\n\nOther Supreme Court decisions this year further hamstrung agencies\u2019 ability to enforce environmental regulations. In Ohio v. Environmental Protection Agency, the court halted the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule, which gave the agency the authority to protect downwind states from air pollution that emanates from their upwind neighbors. This decision could affect public health by preventing the EPA from limiting pollution that wafts across state boundaries. It is also significant because it shows that the Supreme Court is willing to weigh in on individual agency regulations, something that had not previously been the case, Winter said.\n\nThe court also exposed long-standing federal regulations to legal attacks following its decision on Corner Post v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The case, which was brought by a North Dakota convenience store over debit card fees, was backed by the Cato Institute, a Koch-funded libertarian think tank. It ended the existing six-year statute of limitations on suing federal agencies for harm, enabling parties to challenge agency regulations even if a company does so decades after it was allegedly harmed by the rule in question. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that this ruling, combined with the court\u2019s decision to overturn Chevron, could open the floodgates to a \u201ctsunami of lawsuits\u201d that are likely to handcuff federal regulators.\n\nOther recent decisions, such as West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2022, which limited the EPA\u2019s power to regulate carbon emissions, have stripped federal agencies of their ability to respond to climate change more broadly. The West Virginia case, in particular, established a new legal principle, the so-called \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine, which limits agencies\u2019 authority to make decisions with significant political or economic implications without explicit congressional approval. \u201cAll of these cases are creating ripple effects in ongoing litigation,\u201d Schlenker-Goodrich said.\n\nAnd this trend could continue into 2025. On Dec. 10, the justices heard arguments on Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, a dispute over a planned oil railway in Utah that could change how government agencies evaluate the environmental and climate impacts of energy infrastructure projects. The case could potentially limit the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \u2014 a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts before making decisions \u2014 for years to come. \u201cNEPA has provided one of the best ways to force a rational look at what it means for agencies to make decisions on things like fossil fuel projects and fossil fuel extraction,\u201d Winter said. Another case, Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments, could have implications for the Administrative Procedures Act, which governs all federal rulemaking, safeguarding against \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d federal actions.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has shown that it is much less likely to defer to or uphold agency decisions,\u201d Winter said, and lower courts have rapidly followed suit. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re seeing a rightward shift in the courts,\u201d Winter said.\n\nLegislators in some Western states have taken proactive steps to prevent air and water pollution and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. New Mexico and Colorado, for example, have passed landmark laws protecting wetlands and streams, while Washington has passed the Climate Commitment Act, which places a cap on greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nThese state-level measures are merely stopgaps, Schlenker-Goodrich said, but with the incoming Trump administration likely to keep rolling back regulations, they\u2019re critically important to fill the gaps created by the courts. \u201cBetween the Supreme Court and the incoming Trump administration, extractive interests like the fossil fuel industry, especially oil and gas, will be able to run with a lot of ideas that otherwise would have held no merit even just five years ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let the Supreme Court and Trump administration roll over us,\u201d Schlenker-Goodrich said. \u201cWe can hold the line for a better day.\u201d\n\nThis article first appeared on High Country News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump.

Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\n#1. Anthony Richardson's benching\n\nAnthony Richardson was always viewed as a project quarterback. He wasn't the most polished passer in college, but his physical tools are Cam Newton-esque. That's why the Colts selected him with the fourth pick in the 2023 draft.\n\nUnfortunately, Richardson's performances were subpar in Week 3, and the Colts decided to bench him in favor of veteran Joe Flacco. Flacco went on to start just three games before he was replaced as a starter by Richardson.\n\nAd\n\nSuch indecisiveness from the coaching staff and front office typically divides the locker room, and it's hard to disagree as the Colts season looked rather shaky from that point.\n\n#2. Loss to the Houston Texans\n\nThe Colts lost their Week 8 game against the Houston Texans. They came into the game with a 4-3 record and could have gone 5-3 with a victory over their eternal rivals.\n\nHowever, the Texans had their number and inflicted a 23-20 loss on Anthony Richardson, and Co. Richardson could only muster 175 passing yards, and the Texans took advantage of playing at home to lay down a mid-season marker. Furthermore, the game was the first in a three-game losing streak that essentially torpedoed the Colts' season.\n\nAd\n\n#3. The loss to the New York Giants\n\nThe Giants have been eliminated from the playoffs for ages, and they were in pole position in the Shedeur Sanders sweepstakes. Hence, the Colts fans could have been forgiven for fancying their chances ahead of Week 17.\n\nHowever, Drew Lock did not get the memo as the veteran quarterback lit up the Colts in a 45-33 victory. Rookie star Malik Nabers had himself a career game and was pivotal in the Colts' elimination.\n\nAd\n\nThe loss was a painful one as the Giants were there to be taken and gained nothing from the win but a worse draft position. This had shades of Indianapolis' harrowing 26-11 defeat to the Jaguars under Frank Reich and Carson Wentz back in January 2022.\n\nShane Steichen will now need to meet with the top brass to discuss how to better tackle the 2025 season. There have been back-to-back late-season collapses, and something has to give. The Colts aren't going to waste the prime of Jonathan Taylor and other key franchise pieces.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

He compared it to LeBron James' situation back in 2007, when the Cleveland Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs because of a lack of a supporting cast.\n\nHe further noted how Burrow, like young LeBron, is playing at an elite level. However, he insinuated that the QB might eventually grow frustrated if the Bengals fail to build a competent team around him, a fate which also befell the Cavaliers after James left for Miami to win the first two championships of his career.\n\nAd\n\nNow, with one game left in the regular season against the Steelers on January 5, the Bengals and their LeBron-like savior aka Joe Burrow will face a major test.\n\nJoe Burrows' impact on the Cincinnati Bengals\n\nFor five consecutive seasons from 2016 to 2020, the Cincinnati Bengals were a team synonymous with disappointment. The nadir came in 2019 when the team's record plummeted to 2-14.\n\nNext year, entered Joe Burrow after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. His impact was immediate.

            "content": "Dallas Cowboys long-time owner Jerry Jones said that he'll be \"going all in\" ahead of the 2024 regular season. The Cowboys fans heard the rallying cry and thought this season might differ from numerous letdowns over the past two decades.\n\nAd\n\nHowever, it wasn't to be, as the Cowboys were eliminated at the end of the Week 16 slate of games. It's the first time since the 2020 season that America's team will not be in the postseason. Hence, before their last game against the Washington Commanders, let's highlight when the Cowboys' season went into tatters.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nWhy are the Dallas Cowboys out of the playoffs?\n\nHere are three turning points in the Cowboys' 2024 season:\n\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game!\n\n#1. Ezekiel Elliott's re-signing\n\nEzekiel Elliott (affectionately known by the fan base as Zeke) is a modern Dallas Cowboys legend. He owns several franchise records, earned multiple Pro Bowls on the team, and was part of one of the most exciting periods of the Cowboys' recent existence.\n\nAd\n\nHowever, there's a reason why he was let go ahead of the 2023 regular season. Elliott's signature power had declined, his rushing yards had dropped, and Tony Pollard was simply a way better running back than him in the later years of his first stint in Dallas.\n\nFor some reason, Jones decided to sign and bring Elliott back as the team's feature for the 2024 season. It was an unmitigated disaster, just as many analysts predicted. Elliott mustered just 74 carries, 226 rushing yards and three touchdowns in 15 games this season. His touches could have been better served in the hands of Rico Dowdle.\n\nAd\n\n#2. Dak Prescott's injury\n\nDak Prescott is another member of the 2016 draft class who earned legendary status for the Cowboys. Prescott has multiple Cowboys regular-season records, and he's arguably the team's most-loved quarterback since Troy Aikman left.\n\nPrescott signed a four-year, $240 million contract with the Cowboys to make him the league's best-paid quarterback. However, he was ruled out of the season not too long after due to a hamstring injury. After the injury, the Cowboys lost three straight games, which was a turning point in their season.\n\nAd\n\nYes, Cooper Rush eventually came good, winning four out of five games before Week 17, but the damage was already done.\n\n#3. CeeDee Lamb's AC Shoulder Sprain injury\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have relied on CeeDee Lamb for years, especially after they let Amari Cooper go. Lamb's excellence was on display for multiple seasons, but he saw a decline in 2024 overall.\n\nThe perennial Pro Bowler then suffered an AC sprain in the Cowboys' Week 9 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. It was a week after Lamb racked up an impressive 147 receiving yards against the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe veteran wideout played through the injury, but it was clear that his productivity was limited. This, coupled with the lack of a top-tier running game, was decisive for the team's playoff chances. The team eventually shut down Lamb for the rest of the season ahead of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

They were also coming off drafting highly-touted Heisman winner Caleb Williams and investing in his arsenal.\n\nThey initially seemed to be fulfilling the promise of their core, going 4-2 before their bye week. But since then, they have often lost their next ten games because of poor coaching decisions.

(Credits: IMAGN)\n\nAs it turns out, Richard Sherman is not alone in thinking that Pete Carroll could be the savor Caleb Williams's Bears need. The Chicago Tribune's Dan Wiederer also subscribes to that notion. He writes that he has many traits that franchise president Kevin Warren has said he wants in the next coach.\n\nAd\n\n\"Tough and demanding: Check. Can create a culture of accountability: Check. Bright and creative? Decisive? Check, check and check.\"\n\nHe continues by saying that Carroll is a master of creating belief \u2014 a trait he cultivated and perfected in his 14 seasons in Seattle. This trait is desperately needed in Chicago after one of the longest stretches of mediocrity in league history.\n\nHowever, Wiederer also opines that this should not preclude them from seeking out other candidates, like Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, who has turned Jared Goff into an elite quarterback and thus should be their primary target if they want a \"quarterback whisperer\" for Caleb Williams.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

It is immediately cash flow accretive and includes a cash payment upon both execution and completion.\n\n\u201cThis year, the North West Shelf project and its Karratha Gas Plant celebrated 40 years of operations. The Western Australian Government\u2019s recent decision to extend the environmental approval for the North West Shelf project supports its ongoing contribution to reliable energy supply for local and global customers.

Our increased equity in the Angel CCS project also supports future development of this large scale, multi-user carbon capture and storage hub in Western Australia.\u201d\n\nTransaction details\n\nUnder the proposed transaction, Woodside will transfer its 13% non-operated interest in the Wheatstone project and 65% operated interest in the Julimar-Brunello project and will acquire in exchange Chevron\u2019s 16.67% interests in the NWS Project and the NWS Oil project and a 20% interest in the Angel CCS project.\n\nThe effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2024.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions precedent, including Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Foreign Investment Review Board clearances and other applicable State and Federal and regulatory approvals, relevant third-party consents and pre-emption rights of the continuing joint venture participants. The transaction is also subject to the completion of Julimar Phase 3 Project execution and handover which is expected in 2026, and the completion of certain ongoing abandonment activities. The Julimar Phase 3 Project is a four well tie-back to the existing Julimar field production system and is currently in execution phase. Woodside will continue to operate the execution phase, transferring the asset to Chevron at project start-up. The transaction is expected to close in 2026.\n\nThe cash payment by Chevron to Woodside of up to US$400 million comprises a cash payment of US$300 million at completion, and additional contingent payments of up to US$100 million in aggregate related to handover of the Julimar Phase 3 Project and subsequent production performance. In addition, cashflows forecast at approximately US$400 million, are expected from utilising otherwise depreciable tax bases on completion.

It has made huge progress in capital discipline and efficiency gains and is getting more bang for its buck.

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"N-Hexane Market Report Global Forecast By Application, Countries and Company Analysis\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global n-Hexane market is projected to surge from US$2.45 billion in 2024 to US$3.46 billion by 2033 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.91% from 2025 to 2033.\n\nThe rise in demand for pharmaceuticals, adhesives, and chemical extraction is the key driver for the n-hexane market growth. N-hexane is primarily used as a solvent, particularly in extracting edible oils, thereby adding up to its market growth. With growing industrial applications, further growth will be shown in the market in the forecast period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Factors Driving the n-Hexane Market Growth\n\nGrowing Demand in the Edible Oil Extraction Industry\n\n\n\nn-Hexane's ability to effectively extract oil from seeds and vegetables makes it a vital component in the edible oil industry. As global consumption of cooking oils, particularly soybean and sunflower, rises, the demand for n-Hexane follows suit. Its efficiency in separating oils from organic matter has made it indispensable in large-scale food processing industries worldwide. With increasing population and urbanization, emerging markets also contribute to this growth as they seek cost-effective solutions for oil extraction to meet growing consumer demands for edible oils.\n\n\n\nExpanding Use in Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industry\n\n\n\nApplications of n-Hexane in drug formulation and solvent manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries play a very important role in the market. The fact that it is non-polar means it acts effectively for the solubilization of compounds otherwise hard to handle. This diversity, combined with increased pharmaceutical production around the world, has fueled demand. More importantly, n-Hexane is applied in a number of chemical extraction processes that are important to industry applications and continue to drive growth in the market as those industries expand and evolve.\n\n\n\nRising Demand in Adhesives, Inks, and Rubber Manufacturing\n\n\n\nWith solvent properties, n-Hexane is used extensively in the manufacture of adhesives, printing inks, and rubber. Such an application gives way to effective bonding and processing of materials. Increasing global industrialization and construction call for demand for such products. Additionally, the growing automobile industries provide for a higher demand on rubber and adhesives, which are produced using n-Hexane. Therefore, industrial growth would further augment steady market growth in the coming years.\n\n\n\nUnited States n-Hexane Market\n\n\n\nThe n-Hexane market in the United States remains strong since it is broadly applied in all sectors involved in oil extraction, pharmaceuticals, and adhesives. Its demand is also significantly contributed by the strong agricultural sector of the country, particularly soybean and corn oil extraction. There is also the growing pharmaceutical industry that uses it as a solvent in drug production. Industrial applications such as rubber and adhesive manufacturing increase its market even more.\n\nHowever, long-term growth in the market may be impacted by increasing regulatory scrutiny amid concerns for the environment and health. The United States Department of Agriculture forecasts that global production of vegetable oil would be 222.85 million metric tons between 2023 and 2024. Of the palm oil total, an estimated 90% is consumed as food, while the remaining 10% is for industrial purposes: cosmetics, fuel, and diesel. The soybean oil was primarily consumed, followed by 61.68 million tons in 2022 globally. Considering all these facts mentioned above, edible oil extraction application is most likely to lead the n-hexane market for the forecast period. The n-Hexane industry of Germany is gaining at a moderate growth rate primarily owing to the production of oil extraction, pharmaceutical industries, and various other industrial applications.\n\n\n\nGermany n-Hexane Industry\n\n\n\nGermany is the hub of Europe's industrial centers and has a high requirement for n-Hexane to provide various manufacturing industries that are adhesives, rubber, and chemical manufacturing. Pharmaceutical manufacturers also require n-Hexane as a solvent in drug formulation. Again, strict environmental compliances regarding VOCs within the European Union might later affect the industry in terms of having safer and more eco-friendly alternatives. The n-Hexane industry grows well in Indonesia mainly since it has been consuming quite large portions in the extraction process of vegetable oils, mainly for palm oil which is one of the leading sectors in the country.\n\n\n\nIndonesia n-Hexane Industry\n\n\n\nIndonesia, being one of the world's leading producers of palm oil, has consequently high demand for n-Hexane since there are highly efficient processes that use such solvents in extractions of oils. n-Hexane also finds uses in manufacturing adhesives and rubber industries in addition to chemical industries, hence catalyzing the growth in the development of the country's industrial sectors. According to estimates made by the US Department of Agriculture, total oil produced by Indonesia in the year 2023-2024 was around 53.32 million metric tons.\n\n\n\nGlobal n-Hexane Company Analysis\n\n\n\nThe key players in n-hexane industry are ExxonMobil, Shell, Indian Oil Corporation, Chevron, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, DHC Solvent Chemie, Sak Chaisidhi Company and Liaoning Yufeng Chemical Co.\n\n\n\nGlobal n-Hexane Company News\n\nMay 2024: A joint venture between Chandra Asri Capital Pte. Ltd. and Glencore Asian Holdings Pte. Ltd., CAPGC Pte. Ltd., will purchase Singapore's Energy and Chemicals Park from Royal Dutch Shell PLC. Through the deal, CAPGC will acquire Shell's entire stake in Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore.\n\nMay 2024: The Exxon Mobil Corporation said that the Pioneer Natural Resources Company transaction had been completed. With the largest, highest-return development potential in the Permian Basin, an unconventional business will be created by the merging of ExxonMobil and Pioneer.\n\nMay 2024: A framework agreement for strategic partnership was signed in Paris by Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO and chairman of TotalEnergies, and Ma Yongsheng, the chairman of Sinopec. The agreement states that the two parties would look for more opportunities for collaboration in a range of industries, such as the development of oil and gas, the LNG value chain, chemicals and refining, engineering and trading, new energy, and so forth.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 100 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $2.45 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $3.46 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 3.9% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

He acknowledged considering Trey Lance \"the series before\" but waited until the final minutes.\n\nAd\n\nWhen pressed about Week 18's starter, McCarthy responded:\n\n\"I don't know. I'm not there yet.\"\n\nLance's preseason performance offers context to the Cowboys' reluctance. He struggled with consistency, throwing more interceptions (five) than touchdowns (two) while completing 73 of 113 passes. His rushing abilities showed promise with 168 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries.\n\nDavid Helman of Fox Sports captured fans' frustration during the Eagles blowout: \"Why isn't Trey Lance finishing this out?\" The question gained weight as Cooper Rush struggled throughout the game.\n\nAd\n\nMany observers puzzle over the Cowboys' handling of Lance. After trading a fourth-round pick to San Francisco in August 2023, Dallas promised special packages for the athletic quarterback. These plans never materialized, leaving Lance behind Rush (and QB1 Dak Prescott) on the depth chart.\n\nWeek 18 against Washington now carries extra intrigue. McCarthy enters his final contracted game with his second losing season in Dallas. The decision about Lance's playing time could influence both their futures with the organization.\n\nThis quarterback conundrum exemplifies larger questions about Dallas's long-term planning. With Prescott injured and Lance's free agency looming, the Cowboys face crucial decisions about their quarterback room's future direction.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

The report states that the weather won't have a big effect on the game, and players should be able to perform optimally.\n\nAd\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nHow are the Lions and 49ers performing this season?\n\nThe Detroit Lions enter the game as heavy favorites because of their performance throughout the regular season. They have a 13-2 record, and the only losses this season come against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Buffalo Bills. Between their losses, they enjoyed an impressive 11-game winning streak.\n\nThere are many Lions stars to watch out for, with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, and Jahmyr Gibbs all having Pro Bowl-caliber seasons. All three will start against the 49ers to strengthen their position ahead of next week's \"Winner takes first seed\" battle against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nAd\n\nThe 49ers have endured one of the most disappointing seasons among preseason playoff contenders. They've lost nine games and are out of the playoff picture. The 49ers dealt with an array of injuries to key offensive and defensive players, resulting in them missing out on the playoffs for the first time in years.\n\nHence, Kyle Shanahan's side goes into tonight's game against the Lions to play for pride. Their season was over a few games ago, and they'll now look to retool and potentially come back in 2025 with a different mindset.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?
