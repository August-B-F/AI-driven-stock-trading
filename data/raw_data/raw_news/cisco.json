This collaboration with NVIDIA builds on the expanded partnership that was announced last month, and the companies have moved swiftly to provide validated reference architectures today. Together, the companies are developing the Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA to dramatically simplify how enterprises deploy, manage, and secure AI infrastructure at any scale.\n\n\u201cAI can unlock groundbreaking opportunities for the enterprise,\u201d said Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO, Cisco. \u201cTo achieve this, the integration of networking and security is essential. Cisco and NVIDIA's trusted, innovative solutions empower our customers to harness AI's full potential simply and securely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI factories are transforming every industry, and security must be built into every layer to protect data, applications and infrastructure,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cTogether, NVIDIA and Cisco are creating the blueprint for secure AI\u2014giving enterprises the foundation they need to confidently scale AI while safeguarding their most valuable assets.\u201d\n\nDeveloping and delivering AI applications require high performing, scalable infrastructure and AI software tool chain. Securing this infrastructure and AI software requires a new architecture \u2013 one that embeds security at all layers of the AI stack and automatically expands and adapts as the underlying infrastructure changes. Cisco and NVIDIA\u2019s partnership on the NVIDIA Spectrum-XTM Ethernet networking platform provides the foundation for the Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA. Cisco is integrating security solutions like Cisco Hypershield, to help protect AI workloads, and Cisco AI Defense, to help protect the development, deployment, and use of AI models and applications. Together, Cisco and NVIDIA will provide customers with the flexibility to design infrastructure for their specific AI needs without sacrificing operational simplicity or security.\n\n\n\nBuilding a Secure AI Factory\n\nAI factories \u2013 data centers purpose-built to power AI workloads \u2013 are designed to be more modular, scalable and agile, but organizations must also look beyond raw compute power. AI Factories must address new and complex security challenges. The recently published Cisco State of AI Security report analyzes dozens of AI-specific threat vectors and over 700 pieces of AI-related legislation to highlight key developments from a rapidly evolving AI security landscape. Organizations that strategically address both their AI infrastructure and security challenges simultaneously will be more agile, scale faster, and derive business value quicker.\n\nCisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA is expected to build on the companies\u2019 unique ability to offer flexible AI networking and full-stack technology options that leverage the planned joint architecture. The partnership will bring together technologies from Cisco, NVIDIA, and our ecosystem partners into a secure AI factory architecture for enterprise customers, including: compute, networking, storage, and software.\n\nThe Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA includes security at all layers:\n\nSecuring the infrastructure through Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall that provides unified security management and consistent policy across multiple enforcement points. It will, in the future, extend pervasive, zero-trust security enforcement to every AI node by integrating with NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs.\n\nSecuring the Workload via Cisco Hypershield that prevents adversary lateral movement and proactive vulnerability mitigation without the need for patching, all from a single management interface. Future enhancements will further strengthen workload protection through integration with NVIDIA BlueField-3\u2019s DOCA AppShield for real-time workload threat detection in AI-focused virtual machines and containers.\n\nSecuring the AI application with Cisco AI Defense that empowers security and AI teams with comprehensive tools to protect AI applications from safety risks across the development lifecycle. Additionally, AI Defense helps companies align to AI security standards with a single integration, including NIST, MITRE ATLAS, and OWASP LLM Top 10. Future enhancements include integration with NVIDIA AI Enterprise to streamline AI security workflows.\n\nCisco and NVIDIA each bring a unique understanding of customer AI infrastructure needs, and by combining their insights, can offer flexible deployment models alongside proven reference architectures. The Secure AI Factory will provide enterprise customers with scalable, high-performance AI infrastructure that supports customers at any stage of their journey and embeds security throughout.\n\nCisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA will have flexible deployment options, including\n\nReady-to-deploy approach along with Cisco\u2019s security portfolio and NVIDIA technology, customers can deploy a vertically integrated AI solution that automates and simplifies the secure AI factory lifecycle from design to deployment and ongoing monitoring.\n\nBuild-your-own: Featuring customizable modular components from Cisco, NVIDIA, and the companies\u2019 storage ecosystem partners, customers can incorporate their current infrastructure and build solutions that are designed precisely for their unique environments.\n\n\n\nCisco and NVIDIA: The journey to a validated and unified architecture\n\nMoving quickly is crucial to meet today\u2019s demand for AI infrastructure, and Cisco and NVIDIA have made progress as part of the collaboration announced in February 2025. Cisco has developed new reference architectures with deployment options for Cisco Nexus Hyperfabric AI or Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches validated and based on the NVIDIA Enterprise Reference Architecture for HGX H200 and Spectrum-X.\n\n\n\nAvailability\n\nSolutions based on the Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA architecture are expected to be available for purchase before the end of calendar year 2025. Many of the individual technology components included in the architecture are available today.",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs AI increasingly takes over coding tasks, some industry veterans have started to prioritize other skills. However, Cisco executive Liz Centoni says the advice \"learn to code\" is still relevant in tech today.\n\n\"There's some foundational elements that help train the way you think around how to solve for problems,\" the executive vice president and chief customer experience officer said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nCentoni, who was a software engineer early in her career and made several transitions during her nearly 25 years at Cisco, said her coding skills have helped her \"decompose\" the everyday \"boring problems.\" She said one of her strengths is being able to look at a problem, break it down, bring in data, make a hypothesis, and test for it.\n\n\"And maybe nobody wants to talk about the boring problems, because it doesn't make the news,\" Centoni said. \"But the reality is that we have boring problems that have lots of data underneath it. It has thousands of employees who work at it.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean you need to get a degree in computer science, Centoni said. In fact, Centoni said that foundational concepts like coding need \"brought forward\" to address today's challenges because the world isn't just solving linear computer science problems today.\n\n\"We're solving for, you know, where it can be structured, unstructured data as well, where we need a tool, where we need an agent to continue to learn and think for itself as well,\" Centoni said.\n\nThe Cisco exec said that thousands of employees work on those types of \"boring problems,\" and that includes a lot of repeatable workflows. In tackling those kinds of problems, employees need to know how to look at the available technology, whether it's machine learning or generative AI, and know when and where to apply it. Centoni said that \"hands-on knowledge\" in those scenarios is \"super valuable.\"\n\n\"There's some basic concepts you need to understand,\" Centoni said, adding that she's looking for people who can solve them with \"knowledge of the tools that are out there.\"\n\nCentoni added that coding isn't the only valuable skill \u2014 being able to think creatively is also vital. That requires learning more than simply educational background, she said.\n\n\"I want someone in there who's sitting with the subject matter experts who can not just understand the problem, but look at how can we creatively craft a solution,\" Centoni said.\n\nAdditionally, she said understanding business problems is also a key skill so that employees can connect business use cases with technology to create efficient solutions.\n\n\"We have 20,000 people in our organization today,\" Centoni said. \"How do we reduce the friction in their lives? And so I think somebody who can connect both a business use case and the technology, that's very valuable to me as well.\"",

Register now to save 20% on your pass .\n\nOn this episode of the Marketing Vanguard podcast, host Jenny Rooney she sits down with Carrie Palin, CMO of communications technology firm Cisco, for an illuminating discussion on the evolution of B2B tech marketing and authentic leadership.\n\nFrom transforming Cisco\u2019s digital presence to leveraging AI for enhanced customer experiences, Palin shares how she\u2019s redefining what it means to be a tech CMO.\n\nThe conversation takes an inspiring turn as she candidly discusses navigating executive leadership while being present as a parent, offering valuable insights for professionals seeking to balance career ambitions with personal priorities.\n\n\u201cThese days, because the world is so intensely digital and because B2C companies have made that consumer relationship so instantaneous and gratifying, we have had to catch up in B2B. And yet, now we are producing a lot of the tech in B2B that is enabling all of this AI revolution,\u201d she says on the podcast.\n\nWith over 30 years in tech marketing at Dell, IBM, Box, SendGrid, and Splunk, Palin is a pioneer in B2B marketing. At Cisco, she has modernized the brand, overhauled the website, and leveraged AI for customer engagement. A champion of work-life integration, she has helped position Cisco as a leader in digital resilience and cybersecurity while driving business growth.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a marketing leader looking to drive innovation or an aspiring executive seeking to chart your path, this episode delivers actionable wisdom for modern business leadership.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n[11:51] Transforming legacy brands and customer experience \u2014 Carrie shares how her team transformed Cisco\u2019s brand from \u201cthe company that built the Internet\u201d to a leader in digital resilience. Upon joining Cisco, she identified a critical opportunity with their 17-year-old website that had an 80% bounce rate. By securing executive buy-in and making customer experience the priority, her team replatformed the entire site and implemented a customer-first approach to all digital touchpoints, winning numerous awards for their work.\n\n[16:31] AI framework: enhancing human connections \u2014 Carrie emphasizes Cisco\u2019s thoughtful, intentional approach to AI implementation, focusing on safety, security, and enhancing human connections. She explains that AI should be used to fill gaps in customer experience that would be impossible to address with human resources alone, while preserving the human touch where it adds the most value. Her team uses this framework to evaluate every AI initiative, ensuring technology serves humanity rather than replacing it.\n\n[07:21] B2B tech driving innovative customer experiences \u2014 Carrie challenges the conventional wisdom that B2C marketing is more innovative than B2B. She explains that B2B tech companies are now at the forefront of marketing innovation because they both develop and implement the technologies transforming customer experiences. The digital transformation has allowed B2B marketers to understand customer behavior with unprecedented depth, potentially surpassing their B2C counterparts in customer insights and elevating marketing\u2019s role from simply owning the brand to being true business leaders.\n\n[09:11] Customer-first digital transformation \u2014 Carrie outlines the key elements of successful digital transformation at enterprise scale: identifying critical pain points in the customer journey, securing executive support for significant investment, measuring impact through clear metrics like bounce rate reduction, and prioritizing customer experience over internal organizational silos. This framework guided Cisco\u2019s website re-platforming and broader digital transformation efforts, demonstrating how large organizations can successfully evolve their digital presence with the customer at the center.\n\n[13:03] Brand modernization through creative partnerships \u2014 Carrie details how her team updated Cisco\u2019s brand perception by partnering with agencies that typically served luxury brands to bring fresh perspectives to B2B tech marketing. She describes their award-nominated security ad featuring a stylish young executive confidently handling a cyber incident, set to original music without dialogue\u2014a brand language specifically designed to resonate with millennials and Gen Z. This approach demonstrates how traditional B2B brands can successfully modernize their image through unexpected creative partners.\n\n[18:45] AI for global scale with personal touch \u2014 Carrie provides a practical example of using AI to scale customer service globally while enhancing personalization.

We discuss what a Cisco AI infrastructure is and dive into the objectives Cisco has in the compute space with Jeremy Foster, SVP and GM for Cisco\u2019s compute organization.\n\nSubscribe to Techzine Talks on Tour and listen to our other episodes via Spotify, Apple , YouTube or another service of your choice.\n\nCisco\u2019s compute business appeared to be in de doldrums a couple of years ago. That is, it appeared to coast along without a very clear objective. Cisco didn\u2019t make a lot of big announcements around UCS either, as far as we can remember.\n\nThis has changed fundamentally over the past year or so. Cisco wants to make it very clear now that UCS still plays a very important role in Cisco\u2019s strategy. The reason for this? AI of course. What else? With the rise of AI comes more and different demand for the underlying infrastructure.\n\nThat infrastructure is about more than GPUs alone. Compute and networking also play a very important role. That\u2019s why Cisco has been focusing heavily on delivering AI stacks to customers. Hyperfabric is one of them, but the recent announcement of the AI PODs, and the news together with Nvidia coming out of GTC are all clear indications of this.\n\nDuring our conversation with Foster at Cisco Live EMEA, we asked him all about the changed dynamic within Cisco around UCS and compute in general. We talked about what makes a good AI stack, and what customers should take into account when setting one up.\n\nFoster promises one thing, Cisco\u2019s only getting started, so it\u2019s a good idea to be clued in from the start. Another good reason to listen to this new Episode of Techzine Talks on Tour now.\n\nTechzine Talks on Tour: season two\n\nWe started Techzine Talks on Tour in May of 2024, with the goal of doing at least one episode every two weeks. After 25 episodes in 2024 we were close enough to that target for us to call the first season a good start. That\u2019s what it is, a start, because we\u2019re not done yet. We continue with a second season, with the goal of growing our reach even further. We will once again try and serve up a fresh new episode of Techzine Talks every two weeks.\n\nA big thank you to the people who found us in 2024 already. We hope you continue to listen to Techzine Talks on Tour in 2025. If this is your first encounter with our podcast, there\u2019s much more to come!

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights.\n\nA new open-source model from Mistral AI is shaking things up in the tech world. This groundbreaking model outperforms comparable models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, delivering inference speeds of 150 tokens per second. Mistral Small 3.1 surpasses the performance of leading small proprietary models across dimensions such as handling text, understanding multimodal inputs, supporting multiple languages, and managing long contexts, all that with low latency and cost efficiency.\n\nShifting focus to China, Tencent has recently captured attention with its suite of new artificial intelligence tools capable of converting text and images into 3D visuals. The company has released five open-source models based on its Hunyuan3D-2.0 technology, including \u201cturbo\u201d versions that can generate 3D visuals within 30 seconds while maintaining high precision and quality.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Turning Heads on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar\n\nLike many other Chinese firms, Tencent is advancing China\u2019s position in the AI arms race by expanding its capital expenditures. According to Tencent President Martin Lau, capital spending would rise to the \u201clow teens\u201d as a percentage of revenue, and artificial intelligence will be a key focus of strategic investments.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to increase our AI investments, increasing investment in our proprietary Hunyuan model while expanding our contributions in multimodal and open-source capabilities.\u201d \u2013Martin Lau.\n\nMeanwhile, once an AI leader in China, Baidu is also striving hard to regain its position in the tech world. The company has released two new free-to-use artificial intelligence models, including its first reasoning-focused model. The move comes ahead of its plans to move toward an open-source strategy.\n\nAccording to an article by The Financial Times on why China is suddenly flooding the markets with AI models, retaliation appears to be the driving force. When the US tightened its grip on advanced artificial intelligence technologies in January, it blocked off China\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and locked proprietary models behind trade barriers.\n\nEven though it seemed that China would retaliate by doubling down on secrecy, it\u2019s doing quite the opposite, and with good reason. Chinese tech groups are seemingly creating an ecosystem where developers can continuously revamp their models. Provided open-source becomes powerful enough, there would be no reason to pay for closed models if free, equally capable alternatives exist.",

            "content": "The New York Jets signed former Jacksonville Jaguars safety Andre Cisco to a one-year contract worth up to $10 million during the first week of free agency. Today we break Cisco down in detail.\n\nThe 24-year old Cisco is listed at 6\u20190\u201d and 210 pounds. He was a third round draft pick out of Syracuse in 2021. After coming off the bench in his rookie season, Cisco has been a starter for the past three years. He has racked up 229 tackles and eight interceptions in his career so far.\n\nBackground\n\nCisco wasn\u2019t a highly sought-after high school recruit initially, but he then moved from the New York area to enroll at the IMG academy, where he developed into a three-star recruit and earned a scholarship to Syracuse.\n\nHe was a sensation as a freshman as his seven interceptions were tied for the NCAA lead, earning him all-ACC and all-American honors. He also added 60 tackles and 18 pass breakups.\n\nIn 2019, he followed that up with a career-high 65 tackles and another five interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown, to earn all-ACC second team honors. That was despite missing three games due to injury.\n\nHis 2020 season ended prematurely after he was injured in a pre-game collision before the third game of the year and had to have season-ending surgery. However, he opted to enter the NFL draft at the end of the season even though he couldn\u2019t participate fully in the pre-draft process.\n\nThis was expected to damage Cisco\u2019s stock, but he was still picked early in the third round, with the 65th overall pick, by the Jaguars. He began his rookie season on the bench but started the last three games as he ended up with 26 tackles, two pass breakups and two forced fumbles.\n\nFrom the start of 2022 onwards, Cisco was a full-time starter. He set career marks with 73 tackles and 10 passes defensed in 2022 and then had a career-high four interceptions in 2023.\n\n2024 was a contract year for Cisco but he was benched late in the season, ending up with 68 tackles and seven pass breakups but only one interception. Cisco came off the bench in two games and was a healthy scratch in the season finale.\n\nWith his contact having expired at the end of the 2024 season, the Jets signed him to a one-year deal with a base value of $7.5 million and another $2.5 million in potential incentives.\n\nLet\u2019s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Cisco brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nMeasurables/Athleticism\n\nWhile only listed at 210 pounds, Cisco has bulked up since he first entered the league so is probably heavier than that. He has a nice wingspan and big hands, all of which help his range in center field.\n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t healthy enough to work out at the combine or his pro day, Cisco did manage 17 bench press reps, which is above average for his position.\n\nOn film, his range, quickness, change of direction and explosiveness are all apparent and he reportedly tested at between 4.3 and 4.4 for the 40-yard dash in 2020.\n\nUsage\n\nCisco\u2019s primary position has been as a deep safety although he has shown some ability to match up in the slot or come up into the box and contribute there. He will get a lot of reps as the deep centerfielder in single-high looks.\n\nCoverage skills\n\nCisco\u2019s critics may point to the fact that quarterbacks have routinely had a passer rating of over 100 when targeting him, but these numbers can be misleading with deep safeties, for whom many of those targets would have been from being the closest defender rather than in man coverage. Also, some of his interceptions and pass breakups have been on plays where he was not the defender in primary coverage.\n\nWhen he does match up in a man to man situation, Cisco can allow separation due to poor route feel or anticipation, but he moves well and can stay with his man or recover well.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s at his best in center field where he can keep everything in front of him and exploit his range and closing speed.\n\nBall skills\n\nCisco\u2019s on-ball production has been excellent, both in college and at the pro level, as he has been good at patrolling center field and reacting to, locating and going after downfield throws.\n\nIn tighter coverage situations, including in the red zone, he displays good timing and competitiveness at the catch-point.\n\nWhen he does intercept passes, Cisco is a good return threat, with a pick six at both the NFL and college levels and some good return yardage numbers. However, he could have had more interceptions than he did, with his hands letting him down a few times on catchable balls.\n\nTackling\n\nCisco has been a productive and willing tackler during his career, but he has averaged around 10 missed tackles per season as a starter, so he\u2019s not flawless.\n\nHe can be guilty of taking over-aggressive angles or running himself out of plays at times, leading to some of these issues.\n\nTechnically, he packs a punch but his footwork isn\u2019t always faultless, forcing him to make arm tackles rather than being able to stop a runner in his tracks in the open field.\n\nHe had two forced fumbles in college and has had three in his NFL career so far.\n\nRun defense\n\nCisco has played more and more reps in the box over the course of his career, becoming a more well-rounded player, and this has been reflected in increasing production as a run defender.\n\nHe looks comfortable in the box and attacks the line of scrimmage with good aggression to make plays.\n\nPhysicality\n\nCisco has a strong and powerful frame and is capable of unloading some big, but clean, hits in coverage and when tackling.\n\nThere are times, however, when he noticeably struggles to bring a bigger ball carrier down, allowing himself to be dragged for extra yardage.\n\nHe has had four defensive penalties in his career, of which two were unnecessary roughness calls on late hits and one was a pass interference call. He only had one defensive penalty in his entire college career.\n\nBlitzing\n\nCisco hasn\u2019t blitzed much at the NFL level and barely did it at all in college. However, he has registered pressure a few times, batted down one pass at the line and recorded 1.5 sacks.\n\nHe was called for roughing the passer once during his career.\n\nSpecial teams\n\nCisco began his NFL career in a full-time special teams role, covering kicks and punts, rushing on the placekicking and punt return units and blocking on returns and in punt protection. His special teams role has reduced since he\u2019s been a starter, though.\n\nHe has nine special teams tackles in his pro career so far, along with two penalties for holding on a kick return and being offside on a kickoff.\n\nInstincts/Intelligence\n\nCisco is a player who is adept at sitting in center field and reacting to wayward passes or reading the quarterback\u2019s eyes to jump routes.\n\nHowever, he can be fooled by play fakes and misdirection and his over-aggressiveness can be exploited, leading to blown coverages.\n\nOn this play, he jumps the outside route, leaving the cornerback with no deep safety help. It should have been a touchdown but the Jaguars got lucky when the pass was underthrown. You can see the cornerback\u2019s frustration being directed at Cisco at the end of the play.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a one-off incident, as Cisco was involved in a number of blown coverages last season, some of which led to big plays. This is cited as the main reason that he lost some reps down the stretch. However, blown coverages are always difficult to assess because there is often more than one person at fault and it\u2019s not uncommon for them to arise more frequently on a struggling team where communication is perhaps not good.\n\nCisco\u2019s other primary issue has been that he can get caught up in traffic when covering crossing routes.\n\nIn college, Cisco was a four-time member of the Syracuse Athletic Director\u2019s honor roll and a two-time ACC honor roll member.\n\nAttitude\n\nCisco is a player whose Jacksonville teammate Tyson Campbell described as \u201ca born leader\u201d and said he acted like a pro from the start despite being one of the youngest starters on the Jags\u2019 defense.\n\nHe\u2019s a dedicated player who is constantly looking to improve, apparently doing a deep dive at the end of each season to determine where he can make adjustments to his game to mitigate weaknesses.\n\nThere was one controversial moment last year when he made comments that there was \u201ca lot of quit\u201d from the defensive unit during the game they had just lost. Online speculation linked this to a particular play where linebacker Devin Lloyd was loafing rather than hustling back to assist him on a tackle, but head coach Doug Pederson downplayed this and said he didn\u2019t consider it to constitute direct finger pointing.\n\nInjuries\n\nCisco\u2019s college career was cut short in a freak accident where a teammate collided with him during pre-game warmups, causing him to suffer a torn ACL. Prior to that, he just had missed three games due to a lower leg injury in the previous season.\n\nHe was obviously able to put these issues behind him as he became an NFL starter two years later and he\u2019s only had minor injury issues at the NFL level, missing a total of five games, one of which was as a healthy scratch. He had a shoulder injury in 2022, hamstring and groin issues in 2023 and an ankle injury in 2024.\n\nScheme Fit\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know exactly what the Jets\u2019 defense will look like yet, we can assume that the Jets are directly targeting players who they know have ideal size, athleticism and skill-set profiles to fit into what they want to do. Presumably Cisco will be a deep center fielder with them, perhaps enabling Tony Adams to play closer to the line of scrimmage more often than he has in the past two seasons.\n\nRumor has it that the Jets also tried to get Talanoa Hufanga before settling for Cisco on a less lucrative deal. He\u2019s also been primarily a deep safety, albeit that he\u2019s played a higher percentage of his snaps in the box. That may suggest that the Jets have more of a well-rounded role in mind for Cisco.\n\nConclusions\n\nCisco is an excellent athlete with a good skill-set and an ability to read the game along with some good leadership qualities, but he had a down year last year, so the Jets need him to bounce back and play with more consistency.\n\nHe only signed a one-year deal so there\u2019s not much risk if it doesn\u2019t work out, but there will be urgency to get him re-signed beyond this year if he does re-establish himself with the Jets.\n\nSince he\u2019s still only 24, the Jets can have legitimate hope that Cisco can build on the production he\u2019s had so far at the NFL level and eradicate some of the negatives he\u2019s been guilty of over the years.",

            "content": "MadridMaxime France and Pierre Citerne are the winning couples of the seventeenth Vila Viniteca Couples Tasting Competition, held this Sunday at the Casino de Madrid. For the first time in the competition organized by Catalans Quim Vila and Cisco Mart\u00ed, the winners took home 35,000 euros. Peter Srijs and Stijin Verleyen came in second, and Alberto Bot\u00eda Gomz\u00e1lez and Eduardo Dequidt Herrero came in third.\n\nAt nine in the morning, anyone walking down Calle de Alcal\u00e1 in Madrid realized something was happening. The entire street was empty, but a thick cloud of people gathered in front of the casino door, waiting for the organizers of the couples tasting competition to let them in and sit in one of the two rooms that had been set up with long tables with white tablecloths and chairs.\n\nFor the first time, 135 couples participated in the competition invented seventeen years ago by Quim Vila and Cisco Mart\u00ed of Vila Viniteca. Not only was the number of participants unprecedented, but so was the amount they could win if they placed among the top three couples: the first, 35,000 euros; the second, 10,000; and the third, 5,000 euros. In other words, the wine shop on Agullers Street in Barcelona and distributor Vila Viniteca, for the first time in the competition's seventeen years, had committed to giving away 50,000 euros in prizes. Registration, which took place on January 10 through the Vila Viniteca website, sold out in three minutes from participants from various countries: Catalonia, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Poland, Hungary, China, Switzerland, Slovenia, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\nSo, at a few minutes past ten in the morning, the contest began, which consisted of blindly guessing seven wines. For parelles have to write in some documents (sense the use of mobiles or intelligent clocks, nor try to fer trapes aixecant-se to go to the toilet to consult information) the country (1 point), the zone of origin (1 point), the denomination of origin (2 points), the varietats of berries (3 points), the anyada (3 points), the producer (3 points) and the brand (2 points). In case of a tie in the scores, the comment that the couples could also leave written, helped the jury to tip the balance.\n\nAnd speaking of the jury, notary Jos\u00e9 Luis L\u00f3pez de Garayo oversaw the entire process, followed by the organizers, Quim Vila and Cisco Mart\u00ed; the sponsor, Jordi Segura, the European representative of the Riedel glass brand; winemaker Xandra Falc\u00f3; sommelier Paz Levinson; the president of the tasting room, Juan Mu\u00f1oz; the creator of the Pe\u00f1\u00edn guide, Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f1\u00edn; and the president of the jury, Fernando Gurrucharri.\n\nAfter two and a half hours, the first phase of the competition was over, and the jury collected all the participants' forms, kept in envelopes, and locked themselves in an office to read them. 135 documents had to be read, scored, and sorted to select the ten best pairs.\n\nAt 2:00 p.m., the jury emerged from their office and announced the seven wines they had chosen. And then the first emotions began. Quim Vila declared that no one had guessed three of the seven wines, and then the contestants' disappointments began to appear. He then announced the names of the couples who had qualified, and shouts and hugs filled the royal hall. There were also sad faces, those who had been trying for years, for whom qualifying for the semifinals would already be a great success. Fortunately, next year Vila Viniteca will organize another couples tasting, which will take place in Barcelona.\n\nTen couples in the final\n\nAt 4 p.m., the final began. The ten couples sat at long tables with white tablecloths, with space between them so they couldn't talk or look at the papers they were writing. Quim Vila told them they had one hour to guess seven wines under the same conditions: they couldn't look at mobile phones, smartwatches, or any documents. They could only talk to each other.\n\nFinally, just a few minutes before 7 p.m., the jury went out to the royal room, where the finalists were seated, surrounded by family, friends, and other participants. Quim Vila explained the most important details of the day, including the 6,000 Riedel glasses that had been rumored about the casino during the non-contest hours. He then revealed the names of the wines and, finally, those of the winners. The third and second place finishers celebrated their prize with great joy, while the first place finishers, more restrained by nature and with the same discretion they had shown when they qualified, received the check for 35,000 euros from the co-owner of Vila Viniteca, Cisco Mart\u00ed.\n\nThe wines that the contestants had to guess in the semi-final (qualifying phase)\n\nPSI 2021, Ribera del Duero\n\nLa Grange des P\u00e8res 2018, Languedoc-Roussillon\n\nBu\u00e7aco Branco M\u00edstico 2017, Portugal\n\nJacquesson La Cuv\u00e9e 742 D\u00e9gorgement Tardif, Champagne\n\nThe O by L'Origan Brut Nature Edition 13, DO Cava\n\nCa' Del Bosco Annamaria Clementi 2014, Franciacorta\n\nAlvear Pedro Xim\u00e9nez 1927, Montilla-Moriles\n\nThe wines of the final",

Two goals each, two penalties for the Brazilian. Then, to complete the list of scorers, an own goal.\n\nThe debut on the Entella pitch ended with a 1-0 defeat in injury time. The second match of the coach who replaced Zauli saw the red and whites prevail over Ascoli 2-1: Matos opened the scoring with a penalty, Cisco closed in glory in injury time. The third match, against Milan Futuro, ended 0-0, then the double home round: success against Torres 1-0 with an own goal by Dametto, and a 2-1 victory against Legnago Salus, with Cisco opening and Matos closing from eleven meters.\n\nBut claiming a front row seat is Daniele Montevago, striker in a state of grace in the first half of the season (8 goals), dry in the second half. Ten games without a goal, because Montevago missed the last three, with only one appearance in the last ten minutes against Legnago. Montevago is recovering from a bad flu, but now the striker's conditions are good, he also demonstrated it in the part of the match at Curi. With the new coach he still has to, in fact, get into the game.\n\nBut against Ternana, what will coach Cangelosi's attacking choices be? It will depend on the module that will be chosen, it is difficult to think that the three will be on the pitch together. The idea seems to be that of a Perugia lined up with the 3-5-2, in defense there is a choice, Cangelosi could opt for Riccardi, one between Angella and Lewis and Dell'Orco. Curiosity regarding the bands: on the left he will have a Giraudo shirt, while on the right there are three solutions. Leo if a less daring solution is sought, Mezzoni is the middle way, while Cisco is the most risky hypothesis. In the middle of the field chances for Torrasi, Joselito and Giunti, while up front, with three more training sessions, Matos and Montevago are favorites.",

            "content": "The Jacksonville Jaguars are trying to put together a playoff-caliber roster. In order to do so, they had to move on from several players in free agency. Some of them were released while others simply weren't re-signed. Andre Cisco fits the latter category.\n\nA mainstay of the Jags secondary the past three seasons, the Syracuse product bolted for the New York Jets. To replace him, the front office brought in Eric Murray. The move hasn't gotten great reviews, which begs the question, will Jacksonville regret letting Cisco leave?\n\nCisco was a ballhawk for the Orangemen, registering 13 interceptions and 14 passes defensed in 24 games. But despite his playmaking skills, injuries in 2018 and 2018 made him slide to Round 3 in the 2021 NFL Draft. Surprisingly, he managed to stay healthy in his rookie season but spent most of the year on the sidelines. It wasn't until late in 2021 that the New York native was given a chance. With Doug Pederson taking over the following year, he joined the starting lineup full-time.\n\nThe decision paid off, as Cisco went on to showcase the traits that made him a staple of the Orangemen secondary back in college, logging a combined 15 passes defensed and seven interceptions the next two seasons. This in turn made him an obvious choice for a breakout candidate in 2024.\n\nBut instead of having a career year, Cisco regressed in 2024. He wasn't outright dreadful but struggled to tackle and pass coverage. Then again, the Jaguars' defense as a whole struggled, so his regression is somewhat understandable, especially when you take into account that then-defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen rubbed players the wrong way with his arrogant demeanor.\n\nOf course, Cisco isn't free of blame. He pointed fingers at his teammates last year, calling them out for quitting when he himself wasn't doing so well. Then again, it looks like he's leaving on good terms. Just recently, he posted a farewell on social media.\n\n\"DUVAL\u2014thank you for 4 of the most transformational years of my life!\" Cisco said on Twitter. \"From ownership, to support staff, to my coaches, to our media team, and the special fanbase\u2014I was immediately embraced by this city and organization. My teammates became my brothers and I'm forever indebted!\"\n\nDUVAL\u2014 thank you for 4 of the most transformational years of my life!

My teammates became my brothers and I\u2019m forever indebted! pic.twitter.com/bDauZzkYql \u2014 Dre Cisco (@andrecisco7) March 21, 2025\n\nIt's not farfetched to think that Cisco will bounce back with better coaching. Heck, he might even become the player the Jaguars expected last year and he's confident in his skills, having signed a one-year, prove-it deal worth $10 million with the Jets.\n\nIf Cisco has a breakout season, he'll be a hot commodity in free agency next year.\n\nRelated story: AFC South free agency power rankings, where do the Jaguars land?\n\nThe Jaguars signed Eric Murray to replace Andre Cisco, will the move pay off?\n\nBringing in Eric Murray was most definitely cheaper than keeping Andre Cisco around, as the Jacksonville Jaguars gave him a three-year, $21 million deal. Then again, and as with most things in life, they got what they're paying for.\n\nMurray, a fourth-round pick in 2016, has suited up for the Kansas City Chiefs, the Cleveland Browns, and the Houston Texans, appearing in 124 games with 58 games. Simply, you don't last that long in the NFL, let alone start, if you aren't any good, so his longevity is certainly worth recognizing. Having said that, the former Minnesota Golden Gopher has only three career interceptions and 24 passes defensed.\n\nThere's clearly a dropoff from Cisco to Murray in terms of turnovers. That said, Murray is a solid tackler who will get the job done in the backfield. Moreover, he's not the long-term answer but rather a short-term fix at safety. The Jags could find his replacement in the draft this year or next and move on from him in 2026 without incurring a significant cap hit.\n\nOf course, Cisco is a better player than Murray, but he didn't fit the team's vision, so they let him walk. Now, the past regime had a mixed track record of letting players walk. The Jaguars were fine without Calvin Ridley Zay Jones, or Jawan Taylor, but surely regret letting, Quincy Williams, Arden Key, and Darious Williams walk.\n\nWhich group will Ande Cisco join? It's probably too early to tell if the Jaguars dropped the ball, but they are surely hoping it won't be the latter.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

            "content": "All too often the press is a participant in spreading conspiracies, most notably with the Russia collusion hoax, perhaps the most politically consequential one in American history.\n\nThis week, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration released tens of thousands of documents related to the assassinations of President Kennedy, his brother Robert, and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNow, I\u2019m one of those naive Americans who believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in 1963 when he assassinated Kennedy at Dallas. If the Warren Commission had found a smoking gun, we would have heard about it in 1964. The notion that hundreds of staffers, politicians, and conspirers could keep such a secret is ridiculous.\n\nStill, conspiracies surrounding Kennedy\u2019s assassination are by far the most popular in the country. Thousands of books have been written on the topic, and millions of theories spawned.\n\nA 2023 YouGov poll found that 54 percent of the public believed it was \u201cdefinitely or probably\u201d true that Oswald \u201cdid not act alone in assassinating John F. Kennedy in 1963.\u201d Another 24 percent were unsure. This means only 23 percent of my fellow citizens accept the fact that a bitter loser and communist with violent tendencies grabbed a rifle and shot Kennedy on his own.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the release of documents regarding the assassination was long overdue. Overclassification only engenders public suspicion. Reading about the unfolding investigation, the panic and discussions, and the reaction of agencies and foreign governments offers us invaluable historical perspectives. There are lots of fascinating tidbits in those files.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also obvious why officials wouldn\u2019t want them to be released. The Kennedy files contain instances of phone tapping and spying within friendly nations. They offer details on intelligence-gathering methods that may still be used. Mostly, though, it\u2019s a massive cache of documents composed of scraps of evidence, theories, and random unsourced allegations that are sure to be misread and misrepresented by conspiracists.\n\nIndeed, many social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d immediately figured out who did it \u2014 spoiler: the Jews. Yet even the casually conspiratorial right-wing influencer showed how easy it is to jump to conclusions when you don\u2019t have historical context.\n\nOne file shared widely on social media, for instance, contained a copy of a Ramparts article from 1967 that casts suspicion on the death of a man named Gary Underhill, a CIA functionary who committed suicide soon after the assassination.\n\nNone of the big influencer accounts spreading this document seemed to be aware that Ramparts was a radical left-wing, pro-Soviet publication in the 1960s and 1970s that blamed literally every modern atrocity on the CIA. Someone just threw it into a file.\n\nIt should be noted that most of these documents had apparently been made public with a few redactions. The Underhill suicide has long been in the public record, lumped in with other supposedly untimely deaths connected to the Kennedy assassination.\n\nMany Americans seem better versed in the paranoiac mythology that\u2019s arisen around the Kennedy assassination than any genuine history. Oliver Stone\u2019s 1991 film \u201cJFK,\u201d which pinned the assassination on the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex,\u201d the CIA, the FBI, President Johnson, the mafia, anti-Castro Cubans, and big business, among others, wasn\u2019t a documentary.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing: you can never debate conspiracists.\n\nConspiracy theories are organisms forever undergoing mitosis, morphing into new \u201cquestions\u201d and conjectures. In that sense, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the Kennedy documents say. If none of them corroborate the conspiracist\u2019s priors, they will simply contend that pertinent documents were removed by the CIA or the Freemasons. Conspiracists feel no obligation to prove anything. They act like it\u2019s your job to debunk their never-ending, unfalsifiable fantasies.\n\nFor some, a healthy skepticism of government has mutated into a psychological need to blame everything on the government. Sometimes, it seems that every historical incident is now framed in the context of contemporary political antagonisms. Intelligence services went after President Trump, so they must be behind every despicable act ever perpetrated.\n\nIt\u2019s only going to get worse.\n\nClickbait social media accounts with millions of followers chum the waters with misleading snippets of documents and harebrained theories. And because so many of our institutions, including intelligence agencies, have lost our trust, millions will be seduced into conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe press, once tasked with tempering the public\u2019s paranoia, has also lost all credibility. As it happens, they are often participants in spreading conspiracies, most notably with the Russia collusion hoax, perhaps the most politically consequential one in American history.\n\nNow, if tomorrow a batch of documents appeared that indisputably showed Allen Dulles, John McCone, Johnson, Joe Colombo, or whoever else was conspiring to assassinate the president, I would accept the truth. Only conspiracy theorists are never swayed by the preponderance of evidence or the complete lack of it. They are not looking for truth; they are looking for more questions.\n\nAnd no document dump is ever going to change that.\n\nCreators.com",

Attackers can exploit the backdoor to access sensitive log files. While no active exploitation was initially observed, the publication of exploit details has led to recent attack activity.\n\n\u201cMultiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect sensitive information or administer Cisco Smart Licensing Utility services on a system while the software is running.\u201d reads the advisory.\n\nBelow are the descriptions of the two vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-20439 (CVSS score: 9.8) \u2013 The flaw is related to the presence of an undocumented static admin credential, allowing attackers to log in with administrative privileges via the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility API.\n\n(CVSS score: 9.8) \u2013 The flaw is related to the presence of an undocumented static admin credential, allowing attackers to log in with administrative privileges via the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility API. CVE-2024-20440 (CVSS score: 9.8) \u2013 The vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a debug log file. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an affected device and obtain log files that contain sensitive data, including credentials that can be used to access the API.\n\nThe IT giant has already released software updates that address these flaws. There are no workarounds to address the two issues.\n\nResearchers at SANS Internet Storm Center now warn that the two issues are actively exploited in attacks.\n\n\u201cThese two vulnerabilities are somewhat connected. The first one is one of the many backdoors Cisco likes to equip its products with. A simple fixed password that can be used to obtain access. The second one is a log file that logs more than it should. Using the first vulnerability, an attacker may access the log file.\u201d reads the advisory published by SANS. \u201cA quick search didn\u2019t show any active exploitation, but details, including the backdoor credentials, were published in a blog by Nicholas Starke shortly after Cisco released its advisory [2]. So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity\u201d\n\nSANS researchers warn that the group attempting to exploit the two vulnerabilities is also targeting configuration files and possibly CVE-2024-0305 (CVSS score: 5.3), likely exploiting a DVR vulnerability.\n\nSANS\u2019s advisory does not provide information about the identity or motivation of the attackers exploiting the two flaws.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, Cisco Smart Licensing Utility)",

He was accused of leaking sensitive information about India's Gaganyaan mission and other defense projects to Pakistan's ISI.The accused, Ravindra Kumar, was reportedly honey-trapped by an ISI handler named \u2018Neha\u2019 and had been leaking sensitive defence information for an extended period.Kumar was reportedly manipulated by a Pakistani agent posing as an ISRO officer named \"Neha Sharma\" on Facebook. Their interactions moved to WhatsApp, where the agent extracted classified information through chats and video calls.The data shared included details about drone manufacturing, ordnance production, and the Gaganyaan mission. Kumar allegedly received payments from unknown sources multiple times in exchange for this information.The investigation revealed a larger espionage network operated by ISI, utilizing AI-driven tools and call centers in cities like Lahore and Karachi. This network, known as \"Project Lioness,\" trains female spies for such operations.The Firozabad Ordnance Factory, which plays a crucial role in manufacturing parachutes for astronaut landings in the Gaganyaan mission, was compromised. Authorities are investigating the extent of the breach and its potential impact on national security.If convicted under the Official Secrets Act, Kumar could face up to 14 years in prison.This incident underscores the persistent threat of honeytrapping and the need for stringent cybersecurity measures.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nJohannes Ullrich of the SANS Internet Storm Center reported exploitation attempts this week against two critical Cisco vulnerabilities that were initially disclosed in September. CVE-2024-20439 is a static credential vulnerability in the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility, and CVE-2024-20440 is an information disclosure flaw in the utility.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the exploitation was successful, but Ullrich noted the static credential for CVE-2024-20439 was previously published by a security researcher and could be used to remotely access affected devices.\n\nUllrich told Cybersecurity Dive the exploitation attempts likely originate from a smaller botnet, with activity spiking over the last week.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe two CVEs affect a wide range of Cisco products, though the networking giant noted in its advisory that the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited unless the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility was started by a user and is actively running.\n\nIn his SANS Internet Storm Center post, Ullrich referred to CVE-2024-20439, the static credential vulnerability, as a \u201cbackdoor\u201d and warned that it offers easy access to vulnerable Cisco devices.\n\n\u201cThese two vulnerabilities are somewhat connected. The first one is one of the many backdoors Cisco likes to equip its products with. A simple fixed password that can be used to obtain access,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe second one is a log file that logs more than it should. Using the first vulnerability, an attacker may access the log file.\u201d\n\nUllrich noted that security researcher Nicholas Starke published a blog post with technical details about the two CVEs in September, including the static credential to exploit CVE-2024-20439. As a result, Ullrich said it's \"no surprise\" to see exploitation attempts.\n\nThe activity stems for a botnet that's also engaged in other attacks and scanning, Ullrich told Cybersecurity Dive. Internet Storm Center sensors detected around 10 bots in recent days, but he said there are likely more than what the sensors picked up.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the Cisco vulnerabilities, this botnet also scans for exposed secrets. For example backup files like /backup.gz that are sometimes left behind by careless administrators,\u201d he told Cybersecurity Dive. \"The bots that are part of this botnet have been scanning for a variety of vulnerabilities for a few weeks now.\"\n\nCybersecurity Dive contacted Cisco for comment regarding the reported exploitation attempts.",

It does go up and down at times, but from a venture capital standpoint, there\u2019s always money going into life sciences,\u201d said Simmons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long game that these investors are playing. It takes years and years to get a drug to market. So early-stage investments are always going on because people are always looking to try to find the next cure,\u201d he said.\n\nPTP\u2019s MSP niche in the life sciences and biotech industry is on purpose.\n\n\u201cAll the other large MSPs out there are sort of jack of all trades. They try to be everything to everyone,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cWe decided that life sciences was an industry that we could hyper-verticalize on and be really good at understanding the applications, the workflows and the business needs that these companies have to deliver highly curated solutions just to help them do work faster, which is trying to bring cures to market faster.\u201d",

            "content": "There\u2019s a reason why Cisco Meraki wants to expand its presence in Mexico City.\n\nWith a steady increase in local tech graduates, an abundance of IT hubs and governmental support of tech ventures, Mexico has both the resources and talent to solidify its place in the global tech industry \u2014 and Meraki wants to help the nation do just that from the heart of its bustling capital city.\n\n\u201cThis is a great time to work in tech and live in Mexico City,\u201d Meraki Technical Support Manager Chris Ruiz said. \u201cFor one, Mexico City is a buzzing tech hub, making it attractive for industry leaders and early-stage tech talent.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ruiz, the Mexico City office aims to fill several roles in network support engineering and is also searching for interns. The company\u2019s internship program, which is accessible for both university students and recent graduates, provides emerging talent with hands-on experience and offers them the opportunity to join the organization full time once the program is completed.\n\nRuiz said that interns and full-time employees can expect to step into an \u201cinspiring, fun and balanced\u201d environment when they come into the Mexico City office, which offers a recreational room, cafeterias and rooms for rest and relaxation. Besides that, the office is located near many restaurants, shops and other attractions, enabling employees to make the most of what the city has to offer.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the office that makes Meraki a great place to work in Mexico City. Network Support Engineer Sarah Lopez said that her teammates are always supportive and eager to help each other learn.\n\n\u201cWe collaborate and solve problems together,\u201d she shared. \u201cIf I need help, I always know that my team cares and has my back.\u201d\n\nRuiz echoed Lopez\u2019s statement, sharing that he loves the \u201cvery open and supportive\u201d culture he gets to work in.\n\n\u201cThere is a big emphasis on growth, development and collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work together to achieve our collective goals and evolve as a team.\u201d\n\nAbout Meraki Meraki is a cloud-managed IT company and leader in cloud-controlled Wi-Fi, routing and security. The company\u2019s intuitive platform enables organizations of all sizes to deliver customer and employee experiences at scale.\n\nThe Culture at the Meraki Mexico City Office\n\nMeraki strives to cultivate a culture in which everyone feels connected and empowered to deliver their best work, which is something that Network Support Engineer Pablo Ramirez has encountered firsthand.\n\n\u201cNo matter where we are, we\u2019re always happy to help one another troubleshoot an issue,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nThis culture is rooted in seven principles: flexibility, autonomy, collaboration, inclusion, simplicity, energy and humility. For Lopez, collaboration and humility resonate the most, reflected in the ways in which she and her peers work together every day.\n\n\u201cWe treat each other with respect and foster a comfortable environment to share perspectives and ask questions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe operate under the notion that we are all learning and approaching our work in various ways. There is no one way to do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe operate under the notion that we are all learning and approaching our work in various ways. There is no one way to do something.\u201d\n\nRamirez sees flexibility, autonomy and collaboration most vividly in his day-to-day work. He shared that he and his teammates can modify their schedules and prioritize projects and tasks when needed while working together to share resources, discuss issues and find solutions.\n\n\u201cOf course, we must be responsible and get our work done in a timely manner, but there is flexibility around how we schedule our day and manage our time,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cAdditionally, our team collaborates often \u2014 we share resources, discuss issues and solve problems together.\u201d\n\nRuiz added that he aims to uphold this culture through his own leadership approach, which prioritizes frequent and honest communication.\n\n\u201cI have an open-door policy \u2014 my team can always reach out and ask questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to schedule a meeting or ask permission to talk with me.\u201d\n\nSince joining the company nearly 13 years ago as a customer support engineer, Ruiz has learned what it takes to succeed and knows what the experience is like for people who are closer to the beginning of their career journey. That\u2019s why he strives to maintain close connections with those on his team.\n\n\u201cNow, as a Meraki manager, it\u2019s easy for me to sympathize with my team, help them work with customers, learn new technologies and get new certifications,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cConsidering this, my leadership approach will always involve being an active listener.\u201d\n\nWhat it Takes to Thrive at the Meraki Mexico City Office According to Ruiz, there are some skills job candidates will need to work out of the Meraki Mexico City office, such as the ability to speak both English and Spanish. While Mexico City-based team members work with many Spanish-speaking customers, the documentation they rely on is written in English, and most of their colleagues are located in the United States.\n\nHarnessing the \u2018Meraki Magic\u2019\n\nWhile there are many characteristics that define the culture at the Meraki Mexico City office, there\u2019s one underlying element that underpins it all \u2014 and it\u2019s called \u201cMeraki Magic.\u201d\n\nMeraki Magic can mean many different things. For Lopez, it\u2019s rooted in the company\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cMeraki products simplify our customers\u2019 processes and operations, enabling them to fulfill their mission,\u201d she said. \u201cMeraki Magic is all about developing intuitive technology that makes people\u2019s lives easier.\u201d\n\nIn Ramirez\u2019s mind, it comes down to the ways in which the company supports its customers.\n\n\u201cMeraki Magic shines through in our ability to provide excellent customer service to our clients and support them in achieving their goals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe approach troubleshooting with compassion and empathy \u2014 we genuinely care about our customers, and that\u2019s the magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe approach troubleshooting with compassion and empathy \u2014 we genuinely care about our customers, and that\u2019s the magic.\u201d\n\nAt Meraki, everyone has the opportunity to showcase their talents to the world. For Ruiz, having the chance to \u201caccomplish your greatest ambitions\u201d is what Meraki Magic is all about, reflected in the ways in which employees are encouraged to grow.\n\n\u201cWhen we have the support to reach our goals, we are better equipped to help our customers pursue their mission,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of success.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccycle of success\u201d is accessible to everyone who walks through the doors of the Meraki Mexico City office. Whether they\u2019re an intern or an experienced professional, everyone who decides to be a part of the company\u2019s expansion in Mexico will have ample opportunities to shape their own future \u2014 and the future of technology around the globe.",

            "content": "In a few years, Nvidia\u2019s annual GTC has transformed from a niche event into the eye of the AI storm. Expectations are high for 2025 as well. In this overview, we highlight the most important announcements from Nvidia itself and some of those from partners such as HPE, Cisco and Pure Storage.\n\nThere is no shortage of ambition over at \u201cTeam Green\u201d, as Nvidia is still known in the gaming circles which it was once exclusively active in. Nvidia announced not only new GPUs, but also 6G innovations, collaborations with Google, T-Mobile and General Motors, among others, a security system for self-driving cars, photonic network switches and newly open-sourced GPU libraries. On top of that, the previously announced Project DIGITS will be renamed DGX Spark and DGX Station, \u201cPersonal AI Computers\u201d (PAICs?) for developers, researchers and data scientists.\n\nFor a complete overview, visit Nvidia\u2019s site; unfortunately, we cannot give equal attention to all the announcements while writing this evening. We will focus on the most important and, for Nvidia, most lucrative product: Blackwell Ultra. Still, it should be said that we already know (and knew) its successor: Rubin, named after American astronomer Vera Rubin. Next, it appears, will be Rubin Ultra, and then Feynman, in honor of American physicist Richard Feynman. We will no doubt hear (and write) more about these successors at a later date, but first it\u2019s time to delve into Blackwell\u2019s second, more powerful phase of AI GPU horsepower.\n\nBlackwell Ultra\n\nBlackwell Ultra represents a significant improvement over its predecessor. A single B300 GPU delivers 1.5 times faster FP4 performance, though it requires 1,400 watts instead of 1,200 watts to do so. Memory per GPU has also increased by 50% to 288 GB, thanks to a 12-layer HBM3e stack rather than eight layers. Additionally, the system employs advanced water cooling, and ConnectX 8 network cards enhance interconnectivity. The optical modules have been upgraded from 800G to 1.6T networking. For power management, the NVL72 rack configuration features a standard capacitor tray, optional Battery Backup Units (BBU), and more than 300 super capacitors per rack. Furthermore, the GB300 combines a Grace CPU with the Blackwell Ultra GPU, marking the first server implementation of LPCAMM memory.\n\nThis will clearly be an expensive offering, to say the least. Although Nvidia doesn\u2019t mention a price, each super capacitor reportedly costs between $20,000 and $30,000. The NVL72, as mentioned, requires 300 of these. When you add the cost of Grace CPUs and massive Blackwell GPUs, you\u2019re looking at millions of dollars. Major hyperscalers and AI companies will likely order numerous nodes, while smaller AI startups and growing companies can afford only a handful at most. Additionally, Nvidia faces a backlog of Blackwell chips to deliver, partly due to design flaws in this generation. This delay will continue to be felt when Blackwell\u2019s successor, Rubin, arrives.\n\nNvidia actively encourages scaling beyond a few Blackwell Ultra nodes. Those requiring the fastest connectivity can now turn to photonic network switches: Spectrum-X Photonics. These should enable \u201cAI factories,\u201d or AI-focused data centers, to scale to millions of GPUs.\n\nHPE\n\nNvidia\u2019s hardware typically reaches customers through system integrators. This gives companies like HPE, Cisco, and Lenovo the opportunity to combine their solutions with the AI computing power of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra. HPE is introducing innovations that are both simple and scalable. One notable new product is the AI ModPod. This modular \u201cdata center-in-a-box\u201d should lead to three times faster deployment of AI infrastructure, taking months instead of years. It also brings the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) down to 1.1, significantly lower than the industry average of 2.0 and more ambitious targets such as Germany\u2019s requirement to be at or below 1.2 by July 1, 2026. Since a PUE lower than 1.0 is impossible, HPE is approaching a natural limit.\n\nAI workloads revolve around data, so storage improvements significantly impact overall performance and costs for organizations. Disaggregated storage\u2014storage that is separated from compute and scales independently\u2014is central to HPE Alletra Storage MP. HPE promises zero overprovisioning, 45 percent energy reduction, and 40 percent lower costs through their \u201cunified data services architecture.\u201d This is a critical component of the broader HPE Private Cloud AI, a combination of HPE and Nvidia solutions addressing all AI needs for organizations of any size.\n\nCisco\n\nAlong with HPE, Cisco has major AI announcements during GTC 2025. Their focus is on security with the Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA. A secure AI approach here encompasses more than just resistance to cyber attacks or downtime; compliance and reliability are equally important. A variety of Cisco solutions work across all AI layers, from Cisco\u2019s Hybrid Mesh Firewall (including Hypershield) to application security with Cisco AI Defense. High-performance storage from partners such as NetApp, Hitachi Vantara, VAST Data, and Pure Storage is combined with Nvidia\u2019s AI Enterprise suite for an optimal out-of-the-box AI platform.\n\nThe emphasis is clearly on simplicity. Ethernet networking via Nvidia\u2019s Spectrum-X cards makes deployment in existing data centers feasible, bridging the gap to an AI factory.\n\nPure Storage\n\nPure Storage also aims to integrate seamlessly with Nvidia\u2019s AI stack. Pure Storage FlashBlade arrays are now certified for the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, making this Pure Storage solution suitable for Nvidia Cloud Partner and enterprise deployments. We can assume that companies like CoreWeave and U.S. hyperscalers will now widely use Pure\u2019s offerings, where this wasn\u2019t previously the case.\n\nThe validated storage options achieve the same goal we mentioned with Cisco and HPE: simplicity on one hand and scalability on the other. For the largest AI workloads, this allows for plug-and-play deployment, including RAG and training on proprietary data.\n\n\u201cGPUs are fast becoming the driving force behind the next wave of AI innovation,\u201d emphasized Pure CEO Rob Lee. \u201cThe integration of the NVIDIA AI Data Platform into FlashBlade provides the AI-ready storage needed for optimal performance. Additionally, our recent NVIDIA certifications confirm that Pure Storage supports the pace and scale that AI models need to effect change. With our purpose-built storage solutions, enterprises can easily and efficiently leverage the power of AI to succeed.\u201d\n\nHP\n\nLooking beyond exascale data centers at the scalability of Nvidia\u2019s updated product line, we need to consider workstations and edge solutions, including those from HP. The most conventional variants are the ZBook Fury G1i and Z2 Tower G1i, a laptop and desktop with RTX PRO Blackwell GPUs, respectively. The ZBook Fury G1i features an RTX PRO 5000 Blackwell GPU paired with Intel Arrow Lake, while the Z2 Tower G1i includes an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU. The latter has an impressive VRAM capacity of 96GB. However, this video card requires a substantial 600 watts, which is offset by 88 percent performance improvements over the previous generation RTX PRO, Ada Lovelace.\n\nVAST Data\n\nNot just hardware vendors are expanding their capabilities with Nvidia. VAST Data is making its own VAST InsightEngine available for Nvidia DGX- and Nvidia-certified systems. This solution combines automated data capture, large-scale vector search, event-driven orchestration and GPU-optimized inferencing. In doing so, VAST Data promises to deliver enterprise-level security, with, as we hear more often during GTC, simplicity as the primary goal.\n\n\u201cEnterprises need AI solutions that are not just powerful but also simple to deploy and operate,\u201d said John Mao, Vice President, Strategic Alliances at VAST Data. \u201cAs part of the VAST Data Platform VAST InsightEngine with NVIDIA streamlines enterprise AI adoption, delivering a real-time, AI-native data platform that scales seamlessly while ensuring enterprise-grade security and cost efficiency.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Nvidia solidifies AI lead at GTC 2024 with Blackwell GPUs",

Oommen expects the first innovation from this alliance to come in this calendar year.\n\nFor Cisco, this alliance is a continuation of the strategy put in place several years ago to be more interoperable and open. Historically, Cisco has been accused of being closed and proprietary and keeping customers locked into their products.

Footnotes: Bresciani, Compagno, were warned.\n\nTRISSINO \u2013 Fooled with 19 seconds to go, when overtime seemed certain, at the end of a game played by a great team. Forte loses the Coppa Italia semifinal 4-3 and will therefore not be able to defend the title won in 2024. The pace is immediately very high with Lodi (3 fouls in just 3') on the attack and Forte fighting back. Forte takes the lead in the 5', when Najera knocks down Ambrosio in the center of the floor. It's a blue and a consequent direct shot that Ambrosio is parried by Grimalt, but the same attacker puts it back in the middle for the onrushing Pato Ipinazar who scores. Just 25'' and the equalizer is already served: assist by Giovannetti for Faccin who, from the center of the area diagonally, scores the 1-1. The balance is broken by Najera, with a diagonal in personal action, 5' from the siren but the first half is not over yet. Grimalt parries on Ambrosio, then Gnata responds to Compagno and, with 2' to go, Grimalt stops a Cisco Ipinazar free kick on the goal line that almost tears off the crossbar. The last, sensational, opportunity is for Lodi with Fernandes hitting the post on the counterattack. The start of the second half is less frenetic and in the 3rd minute Forte finds the 2-2 with a perfect penalty kicked by Torner. Gnata saves on Compagno and Faccin, then Grimalt responds on Torner and Cisco Ipinazar. Where the Lombard goalkeeper doesn't reach, the crossbar does the trick, parrying Pato Ipinazar's shot. With 6' to go, the law of 'a missed goal is a goal conceded' inevitably comes to the detriment of Forte. Great play by Torner for Rossi who from an excellent position shoots at Grimalt, on the counterattack Najera makes it 3-2. The game could have ended here but Grimalt, who had been amazing until then, deflected Torner's cross shot into his own net, making it 3-3. Overtime seemed inevitable, but the former Teammate found the decisive goal with a low diagonal. For Forte, who had also had another good chance with Torner 2' from the end, it was a mockery. \"Maybe we could have done better in the first half - Mirko De Gerone analyses on the spot - but what was missing in the first half we found in the second half. I can only say well done to the lads. We leave with our heads held high\".\n\nSergio Iacopetti",

            "content": "Free agency gives players a chance to get paid. Some waste no time getting new deals just hours after the tampering period starts, but others have to wait a bit longer. That's the case for several players who suited up for the Jacksonville Jaguars last year.\n\nWhile Evan Engram, Andre Cisco, and Mac Jones quickly found a home after becoming available, some of his former teammates are still waiting to get signed. With that in mind, here's a list of Jaguars free agents who haven't found a home yet.\n\nBrandon Scherff, offensive guard\n\nBrandon Scheff made five Pro Bowls with the Washington Commanders, so it wasn't surprising to see the Jags give him a top-market contract in 2022. However, he wasn't nearly as dominant in Jacksonville. That's why nobody batted an eye when he walked in free agency.\n\nWhile Scherff wasn't outright bad, he was just fine during his stint with the Jaguars. Add the fact that he's 33, and he may not garner interest unless a team suffers an injury at guard in the offseason.\n\nTim Jones, wide receiver\n\nAn undrafted free agent in 2021, Tim Jones spent his rookie campaign on special teams but managed to make the 53-man roster the following year after an impressive preseason. But as impressive as the former Southern Mississippi Golden Eagle was in preseason action, he barely got any playing time in 2022 and when he did, it was mostly as a blocker.\n\nJones routinely got his named called when injuries struck the past three years but isn't the kind of player that opposing coordinators will game plan for. Clubs that may want to bolster their special teams could reach out to him, but he'll need to wait a while to get that call.\n\nJosh Reynolds, wide receiver\n\nThroughout his career, Josh Reynolds has been a solid receiver. Last offseason, he signed a two-year deal with the Denver Broncos, but it looks like they weren't particularly impressed so they moved on from him midseason. The Jags quickly swooped in and signed him. However, he didn't do much of note, registering a measly one reception for 11 during his brief stint in Jacksonville.\n\nReynolds may need to try out in the offseason to get a job, and even then, there's no guarantee that he'll be on a roster come Week 1.\n\nRonald Darby, cornerback\n\nA dependable cornerback throughout his NFL career, Ronald Darby has dealt with injuries in recent years. But despite the medical flags, the Jgas took a flyer on him last year, giving a two-year deal to bolster their secondary. Surprisingly, the former Florida State Seminole managed to stay healthy in 2024. On the other hand, he struggled when he was on the field and eventually was benched.\n\nIt's possible that teams in need of depth at cornerback will eventually sign Darby, but nobody will be surprised if he remains unsigned a few months.\n\nCaleb Johnson, linebacker/special teams\n\nListed as a linebacker, Caleb Johnson carved a niche on special teams for the Jacksonville Jaguars. But given that there's a new regime in place, he was deemed expendable. Special teams coach Heath Farwell holds Johnson in high regard and would surely want to have him back. Having said that, the Jags will probably replenish their special team unit in the draft.\n\nCJ Beathard, quarterback\n\nTrevor Lawrence routinely credited fellow quarterback C.J. Beathard for helping him prepare for game day. But other than that, he didn't bring much to the table. Ideally, you would want your backup to come in and keep the team afloat. However, the Jags didn't appear to be confident in Beathard back in 2023. That year, No. 16 dealt with a myriad of ailments but pushed through.\n\nThen, Jacksonville traded for Mac Jones and Beathard became the No. 3 on the depth chart. Had Lawrence not gotten hurt last year, the team wouldn't have brought back Beathard. Maybe he'll join a quarterback-needy team in training camp, but it's hard to see the former Iowa Hawkeye making a 53-man roster in 2025. A practice squad may be a more realistic goal.\n\nDe'Shaan Dixon, defensive tackle\n\nBack in 2022, De'Shaan Dixon turned heads because he made the 53-man roster as an undrafted free agent. However, he hasn't done much of note since then, even after switching positions. In fact, he's only appeared in three regular-season games the past three years, all as a rookie. That's not the kind of statline that inspires confidence.\n\nJosiah Deguara, tight end\n\nA movable chess piece with the Green Bay Packers, Josiah Deguara had an uneventful season with the Jaguars in 2024. In 15 games, he only hauled in three passes. Sure, Evan Engram, Brenton Strange, and Luke Farrell were ahead of him on the depth chart, but he never did anything to warrant more snaps.\n\nDevin Duvernay, return specialist\n\nA two-time special teamer and a viable target in the passing game during his four seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, Devin Duvernay signed a two-year deal with the Jags in 2024. Expected to give the return game a spark, he was underwhelming on special teams and as a receiver. To nobody's surprise, he was released ahead of free agency.\n\nEsezi Otomewo, defensive tackle\n\nEsezi Otomewo flashed in the preseason, which is why the made the team last year. But like most players on this list, once the regular season came, he was a non-factor. He was a healthy scratch throughout most of the year and didn't record a single stat. That won't help him find a new team soon.\n\nJoe Giles-Harris, linebacker\n\nA familiar face, Joe Giles-Harris had his second team in Jacksonville last year after being traded. Mostly a contributor on special teams, he didn't play a single snap on defense. The veteran linebacker will need to compete for a roster spot in training camp.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

            "content": "Why CEOs are calm about tariffs in public \u2014 but 'very discouraged' in private\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nWall Street is panic-selling over President Trump's chaotic new tariffs. Business executives are reportedly making frantic calls to the White House. And on Tuesday, the country's top CEOs crowded into a closed-door meeting with Trump \u2014 setting a record for attendance.\n\nYet in public, corporate America's leaders are remaining calm \u2014 and even upbeat.\n\n\"The business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nSolomon acknowledged that companies \"always\" want lower tariffs. But he was also careful to start his comments by praising Trump for being \"engaged with the business community\" \u2014 unlike, he added, the Biden administration.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO was speaking a day after Trump met with him and other members of the Business Roundtable, an influential CEO group. The meeting followed two days of sharp losses in the U.S. stock market, in a $4 trillion (and ongoing) selloff, largely kindled by Trump's words and actions: Since early March, Trump has implemented a flurry of steep new tariffs, reversed some of them, and shrugged off concerns over their economic impact.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump demurred \u2014 in a reply that sparked this week's market turmoil.\n\n\"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America,\" the president told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\nBy mid-week, a handful of the most powerful CEOs had started to express concern \u2014 but even then, only in very mild terms.\n\n\"Uncertainty is not a good thing,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank, said Wednesday at a conference hosted by the publication Semafor.\n\nAnd Larry Fink, who runs investment giant BlackRock, told CNN that \"the economy is weakening as we speak.\"\n\nYet Fink was also quick to add that the Trump administration's policies \"can be very productive for the United States\" in the long run.\n\nA White House spokesperson on Thursday reiterated his statement to NPR from earlier this week.\n\n\"President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said by email.\n\n\n\nWhy America's business leaders engage in delicate diplomacy\n\nCorporate America's careful rhetoric \u2014 even as many big companies brace for the impact of the market volatility and the tariffs \u2014 illustrates the delicate diplomacy that business leaders are trying to engage in. They largely welcome Trump's other economic promises \u2014 including lower taxes and fewer regulations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBusiness leaders also see limited benefits to criticizing the president in public, experts say. That's a marked contrast from Trump's first term, when some CEOs publicly resigned from White House advisory councils to protest the president's handling of racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nBut eight years later, corporate America is much less willing to wade into public conversations about politics \u2014 or \"social\" issues that companies don't see as directly related to their bottom lines.\n\nToday, they're more focused on the potential financial upsides of Trump's new term. The president actively courted business interests during his campaign \u2014 and at first, corporate America seemed thrilled with the results of the election. CEO confidence soared to a three-year high last month, according to the Conference Board's quarterly survey of the CEOs of the largest companies.\n\nNow Trump's stop-and-start tariff policies seem to be complicating many companies' economic outlook. But business leaders are trying to avoid adding to investors' financial panic, according to Anna Tavis, who chairs New York University's department of human-capital management and talks to executives across corporate America.\n\nShe points out that part of a CEO's job is to project confidence \u2014 in their own companies, in the markets and in the broader economy.\n\n\"They have no control over what the government is going to do, regardless of how they feel,\" says Tavis.\n\nAnd, she adds: \"Obviously, they want to be on the winning side of whatever happens.\"\n\n\n\n80% of CEOs are \"apologizing to our international partners\"\n\nBehind the scenes, the conversation is more candid. CEOs \"are very discouraged,\" says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who hosted a gathering of CEOs on Tuesday.\n\n80% of those CEOs say \"that they find themselves apologizing to our international partners for Trump's capriciousness,\" Sonnenfeld told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday.\n\nAnd, he added, \"roughly 70% said the Trump administration is going to be bad for the economy.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose numbers are a sharp contrast to the Conference Board's rosier findings last month. It regularly polls the heads of the largest U.S. companies, and it finished its latest survey on February 10 \u2014 after Trump had first announced, then first delayed, his new 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"I know people were surprised that we saw this increase in CEO confidence at the time that tariffs may [start to] have a negative impact on the economy,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, told NPR last week.\n\nMany of the CEOs surveyed in late January and early February did tell the Conference Board that they're worried about tariffs, she added. But at the time, business leaders said they were more focused on Trump's other, business-friendlier promises, including deregulation and lower taxes.\n\nStill, Guichard is curious to see what CEOs tell the Conference Board in two months, when it next polls America's business leaders.\n\n\"A lot can happen between now and May,\" she says.",

A situation that could lead the coach to evaluate new solutions tactics to overcome theemergency in midfield. Because Torrasi is suspended, Bartolomei is struggling with a muscle injury that will keep him out for a few weeks and Broh, already absent with Torres, will most likely remain out for another time.\n\nOn paper, Giunti, Joselito and Agosti remain. A very young midfield for the match that precedes the derby with Ternana.\n\nIn addition to midfield there is the question attack, with Seghetti still out of the loop and Montevago who could at most snatch a call-up to the bench, given that he was on the pitch on Wednesday while yesterday he wasn't. In defense, however, there is good news because Angella and Lewis can also return to the circle of those called up and give further opportunities to the Grifo coach. But what will be the choices to challenge Legnago Salus, a team that is last in the standings, but in a positive phase? It is likely that the coach will return to a four-man defense, with Leo in the ballot with Mezzoni on the right, Amoran and one between Riccardi and Dell'Orco in the center and Giraudo on the left. Cangelosi could choose a 4-2-3-1, with Giunti and Joselito in the center and three prompters behind the attack. Cisco, Matos and Lisi could be candidates behind one between Kanoute and Marconi. Or the coach could play the three midfielders at the start and opt to confirm the three-man defense (3-5-2) in case he considers this solution the best while waiting for the goal. Because, with Grifo struggling in front of goal, solidity counts in the meantime.",

            "content": "The New York Jets\u2019 signing of cornerback Brandon Stephens has come under scrutiny for its questionable value. However, their other defensive back signing is arguably their best value move of 2025 thus far. Comparing these two contracts and players side-by-side illustrates how teams should and should not play the bargain-hunting game in free agency.\n\nNew York scooped up former Jaguars safety Andre Cisco on a reasonable one-year, $10 million contract. Similar to Stephens, Cisco is a 2021 third-round pick who was on the rise in 2023 but took a step back in 2024. The Jets are betting that their coaching staff can help these players return to their previous heights.\n\nHowever, Cisco\u2019s contract is a fair cost for this type of flyer. The Jets enjoy the upside of a potential return to form without hampering their long-term cap. That is how players of this ilk should be handled. Contrarily, Stephens is on a three-year, $36 million deal with $23 million guaranteed. If he doesn\u2019t work out, the Jets will suffer the consequences down the line.\n\nCisco\u2019s $10 million salary ranks 16th among safeties, per Over The Cap. This price is in accordance with the ceiling Cisco has displayed. Stephens\u2019 peak level of play in the NFL is also in accordance with his salary; however, unlike Stephens, who only played up to his contract in one of his four career seasons, Cisco had a two-year peak from 2022-23 that warrants the salary New York gave him. His body of work suggests that his down year in 2024 has a higher chance of being a fluke he will rebound from than Stephens.\n\nAdditionally, Stephens (27) is over two years older than Cisco (turns 25 on March 23). If either of them deserved a long-term deal, it\u2019s Cisco.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 lack of flashy, lucrative signings in free agency is admirable. It is a major positive that they have avoided recklessly throwing money at big-name players. This franchise has dug itself in deep holes by chasing names instead of embracing smart team-building. However, their lack of blockbuster moves does not automatically indicate that every signing they have made is an ideal fit for the economical approach they have elected to take. Cisco fits it perfectly, while Stephens is an overly risky attempt at the same route.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s dive deeper into Cisco\u2019s profile to understand why he is such an enticing value signing for his contract.\n\nAndre Cisco: High-upside ball-hawking free safety\n\nCisco is a pure free safety. He has lined up as a deep safety on 71% of his career defensive snaps, per Pro Football Focus, which is a very high rate for the position.\n\nFor a player in this role, the most coveted trait is ball-hawking. Can you cover large swaths of grass to make plays on the ball?\n\nCisco has shown a high ceiling in this area. He was one of the NFL\u2019s best ball hawks at the safety position from 2022-23.\n\nFrom 2022-23, Cisco tied for fourth among safeties with seven interceptions. In both seasons, he had more interceptions than touchdowns allowed, posting a 2:3 TD:INT ratio in 2022 and a 2:4 ratio in 2023. Over this span, the only other safeties with 7+ interceptions and at least three fewer TDs allowed than INTs were Jessie Bates (6:10), C.J. Gardner-Johnson (4:7), Kerby Joseph (5:8), and Geno Stone (2:7).\n\nInterceptions are a tricky stat. Sometimes, players luck into bogus interceptions that do not tell you much about their individual talent. Whether it\u2019s off a tip by a teammate, an arm punt, or a horrendous throw to a defender standing still, many interceptions are not actually created by the player who secures them.\n\nCisco, though, has shown the ability to make interceptions happen. He boasts an impressive interception reel that displays his blend of instincts, closing speed, and ball skills. On most of his career picks, he read the quarterback, anticipated the throw, drove on the route, and made a strong catch.\n\nOn the strength of his ball-hawking skills, Cisco ranked as one of the league\u2019s better safeties in coverage from 2022-23 despite occasionally allowing some big plays. Here are his coverage rankings in each season among safeties to play at least 300 coverage snaps:\n\n2022 (out of 75): 87.7 passer rating allowed (30th), 68.0 PFF coverage grade (34th)\n\n87.7 passer rating allowed (30th), 68.0 PFF coverage grade (34th) 2023 (out of 76): 83.9 passer rating allowed (29th), 71.5 PFF coverage grade (20th)\n\nProviding two full seasons of above-average overall coverage efficiency along with upper-echelon on-ball production, Cisco\u2019s 2022-23 peak is easily worth a $10 million salary as an under-25 safety in an exploding free agent market.\n\nIn 2024, Cisco took a step back in coverage. He jumped to career-highs in yards allowed (370), yards per reception allowed (19.5), and touchdowns allowed (3) while only grabbing one interception. Cisco dropped to 50th out of 73 safeties in PFF\u2019s coverage grade (56.7) and 61st in passer rating allowed (125.7).\n\nThe down year must be taken into account when evaluating Cisco. However, at just 25 years old with two of his last three seasons being up to par with his $10 million salary in 2025, Cisco has good odds of justifying the Jets\u2019 investment.\n\nIn fact, it would have made sense for the Jets to sign Cisco to a multi-year contract at this salary. Even off a down year, it would be a reasonable investment considering his age and body of work. Perhaps Cisco pushed for the one-year deal to try and get his value back up and cash in with a multi-year deal for a much higher salary in 2026.\n\nStill, Cisco is an excellent low-risk, high-reward pickup by Darren Mougey. This is an exemplary display of buying low on a player. New York is getting someone with great upside for the price and a relatively strong chance of fulfilling that upside.",

[Related: AWS Launches New Agentic AI For Bedrock, \u2018The Next Frontier In Computing\u2019] At the same time, cutting edge agentic AI technology is taking automation to \u201cjust a whole other level,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is not going to take your job. Somebody that knows AI might take your job. That\u2019s probably what we\u2019re going to see playing out,\u201d said Keblusek. Keblusek is the longtime CTO of Sentinel Technologies, a top-notch cybersecurity, AI, networking, cloud and services specialist. The Downers Grove, Ill.-based solution provider was named to CRN\u2019s 2025 Security 100 list, which highlights some of the world\u2019s best MSPs with cloud-based security services. Sentinel has strategic partnerships with the likes of Cisco, Microsoft, Broadcom-VMware and Dell Technologies. In an interview with CRN, Keblusek explains what Sentinel is doing for Broadcom-VMware customers worried about price increases, his bets on Cisco and Microsoft security, and Sentinel\u2019s AI and agentic AI strategy in 2025.\n\nSentinel is a longtime VMware partner. With Broadcom changing VMware\u2019s portfolio and prices, what are you hearing from your Broadcom-VMware customers? You\u2019ve got customers asking what their options are to leave because their price has gone up as they\u2019ve repackaged their licenses and offers. There was obviously the disruption with our customers where: they wanted to renew, they\u2019re were use to a certain price, and now they have to buy VCF (VMware Cloud Foundation) or VvF (VMware vSphere Foundation) or some different bundling where they\u2019re getting additional capabilities that they\u2019re not using, but they\u2019re also being charged more than they were used to in the past. That created quite a bit of a stir. So we actually developed a workshop to run through all the value that VMware Broadcom was bringing to the customer, as well as what alternatives might be of interest. What we ultimately found is everybody wanted to keep VMware, but they wanted to get their price down. So we more recently developed a workshop of, \u2018How do you adopt some of these great capabilities that you\u2019re getting now? And how do we optimize your data center for the spend?\u2019 Because a lot of our customers had really over provisioned things because they could. There wasn\u2019t really a subscription penalty. They were buying additional hardware. Now, that\u2019s coming back to bite them a little bit. So we\u2019re having the right size and having to look at even more modern server platforms with higher processing power to potentially reduce cores, but then they\u2019ll adopt VCF and all the capabilities and really build private clouds that are AI ready.\n\nAs a leading Cisco security partner, how is Sentinel\u2019s Cisco business? Cisco doubled down on security a few years back and we\u2019re really starting to see the return on that. Our security growth was up triple-digits last year. It\u2019s been fantastic. They\u2019ve got some excellent leadership that they\u2019ve brought in a few years back and we\u2019re starting to see the products form. Really the conversation around their overall platform has been resonating with the market. Some of their new releases like Cisco\u2019s XDR and their secure access are outstanding. We\u2019ve had a lot of customer interest to either move from other platforms to Cisco XDR, or adopt and replace things like traditional VPN services and cloud access services with a more unified platform from Cisco. So it\u2019s been really, really strong on the security side of things. We\u2019ve seen a big push forward with Cisco, but also with Microsoft. Microsoft is one of our biggest growing practices and a lot of it is around security. A lot of its around Modern Work and Copilot as well. We\u2019ve seen a big uptick in Microsoft\u2019s XDR, Modern Workplace, some of the AI capabilities and security to really leverage the same things that the bad actors are leveraging to attack you, so you can detect and stop them more closer to real time than ever before. Is CEO Chuck Robbins the right person to lead Cisco in the AI era? For us, what Chuck\u2019s done has been excellent. Some of his leadership like Cisco\u2019s [Chief Product Officer] Jeetu Patel has brought some innovation back. He\u2019s got a great team under him as well. That\u2019s where you start to see their security story really tightening up and resonating now over some of the moves that Chuck was orchestrating over the past number of years. Financially, they\u2019re doing fairly well. They went through their big Splunk acquisition. Overall, the execution is good. We\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits today.\n\nWhat is Sentinel\u2019s strategy for AI agents or agentic AI in 2025? AI, generative AI and agentic AI are all big bets for Sentinel. I\u2019ve actually got a team under me in my office of innovation that focuses exclusively now on AI, both internally and externally. We call it our Fusion AI strategy. It\u2019s really about being the thought leaders with our customers to talk about and education on. So we need to educate them on AI because everybody\u2019s curious. But if you\u2019re a manufacturer or you\u2019re in healthcare, it\u2019s not your everyday job to stay up to speed. So we help our customers bridge that gap with our knowledge. We also partner with Gartner. So we\u2019re having constant communications with them in what they\u2019re seeing in the market from the thousands of customers they talk to on a regular basis. Then we\u2019re also using a lot of use cases our own, where we\u2019ve developed things internally or we\u2019ve developed things for customers, as well as industry use cases that we see in the market to have conversations with our customers on how they might adopt AI. Agentic is starting to surface, where you\u2019re going to start to see the automation make of the decision making and taking action. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re also on top of and talking to our customers about. Customers are adopting generative AI and even traditional AI right now. They\u2019re starting to do POCs. And the POCs are really moving from the art-of-the-possible into business ready platforms.",

Located near Aylesford Lake, Nova Scotia, it's the first facility of its kind in Atlantic Canada and one of the largest pediatric camps in the country. Since 2011, it has hosted thousands of children aged 7-18 who are living with chronic health conditions like Crohn's Disease, cancer, and heart issues. Others face life challenges like the death of a close family member.\n\nThe camp offers specialized services and support to ensure a great learning and growth experience.\n\n\"We bring kids and youth going through similar challenges together,\" said Malcolm Elliot, Brigadoon Village's camp director, \"so they can have fun, meet others going through the same experiences who understand them on a deep level, and build community and support systems.\"\n\nToday, around 700 children pass through each summer. And as one happy parent shared, \"I can't imagine my child's life without the experience of camp.\"\n\nBut as Brigadoon Village CEO Krista Ballem stressed, creating that great experience demands solid, secure network connections.\n\n\"This is a beautiful but somewhat remote location,\" she said. \"Our kids, parents, staff and health professionals need to know they are connected -- and that our organization will run smoothly and efficiently.\"\n\nCisco volunteers step in\n\nThat's where two enterprising and compassionate Cisco employees - Todd Greenlaw and Andrew McCracken - have made a real difference, by contributing their time, expertise, and Cisco Meraki networking technology.\n\nThe two stepped in during the pandemic, when the camp secured funding for a long-overdue physical renovation. But beyond its structures, the network was sorely out of date.\n\n\"Their connectivity was really spotty,\" explained Greenlaw, who is a Cisco engineer based in Halifax. \"They had tried dial-up and point-to-point wireless, which didn't work very well. And they even tried satellite for a while. But they're in a very remote area, and consistent connectivity was a real problem.\"",

For is efforts, Pro Football Focus only graded him the 70th best safety in the NFL with a 58.8 overall mark.\n\nHowever, Cisco has other positive seasons under his belt which New York head coach Aaron Glenn is probably looking more into. The defensive back had four interceptions in 2023 alone.\n\nThe Jets entered the spring low on numbers at the safety position, so a signing was not a surprise. Cisco should see a good opportunity to land a starting position in New York because of that.\n\nCisco agreeing to terms comes after cornerback Brandon Stephens was added earlier on during the first day of free agency.\n\nJets Wire will continue to provide updates throughout the 2025 offseason.",

            "content": "On the unofficial first day of free agency, the New York Jets reportedly have a deal in place with safety Andre Cisco to a one-year, $10 million deal. The New York native is one of the first signings of this new Jets regime. Cisco was born in New York and played High School ball on Long Island. Cisco was a star at Syracuse and was drafted in the third round by Jacksonville in 2021.\n\nAndre Cisco has agreed to a 1-year $10 million contract with the NY Jets. Deal negotiated by Andre Odom and David Mulugheta of Athletes First. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 11, 2025\n\nJets to Sign Andre Cisco\n\nAndre Cisco is only 24 years old and has eight career interceptions. 2024 was a down year for him after massive breakout seasons in 2022 and 2023. Cisco was one of the league\u2019s top ballhawks in that two-year stretch. He totaled seven interceptions and 15 passes defended.\n\nCisco started as a backup and quickly earned his role as a starter in the Jaguars\u2019 defense. His range and ball-hawking ability are his bread and butter. Cisco has been a durable player throughout his career so far, playing in 63 games over his four years in the league. His talent is undeniable, and he is capable of making a big impact. The Jets are betting on him returning to form and becoming a solid contributor again. The one-year deal he received can be a good opportunity to prove he is what he was in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHow will Cisco fit in the Jets\u2019 defense?\n\nPractically the entire Jets safety room hit free agency this offseason, leaving a massive hole. Head coach Aaron Glenn prioritizes the safety position and relies on them to make plays in the back end of the defense, so Cisco will be a key piece.\n\nCisco, at his best, is a rangy, deep safety. In 2024, he was asked by the Jaguars\u2019 staff to put on weight to play closer to the line of scrimmage. He struggled in 2024, as most of the Jaguars\u2019 defense did. In New York, he will go back to being the coverage, deep third-type safety. He will be let loose and will be able to roam in the back end of the defense. His speed will be key. Cisco instantly becomes the most talented player in the group, and his coverage ability will be important.\n\nIn Detroit, Aaron Glenn was able to help develop safeties like Kerby Joseph. Joseph had a massive year, totaling nine interceptions. The Jets could see Cisco filling this type of role and benefiting from playing under the coaching staff. If Cisco can get back to playing like he did two years ago, this deal will look like a major steal.\n\nCisco will join a talented Jets defense and will have the opportunity to fill in a gap to complete the unit. He will have opportunities to take the ball away with the talent playing in front of him, and he will be able to play his style of football. Cisco can be a premier ball hawk in this league as he showcased two seasons ago. He\u2019s also only 24 and has room to grow and become a complete player. The Jets got better by adding Andre Cisco, and the retooling of this defense has begun.\n\nMain Image: Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images",

Cisco is just 24 years old, has over 3,200 career defensive snaps, and has good ball production with eight interceptions and 13 pass breakups. Those are all reasons why other teams will be interested in signing him.\n\nHowever, the reason that he could choose to bet on himself with a one-year deal somewhere is that his market may not be as strong as hoped. As the deep safety, big plays were an issue for the Jaguars' defense last season. Cisco surrendered 19.5 yards per reception, according to PFF, and as a collective unit, the Jaguars' secondary gave up 23 pass plays of 30-plus yards last season--the second-most in the NFL.\n\n\"He\u2019s another one who\u2019s played in a bunch of different systems, and different roles, and has a lot of talent that may still be mined in the right situation,\" wrote Breer.\n\nWhether Cisco returning to Jacksonville is still in the cards remains to be seen. Both sides could be looking for a fresh start. However, on a short-term deal, a reunion does make some sense.\n\nAs Breer mentions, Cisco has experience in a variety of systems and that versatility will be an important part of Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme. In addition to that, on a short-term deal, Cisco can provide the Jaguars with a veteran option at the position as they look to reshape that free safety spot.",

Today, Mark Phibbs believes agencies need to step up as strategic partners, bringing fresh thinking to the table while in-house teams take ownership of execution.\n\nPhibbs is clear that agencies need to evolve from being execution partners into becoming \u201cideas factories.\u201d While traditional agency models involved handling everything for a brand \u2013 briefing, strategy, execution and creative \u2013 he sees a shift happening. \u201cIn the past, agencies did everything for us,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d give them a brief for a campaign and they\u2019d handle it all. But marketing has changed. We now have multi-channel complexity and the days of taking months to create a campaign are over. You need to be able to turn around a video in a day.\u201d\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nTo stay competitive, at Cisco, where he was vice-president of global campaign, content and industries marketing until November 2024, he moved much of the company\u2019s content creation in-house. \u201cMarketers need to move quickly and the best way to do that is with an in-house creative team that\u2019s skilled with Adobe tools and can respond in real-time,\u201d he explains. \u201cMarketing today is social-first. Job one is to win on social.\u201d\n\nSo, where do agencies fit into this new model? \u201cI look for agencies to be ideas factories. They should be a second set of brains. Smart people who can review what we\u2019re doing and bring fresh perspectives.\u201d He highlights social transformation agency 1000Heads as a strong example of a strategic partner. \u201cIt is brilliant at thinking strategically. That\u2019s what I value in an agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy agencies can\u2019t just execute any more\n\nThe shift towards in-house marketing capabilities doesn\u2019t mean agencies are becoming obsolete \u2013 it means they need to offer something different. Phibbs believes that in a world where speed is crucial, marketing teams must own creative execution. \u201cThe days of waiting weeks or months for a piece of creative to be developed externally are over,\u201d he says. \u201cAt Cisco, we built internal teams that can create video content, social assets and campaign materials on demand. That\u2019s the future of marketing.\u201d\n\nBut agencies still have a critical role to play, especially in challenging in-house teams to think differently. \u201cI expect agencies to bring bold, innovative thinking. I want them to tell me what we haven\u2019t thought about. I don\u2019t need an agency to execute standard campaigns. I need them to bring ideas we wouldn\u2019t have come up with on our own.\u201d\n\nPhibbs also believes that agencies must be adaptable. \u201cAgencies that cling to old ways of working \u2013 slow, bureaucratic processes \u2013 will struggle to survive. Agility is everything now. The ability to pivot quickly, adjust messaging in real-time and react to cultural moments is what separates the best agencies from the rest.\u201d\n\nInsights and analytics\n\nPhibbs is passionate about marketing teams taking ownership of data and insights. \u201cMost marketing organizations don\u2019t invest enough in insights. They might have 1% or 2% of their team dedicated to it. But marketing needs to understand the data better than any other function. We are the ones who engage with customers the most through digital channels, websites and social media. We should know what content resonates best and why.\u201d\n\nThat means agencies must align with a brand\u2019s data-driven approach. \u201cI don\u2019t want an agency telling me what it \u2018feels\u2019 will work \u2013 I want it to show me data-backed insights. An agency that can interpret data and turn it into creative ideas is invaluable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChallenges facing CMOs\n\nWith the average tenure of a CMO now being little more than 18 months, Phibbs acknowledges that marketing leaders are under intense pressure from the C-suite and have limited time to make an impact. \u201cSmart CMOs realize they have limited time, so they better be willing to take risks. If you\u2019re not brave in your marketing, you\u2019ve got no chance of success. The most dangerous thing a CMO can do today is play it safe.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, marketing budgets continue to shrink, forcing leaders to do more with less. \u201cMarketing budgets are always under pressure, but that has accelerated in recent years,\u201d says Phibbs. At the same time, technology and artificial intelligence are rapidly transforming the industry. \u201cUnderstanding AI, identifying real use cases and demonstrating cost savings or customer experience benefits is critical.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge, though, is proving marketing\u2019s value to the business. \u201cMarketing needs to be able to show its impact. At Cisco, we made great progress in linking engaged demand to revenue. We could prove that customers who engage deeply with our marketing spend more money with us.\u201d\n\nAs president of the jury for The Drum Marketing Awards APAC, Phibbs says he is keen to see entries that really push the boundaries of what marketing can be. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking for genuine creative chops \u2013 campaigns that take an innovative approach and break through the clutter. There\u2019s so much noise in our lives today. Marketers need to think about how they can stand out and differentiate their brands.\u201d\n\nAnd beyond creativity, Phibbs wants to see measurable business impact. \u201cWhat\u2019s the return on investment of the campaign? Did it achieve its strategic intent? And how did it leverage different elements of the marketing mix?\u201d\n\nWith a career including marketing leadership roles at four of the world\u2019s most influential and innovative tech brands \u2013 IBM, Microsoft, Adobe and Cisco \u2013 Phibbs sees judging The Drum Awards for Marketing as an opportunity to contribute to the next generation of marketers. \u201cI\u2019m towards the later end of my marketing career and I love giving back. I do guest lecturing at universities and I think it\u2019s our role as senior marketers to share our knowledge and help younger marketers move forward.\u201d\n\nFor Phibbs, judging is also a huge learning opportunity. \u201cI always walk away with new ideas. There\u2019s always something to learn. No one has all the answers and the best marketers are those who stay open to new ways of thinking.\u201d\n\nThe future of agency partnerships\n\nPhibbs is clear about where he sees the future of agency-brand relationships going. \u201cB2B marketing is having a moment right now. And I think it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\u201d For agencies, that means evolving to become strategic partners rather than simply creative service providers. \u201cThe best agencies are the ones that challenge CMOs, bring fresh thinking and help CMOs navigate complexity. Marketing is faster, more data-driven and more creative than ever before. Agencies that embrace that shift will thrive.\u201d\n\nWith leaders like Phibbs pushing the industry forward, the expectations of agencies are higher than ever. The challenge for agencies today is to step up, be bold and embrace the role of the ideas factory.",

            "content": "The Jets are in line to have a complete reset at their safety positions in 2025, and it looks like they\u2019ll start by signing former Jaguars safety Andre Cisco. According to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, Cisco and the Jaguars have come to an agreement on a one-year, $10MM contract.\n\nA former third-round pick out of Syracuse, Cisco made himself a key part of the Jaguars secondary as a rookie in 2021. He slowly took over the job as a starter from Andrew Wingard that season before establishing himself as a full-time starter. Cisco\u2019s best two seasons came in 2022 and 2023, in which he started all 30 games he appeared in and racked up 15 passes defensed and seven interceptions for 136 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIn those two seasons, Cisco graded just above average, according to Pro Football Focus (subscription required). The analytics site ranked him as the 39th-best safety out of 88 graded players in 2022 and the 34th-best out of 95 in 2023. The 2024 NFL season saw a decline in analytics and production for Cisco, as PFF ranked him the 70th-best safety of 98 players graded at the position. Statistically, he only logged one interception to go along with seven passes defensed.\n\nNew York will be willing to disregard a down year likely based on Cisco\u2019s youth. At only 24 years old, Cisco already has 47 starts under his belt and has shown he can be effective. The Jets will hope to see that potential turn back into production in 2025. With Chuck Clark, Tony Adams, Ashtyn Davis, and Jalen Mills all hitting the free agent market from New York this offseason, Cisco immediately becomes a crucial addition to the roster.\n\nThe Jaguars, on the other hand, have already filled the vacancy left by Cisco, as they\u2019ve reportedly reached a deal to acquire former Texans safety Eric Murray. Murray will team up with Darnell Savage and Antonio Johnson to fill out the back end of Jacksonville\u2019s secondary.",

            "content": "Throughout the offseason, safety has been brought up as a need for the Jacksonville Jaguars. This is understandable when you take into account that they were beaten deep last year. Then again, you could make the case that it wasn't due to a lack of talent but rather inadequate coaching. If that's the case, the Jags should consider bringing back Andre Cisco. However, signs point toward the former Syracuse Orangeman weighing in his options in free agency.\n\nAlbert Breer recently shared lots of tidbits ahead of free agency and says that Cisco will explore the possibility of signing a one-year, prove-it deal if he hits the open market.\n\n\"Another guy who could sign a one-year deal with an eye on bigger things in 2026 would be Jaguars S Andre Cisco. He\u2019s another one who\u2019s played in a bunch of different systems, and different roles, and has a lot of talent that may still be mined in the right situation.\"\n\nCisco earned a reputation as a ballhawk in college, registering 14 passes defensed and 13 interceptions in 24 games. However, injuries in back-back-to-back seasons hurt his stock, and he fell to the third round in 2021. The New York Queens managed to stay healthy but spent most of his rookie campaign on the sidelines. When he was given a shot, he made the most of it.\n\nBy 2022, Cisco had joined the starting lineup and proved to be the playmaker the Jags expected, registering a combined seven interceptions and 15 passes defensed the next two years. However, he struggled both defending the run and dropping in coverage last season.\n\nLooking back, Cisco must shoulder some of the blame for his dip in performance. That said, the defense was held back by Ryan Nielsen, who rubbed players the wrong way with his arrogant demeanor. His inadequate coaching surely played a role in his unit's underwhelming play.\n\nThat's why Cisco, who was dubbed a breakout candidate in 2024, could bounce back next season. But because he's coming off a somewhat down year, he'll need to bet on himself.\n\nRelated story: Updated cap space and draft picks for the Jaguars in 2025\n\nShould the Jaguars re-sign Andre Cisco\n\nYou should always expect the unexpected when it comes to the NFL. This is to say that it doesn't look like the Jacksonville Jaguars will re-sign Andre Cisco, but deadlines spur actions and could get a deal done before March 12, the day free agency officially starts. On the other hand, there's a chance he will leave in free agency, and if that's the case, they'll need to look for another starting safety.\n\nJevon Holland is probably the Jags' top option to replace Cisco because of his familiarity with defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile. Tre'vor Moerigh and Cam Bynum would be other options in case they miss on Holland.\n\nIt's worth noting that signing any of them will probably be more expensive than bringing back Cisco. Then again, the team's brass may have already decided isthat Cisco isn't a fit and are ready to move in a different direction.\n\nIn the end, both the Jaguas and Cisco could benefit from a fresh start. If he gets it, he could at last the player he was expected to be in Jacksonville.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

Cisco\u2019s first integrated offering, the Smart Switch with Cisco Hypershield, introduces a new approach to securing AI data centers by fusing security directly into the network fabric.\n\nUtilizing programmable AMD Pensando data processing units (DPUs), the switch enables data centers with a faster, more flexible and more secure network infrastructure that is needed to meet the increasing demands of AI workloads.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs AI workloads multiply, building and managing data centers has become much more complex. Data center operators require a simpler way to design, build, and deploy infrastructure to fully benefit from AI. AI applications must sit where they are needed, whether a massive, large language model sitting in centralized hyperscale facilities or a network drone monitoring crop irrigation at the very edge of the network.\n\nThis shift in where data is created, accessed, and stored requires a new type of simplified data center infrastructure\u2013one that integrates compute, storage, networking, and security in new ways, and allows for automated and predictive operations via simplified management platforms.\n\n\u201cAs the Philippines pushes for greater adoption of AI, and as AI workloads continue to multiply, building and managing data centers will become much more complex. Data center operators now require a simpler way to design, build, and deploy infrastructure that integrates compute, storage, networking, and security and allows for automated and predictive operations. With the Smart Switches, we are offering a new way to do that and enable businesses to accelerate their adoption of AI and other innovations without compromising security,\u201d said Zaza Soriano-Nicart, Managing Director, Cisco Philippines.\n\n\u201cCisco\u2019s innovative approach to data center design, leveraging leadership AMD Pensando DPUs, marks a significant milestone in transforming enterprise infrastructure to address the evolving security demands of data center networks while dealing with the fast-paced AI deployments,\u201d said Soni Jiandani, senior vice president and general manager, Networking Technology and Solutions Group, AMD.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with Cisco enables enterprises to achieve high-capacity throughput and impressive network security without compromising on workload performance on Cisco UCS servers or Hypershield enabled platforms. Together, we are paving the way for a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and secure data centers.\u201d\n\nCisco Smart Switches: a Game Changer\n\nAs AI drives rapid growth, organizations must manage significantly increased power, compute, and networking demands. In traditional data center architectures, when each new service required a specific device, growth led to complexity. It also required adding, changing, or upgrading the enforcement of security policies with each new service or workload. Cisco Smart Switches offer a simpler, more efficient and extensible architecture by integrating services directly with the data center fabric, rather than bolting them on top.\n\nBy combining Cisco data center networking, Silicon One, and AMD DPUs, customers can scale services and adapt quickly to evolving business needs, all without the need for any additional hardware. The switches feature two processing engines: a high-performance network processor for stable data transfer and a network services sidecar for agile security processing. Traffic is intelligently steered between the two engines for optimal performance. This architectural shift drives cost savings through hardware consolidation, reduced power consumption, and operational simplicity. Cisco Smart Switches embrace all the capabilities of a NX-OS switch and management through Nexus Dashboard, and will unlock a diverse set of use cases like stateful segmentation, IPSec encryption, enhanced telemetry, DDoS protection and more.\n\nReimagining Data Center Security with Smart Switch and Hypershield\n\nThe first integrated service will combine Cisco Smart Switches and Hypershield to form a new approach to data center security. It will combine an advanced, AI-native, hardware-accelerated, distributed security architecture directly within the data center fabric to:\n\nProvide security that\u2019s melted into the data center network. Hypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a \u2018micro perimeter\u2019 around each service that makes up a workload.\n\nEnable autonomous segmentation policies. Customers can benefit from automatically updating security policies to the right enforcement points, ensuring consistent security with minimal manual effort.\n\nKeep security posture up to date reducing disruption. Organizations can minimize risks and drive policy lifecycle management at scale by using self-qualifying policy updates before deployment.\n\nEasily extend consistent policy enforcement across multiple domains. With the ability to manage policies consistently across a library of enforcement points in the cloud, on-prem, and on traditional next-gen firewalls, customers now have a single management system with Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall.\n\nManage network and security workflows with persona-driven operations. The solution seamlessly integrated into existing processes, and supports common and separate workflows for NetOps, SecOps, or NetSecOps teams using a single solution to maintain connectivity and security.\n\nFusing security directly into the data center network changes the fundamentals of data center security. Combined with Cisco Firewall Threat Defense, new AI Defense capabilities, and Security Cloud Control, Cisco will offer the first Hybrid Mesh Firewall optimized to protect AI applications in the data center and public cloud.\n\nGeneral Availability\n\nThe first available Cisco N9300 Smart Switch, which features 24 100G ports, is targeted for shipment in spring 2025. A top-of-rack model, which will feature 48 25G ports, two 100G ports, and six 400G ports, is targeted for first availability in summer 2025.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nExecutive blog post: Meeting the Moment: Innovation for Unprecedented Times, Jeetu Patel\n\nExecutive blog post: Cisco Silicon One Powers New Service Provider and Enterprise Data Center Solutions, Martin Lund\n\nBlog Post: Fortify Your Data Center with New Cisco N9300 Series Smart Switches, Murali Gandluru and Rick Miles\n\nFor more information on Cisco Live EMEA, please visit The Newsroom",

However, all that buzz can drive the prices and valuations of those stocks to record highs -- which sets them up for steep drawdowns as elevated interest rates and other macro headwinds chill the market.\n\nAs the NASDAQ trades just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high, it might be smart to ignore the market darlings for now and buy a few blue chip tech stocks that trade at cooler valuations and pay healthy dividends. These three stocks fit that description: Verizon (VZ 2.62%), IBM (IBM -1.21%), and Cisco (CSCO -1.06%).\n\n1. Verizon\n\nVerizon's stock sank to a 13-year low of $28.25 on Oct. 13, 2023. At the time, the telecom giant was struggling to gain wireless customers and slashing its prices to stay competitive. But as of this writing, its stock has bounced back to nearly $44.\n\nVerizon's business recovered as it more than doubled its annual postpaid phone net additions in 2024. That acceleration was driven by the localization of its incentives and marketing campaigns, the expansion of its customizable \"myPlans,\" and the growth of its distribution business with Walmart. It also expanded its prepaid wireless segment by acquiring TracFone, while its total wireless churn rate declined 50 basis points to 1.62% for the full year. For 2025, it expects its wireless revenue to rise 2% to 2.8%. Analysts expect its total revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to both rise 2%.\n\nAs Verizon's wireless business warmed up again, it trimmed its spending to offset the pressure from its promotions. Its free cash flow (FCF) rose 6% to $19.8 billion last year and easily covered its $11.2 billion in dividend payments, and it still pays a forward yield of 6.3%. That high yield, along with its low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9, should limit its downside potential and make it a safe place to park your cash and earn some extra income.\n\n2. IBM\n\nIBM was once considered a stagnant tech giant that was left behind in the seismic shift toward cloud-based services. But under Arvind Krishna, its cloud chief who became its CEO in 2020, Big Blue's business gradually recovered.\n\nKrishna took over, IBM spun off its slow-growth managed IT infrastructure services business as Kyndryl, and expanded its open-source software subsidiary Red Hat's presence in the hybrid cloud and AI markets. Instead of going head-to-head against the public cloud giants, IBM aimed to carve out a niche with AI-powered services that could be wedged between the private and public clouds. It also pruned its workforce as it used AI to automate more tasks and trim its spending.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, IBM's revenue and EPS increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% and 1%, respectively. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but they represent a significant improvement after it endured years of top- and bottom-line declines. That's why its stock price more than doubled over the past three years.\n\nAnalysts expect its revenue and EPS to both grow about 4% this year as the macro environment stabilizes. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.7%. It only paid out 52% of its FCF over the past 12 months as dividends, so it still has plenty of room to raise its payout.\n\n3. Cisco\n\nCisco, one of the world's largest networking companies, struggled in fiscal 2021 and 2022 (which ended in July 2022) as supply chain constraints throttled its sales of routers, switches, and wireless networking devices. In fiscal 2023, its growth accelerated again as it resolved those supply chain issues and its customers ramped up their purchases of new networking hardware again.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Cisco's revenue and earnings both declined because many of its customers had accumulated too many of its products in the previous year -- and the intensifying macro headwinds throttled the deployment of those devices. As a result, its orders stalled out as its existing customers sat on too many uninstalled products.\n\nHowever, analysts expect Cisco's revenue to rise 5% in fiscal 2025 as it overcomes those inventory issues and ships more devices. They expect its adjusted EPS to stay nearly flat, but that pressure can mainly be attributed to its initial costs of integrating Splunk, the network observability services provider it acquired last March.\n\nCisco's stock still looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.6%. It only spent half of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months. Its business should stabilize after it fully laps its acquisition of Splunk and it normalizes its inventory levels -- so I believe it's still a reliable choice for conservative investors.",

            "content": "At MWC 2025, Kevin Wollenweber, SVP/GM at Cisco, discussed the rapid evolution of AI and its growing demands on network infrastructure. He highlighted a shift from carrier cost-cutting to exploring new revenue opportunities through AI-driven services and applications. With AI moving from cloud to enterprise data centers, Cisco's role in simplifying and speeding up deployments is becoming more crucial than ever.\n\nWollenweber also forecasted a potential optical networking boom, driven by the vast volume of AI-generated data traveling across networks. The future, he suggested, would see data dispersed further throughout the network, with more AI applications interacting across devices. He also spoke about the industry's embrace of Industry 4.0, where AI will transform various verticals, driving innovation and operational efficiency at an accelerated pace. With physical AI on the horizon, Cisco is at the forefront of this transformation, enabling the seamless integration of AI into real-world applications.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nKevin, it's great to see you again.\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nGood to see you too.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nYeah, last time we were talking it was about ethernet, so it must have been a little while ago. And the industry has certainly moved on a bit since we last had the chance to talk about the carrier business. It seems like there's been a shift recently from carriers looking to save money on OpEx to working out new ways to make money to increase their revenues with new types of service or application. Do you think that's true? And how's Cisco working with those carriers?\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nYeah, it is definitely true, and if you kind of look at the evolution of AI technologies, we had the major builds with the hyperscalers and the LLM builders, but now we're kind of moving into that world of inference and usage of the models. And so I think companies like Cisco and service providers can have a huge play in that space. So as the models move outside of the cloud and really into the enterprise data centers, service provider networks, and even out into the world itself. The solutions that we're building and the simplifications we're driving to those solutions can help them deploy much, much faster.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nSo one of the things which I'm hearing here at MWC 25 is that obviously AI is putting increasing demands on the network. As a provider of network solutions, that's obviously good for you. Do you think there's a possibility both inside the data center and between the data center that we're going to see a sort of new optical networking boom being caused by this vast volume of AI-generated data traveling over the network?\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nYeah, so we've seen a huge increase in data in the hyperscale networks that we've been building out. And so as we see more and more usage of the AI applications and AI infrastructure being built, I expect to see a lot more data dispersed further in the network. But also, you kind of think of this futuristic world of agents and moving to physical AI and robots. I expect to see a lot more agents and AI applications talking to each other, so we'll drive more diversity in where the data actually is and more communication between different devices. So we definitely do expect to see a growth from this.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nLet's stay on data for a moment. I mean, a lot of people are talking about distributed data, and at the same time, hyperscalers and others are building these huge centralized data centers. Which approach wins out? Because the data, it seems, would work better if it was closer to the end user.\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nYeah, and I'll use my product answer and just say, I think it's going to be a combination of all of those. And so if you think about massive training workloads, those are definitely very centralized and being built by a small number of very, very large companies. But as you start to think about fine-tuning and inference, it's really about data gravity and where the data resides. And so as more and more of proprietary, enterprise, and customer data is being used, we're going to see a lot of these AI applications pushing deeper into the network and a lot closer to where those customers reside and where that data resides.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nLet's think about the future of the communications industry. I think that within three or five years, a show like this will be dominated by digital industrialization, industry 4.0. I really see these technologies, automation, predictive analytics, AI moving into the industry verticals and being transformative there. Do you agree with that? And how important is that to Cisco as a potential market?\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nYeah, and actually it may not even be three to five years. If you look at the acceleration that we're seeing in this space last year, we talked a lot about AI, but it was really AI for the sake of AI. We didn't really know exactly what things would look like. I think this show, you're seeing a very different vibe and you're seeing a lot of people looking at real-world use cases and examples of how they're going to leverage these technologies.\n\nAnd so in three to five years, or potentially even faster, I definitely expect to see usage of AI and actually AI enhancing everything that we do and not just being the thing we talk about, but actually being built into everything that we do. And so acceleration of new service offerings, getting to innovation faster, and the operational savings a lot of people are enjoying today from some of these AI applications is absolutely going to be part of that next industrial revolution.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nI agree with that. It seems to me that the best way for a service provider to plan around AI is to assume it's going to be in every device and it's in their network, to look at it as a table stakes kind of commodity and then assume it's there and then work out how they're going to use it. I mean, that's a different way to the way we talked about AI last year, but that's very much in line with Cisco's new philosophy of AI, I think, right, Kevin?\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nYeah, a hundred percent. And I think the faster AI moves, the more we learn about it, the more it's going to be used and how it's going to be used. And you're moving from generative AI and building the large rankings models to agentic AI and all the talk we've been having around a mixture of intelligent agents working together to solve problems to that view of physical AI.\n\nPhysical AI is interesting because when we get to the world of AI being outside the data center and in the physical world, robots and manufacturing floors, and a lot of the industrialization that we talked about, I actually think it's a domain of companies like Cisco and our service providers to actually bring that to market. So it's an exciting time and it's perfect for shows like this.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nKevin, it's great to see you.\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nGreat to see you too.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nAlways a pleasure.\n\nKevin Wollenweber:\n\nAppreciate this. Happy to do this anytime.\n\nSteve Saunders:\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "Cisco has been a key partner and innovator in the service provider space for decades. And today that commitment continues as AI transforms connectivity, and telecoms face the daunting challenges \u2014 and vast opportunities \u2014 of this transformative technology.\n\nThis week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the subject of unlocking AI value took center stage in a panel discussion led by Gordon Thomson, Cisco\u2019s VP for EMEA service provider.\n\nThomson began by emphasizing the latest developments from Cisco in the SP and AI space, including new products like Agile Services Networking and AI Defense; the continued expansion of the Silicon One portfolio; and the company\u2019s deepening partnership with Nvidia.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve seen from our launches over the last few weeks,\u201d Thomson said, \u201cCisco is really focused on the SP segment and very focused on AI infrastructure buildout. It\u2019s about helping our service providers create a platform to be able to build new world digital services for the market space.\u201d\n\nTo round out the discussion, Thomson was joined by two experts in the SP space: Colin Bannon, chief technology officer for BT Business, and Travis Ewert, global head of platform development for Digital Realty. Together they explored topics that included the impact of AI on networks, the need for agile, secure, and resilient data management, and the potential for AI to create new efficiencies and revenue opportunities for service providers.\n\nBannon began by sharing the latest on BT Group\u2019s new cloud-centric Global Fabric platform \u2014 developed with support from longtime partner Cisco \u2014 which offers greater agility, resilience, security, and AI readiness. Because, as Bannon put it, everything from planes in the sky to patients on hospital beds (and so much more) depend on their networks.\n\n\u201cWe needed to rethink how to do things in this world of increasingly distributed workloads, increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats, and the increasing importance of the network,\u201d Bannon stressed. \u201cBecause there is no plan B now without the network. So, we needed to be more agile, and we needed to be much more resilient and much more secure.\u201d\n\nGlobal Fabric is all about convergence and simplification, and, of course, operational resilience.\n\n\"Hard downs are one thing, and you can engineer those out,\" said Bannon, \u201cslow is the new down. So, providing a service where you deliver outcomes of both assurance and security, but also end-user experience is going to be really important. Because we need to think about our mobile network, the convergence of the fixed network, and those outcomes.\"\n\nSecurity in a complex ecosystem\n\nDigital Realty is known for supporting and building high-density data centers and AI infrastructure around the world, so Ewert was quick to add his own thoughts on preparing for this challenging new AI era.\n\n\u201cThe first story from the street so to speak,\u201d he recounted, \u201cwas \u2018hey, the networks aren't big enough, scaled enough, secure enough, on demand enough to tackle some of these workloads and data exchanges.\u2019 And not just for getting data to your model to train it, but even the day 2 and lifecycle considerations.\u201d\n\nSharing \u201ccrown jewel\u201d private data across third-party, AI-related clouds raises additional concerns.\n\n\u201cIf you want to participate with AI, to leverage AI,\u201d Ewert asked, \u201care you going to go put that on the internet or put it on an existing cloud infrastructure, something multi-tenant in nature?\u201d\n\nDigital Realty soon had a solution.\n\n\u201cAll those conclusions for us then resulted in something we announced here a little over a year ago,\u201d he explained, \u201cour Private AI Exchange. It\u2019s the notion of keeping the secure sovereignty, compliance, all that kind of stuff, and exchange pieces. To do this as an ecosystem where the data, the models, the training, the transformation, all those different things in that AI journey could be part of our fabric to get access to that in a private secured way.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ewert praised Cisco\u2019s AI Defense, for which Digital Realty contributed development ideas. And he highlighted the timing of its release, just days after DeepSeek raised new security concerns around consumer AI.\n\n\u201cI'm going to give Cisco all the credit in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nAI innovation that\u2019s \u2018gold dust\u2019 for SP opportunity\n\nAbove all, the discussion focused on just what AI can bring to service providers, in terms of efficiency, improved user experience, security, and so much more \u2014 all as complexity is surpassing the ability of humans to fully manage systems.\n\n\u201cYou need more intelligence in the network,\u201d Bannon stated. \u201cAnd so, AI in the network is starting to do closed-loop remediation. Because AI is moving so fast now, our human brains can't keep up. So, we need to now put some of this onto autopilot to be able to make course corrections faster than a human can do.\u201d\n\nAs this evolution continues, building trust in AI will be critical to reap its full benefits.\n\n\u201cAI means giving up a little control,\u201d Bannon continued, \u201cbut you need to put it into models that you can trust. Imagine if you can start to make changes outside of change windows. There's huge value where you can do this with infrastructure \u2014 like some of the things that your Cisco teams are building where you can actually test the new code, have another version of the data plane still working in the device, and have AI look at all that. That is gold dust to a service provider.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust in partners \u2014 along with cooperation across the entire SP ecosystem \u2014 was another key theme.\n\n\u201cNobody's going to be able to do it on their own,\u201d Thomson emphasized. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take the power of many to be able to offer these solutions in the market space and it's going to require an ecosystem to deliver those services to market.\u201d\n\nEwert stressed that it\u2019s a very fulfilling time to be working with service providers \u2014 to help them meet the challenges of AI, security, and more.\n\n\u201cWe're excited to participate in it, excited to partner with folks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's maybe a once-in-a-career opportunity to embrace this and address it.\u201d\n\nBannon agreed.\n\n\u201cFor anybody who's an engineer,\u201d he stressed, \u201cit's one of the most exciting times to be living. Ultimately though, there's huge responsibility on our shoulders. We're running the critical services of nations, and we want enterprises to be super competitive. And in order to do that, they need brilliant connectivity, and they need connectivity that is relevant for the changing times. And therefore, as a service provider, now more than ever, we're having to step up and be counted to have everybody's back, but at the same time be super innovative and move at a speed we've never done before.\u201d\n\nCisco, he added, is a big part of that.\n\n\u201cIt's great to see Cisco moving at a speed that I haven\u2019t seen for many years in terms of the innovation,\u201d Bannon concluded, \u201cbecause it's helping us actually deliver that.

            "content": "Jacksonville Jaguars NFL free agency spotlight: Should they re-sign S Andre Cisco?\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Jaguars introduce James Gladstone as team's new general manager Jaguars owner Shad Khan introduced the team's new general manager, James Gladstone, on Monday. Here's what he had to say.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have 15 players set to become free agents, including safety Andre Cisco.\n\nCisco's performance declined in 2024 under new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen.\n\nThe Jaguars could replace Cisco with free agent Jevon Holland or draft prospect Nick Emmanwori.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars will have some decisions to make next week as numerous players are slated to become free agents at the turn of the new league year on March 12 at 4 p.m.\n\nThe team has a total of 15 players slated to become free agents, including 10 unrestricted free agents, two restricted free agents and three exclusive rights free agents.\n\nThe list includes quarterback Mac Jones, who will likely see some attention as a backup QB candidate for several teams around the league. The Jaguars could opt to bring back the Jacksonville native if head coach Liam Coen and general manager James Gladstone deem it necessary.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars free agency: Who should they sign? Is a Cooper Kupp trade sensible?\n\nJacksonville has just two quarterbacks slated to be on their roster at the turn of the new league year: Trevor Lawrence and John Wolford. C.J. Beathard is also slated to be a free agent.\n\nStill, Jacksonville's top impending free agent comes from the other side of the football with safety Andre Cisco slated to hit the open market.\n\nShould the Jaguars re-sign safety Andre Cisco?\n\nCisco, 24, was drafted by the Jaguars at the top of the third round in the 2021 NFL Draft under former general manager Trent Baalke and former head coach Urban Meyer.\n\nCisco began his career as a backup, rarely seeing the field in any capacity on game days. He started just three games to end the season before becoming the full-time starter under former head coach Doug Pederson and former defensive coordinator Mike Caldwell.\n\nIn his career, Cisco has started 47 games, playing in 63. He's accounted for 229 total tackles (154 solos), three tackles for loss, eight interceptions and 24 pass breakups.\n\nCisco looked poised to make a significant leap in play in 2024 after posting good years in 2022-23, accounting for seven interceptions and 15 pass breakups over two years.\n\nLast year, though, Cisco's play took a bit of a hit under new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen. Nielsen's scheme and defense were the worst in the league (32nd) last year in the passing game, allowing 257.4 passing yards per game.\n\nCisco started just 14 games, and his snap percentage dived the New York Jets in Week 15 at 44.8%. For reference, Cisco's lowest defensive snap percentage was 90.1% against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1 until Week 10 when Cisco saw just 66.7% of the defensive snaps.\n\nHe totaled 68 tackles (44 solos), seven pass breakups and just one interception last year. According to Pro Football Focus, Cisco scored a defensive grade of 58.8, the lowest of his career. His coverage grade was 56.7 due to rarely making plays on the football and allowing yards.\n\nCisco's drop in play can be attributed in part to the change in defensive philosophy, but he has yet to reach his potential in Jacksonville through four years. This year's free agency class and draft offer plenty of help at the safety position, giving Jacksonville a clear path to move on.\n\nWhat is Andre Cisco projected to command in free agency?\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Cisco is in line for a prove-it deal on a one-year contract worth $10,779,945. That would put Cisco in line to earn the fourth-most among safeties next season, according to the salary cap management website.\n\nSpotrac compared Cisco to players such as Amani Hooker, who signed a three-year, $30 million contract with the Tennessee Titans in 2022 after his rookie deal.\n\nWho could Jacksonville replace Andre Cisco with at safety?\n\nThe Jaguars have a slew of options in both free agency and the NFL Draft.\n\nOne player worth monitoring in free agency is Miami Dolphins safety Jevon Holland. Holland has ties to Jacksonville's coaching staff and is coming off a semi-down year in part due to injuries. Still, he's proven to be one of the top safeties in the league through his career.\n\nIn the draft, Jacksonville could move up from the second round, back into the first to select safety Nick Emmanwori out of South Carolina.\n\nEither player would fit nicely in Jacksonville as the team looks to reshape the backend of their defense this offseason.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

But Holland, at least according to Pro Football Focus contributor Bradley Locker, may not even be the best safety for this particular defense.\n\nLocker, ahead of Monday's opening of the legal tampering period, recently identified the perfect free-agent match for each NFL team. He paired the Panthers with safety Andre Cisco, who has played all four of his pro campaigns with the Jacksonville Jaguars:\n\nThe Panthers will need to overhaul most of their defense this offseason, especially a secondary that ranked dead last in PFF coverage grade. Cisco could be a sleeper fit in defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero\u2019s scheme. Over the past two years, Carolina ranks second in snaps deploying some sort of Cover 3 variety. While Cisco (56.7 PFF coverage grade) wasn\u2019t spectacular last season, he actually performed quite well when deployed in Cover 3, as his 73.1 PFF coverage grade ranked 23rd among qualified defensive backs. He was much stronger overall in his prior two years, notching at least a 69.4 PFF coverage grade in both seasons. Still only 25 during the 2025 season, Cisco brings strong Cover 3 skills and fits what Evero will seek to build in the long term in Charlotte.\n\nJacksonville selected Cisco, a Syracuse University standout, in the third round of the 2021 draft. Along with those PFF numbers, he's gone on to amass eight interceptions and three forced fumbles in 63 games as a Jaguar.\n\nCarolina's defense, which is fresh off allowing the most points ever in a single season, has just one safety currently under contract for 2025\u20142024 undrafted rookie Demani Richardson. Meanwhile, Xavier Woods, Jordan Fuller and Nick Scott\u2014who combined to account for 83.1 percent of Carolina's snaps at the safety position this past season\u2014are all slated for free agency.",

Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nDuo offers a variety of methods for adding two-factor authentication and flexible security policies to Microsoft 365 SAML 2.0 logins with Duo Single-Sign On. Our cloud-hosted SSO identity provider offers inline user enrollment, self-service device management, and support for a variety of authentication methods \u2014 such as passkeys and security keys, Duo Push, or Verified Duo Push \u2014 in the Universal Prompt.\n\nOverview\n\nAs business applications move from on-premises to cloud hosted solutions, users experience password fatigue due to disparate logons for different applications. Single sign-on (SSO) technologies seek to unify identities across systems and reduce the number of different credentials a user has to remember or input to gain access to resources.\n\nWhile SSO is convenient for users, it presents new security challenges. If a user's primary password is compromised, attackers may be able to gain access to multiple resources. In addition, as sensitive information makes its way to cloud-hosted services it is even more important to secure access by implementing two-factor authentication and zero-trust policies.\n\nVideo Overview\n\nAbout Duo Single Sign-On\n\nDuo Single Sign-On (SSO) is our cloud-hosted SSO product which layers Duo's strong authentication and flexible policy engine on top of Microsoft 365 logins. Duo SSO acts as an identity provider (IdP), authenticating your users using existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) and prompting for two-factor authentication before permitting access to Microsoft 365.\n\nOnce you federate a custom domain your Microsoft Online tenant with Duo Single Sign-On, all Microsoft 365 applications will redirect those federated users to Duo when they sign in, while cloud-only (non-federated) users continue to log in using the Microsoft Online sign-in form.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On satisfies Entra ID MFA requirements as of February 24, 2022. Microsoft 365 domains federated to Duo SSO after February 24th automatically have MFA support for their federated domain enabled. Microsoft domains federated with Duo SSO on or before February 24, 2022 must update the federation configuration following the steps in Duo Knowledge Base article 7538.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is available in Duo Premier, Duo Advantage, and Duo Essentials plans, which also include the ability to define policies that enforce unique controls for each individual SSO application. For example, you can require that Salesforce users complete two-factor authentication at every login, but only once every seven days when accessing Microsoft 365. Duo checks the user, device, and network against an application's policy before allowing access to the application.\n\nIf you're interested in a Duo solution for Microsoft 365 that doesn't require installing any on-premises Duo components and allows Duo to be applied per Microsoft 365 application (i.e. required for SharePoint but not Yammer), see our instructions for Duo for Entra ID External Authentication Methods.\n\nConfigure Single Sign-On\n\nBefore configuring Microsoft 365 you'll first need to enable Duo Single Sign-On for your Duo account and configure a working Active Directory authentication source.\n\nMicrosoft 365 requires the use of Active Directory as your authentication source.\n\nPrepare your Microsoft Tenant for Federation\n\nAdd Custom Domains to Microsoft 365\n\nIn order to federate your Microsoft 365 tenant with an external identity provider (like Duo Single Sign-On) you must have added a custom domain to Microsoft 365. You cannot federate your \"onmicrosoft.com\" domain. Additionally, the custom domain you have added to Microsoft 365 cannot be set as the default domain.\n\nIt is recommended that you have a tenant administrator account in your \"onmicrosoft.com\" so you don't lock yourself out of your tenant.\n\nEnable Directory Synchronization in Microsoft 365\n\nMicrosoft 365 requires that users are already provisioned inside Microsoft 365 when an authentication attempt happens. You will need to sync users from your Active Directory to your Microsoft 365 account.\n\nIf you previously configured directory synchronization between your on-premises AD domain and Microsoft 365, skip these steps and proceed to Create the Microsoft 365 Application in Duo.\n\nHowever, if you have already configured AD to Entra ID synchronization and did not select the mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute as the Source Anchor note that you cannot modify the selected Source Anchor attribute and must uninstall and reinstall Azure AD Connect in order to change it.\n\nLog in to the Office Admin portal as the tenant administrator and open the Sync users from your Windows Server Active Directory setup action. Click Get Started to begin setup and step through the guided prompts. On a computer joined to your AD domain open PowerShell and run Install-Module Graph as described here under Step 1, substep 2. to install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Note the additional software prerequisites for the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK: Upgrade to PowerShell 5.1 or later.\n\nInstall .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later. When prompted to download and run Azure AD Connect on the same computer as the step above, do not use the \"Express Settings\" and instead select Customize to perform a Custom installation of Azure Active Directory Connect. When on the \"User sign-in\" page of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect tool select Do not configure as the \"Sign On method\". When on the \"Identifying Users\" page select mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid from the \"Source Anchor\" drop-down. Note: If you've configured your Active Directory authentication source to communicate with your domain controllers over Global Catalog ports you will need to update the Global Catalog to replicate the attribute you chose as your Source Anchor. Enable replication of the Source Anchor attribute to Global Catalog like this: Open up \"Active Directory Schema\" MMC snap-in as a domain administrator. Navigate to the \"Attributes' section. Locate and double-click on the attribute name used for the Source Anchor, in the pop-up check the box \"Replicate this attribute to the Global Catalog\". Click Apply and OK. Verify successful Active Directory Synchronization and activate Office 365 licensing for unlicensed synchronized users.\n\nCreate the Microsoft 365 Application in Duo\n\nLog on to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications \u2192 Protect an Application. Locate the entry for Microsoft 365 with a protection type of \"2FA with SSO hosted by Duo (Single Sign-On)\" in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to start configuring Microsoft 365. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications with Duo and additional application options. You'll need the information on the Microsoft 365 page under Downloads later. The Microsoft domain name is the custom domain you have verified in Microsoft 365 and the domain at the end of your users' email addresses. You will need to create a separate Microsoft 365 application in the Duo Admin Panel for each custom domain. Each custom domain will need to be added to the SSO Permitted Domains. You can optionally select Enable WS-Trust next to \"WS-Trust Configuration\" if you have users that log in with Entra ID joined machines or mail clients that do not support modern authentication. Office clients will also be required to reauthenticate less often when WS-Trust is enabled. When this option is configured users logging in with WS-Trust will bypass Duo 2FA. If this option is not chosen, any mail client that does not support modern auth will not be able to log in and some other clients may be required to reauthenticate more frequently. The user's status in Duo and the effective enrollment policy of the Microsoft 365 application will be checked against Duo before authentication completes. If the effective New User policy for the Microsoft 365 Duo application is one that enforces enrollment (like \"Require enrollment\" or \"Deny Access\"), then any user logging in with WS-Trust authentication must exist in Duo even though 2FA approval isn't required during Microsoft 365 WS-Trust authentication. If your Duo Single Sign-On Active Directory authentication source has the \"Duo username attribute\" populated, the value of this attribute is what Duo will check. Ensure that users logging in with WS-Trust authentication through Duo are not also required to complete Entra ID MFA. If a policy applied to the WS-Trust authentication users enforces Entra ID MFA, WS-Trust authentication fails, preventing access. You can restrict access to WS-Trust authentications by using the settings below: Host-based Access Control allows you to limit which IP addresses can use WS-Trust authentication. You can configure to either \"Allow all IPs\", \"Allow only these IPs\", or \"Deny only these IPs\". You can specify a block of IP addresses, IP ranges, or CIDRs as a comma-separated list.\n\nAgent-based Access Control allows you to limit which services can authenticate with WS-Trust. You can \"Allow all user agents\" or \"Permit only certain user agents\". When permitting only certain user agents you'll be asked to choose which user agents to permit, you can select \"Allow legacy mail clients\" and \"Allow Azure AD Join computer logins\"\n\nGroup-Based Access Control allows you to restrict WS-Trust authentication by Duo groups. Check the box next to Restrict WS-Trust to specific Duo Groups. A new text field appears where you can select Duo groups. Only Duo users that are members of these groups can perform WS-Trust authentications. If the application's effective new user policy is set to \"Allow Access without 2FA\", unenrolled users will also be allowed to perform WS-Trust authentications. We recommend using a more restrictive policy for this application if group-based access control is used. An incoming WS-Trust connection must satisfy all three of these configured settings; otherwise Duo SSO blocks the authentication attempt. Microsoft 365 uses the Mail attribute and Source Anchor attribute when authenticating. We've mapped Mail attribute and Source Anchor attribute to Active Directory source attributes as follows: Duo Attribute Active Directory Mail attribute userPrincipalName Source Anchor attribute mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid If you are using non-standard Mail or Source Anchor for your Entra ID sync, check the Custom attributes box and enter the name of the AD attributes you wish to use instead. You can adjust additional settings for your new Microsoft 365 application at this time \u2014 like changing the application's name from the default value, enabling self-service, or assigning a group policy. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Save button. Under the \"Downloads\" section next to \"PowerShell script\" click Download PowerShell script. You'll need this file later.\n\nDuo Universal Prompt\n\nThe Duo Universal Prompt provides a simplified and accessible Duo login experience for web-based applications, offering a redesigned visual interface with security and usability enhancements.\n\nUniversal Prompt Traditional Prompt\n\nWe've already updated the Duo Microsoft 365 application hosted in Duo's service to support the Universal Prompt, so there's no action required on your part to update the application itself. If you created your Microsoft 365 application before March 2024, you can activate the Universal Prompt experience for users from the Duo Admin Panel. Microsoft 365 applications created after March 2024 have the Universal Prompt activated by default.\n\nIf you created your Microsoft 365 application before March 2024, it's a good idea to read the Universal Prompt Update Guide for more information, about the update process and the new login experience for users, before you activate the Universal Prompt for your application.\n\nActivate Universal Prompt\n\nActivation of the Universal Prompt is a per-application change. Activating it for one application does not change the login experience for your other Duo applications.\n\nThe \"Universal Prompt\" area of the application details page shows that this application is \"Ready to activate\", with these activation control options:\n\nShow traditional prompt : Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\n: Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application. Show new Universal Prompt : (Default) Your users experience the Universal Prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nThe application's Universal Prompt status shows \"Activation complete\" here and on the Universal Prompt Update Progress report.\n\nShould you ever want to roll back to the traditional prompt, you can return to this setting and change it back to Show traditional prompt. However, this will still deliver the Duo prompt via redirect, not in an iframe. Keep in mind that support for the traditional Duo prompt ended for the majority of applications in March 2024.\n\nUniversal Update Progress\n\nClick the See Update Progress link to view the Universal Prompt Update Progress report. This report shows the update availability and migration progress for all your Duo applications. You can also activate the new prompt experience for multiple supported applications from the report page instead of visiting the individual details pages for each application.\n\nUpdate Your Search Attributes in Duo\n\nWhile logged into the Duo Admin Panel navigate to Single Sign-On. On the \"Single Sign-On\" page click on the name of your Active Directory authentication source. On your Active Directory authentication source page scroll down to Email attributes. Click Add attribute, a new text field will appear. If you left the Mail attribute in the last section configured to be userPrincipalName enter userPrincipalName into the field, otherwise enter the value you configured. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.\n\nEnable AD Federation to Microsoft 365 Using Duo SSO\n\nThe transition of your Microsoft 365 tenant from \"managed\" to \"federated\" is typically quick but Microsoft states that it can take two hours or more. Please plan accordingly when enabling federation (or restoring your existing federation configuration back to managed to switch from a previous solution to Duo SSO), as the transition may temporarily impact your users' login access.\n\nSee the Duo Knowledge Base article How do I defederate Office 365 from Duo SSO, Duo for AD FS, or Duo Access Gateway? if you need to defederate Office 365 from Duo SSO.\n\nLog on to the domain-joined computer where you installed PowerShell 5.1 or later, the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, and the Azure AD Connect tool. Copy the PowerShell file you downloaded earlier from the Duo Admin Panel onto this computer. Launch Windows PowerShell as an administrator. Navigate to the directory the PowerShell file is located in and paste the command below into the PowerShell terminal swapping out \"Microsoft 365 - Single Sign-On.ps1\" with the name of your PowerShell file. The PowerShell script is unsigned when downloaded from Duo, so specifying -ep ByPass grants a one-time exception to your PowerShell execution policy in order to run the script. powershell -ep ByPass \"&'.\\Microsoft 365 - Single Sign-On.ps1'\" The PowerShell script will start to run. It will inform you of the steps it will take and ask for your confirmation along the way. Follow the prompts to federate your domain to Duo Single Sign-On. You'll be required to provide a tenant administrator username and password during the flow to complete the federation. If you are running this script on a Windows Server operating system and Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Mode is enabled you may need to add websites used during the authentication process to your trusted sites.\n\nIMPORTANT: Once you federate a given Microsoft 365 domain with an external identity provider, like Duo SSO, you may no longer create new users in that domain from the Entra ID or Microsoft/Office 365 consoles. You will need to create the users in your source Active Directory and have Azure AD Connect sync them from the on-premises directory into the cloud. See additional explanation on this topic in the Microsoft troubleshooting article You can't assign a federated domain to a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.\n\nSee the Single Sign-On Roadmap at the Microsoft TechNet site for more information about configuring SSO for Microsoft 365 for federation.\n\nVerify SSO\n\nNavigate to https://login.microsoftonline.com and enter your Microsoft 365 email address that matches your federated custom domain (with no password). This redirects you to Duo Single Sign-On to begin authentication.\n\nActive Directory Login\n\nWith Active Directory as the Duo SSO authentication source, enter the primary username (email address) on the Duo SSO login page and click or tap Next.\n\nEnter the AD primary password and click or tap Log in to continue.\n\nDuo Authentication\n\nSuccessful verification of your primary credentials by Active Directory redirects back to Duo. Complete Duo two-factor authentication when prompted and then you'll return to Microsoft 365 to complete the login process.\n\n*Universal Prompt experience shown.\n\nYou can also log into Microsoft 365 using Duo Central, our cloud-hosted portal which allows users to access all of their applications in one spot. Link to Microsoft 365 in Duo Central by adding it as an application tile. Once the tile has been added, log into Duo Central and click the tile for IdP-initiated authentication to Microsoft 365.\n\nCongratulations! Your Microsoft 365 users now authenticate using Duo Single Sign-On.\n\nSee the full user login experience, including expired password reset (available for Active Directory authentication sources) in the Duo End User Guide for SSO.\n\nEnable Remembered Devices\n\nTo minimize additional Duo two-factor prompts when switching between Microsoft 365 and your other Duo Single Sign-On applications, be sure to apply a shared \"Remembered Devices\" policy to your applications.\n\nFederating Additional Domains\n\nPlease note that M365 custom domains not federated with Duo SSO will perform an Entra ID cloud-only login, will not redirect to Duo SSO, and will not complete Duo two-factor authentication. To add Duo protection to additional M365 custom domains, you can federate each domain inside of your Microsoft 365 tenant, except for your default domain and your \"onmicrosoft.com\" domain.\n\nRepeat the following steps for each additional domain:\n\nIf you have more than one Microsoft 365 application added in Duo you'll see a message at the top of Microsoft 365 application pages in the Duo Admin Panel informing you to assign permitted groups to your applications.\n\nThis is recommended if you're using Duo Central because by default every user can see every application in Duo Central unless user access is restricted to only permitted groups.\n\nOffice Client Access\n\nWhen you log in to Microsoft 365 for the first time after federation using an Office application, you'll see the Duo Single Sign-On primary login page within the Office application, followed by the Duo authentication prompt.\n\nOffice 2013 and later desktop applications (including Outlook and Skype for Business) can connect to Microsoft 365 after federation with Duo SSO only if modern Authentication is enabled for your Microsoft 365 tenant. More information about modern authentication, including a list of Office applications that support modern authentication, is available at the Office Blog.\n\nModern authentication may already be enabled on your Microsoft 365 tenant, as Microsoft has enabled it by default on new tenants since 2017. Follow these instructions to verify or enable modern authentication on your Exchange Online tenant and these instructions to do the same for your Skype for Business Online tenant. Apply registry updates for Office 2013 (Office 2016 and later applications and Skype for Business natively support modern authentication).\n\nImportant: If users had a preexisting Microsoft 365 Outlook profile before federating with Duo they might not be able to log in with modern authentication after federation and may then need to delete the existing Microsoft 365 client credentials in order to log in with modern authentication. If you encounter this, learn how to delete Microsoft 365 client credentials and more about M365 mail client behavior with Duo.\n\nMail Clients and Entra ID Join\n\nMail clients that do not support modern authentication such as Thunderbird or Android Mail will not be able to log in unless the WS-Trust setting is enabled in the Create the Microsoft 365 Application in Duo section. This is because those clients are unable to display a browser to allow users to log in and must instead log in using only an email address and password via IMAP, POP3, and SMTP logins. If the option is enabled users will continue to log into their mail clients using only their email address and password.\n\nEntra ID Joined devices use WS-Trust to refresh the Primary Refresh Token (PRT) that lets it communicate and authenticate with Entra ID. If WS-Trust is not enabled these devices may need to log in with modern authentication frequently to refresh the PRT.\n\nService Accounts\n\nIf you use service accounts to send e-mails from devices that don't support modern authentication, such as copiers, printers, or scanners, you can use the WS-Trust setting in the Create the Microsoft 365 Application in Duo section to allow those accounts to continue to send e-mail. You will need to create Duo user accounts for the service accounts.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nNeed some help? Take a look at our Microsoft 365 Knowledge Base articles or Community discussions.

            "content": "Researchers from Cisco Talos have discovered multiple cyber espionage campaigns that target various sectors, including government, manufacturing, telecommunications, and media, delivering Sagerunex and other hacking tools for post-compromise activities. Talos attributes these attacks to the threat actor, Lotus Blossom, which has been conducting cyber espionage operations since at least 2012 and remains active today. It confidently assesses that Lotus Blossom, also known as Spring Dragon, Billbug, or Thrip, is responsible for these campaigns.\n\n\u201cBased on our examination of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized in these campaigns, alongside the deployment of Sagerunex, a backdoor family used exclusively by Lotus Blossom, we attribute these campaigns to the Lotus Blossom group with high confidence,\u201d Joey Chen, a Cisco Talos threat intelligence researcher, wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cWe also observed Lotus Blossom gain persistence using specific commands to install their Sagerunex backdoor within the system registry and configuring it to run as a service on infected endpoints.\u201d\n\nChen added that Lotus Blossom has also developed new variants of Sagerunex that not only use traditional command and control (C2) servers but also use legitimate, third-party cloud services such as Dropbox, Twitter, and the Zimbra open-source webmail as C2 tunnels.\n\n\u201cOur assessment is based on the TTPs, backdoors, and victim profiles associated with each activity,\u201d Talos detailed. \u201cOur observations indicate that Lotus Blossom has been using the Sagerunex backdoor since at least 2016 and is increasingly employing long-term persistence command shells and developing new variants of the Sagerunex malware suite. The operation appears to have achieved significant success, targeting organizations in sectors such as government, manufacturing, telecommunications, and media in areas including the Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\u201d\n\nTalos has identified strong evidence to attribute these campaigns to the Lotus Blossom group, primarily due to the Sagerunex backdoor within these operations. Sagerunex is a remote access tool (RAT) assessed to be an evolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora. Sagerunex is designed to be a dynamic link library (DLL) injected into an infected endpoint and executed directly in memory.\n\n\u201cWe also observed the Sagerunex backdoor employ various network connection strategies to ensure it remains under the actor\u2019s control,\u201d Chen detailed. \u201cDespite the development of three distinct variants, the foundational structures and core functionalities of the backdoor remain consistent. These consistent elements enable us to confidently categorize all identified variant backdoors as part of the Sagerunex family.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he added that the consistent patterns in victimology and the TTPs identified across these campaigns strongly support our attribution to the Lotus Blossom espionage group. \u201cThis consistency, seen in the selection of targets and the methods employed, aligns with the known operational characteristics of Lotus Blossom, providing compelling evidence that these campaigns are orchestrated by this specific threat actor.\u201d\n\nLotus Blossom frequently utilizes the Impacket tool to execute remote processes and commands within the victim\u2019s environment, consistent with known Lotus Blossom TTPs. Once they gain access to a target, their operations typically unfold over multiple stages. Each stage is carefully executed, indicating a well-planned strategy aimed at achieving long-term objectives. This multi-stage approach enables them to maintain a presence in the network for extended periods, often going undetected for several months.\n\nTalos\u2019 exploration began with a detailed examination of a particular Sagerunex backdoor variant that exhibits a high degree of code similarity and workflow resemblance to those described in other vendors\u2019 blog posts. This analysis will help establish connections and highlight the shared characteristics observed across different Sagerunex variants.\n\n\u201cNext, we will shift our focus to another intriguing variant of the Sagerunex backdoor, which utilizes Dropbox as its C2 server. This unconventional choice of a third-party cloud service illustrates the threat actor\u2019s adaptability and efforts to evade detection,\u201d Chen noted. \u201cAdditionally, we have identified another variant of the Sagerunex backdoor that leverages the Zimbra open-source webmail service for its C2 operations. This finding further underscores the diverse strategies Lotus Blossom employs to maintain control and persist within compromised environments.\u201d\n\nHe added that Talos examined the loader code similarity to identify numerous variants of the Sagerunex backdoor. \u201cBy analyzing the loader and the behavior of the Sagerunex backdoor, we can classify the malware into the Sagerunex family.\u201d\n\nTalos also discovered another variant of the Sagerunex backdoor that uses Dropbox and Twitter API as C2 services. After bypassing the initial checking steps, this backdoor variant retrieves the necessary Dropbox or Twitter tokens to successfully bring the backdoor online.\n\nOnce the backdoor sends a beacon message and receives a response ID, it evaluates the ID number to determine subsequent actions. If the ID is less than 16, the function will return, prompting the backdoor to send another beacon message and wait for a new ID. If the ID is between 16 and 32, the backdoor proceeds to collect host information and execute paired backdoor command functions.\n\nAfter gathering the information and executing the commands, the backdoor encrypts and archives collected data, then transmits it back to Dropbox or Twitter. When the ID received equals 39, the backdoor retrieves data from Dropbox files or Twitter status updates to confirm the status of the backdoor service.\n\nLast month, researchers from Cisco Talos were monitoring reports of significant intrusion activities aimed at several U.S. telecommunications companies. Their investigation revealed that the initial access to Cisco devices was achieved by the threat actor acquiring legitimate login credentials from victims. The threat actor then showed their capability to remain in the targeted environments, spanning equipment from various vendors, for prolonged durations, with access maintained in one case for more than three years.",

Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nAdd two-factor authentication and flexible security policies to Cisco Secure Access VPN SAML 2.0 logins with Duo Single-Sign On. Our cloud-hosted SSO identity provider offers inline user enrollment, self-service device management, and support for a variety of authentication methods \u2014 such as passkeys and security keys, Duo Push, or Verified Duo Push \u2014 in the Universal Prompt.\n\nOverview\n\nAs business applications move from on-premises to cloud hosted solutions, users experience password fatigue due to disparate logons for different applications. Single sign-on (SSO) technologies seek to unify identities across systems and reduce the number of different credentials a user has to remember or input to gain access to resources.\n\nWhile SSO is convenient for users, it presents new security challenges. If a user's primary password is compromised, attackers may be able to gain access to multiple resources. In addition, as sensitive information makes its way to cloud-hosted services it is even more important to secure access by implementing two-factor authentication and zero-trust policies.\n\nAbout Duo Single Sign-On\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is our cloud-hosted SSO product which layers Duo's strong authentication and flexible policy engine on top of Cisco Secure Access VPN logins. Duo Single Sign-On acts as an identity provider (IdP), authenticating your users using existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) or another SSO IdP. Duo SSO prompts users for two-factor authentication and performs endpoint assessment and verification before permitting access to Cisco Secure Access VPN.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is available in Duo Premier, Duo Advantage, and Duo Essentials plans, which also include the ability to define policies that enforce unique controls for each individual SSO application. For example, you can require that Salesforce users complete two-factor authentication at every login, but only once every seven days when accessing Cisco Secure Access VPN. Duo checks the user, device, and network against an application's policy before allowing access to the application.\n\nConfigure Single Sign-On\n\nBefore configuring Cisco Secure Access VPN with Duo SSO using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 authentication you'll first need to enable Duo Single Sign-On for your Duo account and configure a working authentication source.\n\nOnce you have your SSO authentication source working, continue to the next step of creating the Cisco Secure Access VPN application in Duo.\n\nCreate the Cisco Secure Access VPN Application in Duo\n\nLog on to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications \u2192 Protect an Application. Locate the entry for Cisco Secure Access VPN with a protection type of \"2FA with SSO hosted by Duo (Single Sign-On)\" in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to start configuring Cisco Secure Access VPN. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications with Duo and additional application options. You'll need the information on the Cisco Secure Access VPN page under Downloads later. Cisco Secure Access VPN uses the Mail attribute when authenticating. We've mapped the <Email Address> bridge attribute to Duo Single Sign-On supported authentication source attributes as follows: Bridge Attribute Active Directory SAML IdP <Email Address> mail Email If you are using a non-standard email attribute for your authentication source, check the Custom attributes box and enter the name of the attribute you wish to use instead. You can adjust additional settings for your new SAML application at this time \u2014 like changing the application's name from the default value, enabling self-service, or assigning a group policy. Keep the Duo Admin Panel tab open. You will come back to it later.\n\nDuo Universal Prompt\n\nThe Duo Universal Prompt provides a simplified and accessible Duo login experience for web-based applications, offering a redesigned visual interface with security and usability enhancements.\n\nUniversal Prompt Traditional Prompt\n\nThe Duo Cisco Secure Access VPN application supports the Universal Prompt by default, so there's no additional action required on your part to start using the newest authentication experience.\n\nActivate Universal Prompt\n\nActivation of the Universal Prompt is a per-application change. Activating it for one application does not change the login experience for your other Duo applications. Universal Prompt is already activated for new Cisco Secure Access VPN applications at creation.\n\nThe \"Universal Prompt\" area of the application details page shows that this application's status is \"Activation complete\", with these activation control options:\n\nShow traditional prompt : Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\n: Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application. Show new Universal Prompt : (Default) Your users experience the Universal Prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nThe application's Universal Prompt status shows \"Activation complete\" both here and on the Universal Prompt Update Progress report.\n\nFor the time being, you may change this setting to Show traditional prompt to use the legacy experience. Keep in mind that support for the traditional Duo prompt ended for the majority of applications in March 2024. This option will be removed in the future.\n\nUniversal Update Progress\n\nClick the See Update Progress link to view the Universal Prompt Update Progress report. This report shows the update availability and migration progress for all your Duo applications. You can also activate the new prompt experience for multiple supported applications from the report page instead of visiting the individual details pages for each application.\n\nEnable Cisco Secure Access VPN for SSO\n\nTo enable Cisco Secure Access VPN for SSO, do the sections below in the order they appear.\n\nAdd a VPN Profile\n\nLog into your Cisco Secure Access account as an administrator.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other cheap tech stocks.\n\nIt seems that technology stocks have had a tough start to 2025. On March 4, 2025, CNBC reported that since President Donald Trump took office in January, the S&P 500 technology sector has dropped 7.5%. Tech stocks have slumped largely due to new tariffs that have set off a trade war and added fuel to the risk-off sentiment on Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Worst Performing Crypto Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 5 Years.\n\nEconomists had cautioned that tariffs could lead to a rise in inflation and create global economic disruptions. Many leading tech companies assemble and manufacture products outside the US and as a result of the tariffs these companies could see manufacturing costs rise.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have also been hit hard. On March 3, Trump cleared the way for new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and smashed hopes of a potential last-minute deal. According to the US President, there was \u201cno room left\u201d for further negotiations after weeks of talks. Trump also put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nIn response, Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs. Mexico said it will be looking to announce a plan on Sunday. China retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on some US goods. These developments have added to the uncertainty surrounding the tech sector.\n\nThe tech sector has experienced a decline due to economic uncertainty and trade tensions and this might present buying opportunities for some investors. Despite current challenges, some tech stocks show strong potential for growth.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Yahoo Finance. To find cheap tech stocks, we looked for stocks with a forward P/E ratio of less than 20. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies trading at under 20 times their forward earnings as of March 3, 2025. Next, we focused on the top 10 cheap tech stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.",

            "content": "Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images\n\nAround 500 million years ago, the world exploded with complex life. Prior to what is known as the Cambrian era, the planet was populated primarily with simple, microscopic organisms. But during the Cambrian period, creatures with complex body structures emerged.\n\nScientists who study such things call this the \"Cambrian explosion\" because it was a period of rapid evolution. Major animal groups emerged, competition and predation for food resources increased, and new ecosystems appeared.\n\nAlso: Crawl, then walk, before you run with AI agents, experts recommend\n\nAs you might imagine, the lab rats and grant chasers are still debating why it all happened so \"suddenly.\" In evolutionary terms, \"suddenly\" is about 20 million years. The consensus is that a bunch of factors came together, including increased oxygen levels, genetic transformations, environmental changes, and a sort of arms race fostered by natural selection.\n\nWhy the sudden history lesson in an article that's supposed to be about AI?\n\nThe answer can be found in an announcement by a consortium comprised of the AI nerd herds at Outshift by Cisco (the company's R&D and incubation engine), Galileo (which specializes in agent trust and observability), and LangChain (whose raison d'\u00eatre is agent orchestration).\n\nThey believe that, as much as generative AI has been a fast mover, \"We're witnessing a Cambrian explosion of AI agents.\"\n\nThis\u2026might not be so good. AI agents are self-directed entities designed to carry out certain tasks. In many cases, those tasks will take them from infrastructure to infrastructure, often needing to pass through the walled gardens that vendors set up to lock in customers and avoid brand dilution.\n\nSo how do we deal with this? Obviously, turning off all computers, moving to a yurt, and sitting in a corner rocking back and forth while keening the tune to Frozen's 'Let It Go', is probably not a strategy for successful governance.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way. Perhaps we could coordinate agents so they could work together. If only there was a word that described an organization that managed a group of agents, like an agency.\n\nAlso: The future of Google Search just rolled out on Labs - and AI Mode changes everything\n\nNah. Not hip enough. Let's get rid of most of the vowels. What about\u2026 wait for it\u2026 AGNTCY? I know, you were thinking Skynet. But AGNTCY works, too.\n\nCisco, LangChain, and Galileo are founding members of an open-source collective that is building critical infrastructure for agents to work together. They contend that while individual agents can handle small tasks, the real power is in groups of agents working together (like groups of humans working together) to accomplish bigger tasks.\n\nAn internet of agents\n\nCurrently, such interoperability and standardization are lacking. AGNTCY aims to define and specify an open and interoperable \"Internet of Agents\" to link AI agents that can transcend vendor and organizational boundaries (presumably with the appropriate security protocols in place).\n\nCisco brings its networking infrastructure expertise to the table. According to Guillaume De Saint Marc, vice president of engineering at Outshift by Cisco, \"We're at an inflection point in AI where the next wave of innovation will come from agents working together. Building this infrastructure as open source ensures it will serve the entire ecosystem, not just individual vendors.\"\n\nThe infrastructure for an Internet of Agents isn't in place yet. According to the team, the best possible multi-agent workflow requires finding the right agents for a given job, connecting them into efficient workflows that can function across frameworks and vendors, running them at scale, running them securely, monitoring performance, and improving and tweaking over time.\n\nAlso: How businesses are accelerating time to agentic AI value\n\nThe AGNTCY approach tries to avoid silos that can limit effectiveness. The purpose of the AGNTCY collective is to create open specifications and reference architectures built using open-source technologies to tackle \"the end-to-end requirements for sourcing, creating, scaling, and optimizing agentic workflows from a single app to thousands.\"\n\nHarrison Chase, CEO of LangChain, describes AGNTCY in this way: \"Multi-agent systems are the future of AI, but we need open standards for both collaboration and rigorous assessment. The AGNTCY creates the foundation for a truly observable and trustworthy AI ecosystem\u2026to ensure agents perform reliably across diverse scenarios, empowering organizations to deploy at scale.\"\n\nArchitecturally, the group envisions something like this:\n\nImage: Agntcy.org\n\nSome early specs\n\nAGNTCY is starting its work in three main areas. Interestingly, the group is publishing its specs for each of these elements on GitHub for you to review and provide feedback.\n\nAgent directory: This is pretty cool. It is essentially an app store for agents. You'll be able to search for agents based on specific capabilities and explore reputation and quality metrics. Here's a link to its spec for when the code\n\ndrops at the end of March on GitHub.\n\nThis is pretty cool. It is essentially an app store for agents.

One of the primary reasons open-source WordPress has become so ubiquitous on the web is that individual websites can be built using the WordPress framework and then selected from thousands of plugins that perform individual jobs.\n\nAlso: 4 ways to get your business ready for the agentic AI revolution\n\nMore than anything else, it looks like AGNTCY is trying to turn the world of AI agents into one of frameworks and plugins. That makes a ton of sense. It could make this whole thing much more manageable than the chaos of a world of unrestricted AI agents running wild.\n\nInvitation to participate\n\nThe AGNTCY founding team has asked for your help. You can participate by visiting agntcy.org or jump into the GitHub repos and look around.\n\nWhat do you think about AGNTCY's vision for an internet of agents? Do you see AI agents working together as the next big step in artificial intelligence, or do you think the risks outweigh the benefits?\n\nHave you explored any of the open-source specs they've released? How do you feel about the idea of a standardized agent directory, or do you think a decentralized approach would be better? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

It remains on track to surpass $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders in fiscal 2025. The increasing deployment of AI-powered robotics and industrial security augurs well for CSCO\u2019s industrial Internet-of-Things business. In the first half of fiscal 2025, orders grew more than 40%, along with growth of more than 50% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 alone.\n\nCisco\u2019s security business is being driven by robust demand for both Cisco Secure Access and XDR. Both solutions, on a combined basis, have amassed more than 1,000 customers in the trailing 12 months. Each of the products roughly has one million enterprise users.\n\nProduct orders rose 29% year over year (11% organically, excluding Splunk) in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Annualized Recurring Revenues (ARR) of $30.1 billion jumped 22% on a year-over-year basis, with product ARR growth of 41%. Remaining performance obligations at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were $41.3 billion, up 16% year over year, reflecting robust prospects.\n\nAt present, CSCO carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $3.71 per share, improved from an estimate of $3.65 per share in the past 30 days. Shares have gained 28.7% in the past year.\n\nNETGEAR: Headquartered in San Jose, CA, NETGEAR is a leading provider of advanced, high-performance and premium networking technologies and Internet-connected products for consumers, businesses and service providers.\n\nStrength in the NETGEAR for Business (\u201cNFB\u201d) segment and the premium products portfolio within the Connected Home (\u201cCHP\u201d) business bodes well. Driven by ongoing momentum for ProAV managed switch products (which grew in double digits year over year), revenues from NFB segment jumped 14.9% and 2.9% sequentially to $80.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Efforts to expand Wi-Fi LAN business is another tailwind.\n\nMoreover, it completed a successful destocking plan across CHP and NFB, leading to a $86 million reduction in inventory in 2024. This is expected to help the company align sell-in with sell-through with channel partners, thereby increasing revenue predictability. NTGR also witnessed a 25% spike in recurring services revenues in the quarter under review.\n\nThe company generated $35 million of recurring revenues in 2024. It now has 556,000 recurring subscribers. Increasing subscriber revenues are essential for long-term financial stability and cash flow generation. NETGEAR is confident to retain a competitive edge in new product introductions, based on the Wi-Fi 6 and 7 standards.\n\nHowever, management highlighted that within the NFB segment, though demand for its ProAV line of managed switches remains robust, it is witnessing lengthy lead times for supply.

So, we want the kids to cheat on their papers,\u2019 Extreme's CEO Ed Meyercord tells CRN about the company's 'next generation' AI strategy.\n\n\n\nDespite uncertainty in the competitive landscape and geopolitical factors at play, Extreme Networks continues to make strides against the biggest networking giants with an increasing win rate and a brand-new platform to unify all applications and features into one place for partners and end customers. Morrisville, N.C.-based Extreme Networks in December unveiled Extreme Platform One, an AI-infused platform to boil down networking and security management, as well as product licensing for enterprises and channel partners. The following month, Extreme launched its first, \"modern\" MSP program that includes the company\u2019s entire portfolio of networking, security and AI-powered offerings that partners can choose from and bundle with their own offerings. The new MSP program is based on Extreme Platform One. Extreme Networks in its most recent fiscal quarter posted revenues of $279.4 million, down 5.7 percent year-over-year, and growth of 14. 4 percent year over year for its SaaS subscription revenue. The company\u2019s win rates are improving, especially in the large enterprise market. At the same time, the company said that changes in the competitive market with the HPE-Juniper merger, which is currently the subject of a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as Cisco\u2019s recent acquisitions, are creating new opportunities for Extreme. That\u2019s thanks to the networking specialist\u2019s differentiated outlook on cloud networking focusing on integrated AI models and platforms, according to President and CEO Ed Meyercord. Extreme\u2019s CEO recently sat down with CRN to talk about its FY Q2 2025 earnings results, the recently announced Extreme Platform One and MSP program, and how the company is moving onto the next generation of AI, which will open even more doors for the channel. Here are excerpts from the conversation.\n\nTell us about how your new platform and MSP program are helping Extreme stand out in the networking market in 2025? We announced Extreme Platform One [in December] and really, the vision around that [is] we\u2019re pulling in and unifying all the applications as part of our networking portfolio into one place, and with that, providing a very different experience for the whole lifecycle of networking above and beyond the traditional, either cloud management or from an AI perspective, just AIOps, if you will. [Right now], our cloud management platform is ExtremeCloud IQ and the growth of the platform has been really successful. All of the different elements of our networking solutions, you can get to them through ExtremeCloud IQ, but they all have different user interfaces, effectively. So ,the idea is, we\u2019re unifying all these together, so you have a common user interface, common set of services, and then, importantly, common data [on Extreme Platform One]. That will be very helpful because, for example, you will be able to visualize and have a complete view of the network topology with our campus fabric, which is really a massive differentiator for us in the marketplace. Now from the cloud, you'll be able to visualize, deploy and configure and manage our campus fabric from the cloud. That's a big step up. The [new,] modern [MSP program] is built on [Extreme Platform One]. We have about [40] partners today that are on our MSP platform and people love it because of some of the capabilities we have when we look at consumption billing, for example, and the economics and the ease and simplicity of licensing and multi tenancy, etc. There's a lot of enhancements that are coming in terms of capabilities and what you can do from the cloud on this unified platform with all those applications coming into one, as well as capabilities from next-gen AI that built into the platform.\n\nHow is Extreme\u2019s so-called \u201csecond generation AI\u201d a stronger technology in the market compared to competing offerings? Networking and networks are inherently complex; inherently complicated. And almost everyone is talking about: \u201cHow do we make it simple?\u201d The most complicated of all, the most expensive of all and the least integrated solutions [are from] the largest player. Their policy was not to integrate. They acquire and don't integrate. Our nine applications are unifying. [The largest competitor] has [many more] and I don't know how long it would take them to unify that, but if you think about the capabilities and having everything in one place, a common set of services, common user interface, common data, and then this AI Expert that\u2019s there to guide you in whatever you want to do across all facets of network, not just troubleshooting and gen-one AIOps. We've had this gen-one AI technology for several years and was obviously competing against [Juniper] Mist. Mist did a great job with that gen-one solution, but this is fundamentally a step up into second-generation AI, and we believe will be first to market and we think it will create a noticeable difference in experience. We believe it's going to be an important ingredient to unlocking the channel. We\u2019ve embedded at the core of Extreme Platform One our AI engine. Instead of just having an AI capability for traditional machine learning AIops, which is what you know from Juniper Mist, it's what you know from our Copilot and ExtremeCloud IQ, this is where we have machine learning capabilities sitting on top of our cloud, looking at all the network elements in our cloud. In our case, we have over three million network access point, switches, etc., that are being managed from the cloud. And in this case, we can learn a lot about what's happening in networking environments. One of the things we can do, for example, is predict network failure. That was generation-one AI. Now what we're introducing is a much wider, more expansive use of AI from the journey of planning a network project, literally, you can just [tell] the AI expert: \"Here are the specs. This is what we're building. Configure the network consistent with my other network configurations\" \u2014 and boom: you'll have a network configuration and a network plan. So, all through the life cycle, in addition to network management prompts and issues, you'll be able to interact with and ultimately automate certain issues with the network. Let's say that you're a client and you lose a connection. We can diagnose why that happens. And in diagnosing why it happens, we see that this is something that repeats itself in your environment. So, we can say: Why did this happen? It gives an answer, and then over time, we can set it up to say: \"Let me know every time this happens and suggest a remediation.\" And then you\u2019ll have trust now, because you see that every time this incident occurs, this is the right fix, and it works. Now you trust the AI expert to do it on its own and we\u2019ve introduced this full automation. There\u2019s 10s and 10s of examples where we\u2019ll be in a position to deploy an AI agent to do these things for you \u2026 This is a much more expanded use of AI and this is something that that will fundamentally change the experience of people delivering networks.\n\nHow is Extreme using AI to more quickly train partners on its products, which is often a barrier to entry with new partners? This is really important for the channel \u2014 it\u2019s going to be so easy to train up and use our modern platform, and the reason is, you always have an AI expert at your side. So, we want the kids to cheat on their papers. What we're saying is: We want to help you fix the problem faster and in doing so, we\u2019re going to take what are months of training to become an expert on Extreme and we\u2019re going to boil that down into a few days, because the AI Expert is going to tell you what's happening in the network and it's going to recommend steps, or networking tasks \u2014 it\u2019s going to tell you what to do. For enablement and training for the channel, it means that it's much easier for your system engineers and your technical teams to train up on Extreme and become Extreme experts, and that for us is a big deal. With the competitive landscape today, historically, a barrier to entry has been that people are trained up on other's technology \u2014 like Cisco CCIEs and therefore, they don't want to spend all the time and energy to go train up on others' technology. In our case, now we're making it so easy. Our AI expert can tell them: \"If you\u2019re working in this environment, i.e. a competitor environment, here's the equivalent code for the Extreme environment.\" Our customers, end users, and the people that are delivering the network, are fundamentally going to have a different user experience with their teams across multiple personas. We also have an AI expert tool for partners on how to position our solutions competitively. We have tools to make it very easy to respond to RFPs, for example. So, we're way ahead on this next-generation AI, and we feel like this is where Extreme has a real advantage.",

So far, there has been no evidence that the vulnerability was abused in the wild.\n\nIn early February 2025, Cisco released patches for two critical-severity vulnerabilities plaguing its Identity Services Engine (ISE) solution. Both could have been used to run arbitrary commands and steal sensitive information.\n\nSince the fix was already deployed, it advised its customers to restart the application to apply the configuration changes.\n\nVia BleepingComputer",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 15\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 2.56%\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American multinational tech company that mainly specializes in networking hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment. The company continues to be a dominant player in enterprise networking, maintaining a strong presence in both traditional and cutting-edge network systems. The company holds a major share in areas like wireless access, switching, and routing, and also plays a key role in security and collaboration tools. As hybrid cloud solutions and flexible work models gain traction, Cisco is well-placed to take advantage of these shifts. In addition, its broad range of integrated security and networking features provides it with a competitive advantage in the market. In the past year, the stock has surged by nearly 30%.\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) recently reported strong earnings for fiscal Q2 2025, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 and revenue of $13.99 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 forecasts of $0.91 per share and $13.87 billion in sales. Revenue rose by 9.4% year-over-year, and AI infrastructure orders amounted to $350 million. Management highlighted that overall product orders grew by 29% compared to the previous year, or 11% when excluding the impact of Splunk.\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) maintained a strong cash position in the latest quarter. Operating cash flow surged to $2.2 billion, marking a 177% jump from the $0.8 billion recorded in the same period of fiscal 2024. By the end of the quarter, the company had close to $17 billion in cash and cash equivalents. On February 12, Cisco announced a 3% increase in its quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.41 per share. This adjustment extended its streak of consecutive annual dividend hikes to 18 years, which makes CSCO one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.56%, as of March 3.\n\nOverall, CSCO ranks 16th on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Linux and macOS implementations remain unaffected.\n\nSIP, a cornerstone of VoIP systems, transmits signaling data in cleartext unless encrypted. In vulnerable configurations, attackers intercepting SIP traffic can:\n\nReconstruct authentication headers to steal credentials.\n\nImpersonate legitimate users to access collaboration tools or linked services.\n\nExtract session details to hijack active calls or meetings.\n\nThe flaw\u2019s low attack complexity (CVSSv4.0: 0.6) and lack of required privileges make it accessible to opportunistic actors.\n\nCurrently, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability or public announcements.\n\nMitigation Strategies and Patch Deployment\n\nCisco automatically pushed configuration updates to enforce TLS/SRTP for SIP, but administrators must restart Webex applications to activate changes. Temporary workarounds include:\n\nEnforcing encrypted SIP transport via TLS 1.2+ and SRTP.\n\nRotating credentials for all BroadWorks-integrated accounts.\n\nAuditing log storage permissions to restrict plaintext credential access.\n\nHybrid deployments using Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) or third-party session border controllers (SBCs) must verify SIP header encryption end-to-end.\n\nNetwork segmentation and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can further isolate vulnerable components during patching.\n\nOrganizations using Cisco Webex for BroadWorks Release 45.2 on Windows must prioritize restarts and encryption audits.\n\nAs unified communications evolve, balancing legacy system integration with modern security protocols remains critical to thwarting opportunistic attacks.",

As such, Kerr calls FlexPod the result of a \u201cvery important relationship\u201d that Cisco and NetApp have. The concept has been on the market since 2010 and Cisco and NetApp have created more than 240 so-called validated designs (more on this below). Thus, entirely in line with the current trend, there is also a FlexPod AI. If we are not mistaken, that has been around for quite a long time, by the way. We seem to remember a Cisco Live in 2019 or 2020 where we talked about this with someone from NetApp as well.\n\nThe reasons for FlexPod\u2019s longevity and continued success are diverse, we hear from Kerr. \u201cThere are validated designs for many use cases, there is constant innovation in the platform and there is support from a single source despite being a multi-vendor offering,\u201d he summarizes some of the reasons. However, there are also some somewhat more fundamental reasons. We\u2019ll address those first below.\n\nFlexPod is Converged Infrastructure (CI)\n\nTo understand why FlexPod from Cisco and NetApp has endured and prospered for so long, it is important to start with the underlying concept. That is, FlexPod is an example of converged infrastructure (CI). This is a full stack of network, compute and storage delivered as one big finished product, so te speak. The storage component is from NetApp, network and compute from Cisco (Nexus/MDS switches and UCS servers, respectively).\n\nFlexPod is not only a complete stack in a rack. The individual components work together in the best way possible. This is where the aforementioned validated designs come into play. For each use case, Cisco and NetApp partners who deliver FlexPod to customers can build a stack. Hence, there are now more than 240 such designs. NetApp has created validated designs for several variants of its storage line (AFF, ASA) over the years.\n\nCI vs HCI With the rise of HCI (Hyperconverged Infrastructure), CI may have a somewhat stale image. After all, HCI is the variant in which the integration between the various components is more advanced. It is also a software-defined offering, where CI is fundamentally a hardware offering. With HCI, there is a software layer that allows you to manage everything centrally and in an integrated way. In the case of FlexPod, there is Intersight for the Cisco components and ONTAP for those from NetApp. It is possible to do some basic storage management in Intersight, for example, but if you want to go a little deeper you will still have to use ONTAP. However, the fact that HCI is there does not mean that CI has no added value. HCI is undoubtedly easier to use and manage in the basics. However, because of the deep integration within HCI, it is also a more rigid stack. CI is modular, so you can replace or extend components separately. That means you\u2019re more flexible and, in principle, it is easier to scale. With HCI, scaling often means adding an extra node right away, even if all you really want is more storage. With CI, you can basically scale storage separately from the rest. Kerr also sees the ability to scale up relatively easily as a big advantage of FlexPod for AI purposes. He sees FlexPod as a starting point for what organizations want to do with AI, albeit often after the first steps have been taken in the cloud. That depends on the use case, for which Cisco and NetApp must put together a validated design. If there is one, FlexPod is an excellent place to start. After all, the components are aligned, so the compute and storage can deliver the highest possible performance in the most efficient way possible. After that, it\u2019s easy to scale up. Finally, Kerr points out here the built-in security there is in FlexPod. This is obviously also crucial for AI workloads. Ultimately, it is important to recognize that HCI should not necessarily be seen as an improved version of CI. They are two converged variants that can coexist just fine. Based on customer requirements, one or the other is then preferable.\n\nKerr specifically singles out the ASA line in our conversation. \u201cAll ASA platforms have and are getting validated designs. This is constantly going on, which is a good thing because it [FlexPod, ed.] continues to build and grow.\u201d On the day of our conversation, during Cisco Live EMEA in Amsterdam, NetApp had just announced some new models in the ASA line. These models should serve the lower end of the market. Cisco and NetApp will create validated designs for these as well. NetApp also wants customers for FlexPod from these regions of the market. The reason is simple, says Kerr: \u201cThere are a lot of the same use cases there.\u201d Then a validated design for FlexPod is a logical next step.\n\nHowever, validated designs for NetApp\u2019s various storage lines (and Cisco\u2019s network and compute lines, of course), is not all there is to FlexPod. The workloads that must run on it also get the necessary attention. In part, of course, this is still about the underlying hardware the workloads run on. For example, mission-critical workloads such as VMware, Oracle, SAP, and more generally SQL typically run on block storage and thus ASA. Yet there are also validated designs of FlexPod specifically for VMware environments, for example.\n\nVMware has received a lot of attention over the past years, for obvious reasons. Kerr sees potential here for FlexPod. He calls it an \u201copportunity to innovate in the FlexPod install base.\u201d 80 percent of all NetApp\u2019s ONTAP systems deal with VMware environments, so the company is well positioned to help customers. \u201cWe support them whatever they want,\u201d Kerr summarizes. \u201cIf they want to move to an alternative hypervisor, we\u2019ll support them. If they want to move to the cloud, we\u2019ll support them with that, too.\u201d NetApp\u2019s deep integration and support with the major hyperscalers plays an important role here.\n\nMost VMware customers Kerr has spoken to, however, stay with VMware. They often have only one question, partly in response to price increases: \u201cHow can I optimize?\u201d That\u2019s where NetApp\u2019s years of expertise in these environments comes in. \u201cWe see it as an opportunity to modernize infrastructure using FlexPod, for existing and new customers,\u201d Kerr points out. Then, of course, the validated designs help: \u201cThose give the customer the assurance that they can deploy their VMware environments in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nFlexPod has many more years ahead of itself\n\nFlexPod doesn\u2019t really age, mainly thanks to the continuous stream of validated designs. It\u2019s more of a concept than a product, even though the big rack on the NetApp booth does say FlexPod, of course. However, you can\u2019t walk into a Cisco or NetApp building and say \u201cI want a FlexPod\u201d. Well, you can, of course, but then you don\u2019t walk out with a FlexPod. In fact, a partner of those vendors has to build it for you. You buy it through a CAPEX model or as-a-service.\n\nThanks to FlexPod\u2019s inherent flexibility, this stack from Cisco and NetApp will stay relevant for quite some time to come. As new products come out, so will new validated designs. Or as Kerr put it, \u201cThe theme here is constant innovation in a platform.\u201d From NetApp\u2019s perspective, it fits very well into the hybrid story it has been betting on for some time, thanks in part to its excellent links to hyperscalers. From Cisco\u2019s perspective, it fits well with the development of stacks that it has been betting on in other areas as well. Consider the announcement of AI POD a few months ago. We certainly haven\u2019t heard the last of FlexPod.\n\nAlso read: NetApp is building an Intelligent Data Infrastructure: what is it?",

            "content": "Published 03-04-25 Submitted by Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nThe need for sustainability is everywhere, including where we work.\n\nSustainability is an important consideration for businesses\u2014and with good reason. From rising global temperatures to unprecedented levels of plastic pollution, we are constantly reminded of the importance of this topic\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to meet with a lot of big companies every week\u2014and this topic comes up in all my interactions,\u201d says Snorre Kjesbu, SVP and GM of employee experiences at Cisco.\n\nHe is also fortunate in being able to help these companies out. As the person in charge of a portfolio of collaboration technologies enabling remote working and virtual meetings, he is already instrumental in helping to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions linked to business travel.\n\nAs of 2023, 12 percent of travel volume worldwide was for business, but the level is falling thanks to videoconferencing. The technology is also helping cut emissions linked to commuting, by allowing more people to work from home.\n\nCutting corporate carbon footprints is \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d says Kjesbu. \u201cIt\u2019s right that we use the scarce resources of the planet correctly.\u201d\n\nBut sustainability is also often good for the bottom line. Research from an industry body called the Energy Efficiency Movement shows the industrial sector could save $437 billion by 2030 by applying efficiency measures such as digitizing machinery and processing data in the cloud.\n\n\u201cThere is often a view that being sustainable costs more money, but that\u2019s not the case when it comes to efficiency,\u201d says Energy Efficiency Movement communication and marketing lead Lisa Bounoure. \u201cEfficiency offers clear return on investment.\u201d\n\nFor Kjesbu, this quest for efficiency does not stop at helping cut the GHG emissions involved in corporate meetings. Cisco, which has a goal to reach net zero GHG emissions across its value chain by 2040, is also striving to improve the lifecycle efficiency of its products.\n\nAs an example, 52% of the plastic in the Cisco Collaboration devices product line is post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. Kjesbu says that replaces the use of 154 tonnes of virgin plastic with plastic removed from the waste stream, an amount of plastic equal to 7 million rubber ducks per year.\n\nThe ENERGY STAR\u00ae-certified phones are also designed to require minimal amounts of metals, so even the top-end models in the series only weigh around a kilogram. Less weight means less energy is required to ship the phones in bulk, reducing supply chain costs and emissions.\n\nIn addition to using fewer materials in manufacturing, office devices are being designed to consume less energy throughout their lifecycle.. The new Cisco Board Pro, for instance, has been engineered to consume85-89 percent less power in standby mode versus Display Off.\n\nCutting standby power might not seem like a big deal, but all the devices currently in sleep mode around the world account for 1 percent of global carbon emissions, or about a third of the amount caused by aviation in 2023. And cutting these emissions can have a multiplier effect, says Kjesbu.\n\n\u201cIf you use less power in sleep mode, it also means you generate less heat and so you don\u2019t need to cool buildings as much,\u201d he notes.\n\nBut the real prize for office sustainability is to amplify such multiplier effects with digital technology. Smart building systems can determine whether a work area is being used and\u2014if not\u2014shut down lighting and heating systems automatically, potentially saving massive amounts of energy.\n\nAccording to the Energy Efficiency Movement, more than 40 percent of the energy used in a typical commercial building is for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)\u2014and around 35 percent of it is wasted.\n\nHowever, a digital building management system with artificial intelligence can help cut HVAC emissions by up to 40 percent, while slashing 25 percent off operating costs.\n\nThis is a remarkable sustainability gain, but Kjesbu has another sustainable office equipment design trick up his sleeve: making things last longer. \u201cIf you design products that last longer, you will buy fewer and have a smaller footprint,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big difference if a product lasts four years or seven years,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn taking sustainability to heart, Cisco is staying ahead of a growing workplace trend.\n\nSustainability is an increasingly important factor in office design,\" says John Stephan, a building products and services deal advisory partner at the accountancy firm BDO.\n\n\u201cFrom building materials to office-based technologies, we are seeing a growing appetite for options that reduce waste and emissions,\" he says.\n\nAs far as the planet is concerned, that is a healthy appetite indeed\u2014and one that conscious corporations such as Cisco are happy to satisfy.\n\nView original content here.",

Credit: Jorge Elizaquibel via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has just added new exploits to its actively exploited list, as first noticed by BleepingComputer .\n\nCISA's actions basically serve as a warning to U.S. federal agencies about vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild.\n\nOne exploit being tracked, CVE-2023-20118 , allows hackers to remotely \"execute arbitrary commands\" on certain VPN routers. These routers include Cisco Small Business Routers RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325.\n\n\"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface,\" CISA wrote. \"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and access unauthorized data.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

However, as BleepingComputer points out , hackers could take advantage of another vulnerability, CVE-2023-20025, in order to bypass authentication.\n\nAnother vulnerability added by CISA is CVE-2018-8639. This bug affects a broad swath of Windows operating systems including Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Servers.\n\nAccording to CISA, this vulnerability \"exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory.\" A bad actor with local access to the vulnerable system can utilize the exploit to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. BleepingComputer reports that a bad actor could use this vulnerability to \"alter data or create rogue accounts with full user rights to take over vulnerable Windows devices.\"\n\nMicrosoft and Cisco have not yet released their own security warning regarding these two exploits.",

It also ensures smooth transitions to human agents when necessary.\n\nIn doing so, it utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic dialogue and context management. Yet, it also follows structured workflows, so contact centers can balance rules- and generative processes.\n\nSumming up, Kathuria explained that Cisco\u2019s collaboration with Epic \u201cshows how integrating advanced communication tools\u201d leads to better patient outcomes and creates \u201ca fully connected healthcare experience.\u201d\n\nThe integration \u2013 developed through the Epic Toolbox program \u2013 will soon be released in beta testing.\n\nCCaaS and CRM Convergence: A Trend to Watch Out for\n\nThe Webex-Epic announcement is yet another example of contact center providers embedding their tools natively into CRM platforms to converge the customer service ecosystem.\n\nRecently, Talkdesk embedded Contact Center tools into Epic Cheers.\n\nThe capabilities include call controls and conversation management tools from the Talkdesk Healthcare Experience Cloud.\n\nElsewhere, both Genesys and Five9 have embedded CCaaS capabilities into Salesforce Service Cloud and ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM), too.\n\nThese next-generation integrations aim to drive accelerated time to value, as one coordinated system will typically lower the burden of managing two distinct platforms.\n\nAnother benefit is simplified agent experiences, as agents aren\u2019t constantly switching between platforms. This simplification also helps unify customer service data.\n\nFinally, they centralize service data, which will help to drive AI innovation across the customer support space and enable a more complete view of the customer\u2019s experience.",

While it requires valid administrative credentials, this can still be achieved by chaining the CVE-2023-20025 authentication bypass, which provides root privileges.\n\nCisco says in an advisory published in January 2023 and updated one year later that its Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of CVE-2023-20025 publicly available proof-of-concept exploit code.\n\nThe second security bug (CVE-2018-8639) is a Win32k elevation of privilege flaw that local attackers logged into the target system can exploit to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. Successful exploitation also allows them to alter data or create rogue accounts with full user rights to take over vulnerable Windows devices.\n\nAccording to a security advisory issued by Microsoft in December 2018, this vulnerability impacts client (Windows 7 or later) and server (Windows Server 2008 and up) platforms.\n\nToday, CISA added the two vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which lists security bugs the agency has tagged as exploited in attacks. As mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies now have three weeks, until March 23, to secure their networks against ongoing exploitation.\n\n\"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,\" CISA said today.\n\nMicrosoft and Cisco have not yet updated their security advisories after CISA tagged the two vulnerabilities as actively exploited in attacks.\n\nIn early February, CISA also announced that a critical Microsoft Outlook remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2024-21413) is now being exploited in ongoing attacks and ordered federal agencies to patch their systems by February 27.",

The company is known worldwide for its data center switching, indoor and outdoor wireless coverage designed for seamless roaming use of voice, video, and data applications, and network security, identity, and access management offerings.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nAlthough the company comes with a significant global reach, CSCO has fallen 3.6% since hitting a 52-week high of $66.50 on February 13. On the bright side, the company\u2019s shares have surged 8.1% over the past three months, compared to The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 2.6% decline over the same time period.\n\nMoreover, in the longer term, CSCO shares have surged 28.6% over the past six months and 33.4% over the past 52 weeks. By contrast, XLK has gained 2.8% over the past six months and has surged 10.2% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, CSCO has been trading well above its 50-day moving average since mid-August last year and over its 200-day moving average since mid-September.\n\nOn Feb. 25, CSCO shares surged 1.6% following the announcement of an expanded partnership with NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to provide AI technology solutions to enterprises. The company\u2019s announcement successfully raised investors\u2019 confidence and solidified CSCO\u2019s position in the industry.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s stock surged marginally on February 12 following its Q2 earnings release. Cisco reported a 9% year-over-year increase in its revenue, which amounted to $14 billion. Also, its EPS came in at $0.77, surpassing the Wall Street EPS estimates by 4.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, in the competitive communication technology arena, CSCO\u2019s rival, Arista Networks Inc (ANET), has lagged behind CSCO over the past six months, with shares surging 9.1%. However, it outpaces CSCO with 36.3% returns over the past 52 weeks.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street analysts remain moderately bullish on CSCO\u2019s prospects. The stock holds a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 19 analysts covering it. The mean target of $122.98 suggests a potential upside of 32.2% from the current market prices.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~12.8%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~17.2x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is engaged in designing, manufacturing, and selling Internet Protocol-based networking and other products associated with the communications and information technology industry. The company has a strong moat because of its healthy brand reputation, extensive product portfolio, customer switching costs, innovative technology, and global presence. Citi analyst Atif Malik upped the company\u2019s price target to $73 from $71, keeping a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. Nvidia, while reporting its Q4 2025 and FY 2025 results, highlighted that its enterprise data center sales grew two times YoY due to accelerating demand for model finetuning and agentic-AI workflows. Citi opines that such comments aid Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\u2019s recent partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNotably, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is Citi\u2019s top communications equipment pick in 2025, thanks to the growing AI opportunity and the relatively undemanding valuation. The company\u2019s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure and networking solutions places it well to capitalize on the strong demand for AI-related technologies. With enterprises adopting AI workloads, they need strong networking capabilities to support the data-intensive applications. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\u2019s expertise in networking, together with its investments in AI-specific products and services, can result in strong revenue growth. Its ability to offer end-to-end solutions for AI infrastructure might offer a competitive edge and open new market opportunities.\n\nOverall CSCO ranks 9th on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite Cisco\u2019s 2022 advisories for similar flaws in RV340/RV345 routers, many organizations continue using EoL devices due to cost or operational inertia.\n\nThis incident mirrors past incidents, such as the 2024 XSS flaw (CVE-2024-20362) in the same router series, which also lacked patches.\n\n\u201cOrganizations should use the KEV catalog as an input to their vulnerability management prioritization framework,\u201d CISA added.\n\nWith CVE-2023-20118 now weaponized, organizations must reassess reliance on unsupported hardware. Cybersecurity teams should:\n\nAudit networks for affected Cisco RV routers.\n\nEnforce strict access controls and network segmentation.\n\nMonitor logs for anomalous HTTP requests to /login.cgi or /admin endpoints.\n\nAs threat actors increasingly target edge devices such as routers, adherence to CISA\u2019s requirements is no longer optional but rather a necessary component of modern cybersecurity.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago, Cisco announced Agile Services Networking. With this, the company wants to give service providers a blueprint or basic architecture for their networks. Today at Mobile World Congress, Cisco announces an expansion already. It is expanding Agile Services Networking to include ThousandEyes Connected Devices and something it calls Provider Connectivity Assurance.\n\nCisco Agile Services Networking is actually a combination of several components. Routers with Silicon One silicon form the basis of the architecture. There is also a lot of focus on simplifying this type of networking. The same software is used across the board, for example, but Cisco is also looking for convergence in the area of optics, the actual connections. Coherent Pluggable Optics should go some way to achieving this.\n\nFor more on the initial announcement of Cisco Agile Services Networking, read our article from a few knowles ago. We focus in the remainder of this article on the two new additions to this architecture.\n\nThousandEyes Connected Devices\n\nFirst, we look at ThousandEyes Connected Devices. Cisco has been integrating ThousandEyes into more and more parts of its own offerings in recent years. Today it is the turn of the service provider network. This expansion allows service providers to focus even more on the subscribers\u2019 user experience. It gives them more insight into the so-called last mile, in this case the user\u2019s own network.\n\nWith the addition of ThousandEyes Connected Devices, service providers can start competing with each other in a different way. Until now, it has often been about the speed of the connection a provider can provide. However, that is becoming less and less distinctive. With ThousandEyes Connected Devices, providers can now also measure and monitor actual performance in subscribers\u2019 home or business network in real time. This should make it possible to take the user experience (and thus the Net Promoter Score, so important in that world) to a higher level. Virgin Media O2 is already using it to drive their Smart Support service.\n\nProvider Connectivity Assurance\n\nThe second piece of news around Cisco Agile Services Networking actually focuses on something similar to the first one we discussed above. That is, Provider Connectivity Assurance (the name Cisco gave its recent Accedian acquisition) is also about user experience, but for mobile networks. It\u2019s about offering deeper insights into things like throughput, latency and finding out in real time how applications are performing on the network.\n\nIf providers use this new functionality, they can improve the user experience, reduce network congestion, maximize speed and make dynamic adjustments to spectrum usage. At least that is the thinking behind Provider Connectivity Assurance. For Odido Netherlands, at least, it is a very welcome addition from Cisco. Particularly because of the introduction of its Klik & Klaar (Click & Ready, in English) Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) offering, a feature such as Provider Connectivity Assurance is of great importance to the company.\n\nAll in all, the conclusion of the article we linked back to above holds true here as well. Cisco does not waste time when it comes to innovating in the networking space lately. Less than a month after the basis for Agile Services Networking was announced, it already expands it. That raises expectations toward the future. Not so much from us, but especially from the service providers. They can expect even more innovation with which they can compete in other ways.",

Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says Bitcoin Created \u201cFroth\u201d In The Market. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE cost-cutting efforts on the US government and how action against smaller agencies such as USAID can translate into action against larger agencies and programs.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201cBut I do think that when the Defense Department is on the [inaudible], and then Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, Medicare, Medicaid, I don\u2019t know a soul who thinks that there isn\u2019t fat in there. And I also think that, kind of like the labor department, with the unemployment number we really don\u2019t know what it is we have big revisions, if we had, if we gave to Salesforce, I don\u2019t know. . .I think that, if we gave these companies, literally outsourced these companies, I know people are going to say, Jim you are like, that is so right wing, but if there\u2019s, the machines are better. . \u201c\n\nCramer also commented on recent Bitcoin price action which saw the cryptocurrency dip below the $90,000 mark. He linked Bitcoin as being a \u201cproxy for the fact that we have thirty-six trillion in debt.\u201d Cramer also wondered how much of the gain in Bitcoin\u2019s price was due to Michael Saylor\u2019s firm adding the currency to its balance sheet.\n\nCramer added that his team has concluded that so much of the \u201cfroth\u201d in the market in untested areas such as quantum computing came from Bitcoin. He outlined: \u201cThe reason why we\u2019ve had so much froth . . .we think that Bitcoin got people very excited about things that are space age and that the fundament of speculation is Bitcoin. That\u2019s what turned it all on.\u201d\n\nAnother topic that caught the CNBC TV host\u2019s attention was the mergers and acquisition environment in the Trump administration. After the President\u2019s election victory in November, investors were ecstatic as they believed that the new administration could create a healthy environment for deals. Commenting on how the rules of the market still remained the same, Cramer outlined:\n\n\u201cLook you can enforce the rules two ways. You can use the rules and talk. Or you can prosecute using the rules. And they\u2019re not going to prosecute. They\u2019re going to have discussions. They are not going to do it the way that Biden did.\u201d\n\nHe also shared that the \u201csize\u201d of the deals that are taking place is \u201cmicroscopic\u201d and added that \u201cThe M&A and the IPO markets are as dead as I have ever seen them.\u201d\n\nApart from the M&A sector, another sector he discussed was the consumer packaged goods. These firms have struggled amidst high input prices and inflation. Cramer believes \u201cThey should all, the consumer packaged goods companies, should merge. Because they\u2019re pathetic. They\u2019re pathetic parodies of stocks. . . which by the way I really like them.\u201d\n\nFinally, he also commented on the poor performance of Mag 7 stocks and inflation. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cI mean, I keep thinking about what you said about the Mag 7, and their ability to be able to affect spending. If that\u2019s the case, look, the Fed is, Austan Goolsbee, whom I really, really like, he\u2019s been waffling. I wish he went the other way. Because I think the data says, that he would have been right. Except for insurance, stake, eggs, okay. These are bad. Insurance, steak, and eggs. And then entertainment is just ridiculous. If Swift were to cut the prices of her tickets, we would have a rate cut immediately.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 25th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 84\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking and data center equipment provider. Its shares are up by a modest 32% over the past year as the firm has navigated a tough non-AI market by focusing on AI networking equipment and cutting down its workforce to manage costs. Cramer\u2019s comments about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) surrounded the firm\u2019s recent deal with AI GPU giant NVIDIA. Through the deal, the pair will work on NVIDIA\u2019s ethernet connectivity system. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about NVIDIA. And there is a nice deal this morning with Cisco. I think it\u2019s actually much more important than people realize. Cisco\u2019s the first to qualify. It\u2019s going to be a real partnership. And that uh Chuck Robbins working closely with Jensen. But there is an overwhelming sense that this market keys on NVIDIA at a moment when we have no idea what the federal government\u2019s gonna do to NVIDIA.\u201d\n\nOverall CSCO ranks 9th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

As new leadership emerges in Jacksonville, changes are on the horizon, and one player who may be on the brink of a significant career shift is safety Andre Cisco.\n\nCisco, a native New Yorker and the Jaguars\u2019 third-round pick from Syracuse in the 2021 NFL Draft, has shown flashes of potential during his professional career. However, his future with the Jaguars appears uncertain, with speculation mounting that a change of scenery may be on the cards for the talented safety.\n\nIn a recent ESPN article titled \u201c32 NFL Players Who Need A Change of Scenery This Offseason,\u201d Michael DiRocco highlighted Cisco\u2019s struggles in Jacksonville, pointing out his inconsistency and defensive lapses. Despite recording interceptions and forced fumbles, Cisco\u2019s performance in 2024 fell short of expectations, contributing to the team\u2019s defensive woes.\n\nWith 229 total tackles, eight interceptions, and 24 passes defended in 63 regular-season games for the Jaguars, Cisco has demonstrated his value as a defensive playmaker. As he enters his age 25 season, the talented safety presents an enticing prospect for teams seeking to bolster their defense.\n\nCould Cisco\u2019s future lie beyond Jacksonville, potentially beckoning him back to his hometown of New York? As rumors swirl about his potential departure from the Jaguars, the franchise may turn to veteran Andrew Wingard to fill the void. Wingard, a seasoned player with a successful tenure in Jacksonville since 2019, could step up to the challenge if Cisco departs.\n\nAs the offseason unfolds, all eyes are on Andre Cisco as he stands at a career crossroads, poised for a potential move that could redefine his trajectory in the NFL. Whether he remains in Jacksonville or embarks on a new chapter elsewhere, the talented safety\u2019s journey is one to watch closely as he navigates the uncertain waters of professional football.",

            "content": "Video conferencing services have become invaluable for businesses of all sizes, whether for connecting a far-flung remote workforce or facilitating meetings with clients across the globe. That's why PCMag tests and rates the leading video conferencing software. In the process, we've learned that different products serve diverse needs. Zoom, for example, began as a service for individuals and small teams and has grown into a full-on business platform called Zoom Workplace. Webex by Cisco, meanwhile, has a long history of catering to businesses scaling all the way up to giant enterprises. Both are Editors' Choice winners. Still others specialize in mass-audience applications, such as webinars and online training, so it's worth exploring all our top picks. Make sure to click through to our in-depth reviews and scroll past the list for advice on choosing the best video conferencing service for your company.\n\nSince 1982, PCMag has tested and rated thousands of products to help you make better buying decisions. Read our editorial mission\n\nTable of Contents Best Video Conferencing App Overall Best for Small to Midsize Enterprises Best for SMB-Friendly Web Conferencing Best for Free Tier of Service Best for Google Workspace Customers Best for Standalone Small Business Video Conferencing Best for Events and Webinars Best for Microsoft 365 Organizations Best for Zoho Customers What Is Video Conferencing Software? How Much Does Video Conferencing Software Cost? What Can Video Conferencing Software Do for You? What Equipment Do You Need for Video Conferencing? How to Buy Video Conferencing Software\n\nZoho would like to be your one-stop shop for business apps, and if you've already bought into the broader Zoho ecosystem, you should give Zoho Meetings a look. It could also meet your needs if you're on a particularly tight budget. However, when using it as a standalone solution, you may find you can get more bang for your buck elsewhere.\n\nWhile it lacks the bells and whistles of some of its competitors, Zoho Meetings' appeal lies in its low price. Unlike many of the services in our roundup, it offers a free tier that lets you host meetings for up to 100 attendees. It also integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Zoho business software suite.\n\nDie-hard Microsoft shops should take note: If you're already using Teams\u2014and particularly if you're a Microsoft 365 customer\u2014it may be all the video conferencing software you need. On the other hand, if you're not all-in on the Microsoft way of doing things, and all you want is video conferencing, we recommend you look elsewhere.\n\nMicrosoft has a pattern of steadily piling features into its products, and Teams is no different. It has risen from humble beginnings to become a team collaboration behemoth and a core part of the Microsoft 365 suite. More importantly, unlike some competitors (such as Slack), it's also a full-featured video conferencing system that's suitable for far more than one-to-one video calls.\n\nIf you need to conduct online training sessions or webinars, ClickMeeting should be on your shortlist. It focuses on these types of events rather than peer-to-peer and small team collaboration.\n\nUnlike most of the video conferencing solutions we've tested, ClickMeeting specializes in large online meetings and webinars. It claims to support up to 10,000 participants at its custom enterprise tier, but even its more basic plans can scale up to 1,000 attendees. The service has an accessible and sleek interface, making it a sound choice for any company looking to reach a mass audience.\n\nAs a standalone video conferencing solution, GoToMeeting is a dependable offering, but it lacks some features you'd want for general-purpose video meetings. It's best suited for use cases like webinars, contact centers, and remote IT management, especially when paired with GoTo's other software for those markets.\n\nGoToMeeting is a mature video conferencing solution from GoTo, the company formerly known as LogMeIn. It offers a good balance between features and cost, and it includes competitive features like smart transcription and unlimited recording to the cloud. It also integrates with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 calendars.\n\nGoogle Meet is a no-brainer if you use Google Workspace for online collaboration. It's very reliable and easy to use.\n\nGoogle Meet is an excellent general-purpose video conferencing platform that's accessible from virtually any device. Its real-time transcription feature is top-notch and supports more languages than any competitor. The platform offers extensive Gemini AI assistance, albeit via an add-on. Tight integrations with other Google tools make it especially attractive to Google Workspace users.\n\nIf you're looking for a video conferencing solution that's well-integrated with a business VoIP system, RingCentral is an excellent choice. Both functions are built into the same app, with an appealing user interface. Also, it delivers more at no cost than any other system we looked at. Be aware, though, that it doesn't yet deliver all the capabilities of more mature competitors.\n\nRingCentral is well-respected for its business communication technologies, most notably its voice-over-IP (VoIP) solution. RingCentral Video is its entry into the video conferencing market, and while it's playing catch-up to some of the more established players, it's still a solid offering. One appealing feature is its generous free pricing tier, which lets you conduct meetings with up to 100 attendees and lasting as long as 24 hours at a time.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with its user interface and controls, AnyMeeting is hard to beat. The one caveat is that it lacks certain webinar-oriented features, such as breakout rooms.\n\nIntermedia AnyMeeting is an attractive, easy-to-use service that's packed with enough features to suit any organization. We especially liked its AI-powered Virtual Assistant, which delivers reasonably high-quality transcriptions of video meetings and can even flag action items based on what's said during the call. And, as comprehensive as it is, AnyMeeting's pricing is on par with most of its competitors.\n\nWebex is an excellent choice for businesses anticipating rapid growth because it scales well. It's also available on virtually every mobile and desktop platform, including Linux. If AI-enhanced features are important to you, Cisco's AI assistant is among the most sophisticated.\n\nWebex was one of the pioneering video conferencing systems and continues to be highly competitive among current options. It delivers reliable performance and rich collaboration features such as breakout rooms, screen-sharing, and whiteboards. Webex now even has an advanced AI assistant that can transcribe meetings and give you a quick recap if you have to step away briefly. It's not the most affordable service we've reviewed, but a highly capable free tier makes it easy to get started.\n\nBetween its superb core video conferencing features and advanced collaboration tools, Zoom is the best all-around video conferencing platform we've tested. The free tier is workable, though businesses should prepare to pay for a premium plan to get the most out of it.\n\nZoom Meetings is now just one part of Zoom Workplace, a unified communication and collaboration platform that provides document editing, team chat, whiteboard sharing, and more. It aims to reduce the \"toggle tax\" that occurs when you switch between multiple applications. Zoom's industry-leading AI Assistant can even summarize in-progress meetings and answer any questions you might have about what another participant said earlier.\n\nWhat Is Video Conferencing Software?\n\nVideo conferencing software continues to evolve. Initially, it was available only in the form of pricey conference room systems that combined specific hardware and software. Now, however, popular cloud-based services require little dedicated infrastructure and largely work within a browser.\n\nContemporary video conferencing systems have a cornucopia of capabilities that their predecessors never did. Best-in-class video conferencing services offer broadcasting modes for passive viewers (also known as webinars), digital whiteboard collaboration, file exchange, remote desktop access, screen sharing, text chat, and more. Additionally, some services integrate with business voice over IP (VoIP) packages, enabling users to convert voice calls to video calls or initiate a shared meeting at the touch of a button without interrupting the original connection.\n\n(Credit: Getty/Ariel Skelley )\n\nHow Much Does Video Conferencing Software Cost?\n\nLike most software-as-a-service (SaaS), video conferencing providers offer multiple pricing tiers. The lowest tier is free for many of the services we test. These offerings are great for connecting with friends and family and for occasional business use. However, they have limited features and place restrictions on how long meetings can be and how many people can attend. Organizations that plan to use video conferencing as an everyday tool should invest in a paid service.\n\nAmong the services we reviewed, the median pricing for business-grade service is around $13 per user per month. Most also offer more expensive tiers for enterprises. As usual, the greater your needs, the more you should expect to pay.\n\nAlthough most services charge by the number of users, others charge by the number of hosts. Services that charge per host are generally primarily for webinars, in which only a host can initiate a meeting (and meetings typically have many attendees). On the other hand, services that charge per person are usually for peer-to-peer usage, in which anyone can start a meeting.\n\nWhat Can Video Conferencing Software Do for You?\n\nVideo conferencing has quickly become an essential business tool, particularly given the rise of remote work. The products in this roundup all offer video calls via webcam, typically alongside several other features, such as text chat.\n\nUnderstanding what constitutes a video conferencing platform can be confusing since some team messaging platforms, like Microsoft Teams and Slack, offer the same features. Teams offers a complete video conferencing solution, which is why we include it. Slack and some of its competitors just have person-to-person video calling, so they don't make the list. The solutions we've reviewed here can all support multi-party video meetings.\n\nBeyond video calling, you likely want a few additional capabilities. Screen sharing is essential for presentations. You may also want to look for more granular options, such as the ability to share just one application, document, or image rather than the entire desktop. Many packages also support video annotation and virtual whiteboards, which foster participant collaboration.\n\nMost of the video conferencing services in this roundup also offer a text chat mode during meetings and sometimes outside of video calls.\n\nMany services offer automated recording that you can initiate with the press of a button. Typically, they save recordings to cloud storage and automatically share them with all meeting attendees. If you think this is a feature you will use often, make sure the service tier you choose offers sufficient storage capacity. Alternatively, you can integrate it with your existing third-party cloud storage provider.\n\nRecently, video conferencing vendors started to aggressively introduce artificial intelligence (AI) to their systems. Applications include analytics and optimization, automatic call summaries and transcription, call scheduling, facial recognition, noise cancellation, and more.\n\nWhat Equipment Do You Need for Video Conferencing?\n\nBeyond the video conferencing software, you should also consider the hardware you need. Fortunately, almost every modern laptop, tablet, and smartphone has an integrated microphone and a serviceable (if fairly mediocre) camera. Many modern laptops and higher-end mobile devices ship with high-quality 1080p webcams.\n\nDesktop PCs, on the other hand, typically require additional hardware. If you're looking for crisp sound or video quality, you need the best microphone and high-end webcam you can get. Some business monitors also come with built-in video conferencing features. You can use some digital cameras as a webcam, too.\n\nFor most use cases, consumer-grade hardware is all you need. Then again, if you want the highest possible video quality for webinars and client meetings, you might need to buy extra lighting accessories.\n\nAlthough these hardware purchases drive up the total cost of your video conferencing deployment, you still save compared with old-school, end-to-end conferencing solutions. You don't need to make a huge capital outlay all at once. Instead, you can buy the licenses you need and add new seats as necessary, a method that can dramatically reduce costs.\n\nHow to Buy Video Conferencing Software\n\nAt first glance, choosing the right video conferencing service for your organization can seem challenging because most offer the same basic features. But you still need to evaluate several factors before making your decision. Assessing the software's overall user experience is a good place to start.\n\nIn each review, we discuss the ease of signing up, creating a meeting, inviting participants, and setting up audio and video controls. We also look at the experience from a meeting invitees' point of view and how easy it is to access smart meeting controls, such as annotation, file sharing, virtual assistants, and whiteboard-style collaboration.\n\nWe've also tested each service's prominent features, but it's up to you to decide which ones you need most. For example, do you need dial-in numbers, VoIP integration, or both? How about features like screen sharing or remote control? Some services offer teleconferencing with dial-in numbers (local or toll-free) and VoIP calling, while others provide just one or the other. A few offer international dial-in numbers.\n\nDuring our testing, we hosted and joined meetings to evaluate the experience of registered and non-registered users. We made sure to outline how easy it is to join a meeting, including whether a participant needs to download software before joining (which could cause a delay or even be a deal breaker). Other services simply require that attendees enter a code to access the meeting.\n\nOur reviews also cover the host's administration features. The best services let you set up various types of meetings, such as lecture-style calls in which all participants are on mute or a Q&A mode in which presenters can mute and unmute participants as necessary. Other options include allowing break-out sessions, creating a waiting room while preparing for the meeting, locking latecomers out of a meeting, and turning webcams on and off.\n\nMost of these services offer at least a 30-day free trial, so you can test the product that looks most attractive to you. Make sure to include relevant stakeholders in your decision-making process, both within and outside your organization.",

Dysart just made more plays down the stretch than we did. We made a few too many mistakes down there and probably lost four minutes of the game and it definitely cost us.\u201d\n\nWhen Llamas made a 3-pointer with 5:01 left, Sahuaro led 47-40.\n\nIn less than 2 minutes, Dysart led 49-47.\n\nTough loss for No. 1 Sahuaro.\n\nShot doesn\u2019t fall after the steal of the inbound pass and the Cougars lose 55-54 to No. 8 Dysart. pic.twitter.com/St6sZDn52e \u2014 Javier Morales (@JavierJMorales) March 1, 2025\n\nSantiago Leyva, who controlled the paint for most of the game, got one of many offensive rebounds and scored while being fouled. He made the free throw.\n\nSahuaro couldn\u2019t convert on the other end and Ashton Havvard made a 3-pointer.\n\nAfter another failed Cougar possession, Leyva drilled a 3-pointer and the Demons led 49-47 with 3:30 left.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was just a matter of keeping our composure, keep trying to attack the rim, and the boys were able to do that,\u201d Dysart coach Keegan Cook said.\n\nLeyva, a 6-foot-5 junior center, finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds. He had 11 points in the pivotal fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cHe played tremendous,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe really stepped up to the task. Their big (Sahuaro 6-7 post player Jamal Ali) is a really good player. (Leyva) had his hands full all night with him. Offensively, he was asked to do a lot, too, and he was able to get to the rim a little bit, knocked down some free throws at the end.\u201d\n\nA putback by Leyva and then a jumper by Lamar Anderson capped Dysart\u2019s 13-2 run that put the Demons ahead 53-49 with 1:54 left.\n\nJamal McCraney made a strong move to the basket to cut the lead to 53-51 with 1:31 remaining.\n\nSahuaro (22-5) couldn\u2019t score in its next two possessions and Leyva made one of two free throws on two different occasions to put Dysart up 55-51 with 8.1 seconds left.\n\nSahuaro Class of 2026 guard Cisco Llamas finished with 27 points in the 55-54 loss to Dysart in the 4A quarterfinals.

Rebounding was our biggest deal. We should\u2019ve boxed out more. They had a lot of second-chance points.\u201d\n\nLlamas has shown maturity since his freshman season.

He can reach 300 career wins next season. His record is 287-124.\n\nLast year\u2019s championship appearance against Glendale Deer Valley was his first in a title game. That occurred after the Cougars defeated Dysart at Sahuaro in a quarterfinal game.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, Dysart defeated the Cougars at Sahuaro in another 4A quarterfinal game.\n\nThree straight years, three quarterfinal matchups at Sahuaro between the Cougars and Demons. The teams also met in the early rounds of the playoffs at Dysart in 2018-19 and 2019-20 with the Demons prevailing both times.\n\n\u201cComing down here all three years, I felt like we were very even,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe (Henry) runs a great program, and we\u2019re lucky enough to be able to come out of it with a win two times down here.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a great matchup coming in here. I knew going into it, it was going to be a battle. That guards that they have, man, defensively, they\u2019re really tough. They really get after it.\u201d\n\nHenry\u2019s summer will include hosting a summer league in June. The league is one of the many elements that help Sahuaro be a model program in Southern Arizona and the state.\n\nNever having a losing season in a 15-year span is incredible. Greatness becomes an expectation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good place right now,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of hard-work and character guys. That\u2019s what leads to success when you have guys who are willing to come in and put in that hard work all the time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got right now. We\u2019ve got guys who look to the seniors and they see how hard they work. It sort of inspires the younger guys to come in and put in that work, too.

He added four carries for 98 yards and a score on the ground.\n\nWhen asked what he expects to run in his 40-yard dash on Saturday, Bond didn't skip a beat: \"I'm going to break the record tomorrow for sure,\" he said.\n\nCurrently, former Texas, Kansas City Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy holds the record at 4.21 seconds. Bond says he anticipates running a 4.20 or even into the 4.1s.\n\nTime will tell, but the standout receiver out of Texas says he ran a 4.23 40-yard dash during training ahead of the Combine.\n\nOthers worth monitoring: Matthew Golden, Texas; Luther Burdern III, Missouri; Tre Harris, Ole Miss; Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State\n\nWhen to tune in: Saturday, 1 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nJaguars NFL Draft needs include trenches, secondary\n\nCornerback: Jacksonville's experiment with Ronald Darby opposite Tyson Campbell at cornerback failed last year. While Montaric \"Buster\" Brown has shown promise, the team can't enter 2025 without a sure thing at the position. Especially when you factor in Campbell has missed 11 games the last two seasons combined.\n\nSafety: Starter Andre Cisco is about to test the free agency market, and there has been no contact between the team and Cisco regarding a potential extension.\n\nGuard: Starting right guard Brandon Scherff is set to be a free agent once his contract voids. The Jaguars do not have a capable backup plan after Cooper Hodges sustained another season-ending injury last year. This spot will be a priority.\n\nDefensive lineman/EDGE: The Jaguars got 18.5 sacks out of their edge rushers last year. Five other defensive linemen posted sacks with rookie Maason Smith (three) leading the way. Roy Robertson-Harris (two sacks) was traded after Week 6. The Jaguars finished with 34 total sacks. They also ranked 24th in rushing yards allowed per game with 132.6.\n\nJaguars NFL Draft picks\n\nThe Jaguars hold 10 picks in this year's draft. Here are their current positions:\n\nRound 1: (No. 5)\n\nRound 2: (No. 36)\n\nRound 3: (Nos. 70, 88)\n\nRound 4: (Nos. 105, 124)\n\nRound 5: (No. 141)\n\nRound 6: (Nos. 180, 192)\n\nRound 7: (No. 221)\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

This marks a notable shift in India's role within the global supply chain, transitioning from a net importer to an exporter of these components.Thanks to Government of India's initiatives like Make in India and Product Linked Incentive (PLI), Apple suppliers like Motherson Group, Jabil, Aequs, and Tata Electronics are producing key components in India, contributing to the development of a local electronics manufacturing ecosystem. This initiative is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its supply chain and deepen domestic value addition in India.This move is expected to boost India's electronics manufacturing sector and help the country achieve its component exports target of $35-40 billion by 2030. It's a fascinating example of how global supply chains are evolving and how strategic investments can reshape economic landscapes.China and Vietnam, which have been major hubs for Apple's manufacturing, will now receive components from India for final assembly. This could lead to a reconfiguration of their supply chains and potentially reduce their reliance on other component suppliers.Countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, which are also significant players in the electronics manufacturing sector, might experience competitive pressure as India strengthens its position in the supply chain.Moreover, for Apple, which is a US-based company, this shift aligns with its strategy to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependency on China. This move could also influence other US tech companies to explore similar strategies.Domestically, this shift is expected to boost India's electronics manufacturing sector, create jobs, and attract further investments. It aligns with the Indian government's \"Make in India\" initiative and its goal to become a major electronics exporter.",

The flaw allowed them to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices, pulling a malicious payload from a Huawei Cloud server located in Singapore. Digging deeper, Sekoia found traces of the campaign targeting devices from other manufacturers, as well. They named the botnet PolarEdge, and confirmed that at least 2,000 endpoints around the world were infected.\n\nEndgame unknown\n\nThe botnet\u2019s goal is unknown at this time, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this botnet has not yet been determined. Cross-checking the IP addresses with our telemetry has not revealed any specific activity,\u201d the report reads.\n\nUsually, cybercriminals would develop a network of infected devices to either run Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, set up a residential proxy, run spam and phishing campaigns, spread malware, or engage in click fraud.\n\nThe majority of the victims are found in the US, but Sekoia says the botnet appears to be \u201cparticularly prevalent\u201d in Asia and South America, although it cannot be certain if this was a deliberate move by the attackers, or just coincidence.\n\nAre you a pro?

            "content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 7.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.71 points to a change of -0.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 indicates a change of +6.6% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $56.44 billion and $58.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.9% and +4.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCisco reported revenues of $13.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.4%. EPS of $0.94 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +3.3%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCisco is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers \"Most Likely for Early Price Pops.\"\n\nSince 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +24.3% per year.

            "content": "Among a blizzard of announcements in the keynote at Cisco Live EMEA 2025 in Amsterdam this month, Cisco unveiled the Nexus Smart Switch and Hypershield integration, a two-in-one solution that it says addresses the mounting security management pains amid sweeping artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in data centers.\n\nThe goal is to \u201cmelt security into the network itself\u201d and in the process \u201cmake security better\u201d so that protection is integrated instead of siloed, and enforcement and operations are simplified and consistent, Cisco says.\n\nJaved Asghar, director of product management, while giving a technical presentation at Tech Field Day Extra at Cisco Live EMEA 2025, said, \u201cData center fabric has typically been a networking stack, but with security integrated natively, it will be a native capability of the fabric.\u201d\n\nThe product that was developed from conception to launch in just seven months, according to Cisco, combines both hardware and software stacks. On the hardware side, it builds on the Cisco Nexus 9300 switch family with two newly unveiled SKUs \u2013 N9324C-SE1U and N9348Y2C6D-SE1U Smart Switches. Both estimated to GA in April, Asghar described them as \u201cbest of class\u201d.\n\nThe first is a 24x100G port switch that packs two hero components among other things \u2013 AMD DPUs \u2013 4 in this case, and the Cisco Silicon One E100 ASIC, a network processor. The second, a top-of-rack (ToR) 48x25G port switch, packs 2 AMD Giglio DPUs and uses the same Silicon One.\n\nSilicon One comes loaded with some vital Nexus OS capabilities, and the highly programmable AMD DPUs support service offload.\n\nPiggybacking on the switches, Hypershield, an AI-based solution for global security enforcement which Cisco inherited from its acquisition of Isovalent in 2024 and has placed at the center of Security Cloud Control, will provide a simpler policy lifecycle management ensuring a stronger security posture with distributed and consistent enforcement.\n\n\u201cOne of the main benefits of Smart Switches is device convergence,\u201d Asghar said. \u201cTypically, data center switches are connected to multiple firewalls, making device management extensive. Cisco can consolidate [them] into a single switch. The forwarding is done by the Silicon One while the DPUs can be modelled as firewalls.\u201d\n\nThrough a packet flow demonstration, Asghar explained how the Smart Switches provide stateful firewalling. As traffic comes into Silicon One, it inspects the traffic and obtains the incoming VRF. The policy in place tells which DPU to direct the traffic to. Within this DPU, Hypershield\u2019s segmentation policy performs the traffic firewalling. Once done, the traffic is once again directed back to the Silicon One which then sends it out to the right egress port.\n\nOn the Smart Switches, Hypershield offers capabilities including autonomous policy creation, optimization and enforcement for all workloads, and self-validation of updates.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of enforcement points within Hypershield that work together \u2013 they\u2019re not disjointed. We have enforcement points directly within the kernel of the workload,\u201d Jacob Rapp, senior director of product management for Hypershield, said.\n\nOne of the core things Hypershield addresses is policy change management. \u201cChange is some of the most risky parts of security,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cWhen making some broad changes to zone-based firewall policy, while updating granular micro-type segmentation policies, or just updating code.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt scale across the network or at every single workload, no human can actually try to figure out where to place the policy,\u201d he added.\n\nTo make things simpler, Hypershield allows users to manage policies globally and enforce them locally.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to have a single intent-based policy \u2013 you write your intent at the top and then we can take care of compiling them to the right enforcement point. It\u2019s order-independent and we take care of policy placement,\u201d Rapp explained\n\nHypershield will ensure high performance and stateful segmentation on all network ports, Cisco says.\n\nThe combined Nexus Smart Switch and Hypershield integration solution, like the Smart Switch platforms, will begin its first customer shipment (FCS) end of April this year, Asghar told.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts on the US government and how action against smaller agencies such as USAID can translate into action against larger agencies and programs.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\"But I do think that when the Defense Department is on the [inaudible], and then Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, Medicare, Medicaid, I don't know a soul who thinks that there isn't fat in there. And I also think that, kind of like the labor department, with the unemployment number we really don't know what it is we have big revisions, if we had, if we gave to Salesforce, I don't know. . .I think that, if we gave these companies, literally outsourced these companies, I know people are going to say, Jim you are like, that is so right wing, but if there's, the machines are better. . \"\n\nCramer also commented on recent Bitcoin price action which saw the cryptocurrency dip below the $90,000 mark. He linked Bitcoin as being a \"proxy for the fact that we have thirty-six trillion in debt.\" Cramer also wondered how much of the gain in Bitcoin's price was due to Michael Saylor's firm adding the currency to its balance sheet.\n\nCramer added that his team has concluded that so much of the \"froth\" in the market in untested areas such as quantum computing came from Bitcoin. He outlined: \"The reason why we've had so much froth . . .we think that Bitcoin got people very excited about things that are space age and that the fundament of speculation is Bitcoin. That's what turned it all on.\"\n\nAnother topic that caught the CNBC TV host's attention was the mergers and acquisition environment in the Trump administration. After the President's election victory in November, investors were ecstatic as they believed that the new administration could create a healthy environment for deals.

If they do, they'll have one more option than they originally expected.\n\nJeremy Fowler of ESPN reports that safety Marcus Williams is preparing to hit the open market, pointing out that the Baltimore Ravens are expected to release him.\n\n#Ravens safety Marcus Williams is preparing for free agency with the full expectation that Baltimore releases him, per source.\n\n\n\nA recent contract restructure includes a significant trigger March 13.\n\n\n\nWilliams, benched last season, has 20 career INTs. pic.twitter.com/iJUVDYBUQL \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) February 28, 2025\n\nA third-round selection in the 2017 NFL Draft, Williams spent his first four NFL seasons with the New Orleans Saints and signed with the Baltimore Ravens in 2021. He's appeared in 108 games with 106 starts and registered 20 interceptions and 56 passes defensed.\n\nWilliams will join a free-agent class that includes fellow safeties Justin Reid, Tre'Von Moehrig, Jevon Holland, and Cam Bynum. The position may become a need for the Jags if they let Andre Cisco hit the open market.\n\nCisco was a third-round pick in 2021 who has shown playmaking skills, registering a combined seven interceptions and 15 passes defensed in 2022-2023. However, he's coming off a down year, and it's uncertain if Jacksonville will want him back. The franchise tag might've been a way to keep the New York, Queens native from leaving, but the team's brass doesn't plan to use it.\n\nGiven that coaching was an issue last year, there's a chance that the new regime will want to bring the former Syracuse Orangeman back, but he wants to test the market and see what kind of demand there is for his services.\n\nRelated story: Updated cap space and draft picks for the Jaguars in 2025\n\nWhy Marcus Williams would be a fit for the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency\n\nIf the Jacksonville Jaguars want to sign a safety in free agency to replace Andre Cisco, they'll have no shortage of options. They've previously been linked to Jevon Holland because of his relationship with defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile during his stint as the linebackers coach for the Miami Dolphins from 2021-2023.\n\nThe Jags have also been linked to Cam Bynum, who's coming off a season in which he registered three interceptions and 10 passes defensed. That said, he'll probably come cheap and it's uncertain if general manager James Gladstone is willing to pay top-market compensation to bolster the safety position. Enter Marcus Williams.\n\nWilliams isn't nearly as young as other safeties, but at 28, he isn't old either. His biggest drawback was that he was a healthy scratch the last six games of the 2024 season. The Baltimore Ravens cited a personal decision as the reason for benching him, but it looks like it was due to his struggles early in the year.\n\nMaybe Williams will benefit from a fresh start. Moreover, he's more effective when he lines up close to the line of scrimmage. The Jaguars could use him in that role, and signing him would make sense if they're looking for an affordable option to replace Andre Cisco.\n\nThe bottom line is that there will be better options than Marcus Williams in the open market but he would be a viable alternative short-term if the Jacksonville Jaguars don't want to break the bank.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

With Cisco, the GPU manufacturer has included third-party providers in its Spectrum-X reference architecture for AI networks for the first time. Cisco is also planning to port NX-OS, its network operating system for data centers, to the hardware platforms of Nvidia switches. In the future, it should also be possible to manage and monitor them via the Nexus dashboard.\n\nAnzeige\n\nNvidia and Cisco previously without a joint product\n\nAs recently as July 2024, Cisco announced a far-reaching partnership with Nvidia at its in-house exhibition in Las Vegas. Under the title HyperFabric AI Cluster, the two companies are cooperating in the field of plug & play AI infrastructures. Although the complete Nvidia software stack was listed on Cisco's global price list, the cooperation has not yet resulted in finished products.\n\nUntil now, Spectrum-X for Ethernet-based AI networks was only designed for hardware and software from Nvidia. Other manufacturers were left out. According to the company, the Cisco Silicon One ASIC family with Nvidia BlueField 3 SuperNICs will be integrated into the Spectrum-X Ethernet network platform. Specifically, Cisco would like to include switches from the Nexus 9000 series with 400G and 800G ports in the reference architecture.\n\nSuch high bandwidths and low latencies are required for the AI training clusters in backend networks with RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). The correct coordination of the individual components also plays a key role here. This should be provided by the reference architecture and the inclusion in Cisco's validated designs. The company is to provide the corresponding optics for 400G and 800G ports.\n\nIntegration should relieve the burden on AI developers\n\nNvidia only acquired switch manufacturer Mellanox in 2020. Their platform was therefore in direct competition with the Nexus platforms for data centers. In addition, Nvidia's switches could be operated with the open operating systems Cumulus Linux and SONiC. Cisco is now planning to port NX-OS to Nvidia's Spectrum switching hardware.\n\nThe integration of Cisco Silicon One into the Spectrum-X platform will provide companies with a standardized architecture for AI workloads. It is intended to offer coordinated interoperability so that AI developers can focus on content implementation.\n\nAnzeige\n\nManufacturers move away from Infiniband\n\nThe HyperFabric AI Cluster is not yet available. Nevertheless, the cooperation demonstrates the efforts of large companies in the UltraEthernet consortium to move away from Infiniband and towards Ethernet. This paves the way for additional manufacturers of Ethernet-based products for AI networks.\n\nDue to its AI strategy, the cooperation with Nvidia seems logical for Cisco. However, the company has recently lost market share to its competitor Arista in high-speed switches for data centers, which are required for AI networks. It therefore remains to be seen whether Cisco can boost its sales with the new partnership. Large AI players such as Meta recently built their Ethernet AI networks with Arista switches.\n\n(mack)",

We\u2019re also seeing more leverage from our OEM and channel partners, who are contributing to our new logo growth as well,\u2019 Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami says on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nNutanix revenue jumped 16 percent year over year, beating its Wall Street guidance as VMware\u2019s largest competitor added bigger customers more quickly this quarter, Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami (pictured) told investors during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.\n\n\u201cNow clearly you\u2019ve seen our new logos grow 50 percent year over year for the last couple of quarters, and it\u2019s driven by, I would say, a couple of things,\u201d Ramaswami said during Wednesday\u2019s call. \u201cOur pipeline has matured over time, and we\u2019ve seen the impact from some of our recent go-to-market initiatives, seeing the benefit from our customers, our sales and partner incentive programs. We\u2019re also seeing more leverage from our OEM and channel partners, who are contributing to our new logo growth as well.\u201d\n\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company reported $654.7 million in sales for the quarter ended Jan. 31, beating the high end of its guidance by $9.7 million. Nutanix raised its full-year revenue guidance from $2.46 billion to $2.51 billion.\n\n[RELATED: Broadcom's VMware Issues 'Top of Mind' For Partners, Nutanix Channel Chief Says]\n\nRamaswami credited much of the revenue growth to Nutanix\u2019s hyperfocus on the channel.\n\n\u201cWe are a very partner-centric company. All our business pretty much goes through the partner community, and we have continued to make enhancements to our channel programs and incentives,\u201d he told investors. \u201cFor example, we have new logo incentives for these partners to bring us business. They may not be new logos for them, but they\u2019re new logos to Nutanix and so we\u2019ve been working very hard to make it worthwhile for the channel to do business with us, and that\u2019s certainly helping and contributing.\u201d\n\nIn May it will be three years since Broadcom announced its intention to buy VMware, an event that spurred existing customers to renew their typical three-year deals to lock in pricing. Since then, the cost of VMware and products available to customers has changed. Broadcom has eliminated perpetual licensing and bundled existing products into four options, which are priced per core of compute.\n\n\u201cSo what we see is, as a result, customers are moving more toward, \u2018OK, I need a modern stack. I need something that can handle virtual machines and containers. I need something that can work on-prem, but also in the public cloud,\u2019 and that's the kind of platform that we are providing today in the market,\u201d Ramaswami said on the call. \u201cSo from that perspective, if there\u2019s an impetus for a customer to migrate away from VMware, then it\u2019s also an impetus for them to look at what is their long-term architectural endgame, and that\u2019s exactly what we are positioning with them.\u201d\n\nRamaswami highlighted several new logo wins, including one with an energy technology company that saw a 200 percent price increase with its existing IT infrastructure provider and sought out Nutanix.\n\n\u201cThey were looking for an alternative solution that could also meet their cybersecurity requirements and desire for improved operational efficiency,\u201d Ramaswami said. \u201cThey chose the Nutanix platform, including Nutanix Cloud Manager, which will enable them to streamline their operations through increased automation and reduced their existing IT footprint by over 30 percent.\u201d\n\nOver the last year, Nutanix has struck partnerships with Dell, Cisco and cloud giant AWS to provide its software baked into their products, while also presenting another off-ramp to VMware users. Ramaswami said the partnerships are part of the multiyear opportunity Nutanix sees in the market around the adoption of its hyperconverged infrastructure and are bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cWith AWS, we\u2019ve seen early traction with some customers migrating already from VMware Cloud on AWS over to our offering, and also sometimes from on-prem into the public cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve seen some of these customers actually move fairly quickly from where they were to being able to be running on a Nutanix platform within a matter of a month. Because one of the things that we don\u2019t have to worry about in a cloud-to-cloud migration is the hardware refresh, [which] is not an issue anymore.\u201d\n\nHe said the partnership with Cisco contributed to new logos in the most recent quarter and he expects that to grow as they work \u201cvery closely\u201d together. Dell\u2014the market leader worldwide in the sale of servers and storage\u2014sells Nutanix HCI, which resulted in some sales this quarter. However, later this year Nutanix will be available on Dell\u2019s PowerFlex storage.\n\n\u201cI think we should be looking at every PowerFlex customer out there, and future PowerFlex customer out there, and looking at this and saying, \u2018OK, here\u2019s now a hypervisor solution from a trusted partner that\u2019s going to support them for over time, that they can work seamlessly with,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPowerFlex works with their existing environments. They don\u2019t have to go replace their hardware. That\u2019s the value proposition that we bring to the table there.\u201d",

Implement Traffic Filtering: Use ACLs to block anomalous Ethernet frames targeting the health monitoring subsystem. Segment Sensitive Networks: Restrict adjacent access to Nexus switches through microsegmentation and zero-trust architectures. Monitor Reload Events: Deploy network monitoring tools to track unexpected device restarts and traffic patterns indicative of exploitation attempts.\n\nAs enterprises increasingly rely on automated network infrastructures, this vulnerability underscores the importance of rigorous patch management cycles and defense-in-depth strategies.\n\nWith no publicly documented exploits at press time, proactive mitigation offers organizations a critical window to safeguard their networks against potential attacks.\n\nFor technical specifics, Cisco\u2019s full advisory (cisco-sa-n3kn9k-healthdos-eOqSWK4g) provides configuration guidance and patching timelines.\n\nSecurity teams should cross-reference their infrastructure against Cisco\u2019s impacted products list and initiate remediation workflows to neutralize this persistent threat vector.",

Let\u2019s start with the big picture. What are some key macro-economic and mega forces that are defining our world and our industry today?\n\nThe first mega force that all of us are talking about, of course, is AI. What we're seeing across industries and communities is a belief that this technology can do so much. At WEF there was a theme around growth in AI, and this puts technology front and center as we think about resilience and our interconnected future. The use cases for AI are clearer and more outcome-focused this year -- evolving from just productivity to how it can help people, organizations and countries create better and more fulfilling lives -- and how we can use AI to help close the digital divide.\n\nThe other thing that always has to go hand in hand with AI, is cybersecurity. In today\u2019s world, we need security for AI and AI for security. This idea has redefined how we talk about AI at Cisco. But I think many other companies are also thinking about not only the technology but about practices for their people to keep everyone safe.\n\nCisco\u2019s Purpose Report is a sweeping, comprehensive document that chronicles progress, innovation, and what more needs to be done to realize Cisco\u2019s commitment to an Inclusive Future. Could you share some highlights from this year\u2019s report.\n\nThe first thing that I would say is that we are celebrating 40 years as a company. And there\u2019s a realization that from day one, Cisco has been all about connections. What you see in the Purpose Report is how in this age of AI and global disruption, we as a company are more compelled than ever to make sure we are leveraging our technology and our people to connect and do good. And that\u2019s not just for our business but doing good for the world, because the need for public and private to come together and address pressing global issues has never been more urgent.\n\nThere are amazing statistics in the Purpose Report that make me so proud of Cisco and our people. First, our Networking Academy has trained more than 24 million students with technology skills and opportunities since its inception in 1997. Another thing that is so amazing is that this year 86 percent of Cisco employees participated in giving back to their communities \u2014 the fifth year in a row that we have been over 80%. I've never seen this at another company. It shows how engaged our employees are. And that\u2019s just two examples of what you\u2019ll see in the Purpose Report. There\u2019s so much to be proud of \u2014 about our past and all that we will continue to accomplish in the future.\n\nOne of the focus areas of the Purpose Report is resilience. How does Cisco define resilience in our tech-driven world?\n\nWhen we think about resilience today, it\u2019s often from an individual perspective, maybe even a company perspective. What you'll see in the Purpose Report and in the work that we're doing is thinking about resilience from a community perspective as well. It comes down to the ability to turn disruption and challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation. Today, that\u2019s tightly interwoven with technology because so much depends on having access to secure, dependable connectivity. We aim to build a legacy that extends far beyond Cisco\u2019s 40th anniversary and contribute to the world a model for driving resilience and true systems change based on lasting and enduring relationships \u2014 engaging, supporting and investing to power an inclusive future for all.\n\nWhat about the disparity in resilience? How does that play out from country to country?\n\nEveryone is at a different point on the journey to resilience, whether that\u2019s country by country or community by community. This shows up especially when we consider that 2.6 billion people globally are still not connected to the internet. Even things like the cost to access the internet varies from country by country. In less economically developed countries, it's much more expensive to get connected. That creates an issue from a resilience perspective, but also such an opportunity. Our Rural Broadband Innovation Center in North Carolina is just one example of how we are going after that problem.\n\nYou mentioned security. That\u2019s a critical element to resilience.\n\nThis year, cybercrime is expected to cost more than $10 trillion globally. So, security is arguably the most important element of connection and resilience, whether it\u2019s individuals, critical infrastructure, or entire countries that are threatened.\n\nFrom a Cisco perspective, we initially started with connection 40 years ago, and that remains a cornerstone today. But we have to bring security into the dialogue as another vital pillar so that when people do finally get connected they don\u2019t find themselves victims of cybercrime. The most important thing now is to securely connect people \u2014 to ensure that security is always front and center. As an example, we've done a lot of work looking at security and resilience on the African continent and we see that cybercrime is impacting as much as 10 percent of GDP. That\u2019s exactly what we have to prevent. Also, our world is so interconnected that no one is completely secure until we all are. So, whether the developing world or developed, we need to do all we can to build resilient security, from the smallest business to the biggest enterprise or government.\n\nLooking forward, tell us about one of Cisco\u2019s next big ambitions \u2014 impacting 40 Communities around the world.\n\nSomething that we're so proud of as a company is that we met our goal of positively impacting a billion people well ahead of schedule. We actually did that in 2023, and we did it through all of the amazing projects and efforts and partnerships across both the public and private sectors \u2013 non-profits, governments and companies all working together. We saw that when we apply Cisco\u2019s unique strengths \u2013 our technology, our people, and the trust people have in our brand \u2014 that we can create impact at huge scale. All of this led to a big question around what's next? We decided that over the next decade, we intend to engage, support, and invest in 40 communities around the globe.\n\nSomething that we realized at Cisco from day one is that our technology connects best where we leverage it to build resilience in communities. This is why we\u2019ll bring our Resilient Ecosystem Framework into communities \u2014 so we can better understand how we can truly serve that community. We\u2019ll be looking at people in society, we'll be looking at government, we'll look at economies and what can be done to create projects that are truly meaningful.\n\nI\u2019m sure Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) will have a great impact on the 40 Communities.\n\nYes, CDA brings together nations\u2019 industry, government, and academic leaders to co-innovate and solve some of their biggest societal problems. And when I think about what we've done through CDA against the backdrop of our Purpose, you can expect that we'll continue to explore things like EDGE Incubation Centers that connect digital skills to jobs in places like Africa. Those EDGE Centers provide a physical space equipped with our technology, accelerating innovation and collaboration for start-ups.\n\nCDA is also celebrating its 10 anniversary this year.\n\nYes, we are very excited for the global CDA team! They have done so much good work, spanning more than 50 countries around the world. CDA leverages our technologies and expertise while forming great partnerships. We\u2019ve helped many non-profits and governments scale their efforts, and over the past 10 years our strong partnerships have helped our work to narrow the digital divide by ensuring inclusive and equitable access to knowledge, resources, and opportunities. CDA has taken on innovation challenges around security, sustainability, and we are looking forward to much more.\n\nFor CDA and Cisco, it sounds like the momentum is accelerating.\n\nYou can expect that we'll look at how we can leverage both our mainstream and cutting-edge technologies to drive access to governments in a really positive way and ensure that services like transportation, health care, and education can get easier for citizens to use. We\u2019ll ensure that all of the work we do to connect, we do in a secure way. We talked about our 40 Communities ambition, and right now we\u2019re identifying the first set of communities that we're going to start with. We anticipate that we'll be bringing CDA and so many of our employees along with us on this journey.\n\nBeyond being a company-wide effort, the ecosystem perspective is critical. To what extent will Cisco\u2019s efforts continue to reach far beyond the company walls?\n\nOur employees will play a big role in our next big ambition to truly impact 40 communities around the world. But one thing that WEF highlighted was the need for collaboration on a global scale to solve our world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and public-private partnerships are critical to addressing this. Beyond that, it\u2019s just so important to have that holistic view \u2014 to remember that our interconnectedness underscores the need to support vulnerable communities. And why helping them become resilient should matter to us all.\n\nView original content here.",

            "content": "4. Europe is on the AI clock\n\nEach wave of technology creates an opportunity for the different regions of the globe to establish themselves as a leader. The battle for AI supremacy is well underway with the US having a strong foothold. The Middle East is likely to have an impact, as many countries there have made commitments to investing in this area.\n\nDuring a press Q&A, Oliver Tuszik, president of EMEA for Cisco, talked about the opportunity for Europe and the need to act as one. He commented that often, the larger EU countries, such as Germany and France, tend to act in their own best interests. But that may not have the best long-term outcome. While they carry economic heft within the EU, each individual country is small when compared to the likes of the US, India, the Middle East region and others. But the EU as a whole carries significant weight.\n\nTuszik expressed some urgency for the EU to act as one and is optimistic that country leaders are aligned on this. He pointed to the EU AI Act as a proof point that the region understands what\u2019s at stake. He added that the structure of the AI Act being outcome based versus overly regulated is another indicator of change within the EU. Time will tell if Tuszik\u2019s optimism is warranted, but we shouldn\u2019t have to wait long to tell.\n\n5. Silicon One remains Cisco\u2019s best kept secret\n\nCisco is one of the few network vendors that manufactures its own silicon. The tech industry tends to gravitate to certain trend that become absolutes, such as \u201ceverything is moving to the cloud.\u201d For years, in networking, doing more in software was all the rage. But it\u2019s always a combination of things that create a great experience. In networking, one can do a lot in software, but there are certain tasks, such as managing traffic, deep packet inspection and buffering, that are best done in silicon.\n\nA good way to understand the importance of custom silicon is to look no further than the AI space. Nvidia initially made a GPU because general purpose processors could not handle high performance graphics. Similarly, Cisco makes Silicon One because the network has unique requirements that don\u2019t perform well with off-the-shelf chips. Initially, Silicon One was used for Cisco to regain a foothold with the hyperscalers, but the company has done an excellent job of bringing the benefits of Silicon One to the rest of its product line, including the above-mentioned N9300.\n\nGiven the price/performance and feature consistency benefit Cisco gets with Silicon One, I\u2019m surprised at the lack of marketing and related awareness of it. Over the last year or so, I\u2019ve seen Martin Lund, executive vice president of the common hardware group at Cisco, get in front of customers, press and analysts more often. But articulating the benefits is something Cisco should double down on rather than it being a \u201cbest kept secret.\u201d",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:\n\n\u201cIn general, we\u2019re just asking way too much of individuals to get all this right. And saving during the middle years of your life to provide income throughout retirement, it really is a challenging endeavor.\u201d\n\nConversely, Doonan believes that a more streamlined network of retirement schemes across the country can help private-sector companies reduce employee turnover. In addition, Congress has already taken its own steps, passing laws like the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which alters federal retirement plan rules with the purpose of boosting access. According to Doonan, these revisions may encourage more employees to save in accounts similar to pensions.\n\nIn addition, retirees should monitor the equities market, which soared in 2023 and 2024, propelled by technology companies and optimism about AI-related advancements. According to FactSet statistics, the S&P 500 is predicted to expand by double digits this year, at a rate of 14.8%. This would outperform the trailing 10-year average of 8% profit growth. Furthermore, this strong performance may prove to be more significant than the Fed\u2019s interest rate forecast. Regarding this, Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said the following:\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate 2025 is likely to be more volatile than the remarkably low volatility environment of 2024, the fundamentals remain supportive for both equities and fixed-income assets. And it\u2019s those fundamentals that matter more for the outlook than the exact number of cuts.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best retirement stocks, we used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to find large companies with low beta values, a history of reliable dividend payments, and well-established businesses. These equities were then rated using hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Cisco Talos researchers last week said they observed a recent attack in which Salt Typhoon actors exploited the flaw, but they found no other evidence of Cisco vulnerabilities being used by the group.\n\nIn a threat report earlier this month, Recorded Future's Insikt Group said it observed Salt Typhoon attacks between December and January where threat actors exploited CVE-2023-20198, a critical privilege escalation vulnerability, against unpatched Cisco devices.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nGreyNoise's findings are the latest research on threat activity connected to Salt Typhoon. The Chinese state-sponsored threat group was responsible for several high-profile breaches of U.S. telecom companies, including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies, that first came to light last fall. In those attacks, Salt Typhoon accessed private communications for high-value individuals and obtained data related to law enforcement requests.\n\nRecorded Future discovered Salt Typhoon's campaign against telecom organizations continued in December and January. Insikt Group researchers found the threat group had compromised five more telecom providers, including two based in the U.S., by exploiting CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to gain initial access.\n\nIn a blog post Monday, GreyNoise warned of additional threat activity against Cisco vulnerabilities. \"Two malicious IPs exploited CVE-2018-0171 in December 2024 and January 2025, originating from Switzerland and the United States \u2014 the same period when Salt Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored threat group, reportedly breached telecom networks using CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273,\" the threat intelligence company said.\n\nGreyNoise also observed recent exploitation of CVE-2023-20198 against unpatched Cisco devices. According to the blog post, 110 malicious IPs, primarily from Bulgaria, Brazil and Singapore, targeted the flaw.\n\nIt's unclear what threat actors are behind the observed threat activity. In a statement to Cybersecurity Dive, the company emphasized that the attacks on CVE-2018-0171 overlap with the reported exploitation of CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. However, the blog post did not attribute the exploitation to Salt Typhoon or any specific threat actors.\n\nSimilarly, GreyNoise said it's unclear who is behind the recent exploitation of CVE-2023-20198. Cybersecurity Dive asked the company if multiple threat actors could be responsible for the attacks, given the number of IP addresses involved.\n\n\"At this point, we do not have enough evidence to identify how many threat actors were involved, and we do not feel comfortable speculating,\" GreyNoise said in an email.",

            "content": "UPDATED Networking giant Cisco Systems and AI platform provider Nvidia have hammered out a deal to mix and match each other\u2019s technologies to create a broader set of AI networking options for their respective and \u2013 importantly, prospective \u2013 customers.\n\nNvidia has been a competitor of Cisco\u2019s in the datacenter since acquiring Mellanox Technologies in March 2019 for $6.9 billion, but they have generally kept to their patches. Cisco is the enterprise and service provider giant that dabbled a bit in AI and HPC as it relates mostly to financial services firms, while Nvidia had expertise in HPC and among certain hyperscalers and cloud builders trying to build low latency networks, often with InfiniBand but increasingly with Ethernet that has been gussied up with RDMA memory technologies and other techniques borrowed from InfiniBand.\n\nBut the minute Cisco entered the merchant silicon market with its Silicon One ASICs, which sport switch and router functions that have a common underlying architecture and which in recent months have had packet spraying and other congestion control techniques added to them to herd the massive \u201celephant flows\u201d on the backend networks used in AI training clusters, a collision between Nvidia and Cisco was imminent. But instead of bumper cars, what the market will now have is a covalent bond, a sharing of technologies and more choices.\n\nWhere there were once three options \u2013 the Cumulus Linux or SONiC network operating systems on Spectrum 4 switch ASICs paired with BlueField 3 DPUs from Nvidia or the NX-OS network operating system on Silicon One switch ASICs from Cisco \u2013 now there are many options, perhaps more than a half of dozen depending on how you count it and what the two companies do under their new AI networking partnership.\n\nUnder that partnership announced today, a bunch of things are happening. First, Cisco is porting its NX-OS networking operating system to run on Nvidia\u2019s Spectrum 4 ASICs, which are at the heart of the Spectrum-X networking platform that includes BlueField 3 DPUs for all kinds of congestion control and adaptive routing that is offloaded from servers and switches to these auxiliary processors.\n\nThese congestion control and adaptive routing features are part of the InfiniBand switch ASICs and MLNX-OS network operating system that Mellanox created for InfiniBand decades ago. We strongly suspect that in the wake of Nvidia buying Cumulus Networks in May 2020, all kinds of stuff from MLNX-OS (and possibly the Onyx NOS that goes end of life this year) was moved over to the Cumulus Linux NOS and has also been ported to the BlueField 3 DPUs to make up the Spectrum-X software stack. (It is hard to prove, but logical.) Suffice it to say, Nvidia has lots and lots of NOS expertise in its own right.\n\nOf course, so does Cisco with its venerable Internetwork Operating System (IOS), which predates even commercial-grade Unixes and is based on its own kernel. The more modern NX-OS for the Nexus line of switches that date from the late 2000s is based on a Linux kernel, as is the Extensible Operating System (EOS) from Arista Networks.\n\nUnder the new partnership between Cisco and Nvidia, companies will be able to buy Cisco Nexus switches based on the Spectrum 4 switch ASICs and run the familiar NX-OS on them and still get the benefits that come with the Spectrum-X stack because really a lot of the smart stuff for shaping traffic and controlling security for Spectrum-X happens at the DPU level.\n\nIn the past, before Silicon One was launched way back in 2019, Cisco has gone out to merchant silicon makers and built Nexus switches around their ASICs because they have capabilities that filled in niches with specific customers. We detailed such diverse switches way back in 2018 when Cisco was using ASICs from Broadcom, Innovium, and Barefoot Networks as well as its own homegrown chips. To our knowledge, Cisco never make a switch using Mellanox or Nvidia ASICs, and this will be the first time. Gilad Shainer, senior vice-president of marketing for Mellanox networking at Nvidia, tells The Next Platform that the deal between Nvidia and Cisco covers Spectrum 4 and multiple generations of ASICs out beyond that in the Spectrum family.\n\nNvidia will not be reselling these Cisco Nexus switches based on NX-OS, but will promote them as being part of the Spectrum-X family since interconnects using them will include DPUs for the reasons outlined above. Nvidia will continue to make and sell its own Spectrum-4 switches and will make switches for the foreseeable future. This is not about Nvidia getting out of the switch manufacturing business.\n\nIt is about creating a Cisco-flavored Spectrum-X offering, which both Nvidia and Cisco both believe is necessary to make a more familiar and palatable AI cluster offering to customers used to having Cisco as their networking vendor. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Cisco has over 90,000 customers for its Unified Computing System (UCS) server platforms, which sport integrated Nexus networking and a Nexus Dashboard for managing it. If you want to sell Cisco enterprise and service provider customers AI clusters \u2013 as Nvidia does \u2013 you can\u2019t expect them to give up on Nexus. They won\u2019t do it, because the only thing stickier in the datacenter than a NOS is a database.\n\nCisco will also be creating Nexus switches that are based on its own Silicon One ASICs that can also in theory run SONiC or proprietary NOSes, but which will be considered a peer in the Spectrum-X lineup even through it is not running a port of Nvidia\u2019s Cumulus Linux. (We had originally thought that Cumulus Linux was being ported to the Silicon One ASICs, which made sense to us, but that is not what is happening.)\n\nThe new Nexus switch that will be paired with Nvidia BlueField 3 DPUs will be based on the Silicon One G200 ASIC. We did a deep drilldown into the G200 back in June 2023 when it was launched, and this 51.2 Tb/sec ASIC is the first chip equipped with the packet spraying techniques that are necessary for managing AI elephant flows. The Spectrum-4 ASIC from Nvidia and the Tomahawk 5 ASIC from Broadcom also deliver 51.2 Tb/sec of aggregate throughput.\n\nAs far as we know, Nvidia has no intention of selling any Silicon One switches itself, just like it will not resell Cisco Nexus switches using its Spectrum 4 ASIC.\n\nCisco is the first such networking partner to have this Spectrum-X partnership with Nvidia, but we can envision that Arista Networks (really just a proxy for Broadcom ASICs at this point) might also want a similar deal. Shainer does not think this is a particularly useful idea. But he didn\u2019t put the kibosh on the idea, either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very frank, and I\u2019m telling you that at this point that we\u2019re focusing on what we announced with Cisco.\u201d Shainer explains. \u201cThere is a good amount of work that we are going to do between us. There are a lot of things we want to do together. We want to go to enterprises with AI. We want to do a lot of activities together. What\u2019s going to happen in far future, who knows?\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see if either Nvidia or Cisco create a commercial distribution of SONiC for these switches. Both companies have software development kits to support proprietary NOSes, and further they have support for the Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) layer that rides on top of those SDKs and shims underneath SONiC, which is itself based on a Linux kernel even though it was created by Microsoft, which would seemingly be allergic to Linux but is not. (You cannot be a cloud and not support Linux, and enthusiastically at that.) Microsoft donated SONiC to the open source community in March 2016.\n\nWe wonder how much pressure certain enterprises and service providers were giving Nvidia and Cisco to work together to give them more options on how to deploy Cisco NOSes and Spectrum-X add-ons to either Nvidia or Cisco switch ASICs. Shainer downplayed this as the motivation for the partnership, saying that this is just a practical approach to getting Cisco customers fired up about AI clusters and reducing the friction of adoption into Cisco shops for Nvidia iron. We suppose it all comes to the same, whether it is a push or a pull. The important thing is that Cisco and Nvidia are working together.\n\nThe first Spectrum-4 switches running NX-OS and the Spectrum-X add-ons as well as the first Silicon One switches bearing the Spectrum X deal of approval and paired with Nvidia DPUs and Nvidia NOS SDKs are expected later this year \u2013 very likely during the summer.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the top provider of chips used in new artificial intelligence computers, is extending a partnership with networking-gear maker Cisco Systems Inc. in a push aimed at making it easier for corporations to deploy AI systems.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMany businesses remain in the early stages of adopting AI systems because of the complexity the shift adds to their data centers, Cisco and Nvidia said Tuesday in a joint statement. The two companies are broadening the list of products that include each others\u2019 technology in an attempt to remove those hurdles.\n\nNvidia offers networking add-ons to its AI server machinery, called Spectrum-X Ethernet. That product line will start including Cisco chips that handle broader connectivity functions, the two companies said.\n\n\u201cEnterprises are under immense pressure to deploy AI quickly and effectively, and many leaders struggle to justify the investment while balancing the risks,\u201d Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement. \u201cTogether, Cisco and Nvidia are partnering to remove barriers for customers and ensure they can optimize their infrastructure investments to unlock the power of AI.\u201d\n\nCisco shares gained on the news, rising as much as 2.2% to $64.64 in New York. The increase bucked the broader trend of tech stocks slumping on Tuesday. Nvidia was down less than 1% to $129.44.\n\nThe build-out of AI data centers has been, for the most part, done by a small group of the world\u2019s biggest companies \u2014 so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. that have vast engineering teams capable of designing and deploying machinery.\n\nNvidia wants to broaden the technology\u2019s reach beyond those few customers and push AI into the wider economy. It first teamed up with Cisco a year ago to try to reach that larger audience, including the corporations and government departments that are the networking company\u2019s biggest users.\n\nFor Cisco, which has struggled to sell its machinery into those hyperscalers\u2019 data centers, the tie-up with Nvidia is a pathway toward grabbing a bigger slice of AI spending. Nvidia\u2019s networking gear will include Cisco\u2019s Silicon One chips, giving that product a boost against widely used products from Broadcom Inc.",

With the announcement today, NVIDIA is bringing Cisco Silicon One into Spectrum-X, making it an alternative to NVIDIA\u2019s own Mellanox-lineage switch silicon.\n\nCisco Silicon One Joins NVIDIA Spectrum-X\n\nHere is a quick summary of the announcement on what NVIDIA is doing and Cisco:\n\nNVIDIA will enable Cisco Silicon One coupled with NVIDIA SuperNICs to become part of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform. Cisco would be the only partner silicon included in NVIDIA Spectrum-X. This is not only [a] massive validation for Silicon One, but it also highlights the centrality of Cisco technologies \u2014 including silicon, optics, and software \u2014 in the AI technology landscape. Cisco will be building systems that combine NVIDIA Spectrum silicon with Cisco OS software, allowing customers to simultaneously standardize on both Cisco networking and NVIDIA technology in the data center. Every enterprise will have a huge variety of use cases and applications for AI in their business. By enabling customers to leverage Nvidia Spectrum Silicon that[ i]s specialized for back-end connectivity or Cisco Silicon One, both under a common Nexus software stack (NX-OS and Nexus Dashboard), we will enable an exciting new level of interoperability in the industry. (Source: Cisco)\n\nOn the one hand, NVIDIA still retains the NIC side of the equation. With today\u2019s 51.2T switch silicon and 400GbE NICs, that usually means about 64 NICs per switch if there is one NIC port per switch uplink port, and more if the switch is oversubscribed. For every switch sold, that is a lot of NVIDIA BlueField SuperNIC revenue.\n\nFor Cisco, the company has been pushing for an AI story as competitors have been doing very well in AI switch silicon. We have seen Cisco also pushing outside its traditional Cisco-centric networks with its inclusion in the Meta Minipack3 at OCP Summit 2024 announcement.\n\nThis is a great story.\n\nFinal Words\n\nFor those who run Cisco networks in the enterprise, the idea of being able to use familiar tooling and Cisco switching to also run an AI network is welcome. Many of the hyper-scale and large AI shops today will be happy to use other vendors, but if you are already Cisco, this makes a lot of sense. Although we have seen many north-south networks in large AI clusters use other switch vendors, NVIDIA Spectrum-X is used by some for the bigger east-west traffic doing transfers between GPUs.",

            "content": "Cisco and Rockwell Automation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to expand their strategic partnership and launch the \u2018Digital Skills for Industry\u2019 program. Addressing the growing skills gap in India\u2019s manufacturing sector, the program aims to empower the next generation of workers with essential digital skills, combining IT and OT (operational technology) curriculums in the areas of cybersecurity, networking, IoT, data science, AI, programming and automation technologies.\n\nTo meet the evolving demands of the industry, the program aims to improve digital literacy in industry, attract new talent, enhance workforce productivity, help accelerate career growth and bridge the global digital divide.\n\nWith a vision of exporting goods worth USD 1 trillion by 2030, India is well on its way to cementing itself as a major manufacturing hub. However, a shortage of skilled workers poses a significant barrier to progress. In fact, according to a Team Lease report, by FY 2027-28 while the electronics manufacturing industry is expected to generate 12 million jobs, yet a staggering skills gap of 10 million trained professionals persists. Bridging this skills gap is critical to ensure that India\u2019s manufacturing industry remains globally competitive, efficient, and future-ready.\n\nTo address this gap, organizations are intensifying their investments in operational technology while prioritizing workforce upskilling. In July 2024, Cisco and Rockwell Automation signed an MOU pledging to close the digital skills gap in manufacturing across the Asia-Pacific region through social impact programs which include the Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad). In India, NetAcad has already trained more than 2.2 million students through collaborations with educational institutions and industry partners. With courses in emerging technologies such as networking, programming, and cybersecurity, NetAcad is equipping the workforce with the skills needed to succeed in the jobs of the future.\n\n\u201cAs we navigate the digital-first era, we\u2019re witnessing a significant shift where industries without the right skilled talent risk falling behind. This transformation, driven by AI and emerging technologies, is especially critical for the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Daisy Chittilapilly, president at Cisco India and SAARC. \u201cWe are excited to partner with Rockwell Automation to build a future-ready, skilled workforce that can bring to life new possibilities of digital technologies, paving the way for a smarter and globally competitive manufacturing landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s manufacturing sector is poised to be a key engine of the nation\u2019s economic transformation. Amidst rapid technological advancements, the need for workforce upskilling and reskilling has never been more urgent. Rockwell Automation\u2019s 9th annual State of Smart Manufacturing report identifies \u2018change management\u2019 as the top workforce challenge for 2024, highlighting the crucial role of human capital in the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies,\u201d said Dilip Sawhney, managing director at Rockwell Automation India.\n\nRecognizing the growing need for skilled workforce in automation technologies, Rockwell Automation offers solutions to helps both customers to upskill workers and academic institutions to train students in industry-relevant skills. These training solutions can be deployed with Rockwell Automation support through a blend of virtual or instructor-led courses to help enterprises mitigate workforce challenges and prepare for the future of smart manufacturing. These courses, spread across a variety of fundamental and product-specific automation technology topics, deliver a training solution that can be implemented directly on the plant floor, in classrooms, or through virtual sessions.\n\n\u201cWhile companies are committed to maintaining and even expanding their workforce in this era of automation, simply hiring isn\u2019t enough. A strategic investment in robust upskilling and reskilling programs is essential,\u201d Sawhney added. \u201cThese programs must empower workers with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage emerging technologies effectively. By cultivating a dynamic talent ecosystem equipped for the future of manufacturing, we can realize India\u2019s national vision: establishing the country as a global manufacturing powerhouse, competitive on the world stage.\u201d",

            "content": "Having tracked reports of extensive intrusion activities targeting several U.S. telecommunications firms, researchers from Cisco Talos have investigated to date, that the initial access to Cisco devices was determined to be gained through the threat actor obtaining legitimate victim login credentials. The threat actor then demonstrated their ability to persist in target environments across equipment from multiple vendors for extended periods, maintaining access in one instance for over three years.\n\nSince September last year, hackers linked to the Chinese government have broken into a handful of U.S. internet service providers in recent months in pursuit of sensitive information, marking the latest intrusion into core U.S. infrastructure by entities tied to Beijing. In the hacking campaign called \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 by investigators, these cyber adversaries allegedly linked to China burrowed into America\u2019s broadband networks.\n\n\u201cA hallmark of this campaign is the use of living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques on network devices. It is important to note that while the telecommunications industry is the primary victim, the advice contained herein is relevant to, and should be considered by all infrastructure defenders,\u201d Cisco Talos researchers wrote in a blog post last week. \u201cNo new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign. While there have been some reports that Salt Typhoon is abusing three other known Cisco vulnerabilities, we have not identified any evidence to confirm these claims. Threat actors regularly use publicly available malicious tooling to exploit these vulnerabilities, making patching of these vulnerabilities imperative.\u201d\n\nThey mentioned that security patches are available for each of these CVEs.\n\nCisco Talos reported that the use of valid, stolen credentials has been observed throughout this campaign, though it is unknown at this time exactly how the initial credentials in all cases were obtained by the threat actor. \u201cWe have observed the threat actor actively attempting to acquire additional credentials by obtaining network device configurations and deciphering local accounts with weak password types\u2014a security configuration that allows users to store passwords using cryptographically weak methods.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the researchers have observed the threat actor capturing SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including the secret keys used between network devices and TACACS/RADIUS servers. \u201cThe intent of this traffic capture is almost certainly to enumerate additional credential details for follow-on use.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn numerous instances, the threat actor exfiltrated device configurations, often over TFTP and/or FTP. These configurations often contained sensitive authentication material, such as SNMP Read/Write (R/W) community strings and local accounts with weak password encryption types in use. The weak encryption password type would allow an attacker to trivially decrypt the password itself offline,\u201d according to the researchers. \u201cIn addition to the sensitive authentication material, configurations often contain named interfaces, which might allow an attacker to better understand the upstream and downstream network segments and use this information for additional reconnaissance and subsequent lateral movement within the network.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a significant part of this campaign is marked by the actor\u2019s continued movement, or pivoting, through compromised infrastructure. This \u2018machine to machine\u2019 pivoting, or \u2018jumping,\u2019 is likely conducted for a couple of reasons. First, it allows the threat actor to move within a trusted infrastructure set where network communications might not otherwise be permitted. Additionally, connections from this type of infrastructure are less likely to be flagged as suspicious by network defenders, allowing the threat actor to remain undetected.\n\n\u201cThe threat actor also pivoted from a compromised device operated by one telecom to target a device in another telecom,\u201d Cisco Talos said. \u201cWe believe that the device associated with the initial telecom was merely used as a hop point and not the intended final target in several instances. Some of these hop points were also used as a first hop for outbound data exfiltration operations. Much of this pivoting included the use of network equipment from a variety of different manufacturers.\u201d\n\nThe researchers detailed that the threat actor used a custom-built utility, dubbed JumbledPath, which allowed them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actor-defined jump host. \u201cThis tool also attempted to clear logs and impair logging along the jump path and return the resultant compressed, encrypted capture via another unique series of actor-defined connections or jumps. This allowed the threat actor to create a chain of connections and perform the capture on a remote device.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the use of this utility would help to obfuscate the original source and destination, of the request and would also allow its operator to move through potentially otherwise non-publicly-reachable (or routable) devices or infrastructure. \u201cThis utility was written in GO and compiled as an ELF binary using an x86-64 architecture. Compiling the utility using this architecture makes it widely useable across Linux operating systems, which also includes a variety of multi-vendor network devices. This utility was found in actor-configured Guestshell instances on Cisco Nexus devices.\u201d\n\nThe Salt Typhoon hackers repeatedly modified the address of the loopback interface on a compromised switch and used that interface as the source of SSH connections to additional devices within the target environment, allowing them to effectively bypass access control lists (ACLs) in place on those devices.\n\n\u201cThe threat actor routinely cleared relevant logs, including .bash_history, auth.log, lastlog, wtmp, and btmp, where applicable, to obfuscate their activities. Shell access was restored to a normal state in many cases through the use of the \u2018guestshell disable\u2019 command,\u201d the researchers detailed. \u201cThe threat actor modified authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server settings with supplemental addresses under their control to bypass access control systems.\u201d\n\nCisco Talos recommends conducting comprehensive configuration management (inclusive of auditing), in line with best practices; conducting comprehensive authentication/authorization/command issuance monitoring; monitoring syslog and AAA logs for unusual activity, including a decrease in normal logging events, or a gap in logged activity; and monitor the environment for unusual changes in behavior or configuration.\n\nThe post also suggests profile (fingerprint via NetFlow and port scanning) network devices for a shift in surface view, including new ports opening/closing and traffic to/from (not traversing); where possible, develop NetFlow visibility to identify unusual volumetric changes; look for non-empty or unusually large [dot]bash_history files; and additional identification and detection can be performed using the Cisco forensic guides.\n\nEarlier this month, Recorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group uncovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat group identified as RedMike, which corresponds to the group named Salt Typhoon by Microsoft, targeting unpatched, internet-facing Cisco network devices, predominantly affecting global telecommunications providers between December 2024 and January 2025. Among the victim organizations were a U.S.-based affiliate of a U.K. telecommunications provider and a telecommunications provider based in South Africa.",

Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nAdd two-factor authentication and flexible security policies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager SAML 2.0 logins with Duo Single-Sign On. Our cloud-hosted SSO identity provider offers inline user enrollment, self-service device management, and support for a variety of authentication methods \u2014 such as passkeys and security keys, Duo Push, or Verified Duo Push \u2014 in the Universal Prompt.\n\nOverview\n\nAs business applications move from on-premises to cloud hosted solutions, users experience password fatigue due to disparate logons for different applications. Single sign-on (SSO) technologies seek to unify identities across systems and reduce the number of different credentials a user has to remember or input to gain access to resources.\n\nWhile SSO is convenient for users, it presents new security challenges. If a user's primary password is compromised, attackers may be able to gain access to multiple resources. In addition, as sensitive information makes its way to cloud-hosted services it is even more important to secure access by implementing two-factor authentication and zero-trust policies.\n\nAbout Duo Single Sign-On\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is our cloud-hosted SSO product which layers Duo's strong authentication and flexible policy engine on top of Cisco Unified Communications Manager logins. Duo Single Sign-On acts as an identity provider (IdP), authenticating your users using existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) or another SSO IdP. Duo SSO prompts users for two-factor authentication and performs endpoint assessment and verification before permitting access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is available in Duo Premier, Duo Advantage, and Duo Essentials plans, which also include the ability to define policies that enforce unique controls for each individual SSO application. For example, you can require that Salesforce users complete two-factor authentication at every login, but only once every seven days when accessing Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Duo checks the user, device, and network against an application's policy before allowing access to the application.\n\nConfigure Single Sign-On\n\nBefore configuring Cisco Unified Communications Manager with Duo SSO using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 authentication you'll first need to enable Duo Single Sign-On for your Duo account and configure a working authentication source.\n\nOnce you have your SSO authentication source working, continue to the next step of creating the Cisco Unified Communications Manager application in Duo.\n\nCreate the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Application in Duo\n\nLog on to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications \u2192 Protect an Application. Locate the entry for Cisco Unified Communications Manager with a protection type of \"2FA with SSO hosted by Duo (Single Sign-On)\" in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to start configuring Cisco Unified Communications Manager. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications with Duo and additional application options. You'll need the information on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager page under Downloads later. Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses the Mail attribute and Username attribute when authenticating. We've mapped the bridge attributes to Duo Single Sign-On supported authentication source attributes as follows: Bridge Attribute Active Directory SAML IdP <Email Address> mail Email <Username> sAMAccountName Username If you are using non-standard attributes for your authentication source, check the Custom attributes box and enter the name of the attributes you wish to use instead. You can adjust additional settings for your new SAML application at this time \u2014 like changing the application's name from the default value, enabling self-service, or assigning a group policy. Keep the Duo Admin Panel tab open. You will come back to it later.\n\nDuo Universal Prompt\n\nThe Duo Universal Prompt provides a simplified and accessible Duo login experience for web-based applications, offering a redesigned visual interface with security and usability enhancements.\n\nUniversal Prompt Traditional Prompt\n\nThe Duo Cisco Unified Communications Manager application supports the Universal Prompt by default, so there's no additional action required on your part to start using the newest authentication experience.\n\nActivate Universal Prompt\n\nActivation of the Universal Prompt is a per-application change. Activating it for one application does not change the login experience for your other Duo applications. Universal Prompt is already activated for new Cisco Unified Communications Manager applications at creation.\n\nThe \"Universal Prompt\" area of the application details page shows that this application's status is \"Activation complete\", with these activation control options:\n\nShow traditional prompt : Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\n: Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application. Show new Universal Prompt : (Default) Your users experience the Universal Prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nThe application's Universal Prompt status shows \"Activation complete\" both here and on the Universal Prompt Update Progress report.\n\nFor the time being, you may change this setting to Show traditional prompt to use the legacy experience. Keep in mind that support for the traditional Duo prompt ended for the majority of applications in March 2024. This option will be removed in the future.\n\nUniversal Update Progress\n\nClick the See Update Progress link to view the Universal Prompt Update Progress report. This report shows the update availability and migration progress for all your Duo applications. You can also activate the new prompt experience for multiple supported applications from the report page instead of visiting the individual details pages for each application.\n\nEnable Cisco Unified Communications Manager for SSO\n\nLog into your Cisco Unified Communications Manager account as an administrator. In the top left corner of the page, navigate to System \u2192 SAML Single Sign-On. The \"SAML Single Sign-On\" page opens. In the middle of the page, click the Enable SAML SSO button. The \"Reset Warning\" pop-up window opens. Click Continue. The pop-up window closes. Click Next. Return to the Duo Admin Panel. Under \"Downloads\", click Download XML.

Click Finish.\n\nLearn more about Cisco Unified Communications Manager SSO at Cisco Product Support.\n\nUsing SSO\n\nYou can log on to Cisco Unified Communications Manager by navigating to your Cisco Unified Communications Manager SSO page e.g., https://yourhostname.com/ccmadmin. You will be automatically redirected to Duo Single Sign-On to begin authentication.\n\nActive Directory Login\n\nWith Active Directory as the Duo SSO authentication source, enter the primary username (email address) on the Duo SSO login page and click or tap Next.\n\nEnter the AD primary password and click or tap Log in to continue.\n\nEnable Duo Passwordless to log in to Duo SSO backed by Active Directory authentication without entering a password in the future.\n\nSAML Login\n\nWith another SAML identity provider as the Duo SSO authentication source, Duo SSO immediately redirects the login attempt to that SAML IdP for primary authentication. Users do not see the Duo SSO primary login screen.\n\nDuo Authentication\n\nSuccessful verification of your primary credentials by Active Directory or a SAML IdP redirects back to Duo. Complete Duo two-factor authentication when prompted and then you'll return to Cisco Unified Communications Manager to complete the login process.\n\n* Universal Prompt experience shown.\n\nCisco Unified Communications Manager supports SP-initiated authentication only, meaning that you must start your SSO login from that application's sign-in page. You won't be able to add Cisco Unified Communications Manager as an application tile in Duo Central for IdP-initiated logins.\n\nCongratulations! Your Cisco Unified Communications Manager users now authenticate using Duo Single Sign-On.\n\nSee the full user login experience, including expired password reset (available for Active Directory authentication sources) in the Duo End User Guide for SSO.\n\nEnable Remembered Devices\n\nTo minimize additional Duo two-factor prompts when switching between Cisco Unified Communications Manager and your other Duo Single Sign-On SAML applications, be sure to apply a shared \"Remembered Devices\" policy to your SAML applications.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nNeed some help?

We welcome more international I&T enterprises like Cisco to set foot in Hong Kong and leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages as an ideal gateway for businesses aiming to tap into the vast markets of Mainland China and the Asia-Pacific region.\"\n\nThe event was attended by Professor Sun Dong, JP , Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry of the HKSAR Government, Hon. Mr. Duncan Chiu , Legislative Council Member Technology & Innovation Constituency, Carmen Leung , Senior Superintendent of Police, Cyber Security, Forensics and Training, CSTCB, Hong Kong Police, Dave West , President, Cisco Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China, and Ming Wong , Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Cisco Greater China.\n\nHONG KONG, Feb. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) today brought together senior leaders and industry experts for a series of insightful discussions on the critical technological advances shaping the vibrant Greater Bay Area (GBA). The event marked the return of Cisco Engage Greater Bay Area following its great success in 2023. This year's theme, \"Go Beyond\", explores new frontiers of innovation, where companies in the GBA harness the transformative possibilities of the AI era to push the limits of what can be achieved.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Cisco has been actively involved in a range of strategic initiatives across the GBA. These include a Memorandum of Understanding with Cyberport to make join efforts in the establishment of an AI lab; supporting Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in expanding its AI data center; and contributing to the Hong Kong Police Force's establishment of a Cyber Security Action Task Force to enhance the city's ability to cope with cyber threats. Cisco also participated in the \"US-China Bay to Bay Dialogue\", where discussions focused on the shared economic development of the Bay Area.\n\nA Paradox Between AI's Potential and Implementation Challenges\n\nCisco has been leading the chart on providing in-depth analysis of the biggest trends impacting businesses, the latest of which are published in Cisco's 2025 AI Briefing CEO Edition. This study uncovers a paradox where four in five CEOs recognize AI's potential benefits and almost all CEOs plan to integrate AI into their operations. Yet at the same time, many fear gaps in their knowledge will hinder decisions in the boardroom (74%) and stifle growth (58%) \u2013 risking missed opportunities and falling behind competitors.\n\nMore than 70% of CEOs are concerned about losing ground due to IT and infrastructure gaps, fears that are already translating into real losses. Over half (53%) worry that a lack of investment in technology is costing them competitive advantage, while two-thirds are concerned about the opportunity costs of not investing more in technology. Without decisive action, CEOs anticipate higher operating costs, lower profits, reduced productivity, and declining market share.\n\nFor those who confront their fears, the rewards will go far beyond simply \"keeping up\". CEOs are turning to AI for its transformative potential: driving efficiency (69%), spurring innovation (68%), and outpacing competitors (54%). Yet, to realize AI's full potential, they must first overcome key barriers \u2013 including skills shortages, infrastructure limitations, and security risks.\n\nWhile CEOs focus on the bigger picture, their CIOs and CTOs are often grappling with operational hurdles, including the lack of compelling business use cases \u2013 a challenge CEOs rank lower. This tension perhaps reflects AI's exploratory phase, with 82% of CEOs recognizing that AI's potential benefits call for bold experimentation in the short term to uncover value in the long term.\n\nAs they work to meet these challenges, CEOs recognize they cannot deliver on their blueprint alone. 96% are turning to trusted partnerships to future-proof their network for AI.\n\n\"As AI continues to evolve, particularly with the rapid growth of agentic AI, companies in the GBA are navigating a pivotal transformation,\" said Iris Feng, General Manager of Cisco Hong Kong, Macau, and South China. \"Cisco is leading the charge to help businesses not only navigate the AI revolution but also leverage its power for sustainable growth, capitalizing on the region's growing role as a global powerhouse. Our solutions are designed to help businesses in the GBA seamlessly adapt, stay competitive, and achieve long-term success, all backed by Cisco's AI-driven innovations.\"\n\nPowering AI for the Future: Cisco's Latest Innovations\n\nTo provide GBA customers with the technology needed to embrace AI, Cisco is delivering impactful innovations across its unmatched product portfolio.

As of the Feb. 20 close, shares have provided a total return of 10% on the year.\n\nCisco\u2019s Feb. 12 earnings report beat estimates on several fronts, raising shares moderately in the subsequent trading days. Cisco's AI-driven business is small now, but is gaining traction.\n\nGet Cisco Systems alerts: Sign Up\n\nThis has excited investors. I\u2019ll dive deep into the tech company\u2019s AI business to understand what type of opportunity it represents for Cisco in the near and long term.\n\nCisco: Analyzing AI Infrastructure\u2019s Role After Strong Earnings Report\n\nCisco achieved moderate growth on both the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q2 2025. Revenue grew by 9% to nearly $14 billion, beating out estimates of $13.9 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 8% to $0.94, topping estimates.\n\nIn the full fiscal 2025 year, analysts see sales rising by 5% and adjusted earnings staying flat. This comes after the company moderately raised its guidance for the year in this release.\n\nOne figure that grabbed Cisco's attention was its uptick in AI infrastructure orders. These came in at $350 million for the quarter, resulting in $700 million in orders through the first half of its fiscal year.\n\nOverall, Cisco is expecting over $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders in 2025. Although it is good to see Cisco starting to participate more in AI infrastructure spending, I'll put these numbers in the proper context.\n\nCompared to the firm\u2019s $56.5 billion in expected revenue for fiscal 2025, the AI orders figure is only equal to around 1.7% of that total. AI orders are unlikely to make up even that amount of revenue, considering orders imply future revenue. It will take time for Cisco to recognize this as actual revenue.\n\nThus, at this point, it doesn\u2019t make sense to consider Cisco an important player in AI infrastructure. However, it could contribute more meaningfully long term. Additionally, infrastructure isn\u2019t the only way Cisco is participating in AI.\n\nCSCO: Splunk Acquisition Showing Its Value\n\nSplunk has been a substantial addition to Cisco. Its security and observability segments grew by 117% and 47% from a year ago. It is helping drive higher margins and was accretive to adjusted EPS last quarter, which was sooner than expected.\n\nThrough its acquisition of Splunk, Cisco is using AI to help enterprises become more secure. Hypershield is the company\u2019s AI-driven threat detection and response software.\n\nIn Q2, Hypershield booked two Fortune 100 customers. In Jan., Cisco launched AI Defense. The software helps enterprises develop and deploy AI applications securely. Cisco said the response from early access customers was \"phenomenal.\" It plans to launch general availability in March.\n\nCSCO: Key Enterprise Partner With Lots to Like\n\nCisco Systems Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 2.72% Annual Dividend $1.64 Dividend Increase Track Record 13 Years Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth 2.63% Dividend Payout Ratio 71.62% Next Dividend Payment Apr. 23 CSCO Dividend History\n\nCisco may not be an exciting player in the AI revolution right now, but it still has many appealing qualities. The company returned $2.8 billion to shareholders just last quarter.\n\nIt has a substantial buyback capacity worth 6.6% of its overall market cap, which it can use to support its share price.\n\nCisco also has a healthy dividend yield of 2.5%, over double the 1.2% yield of the S&P 500. Its dividend yield ranks in the top ten among U.S. large-cap technology companies.\n\nCisco also ranks in the top 10 among this peer group when it comes to cash on its balance sheet and free cash flow generation last quarter. This could allow the company to engage in acquisition activity to enhance its position strategically.\n\nHowever, a massive acquisition is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Cisco is currently saddled with over $32 billion in debt due to its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk in Q1 2024.\n\nMarketBeat tracked eight Wall Street analysts who updated their price targets after Cisco\u2019s earnings release. On average, they raised their targets by 14%, significantly more than the 3% rise Cisco shares have seen post-earnings. Their price targets imply an average upside in Cisco shares of 9%, compared to a Feb. 21 morning trading price of $64.67.\n\nOverall, Cisco remains a key partner for many large enterprises around the world. As these companies look to implement AI further, Cisco can be a significant beneficiary long-term. This is true for both infrastructure and software solutions.\n\nThe company\u2019s sticky enterprise partnerships help limit downside risk. Cisco has strong financials and is willing to return capital. These factors can make it a bellwether tech stock, which can also benefit from AI growth in the long run.\n\nBefore you consider Cisco Systems, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Cisco Systems wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Cisco Systems currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

First identified in late 2024 and subsequently confirmed by the US government, this activity is attributed to a highly advanced threat actor known as Salt Typhoon. According to public reports, Salt Typhoon successfully infiltrated core networking infrastructure in multiple instances, leveraging these systems to collect sensitive information. While one case suggested exploitation of a known Cisco vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171), Cisco Talos\u2019 investigations indicate that most incidents stemmed from the use of legitimate victim login credentials rather than newly discovered vulnerabilities. The findings reveal that the threat actor maintained persistence in some environments for extended periods, with at least one instance of unauthorized access lasting over three years. Moreover, the attack campaign employed living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques, allowing adversaries to exploit existing system tools to evade detection.Salt Typhoon relied on using stolen credentials to gain access. While the exact method of initial credential compromise is not apparent, the threat actor actively attempted to get its hands on additional credentials by extracting network device configurations and deciphering weakly encrypted local accounts. They were also observed capturing SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including secret keys, to enumerate credential details for further infiltration.In many instances, the threat actor exfiltrated device configurations using TFTP and FTP\u2014configurations that often contained sensitive authentication material, such as SNMP Read/Write (R/W) community strings and weakly encrypted local account passwords. Malefactors could trivially decrypt these passwords offline and configurations provided insights into network infrastructure, enabling reconnaissance and lateral movement.A hallmark of this campaign was the actor\u2019s ability to pivot through compromised infrastructure. By using machine-to-machine connections, it maintained a presence within trusted infrastructure, slipping past network security measures. Salt Typhoon also used compromised devices from one telecom provider as hop points to target infrastructure at another provider. Some of these hop points were also used for outbound data exfiltration, exploiting network equipment from multiple manufacturers.The actor also altered device running configurations and subsystems associated with Bash and Guest Shell, a Linux-based virtual environment on Cisco devices. The observed modifications included:Various tools and techniques were used to capture packet data, including:Despite reports suggesting that Salt Typhoon might have exploited other Cisco vulnerabilities, Cisco Talos says it has found no evidence confirming these claims. The vulnerabilities in question, which already have security fixes available, include:Cisco Talos stresses that patching these vulnerabilities is critical, as bad actors often use publicly available malicious tools to exploit unpatched systems. It advises all infrastructure defenders\u2014not only those in the telecoms sector\u2014to stick to best practices for securing network infrastructure. Darren Guccione, CEO and Co-Founder at Keeper Security, adds: \u201cEffective cybersecurity isn\u2019t just about sealing off the front door \u2013 it requires vigilance in closing known security gaps and limiting damage when defenses fail.\u201d He advises telecom providers and other critical infrastructure to take a layered approach that includes zero trust, least-privilege access and Privileged Access Management (PAM). \u201cPAM helps restrict lateral movement by securing and limiting access to critical systems, making it significantly harder for attackers to persist and minimizing the impact of a breach. By securing critical accounts and restricting lateral movement, organizations can make it significantly harder for adversaries to maintain control over time.\u201dRom Carmel, Co-Founder and CEO at Apono, says this incident is another wake-up call for the industry: \u201cLegacy security gaps are still being exploited, and traditional perimeter-based defenses are no longer enough. Time and again, we see everyone from criminal gangs to APTs using tried-and-true methods like stolen credentials and known vulnerabilities to gain footholds, escalate privileges, and access sensitive resources. As organizations expand their cloud footprint, their identity attack surface grows, offering hackers more opportunities to exploit security gaps.\u201d",

A major factor behind the success of this approach is the power of compounding. By reinvesting dividends\u2014using those payouts to purchase additional shares\u2014investors can enhance the growth of their portfolios. Rather than taking the dividends as cash, reinvesting them allows for a steady increase in share ownership, amplifying potential returns. Over time, this method has proven to be highly effective. In fact, a report from Hartford Funds highlights that since 1960, reinvested dividends and compounding have accounted for 69% of the broader market\u2019s total return.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Dividend Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOver the years, analysts have closely monitored the impact of dividend reinvestment and have expressed favorable opinions about its benefits. Steven Greiner, Managing Director of Schwab Equity Ratings at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, supports this approach. He shares the following insight:\n\n\u201cReinvesting dividends is nearly effortless. Once you set it up\u2014which generally involves simply ticking a box\u2014there\u2019s nothing more to do but sit back and let compounding work its magic. Be aware, however, that companies can reduce or stop paying dividends.\u201d\n\nSteven Greiner\u2019s final point touches on a key concern for dividend investors\u2014the risk of a company suddenly cutting or suspending its dividend payments. No investor wants to be caught in that situation. While many tend to measure success primarily by stock price appreciation, a deeper analysis offers a broader perspective. A study of major global indexes over a 25-year period, ending in March 2018, found that reinvested dividends contributed nearly 3% in additional growth, as reported by Forbes. This underscores the vital role that dividends play in enhancing investment returns beyond just price gains. It serves as a strong reminder that evaluating an investment solely based on stock price movements may offer an incomplete picture. By incorporating dividend reinvestment into the assessment, investors gain a more comprehensive and accurate view of overall performance.\n\nA separate analysis from T. Rowe Price found that over the three decades leading up to 2022, reinvested dividends played a crucial role in market returns, contributing a notable 42.5% to overall gains. The report also emphasized that dividend reinvestment had an even greater impact on a select group of high-performing companies\u2014those that consistently increase their dividends at a rate exceeding the broader market. This effect becomes more powerful over time, as reinvesting a steadily growing dividend further accelerates long-term investment returns.\n\nFor long-term investors looking for steady returns, focusing on stocks with strong dividend growth can be a strategic approach. Reinvesting dividends from these stocks allows investors to gradually increase their holdings, leveraging the power of compounding to boost overall returns and steadily grow their wealth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we looked through Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024. We specifically chose dividend stocks that provide a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) to shareholders. After filtering, we narrowed down the selection to companies with robust and consistent dividend track records. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.\n\nThe Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.\n\nAs of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.\n\nIn comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.\n\nWhile the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.\n\nHowever, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified stocks that have delivered positive returns in 2025 so far. We then picked the top 11 stocks with the highest Year-to-Date return as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\n\n\u201cWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\u201d\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nYear-to-date return as of February 14: 9.76%\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is one of the biggest software firms and the world\u2019s biggest supplier of networking equipment. Its main businesses are networking hardware and software (where it has a significant market share) and cybersecurity software such as firewalls. It also offers observability tools and collaborative technologies, such as its Webex suite. It employs 25,000 people in sales and marketing in 90 countries, and it mostly contracts out its manufacturing to outside companies. It offers its products all around the world and has 80,000 employees overall.\n\nAs the industry leader in enterprise networking, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to dominate both legacy and emerging networks. The firm has dominant market shares in wireless access, switching, and routing. It also has strong complementary positions in security and teamwork. Its portfolio has the potential to profit from the growing popularity of hybrid cloud and work environments. It provides the most extensive set of features in the convergent security and networking fields.\n\nAt $14 billion, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\u2019s January-quarter revenue increased 1% sequentially and 9% year over year. Profitability and revenue exceeded management\u2019s forecasted levels.\n\nFollowing better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, an increase in full-year revenue guidance, and praise from many banks, the company\u2019s shares were up. According to Citi, its campus and data center switching businesses\u2019 double-digit percentage growth \u201cbodes well\u201d for the outlook of its networking business in the next quarters. Furthermore, the bank took a positive view of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\u2019s $750 million in \u201ccloud AI orders\u201d during the first two quarters of its fiscal year. The company\u2019s increased full-year estimate is \u201crelatively conservative,\u201d according to investment bank Evercore ISIS, which also referred to the results as \u201cimpressive.\u201d\n\nOverall, CSCO ranks 8th on our list of Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025.

It is my great pleasure to be here today at the Cisco Engage Greater Bay Area event, a dynamic platform for exploring the exciting opportunities and innovative solutions that lie ahead in this vibrant region.I am delighted to learn that today's event brings more than 20 visionary speakers and some 400 tech industry leaders and experts from home and abroad, a true testament to Hong Kong's ability to attract the world's top talent and innovative ideas.Today's theme, \"Go beyond\", perfectly captures the spirit of Cisco's success over the past 40 years. It is also a call to action, urging us to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore new horizons to achieve our shared vision of developing Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.Hong Kong has long been recognised as a super connector, bridging the dynamic markets of Mainland China with the rest of the world. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is fully committed to creating a robust I&T ecosystem and a business-friendly environment where I&T enterprises and start-ups can grow and thrive here, and make impactful contributions to the local and global economy and society. Proactive initiatives, such as the development of the Hetao Hong Kong Park and the new I&T land in San Tin Technopole, will provide new impetus to our I&T development. We welcome more international I&T enterprises like Cisco to set foot in Hong Kong and leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages as an ideal gateway for businesses aiming to tap into the vast markets of Mainland China and the Asia-Pacific region.To construct a sustainable I&T ecosystem, the close collaboration among government, industry, academia, research and investment sectors is crucial. Last year, Cisco collaborated with Cyberport to jointly build an AI Lab, and I am pleased to learn that it has achieved some remarkable results. As one of the world's largest technology companies specialising in IT network, cyber security and cloud computing, Cisco has long been a solid player in the ICT (information and communications technology) industry, supporting Hong Kong to become a leading digital hub in the region. I look forward to witnessing more successful partnership between Cisco and other stakeholders in Hong Kong's I&T industry.The digital landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Together, let us continue to embrace the spirit of \"going beyond\", and navigate the complexities of the digital age.Wish you all a great day. Thank you.\n\nEnds/Monday, February 24, 2025\n\nIssued at HKT 10:22\n\nNNNN",

Expect intelligence agencies to clash with the White House and public skepticism to grow.\n\n\u201cAll is riddle,\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \u201cand the key to a riddle is another riddle.\u201d Americans have puzzled over Kennedy\u2019s assassination ever since his death at Dallas in 1963. After his slaying, the myth of Camelot was created, and it grows to this day.\n\nIn 1865, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton spoke after President Lincoln succumbed to an assassin\u2019s bullet. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201che belongs to the ages.\u201d Lincoln became a martyred ideal. It was the same with Kennedy. Americans found it hard to accept that the dynamic, young president was cut down by a single, angry man acting alone.\n\nThat the gunman who shot Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a leftist who\u2019d defected to the USSR made the truth even more unpalatable to the keepers of the Democratic president\u2019s legacy. It was preferable to blame right-wingers, the military, Cuba, the CIA \u2014 even President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nLast month, hoping to curb speculation, Mr. Trump tasked the intelligence community with \u201cending the endless delays\u201d and, by March 8, making public everything about Kennedy. The order executes the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992\u201d which ordered full transparency by 2017.\n\nThe law, however, has a trapdoor. It empowers presidents to certify that \u201ccontinued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm\u201d to national security \u201cof such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump exercised that option twice in his first term and President Biden did so three times. Mr. Trump now says he regrets conceding to the intelligence agencies\u2019 concerns; his new order is meant to solve the riddles that have fascinated so much of the public.\n\nIn 2023, a Gallup poll found that 65 percent of Americans believed that the murder of Kennedy \u201cinvolved a conspiracy.\u201d The author of \u201cCase Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,\u201d Gerald Posner, doubts that March 8 will change those numbers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see files for some time,\u201d Mr. Posner, whose book was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, tells the Sun. \u201cA few with simple redactions might come in March, but I think there will be a tug-of-war over others for a few months.\u201d\n\nAnything short of full disclosure would be further complicated now that Kennedy\u2019s nephew, Secretary of Health Robert Kennedy, serves in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Mr. Kennedy, skeptical of the official story of the slaying, released a statement praising Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cA government that withholds information,\u201d Mr. Kennedy wrote, \u201cis inherently fearful of its citizens\u2019 ability to make informed decisions and participate actively in democracy.\u201d He invoked his uncle\u2019s statement that \u201c\u2018secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society.\u201d\n\nThe Assassination Records Review Board, created to preserve documents relevant to the assassination, sees its mandate as protecting society, too. So do the intelligence agencies. They have operatives, information, and trade secrets to protect, setting them on a collision course with the White House.\n\n\u201cPeople will be disappointed,\u201d Mr. Posner said, \u201cif they expect that the release of the JFK files will stop the conspiracy industry that has flourished around the assassination.\u201d An estimated 40,000 books have been written on the subject in addition to countless movies and TV scripts. It\u2019s an industry unto itself.\n\nAny delays or redactions will only inspire new riddles. \u201cIf the unsealed files do not contain a smoking gun document,\u201d Mr. Posner said, \u201cthose who believe that a grand plot was behind JFK\u2019s murder will simply look elsewhere for the evidence they hope to find.\u201d\n\nOnly facts can solve a riddle. It would be a mistake, though, to expect whatever, if anything, is released by March 8 to shake those convinced that a conspiracy existed at Dallas. Lincoln may belong to the ages. JFK belongs to those who doubt the government and who are unmoved by the mountain of evidence pointing to Oswald\u2019s guilt.",

            "content": "February 21, 2007: Apple comes to an agreement with Cisco over the iPhone trademark, which Cisco legally owns but Apple wants to use.\n\nUnder the agreement, both companies get to use the iPhone trademark on products throughout the world. The two businesses also dismiss outstanding lawsuits against one another, and agree to \u201cexplore opportunities for interoperability in the areas of security, and consumer and enterprise communications.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a classic bit of Apple CEO Steve Jobs steamrolling the opposition.\n\niPhone trademark: How Apple\u2019s phone got its name\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone rules the smartphone world now, but there was another iPhone that is considerably less well-known. While Apple first began giving its products the \u201ci\u201d prefix with the launch of the original iMac in 1998, the \u201ci\u201d in that case stood for \u201cinternet.\u201d However, Apple left things sufficiently vague so it could use the prefix for later non-connected products like the first-gen iPod.\n\nThe same year Apple released the iMac, a company called InfoGear launched its own touchscreen home phone that it called the \u201ciPhone.\u201d In the late 1990s, a trend emerged of \u201cinternet appliances\u201d designed to allow users to check email or browse the web without using their home computers. It was a bit like today\u2019s \u201cinternet of things\u201d devices, but without the finesse.\n\nNational Semiconductor\u2019s Project Mercury leads to InfoGear\u2019s iPhone\n\nAs revealed in an intriguing article by the Internet History Podcast, the InfoGear iPhone grew out of a skunkworks project at National Semiconductor called \u201cProject Mercury.\u201d It eventually became a product called the iPhone.\n\nVenture capitalist Robert Ackerman \u2014 who helped bring it to market \u2014 revealed the origins of the name.\n\n\u201cThe way we came at it is, we looked at the telephone as being the original information appliance,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cThis was the evolution of the original information appliance \u2014 on steroids. So, iPhone was internet-phone \u2026 information-phone.\u201d\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting that, a bit like the \u201c2000\u201d suffix, using the prefix or suffix \u201ci\u201d wasn\u2019t unique in the 1990s. There was also the website iVillage, NBC\u2019s internet portal NBCi, AOL\u2019s iGolf channel and more.)\n\nInfoGear iPhone brings some firsts\n\nInfoGear first showed off its iPhone at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1998. It wasn\u2019t cheap, with a price tag of $499 and extra charges for internet access. However, it offered some exciting advances, including visual voicemail, basic apps and a very early use of touch technology.\n\nThe idea was that the InfoGear iPhone would \u201cco-exist with PCs much as the microwave co-exists with a conventional oven.\u201d\n\nThe device was well-reviewed and ultimately sold around 100,000 units. But, as with many internet appliances at the time, the technology simply wasn\u2019t there yet to make the InfoGear iPhone indispensable.\n\nCisco then acquired InfoGear, along with the iPhone trademark. Cisco stopped releasing products named \u201ciPhone\u201d in 2001, although it hung onto the trademark.\n\nApple considers building a cellphone\n\nApple, for its part, had been considering some version of the iPhone for a long time before unveiling its first handset in 2007. In fact, Apple acquired the domain name www.iphone.org on December 14, 1999, prompting years of speculation the company was considering building a cellphone.\n\nIf there was any other name Apple could have gone with, that ended when the iMac, the iBook, the iPod and the iTunes Store became back-to-back-to-back hits. From Apple\u2019s perspective, the \u201ci\u201d prefix was as recognizable as any other brand it owned.\n\nSteve Jobs muscles in on iPhone trademark\n\nWhat happened next was audacious, though. Knowing that Cisco owned the iPhone trademark, Apple nonetheless introduced the iPhone in January 2007. The following day, Cisco filed suit against Apple.\n\nAdam Lashinsky detailed Jobs\u2019 outrageous handling of the situation in his book Inside Apple:\n\n\u201c[Charles Giancarlo, a Cisco executive at the time,] fielded a call directly from Steve Jobs. \u2018Steve called in and said that he wanted it,\u2019 Giancarlo recalled. \u2018He didn\u2019t offer us anything for it. It was just like a promise he\u2019d be our best friend. And we said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re planning on using it.\u201d\u2018 Shortly after that, Apple\u2019s legal department called to say they thought Cisco had \u2018abandoned the brand,\u2019 meaning that in Apple\u2019s legal opinion Cisco hadn\u2019t adequately defended its intellectual property rights by promoting the name.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe negotiation displayed some classic Steve Jobs negotiating tactics. Giancarlo said Jobs called him at home at dinnertime on Valentine\u2019s Day, as the two sides were haggling. Jobs talked for a while, Giancarlo related. \u2018And then he said to me, \u201cCan you get email at home?\u201d\u2018 Giancarlo was taken aback. This was 2007, after all, when broadband Internet was ubiquitous in homes in the US, let alone that of a Silicon Valley executive who had worked for years on advanced Internet technology. \u2018And he\u2019s asking me if I\u2019m able to get email at home. You know he\u2019s just trying to press my buttons \u2014 in the nicest possible way.\u2019 Cisco gave up the fight shortly after that.\u201d\n\nAnother Apple-Cisco deal for iOS\n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough, Apple later \u201cborrowed\u201d another big Cisco trademark \u2014 IOS (which Cisco used for its Internet Operating System). Again, Apple got its way. The promised Cisco-Apple team-up to \u201cexplore opportunities for interoperability\u201d didn\u2019t end up happening, either.\n\nDid you ever see one of InfoGear\u2019s original iPhones? Do you remember the iPhone trademark dispute or the \u201cinternet appliances\u201d of the 1990s? Leave your recollections below.",

            "content": "The Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon has continued its spree of breaking into telecom networks worldwide, including more in the US. Researchers at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future revealed that they\u2019ve seen Salt Typhoon breach five telecoms and internet service providers and more than a dozen universities from Utah to Vietnam between December and January. The telecoms include one US internet service provider and telecom firm, and another US-based subsidiary of a UK telecom, although the specific identities of these victims were not disclosed.\n\n\u201d They\u2019re super active, and they continue to be super active,\u201d says Levi Gundert, who leads Recorded Future\u2019s research team, Insikt Group. Salt Typhoon has exploited vulnerabilities in the web interfaces of Cisco\u2019s IOS software, which operates on the networking giant\u2019s routers and switches. These vulnerabilities grant the hackers initial access and root privileges, allowing them full control of the devices.\n\nRecorded Future found over 12,000 Cisco devices whose web interfaces were exposed online, with hackers targeting over a thousand globally. They focused on a smaller subset of telecoms and university networks where they executed successful intrusions. For their selected targets, Salt Typhoon configured the hacked Cisco devices to connect to their own command-and-control servers via GRE tunnels\u2014private communications channels\u2014which they used to maintain access and steal data.\n\nIn response, Cisco pointed to an advisory it published in 2023, urging customers to follow outlined recommendations and upgrade to patched software versions.\n\nSalt Typhoon\u2019s data breach continues\n\nDespite media exposure, government reports, and even sanctions issued by the US Treasury, Salt Typhoon has not altered its course.\n\nOn January 17, the Treasury sanctioned Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a cybersecurity firm allegedly linked to Salt Typhoon\u2019s operations. Yet Recorded Future has seen no slowdown in the hackers\u2019 activities since that date. \u201cThat\u2019s the disappointing part about this,\u201d says Gundert. \u201cEven with all the attention, we haven\u2019t observed any real change in the volume or velocity of attacks, even in the same target demographic of telecommunications.\u201d\n\nA top FBI official said Wednesday that one of the most notable elements of the monumental hack of major telecommunications companies is just how \u201cindiscriminate\u201d it was in its pursuit of data. Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director in the bureau\u2019s cyber division, characterized the breach as \u201ca different level of insidiousness\u201d from Beijing, reflecting its \u201cambition and reckless aggression in cyberspace.\u201d\n\nThe hack compromised a wide range of data, from law enforcement information to call records. Kaiser said the scope left no target out, not even children.\n\n\u201cCan any of you imagine a world in which China would have been stealing information about you as a 13-year-old?\u201d she asked the audience. That\u2019s precisely what American children are facing in this new era of big data and cyber espionage, and it will follow them no matter which careers or risks they choose in the future.\n\nThe Salt Typhoon hack is one of several recent notable incidents that have prompted calls for the United States to adopt a more aggressive stance in cyberspace with its own offensive operations. The breach has hit multiple additional networks worldwide since being publicized last year. It involves a Chinese national and a cybersecurity company based in Sichuan, China, for participating in the hacking campaign.\n\nImage Credits: Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash",

The threat actor has also been observed making efforts to get hold of credentials via network device configurations and deciphering local accounts with weak password types.\n\n\"In addition, we have observed the threat actor capturing SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including the secret keys used between network devices and TACACS/RADIUS servers,\" Talos noted. \"The intent of this traffic capture is almost certainly to enumerate additional credential details for follow-on use.\"\n\nAnother noteworthy behavior exhibited by Salt Typhoon entails leveraging living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques on network devices, abusing the trusted infrastructure as pivot points to jump from one telecom to another.\n\nIt's suspected that these devices are being used as intermediate relays to reach the intended final target or as a first hop for outbound data exfiltration operations, as it offers a way for the adversary to remain undetected for extended periods of time.\n\nFurthermore, Salt Typhoon has been spotted altering network configurations to create local accounts, enable Guest Shell access, and facilitate remote access via SSH. Also put to use is a bespoke utility named JumbledPath that allows them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actor-defined jump-host.\n\nThe Go-based ELF binary is also capable of clearing logs and disabling logging in an attempt to obfuscate traces of the malicious activity and make forensic analysis more difficult. This is supplemented by periodic steps undertaken to erase relevant logs, including .bash_history, auth.log, lastlog, wtmp, and btmp, where applicable.\n\n\"The use of this utility would help to obfuscate the original source, and ultimate destination, of the request and would also allow its operator to move through potentially otherwise non-publicly-reachable (or routable) devices or infrastructure,\" Cisco noted.\n\n\"The threat actor repeatedly modified the address of the loopback interface on a compromised switch and used that interface as the source of SSH connections to additional devices within the target environment, allowing them to effectively bypass access control lists (ACLs) in place on those devices.\"\n\nThe company said it also identified \"additional pervasive targeting\" of Cisco devices with exposed Smart Install (SMI), followed by the exploitation of CVE-2018-0171. The activity, it pointed out, is unrelated to Salt Typhoon and does not share overlaps with any known threat actor or group.",

            "content": "Salt Typhoon gained initial access to Cisco devices as part of the Chinese nation-state threat group\u2019s sweeping attacks on U.S. telecom networks, the company confirmed Thursday in a threat intelligence report.\n\nCisco Talos, the networking vendor\u2019s threat intelligence unit, said it observed one instance where Salt Typhoon likely exploited a seven-year-old critical vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE (CVE-2018-0171). Yet, researchers asserted Salt Typhoon gained initial access to Cisco devices with legitimate login credentials in all other incidents it\u2019s investigated to date.\n\nThe report marks the first time Cisco acknowledged the role its equipment played in Salt Typhoon\u2019s attack spree on telecom networks. Recorded Future last week said five additional telecom networks were hit by Salt Typhoon via a pair of other vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE (CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273) between early December and late January.\n\nCisco Talos said it hasn\u2019t identified any evidence to confirm Salt Typhoon\u2019s exploitation of other known Cisco vulnerabilities. The company declined to answer questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCisco Talos published a blog about the threat actor Salt Typhoon\u2019s campaign, based on Cisco\u2019s investigation while assisting law enforcement and victims of the attacks,\u201d a company spokesperson said via email. \u201cOur findings do not cover the entirety of the Salt Typhoon campaign or all affected infrastructure, as these go beyond the scope of Cisco\u2019s engagement and technology. As always, we strongly advise customers to patch known vulnerabilities and follow industry best practices for securing management protocols.\u201d\n\nSalt Typhoon\u2019s primary initial access point for attacks on telecom networks hasn\u2019t been identified by authorities, but U.S. and global officials advised network defenders to address the risk of Cisco device exploitation in guidance released in December. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency declined to comment on Cisco\u2019s report.\n\nCisco Talos reaffirmed other previously shared threat intelligence, particularly Salt Typhoon\u2019s ability to gain persistent access to telecom networks\u2019 infrastructure with living-off-the-land techniques, describing it as a hallmark of the campaign.\n\nThe threat group maintained access to one target environment for more than three years, according to Cisco Talos.\n\nResearchers said it\u2019s unknown how Salt Typhoon obtained valid credentials to Cisco devices, but noted the threat group actively attempted to acquire additional credentials through network device configurations and local accounts with weak passwords. Salt Typhoon also captured network protocol traffic, including secret keys used between network devices to likely obtain additional credentials, the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother key component of Salt Typhoon\u2019s activities involved continued movement through compromised infrastructure. Researchers said the threat group blended its activity into normal operations by jumping through trusted infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe threat actor also pivoted from a compromised device operated by one telecom to target a device in another telecom,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe believe that the device associated with the initial telecom was merely used as a hop point and not the intended final target in several instances.\u201d\n\nMost of Salt Typhoon\u2019s movement across infrastructure involved network equipment from different vendors, according to Cisco Talos.\n\n\u201cThe long timeline of this campaign suggests a high degree of coordination, planning and patience \u2014 standard hallmarks of advanced persistent threat and state-sponsored actors,\u201d researchers said in the report.",

I\u2019m looking forward to building off this one.\u201d\n\nMore: Finding Black history in Palm Beach County is daunting, but rewarding\n\nJohnson, a Barberton, Ohio, native, held the first-round lead, and when he opened his second round with birdies on three of the first seven holes, it looked like he might run away with the tournament. Bogeys on 8, 10 and 12, however, brought him back, but he made birdies on the 13th and 16th holes to reclaim the lead. His par on the 18th, where Byrd made bogey, clinched medalist honors.\n\nJohnson has played in eight PGA TOUR events since 2021, making three cuts.\n\n\u201cI started a swing change with my coach nine days ago, and really only started being able to work on it two days ago, so going into today, I really just wanted to keep it in play off the tee,\" he said \"I knew my short game would be able to keep me in it, especially coming down the stretch.\u201d\n\nJohnson credited the APGA Tour for putting players like himself and the rest of the field in position to test their games in the most challenging conditions and prepare themselves for a possible future in professional golf.\n\n\u201cThis is the site for the final stage of Korn Ferry Q-School, where you need to know how to maneuver yourself around this golf course in order to earn your tour card,\" he said. \"So being able to play this course under very similar conditions as they normally play it at that time of year, and being able to have the confidence to score and win, making the shots I need to make coming down the stretch today, hopefully I can be back here in December and be in position to earn a PGA Tour card or a Korn Ferry Tour card.

An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 54.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CSCO\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CSCO\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Cisco here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Cisco, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

But Fran Katsoudas, Cisco\u2019s EVP and chief people, policy, and purpose officer, also highlighted the role that human relationships have played.\n\n\u201cYou have built trust with people around the world, and that is not easy to do,\u201d Katsoudas stressed in congratulating CDA on its anniversary. \u201cAnd your impact is not only good for Cisco from a business perspective, it's amazing for the world.\u201d\n\nBuilding that trust starts at the top. And Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins called out the importance of engaging high-level government leaders in the early stages of each project.\n\n\u201cI have the benefit of having been involved when we created this program a decade ago, and it has been hugely powerful,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cIt's so logical. If we're going to invest in a country, let's align those investments with the priorities of the head of state in the country. It makes us a better citizen in that country. And it makes us more impactful.\u201d\n\nWhen doing good is good for business\n\nLike Diedrich and Robbins, Chris Reeves \u2014 vice president of Cisco\u2019s Digital Impact Office for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) \u2014 has been with CDA from the start. And he shared his thoughts on how the program has evolved during its 10 years, while, at its core, remaining the same.\n\n\u201cOver 10 years, the program's changed and adapted to different waves of technology and changing geopolitical landscapes, and it's adapted and grown,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also proud that it has remained true to its original concept, which is to use technology to deliver better outcomes for communities, economic growth, and also potential growth for Cisco.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the CDA program has shown that positive change can be good for business.\n\n\u201cThe Country Digital Acceleration Program is proof that you can do good and do well,\u201d Diedrich said. \u201cYou can benefit the world. You can lift up populations. You can work with societies to help them take advantage of new opportunities. And you can make money along the way.\u201d\n\nThat kind of success, Diedrich believes, creates the potential for doing more good.\n\n\u201cSome people think that somehow if you're making a profit, it diminishes your purpose,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think the exact opposite is true. If you can fulfill your purpose and drive revenue and provide value to the company, then it makes it sustainable. In fact, purpose and profit are not mutually exclusive. They're completely compatible.\u201d\n\nA round of global applause\n\nThe spirit trust and cooperation infused the responses of CDA\u2019s partners around the world, starting with Milan, Italy. With Cisco\u2019s help, the city has driven a wide range of smart city, educational, health care, and transportation initiatives, along with creating a Cybersecurity Co-innovation Center.\n\nGiuseppe Sala, Milan\u2019s mayor, looks forward to many more years of collaboration.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, CDA has made remarkable contributions to driving innovation and digital transformation in our city and across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cWishing continued success in shaping a more connected and sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nAs regards education, Diedrich stresses that every CDA initiative will include a skills component. So CDA is closely aligned with the Cisco Networking Academy, the largest company-led digital skills program of its kind.\n\nIrais Barreto Canales, of Mexico\u2019s Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Ministry, gave CDA high marks for its many initiatives to better Mexican society. But she called out two that were especially close to her heart.\n\n\u201cDigital Skills for Mexican Women of the 21st Century,\u201d she explained, \u201cis a program in which we have certified nearly 2,000 women in specialized courses representing over 600,000 training hours. The other one was the Digital Skills for Nurturing, which is about growing new companies. These are great examples of how our collaboration with Cisco has increased our digital skills.\u201d\n\nAnother project showing the scope and reach of CDA and Networking Academy is the Senac Ferry School, which brings professional training to riverside communities in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nBorn from a longstanding partnership between CDA and Senac \u2014 one of Brazil\u2019s leading professional education institutions \u2014 the project provides access to technology, connectivity, and knowledge in remote areas. Courses in IT and other fields combine Cisco\u2019s tech expertise with Senac\u2019s educational infrastructure. It\u2019s an initiative that develops essential job market skills, promotes citizenship, and expands opportunities in hard-to-reach regions.\n\n\u201cThe people that Senac serves can now access the internet and can access Cisco courses,\u201d said Anna Beatriz, director of professional education at Senac Brazil, \u201cand this transforms lives. Technology courses and free connectivity weren\u2019t accessible to these populations, but now they are.\u201d\n\nSmarter cities, schools, traffic, and more\n\nAt the same time, powerful new network solutions are giving Japanese schools a big boost. Cisco and CDA\u2019s GIGA schools package includes Cisco and Meraki networking equipment to create a robust, futureproof network, enabling all-new experiences in K-through-12 education. Webex boards and Cisco Wi-Fi are part of what make learning more fun and effective.\n\nSmart cities have been a keystone of CDA efforts from the start. In India, for example, CDA played a pivotal role in the country\u2019s Smart Cities Mission. And cities like Vijayawada, Gandhinagar and Hyderabad featured Cisco solutions around Wi-Fi, security, smart parking, smart lighting, improvements in transportation, and additional command and control centers.\n\nThe Indian government is enacting a bold plan to create 100 smart cities across the country. And CDA looks forward to continued leadership in these efforts, improving connectivity, economic opportunity, sustainability, quality of life, and more.\n\nSpeaking of quality of life, in Australia, as in many countries, traffic is a serious issue. So, CDA partnered with Transport for NSW to take smart traffic management to next levels. This included deploying AI, Wi-Fi, and edge computing for real-time analysis of traffic patterns.\n\n\"The system is being used to manage congestion more efficiently, to improve the safety of our network, and to improve the customer experience,\u201d said Chris Bennetts, head of technology and innovation, TfNSW. \u201cThe future is upon us. The next 3 to 5 years is going to be a game-changer.\"\n\nLooking to a future that\u2019s more sustainable and equitable\n\nThe climate crisis affects us all, so energy grids and renewable energy are key focus areas for CDA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked very closely with utility companies around the world to help them transform their networks,\u201d said Reeves. \u201cSo, they're digitally powered networks and they can respond to the distributed generation of carbon free energy and also the distributed usage of it, from things like autonomous vehicles. So, we've used Cisco's technology to help the utility companies adapt as they've moved to more sustainable solutions.\u201d\n\nAmong CDA\u2019s partners is Ikusi, an advanced technology services company that has partnered with CDA on digitizing electricity grids. And Javier Aguilera, managing director of Ikusi Spain, shared some thoughts on working with Cisco and CDA.\n\n\u201cAt Ikusi, we have had the privilege of participating in various projects with the Cisco CDA program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest and most exciting of this is a pioneering project focused on the digitalization of electricity grids in Spain. The Cisco CDA program represents innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to driving digital transformation.\u201d\n\nCDA\u2019s efforts in war-torn Ukraine show how it can respond in some of the most challenging conditions. In addition to its Medibus, a rolling healthcare center that has supported refugees, CDA has helped strengthen and secure Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure while building important educational and skills resources \u2014 all of which will be critical as Ukraine anticipates its long struggle to rebuild.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with CDA is a pivotal investment in Ukraine\u2019s and the world\u2019s digital future,\u201d said Valeriya Ionan, deputy minister for Eurointegration at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. \u201cWhile words cannot fully express our gratitude, our projects speak for themselves. We\u2019re looking forward to the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nThose next 10 years are on the minds of all who are involved in the CDA program. In supporting a future that\u2019s more sustainable, equitable, and connected, CDA is just getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this success story will go on because the disruptive technologies are changing fast than ever before,\u201d concluded Oliver Tuszik, president of Cisco\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EMEA). \u201cAnd no matter in which country we are, they're all looking for help from a reliable partner like Cisco.\u201d\n\nView original content here.",

            "content": "With free agency around the corner, the NFL announced that the salary cap will be higher than expected in 2025. This will benefit all 32 teams. This will allow some of them to keep players they were planning to release or let walk while others may be incentivized to make more moves in free agency. The Jacksonville Jaguars fall in the former category.\n\nThe league announced that the salary cap for 2025 will be between $277.5 million to $282.5 million, which represents a $7 million increase from the expected ceiling. This means that teams will have extra money to spend. In the Jags' case, they'll have $38.2 million instead of $38.1 million, per Spotract.\n\nThe NFL today informed teams that the 2025 per-team salary cap will fall in the range of $277.5 million to $281.5 million, way up from last year's $255.4 million. Cap will have increased by more than $53 million over the last two years. \u2014 Dan Graziano (@DanGrazianoESPN) February 19, 2025\n\nWith the extra space, Jacksonville could make an additional signing in free agency, or bring back any of their players scheduled to hit the open market. Since they've already locked up Trevor Lawrence, edge rusher Josh Hines-Allen, cornerback Tyson Campbell, and offensive tackle Walker Little. That leaves safety Andre Cisco and right guard Brandon Scherff as their most prominent free agents.\n\nJacksonville isn't planning on using the franchise tag on either Cisco or Scherff, but the increased floor may prompt them to keep one of them. Given that the latter is 33 and past his prime, the former makes the most sense.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nWhy the Jaguars may want to re-sign Andre Cisco\n\nA ballhawk in college, Andre Cisco fell to the third round of the 2021 draft because of medical red flags, having suffered a lower-body injury in 2019 and tearing his ACL in 2020. Surprisingly, he managed to stay healthy as a rookie but spent most of the year on the sidelines. Once he was given a chance, the former Syracuse, Orangeman showed game-changing potential.\n\nAfter flashing late in 2021, Cisco joined the starting lineup in his sophomore campaign. He wasted no time showcasing his playmaking prowess, registering a combined seven interceptions and 15 passes defensed the next two years.\n\nExpected to have a breakout season in 2024, the New York, Queens native instead regressed. He was inconsistent in coverage and struggled to defend the run. Then again, the defense as a whole struggled because Ryan Nielsen wasn't able to get the most out of his players.\n\nIt's reasonable to think that Cisco could return back to form under the new coaching staff. Defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile has had success everywhere he's gone because of his no-nonsense approach and it shouldn't be any different in Jacksonville.\n\nAdd the increased cap ceiling, and it wouldn't be shocking if the Jaguars' brass choose to bring the fifth-year safety back, which didn't seem like a legitimate possibility just a few weeks ago.\n\nOf course, it takes two to tango, and Cisco might want to test the market and see what other teams are willing to pay him. He's already displayed the ability to make plays and is healthy, so he should have no shortage of suitors.\n\nUltimately, free agency could go in several different ways, but it wouldn't hurt to see the Jacksonville Jaguars make an attempt to re-sign Andre Cisco.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

            "content": "\"I have the benefit of having been involved when we created this program a decade ago, and it has been hugely powerful,\" Robbins said. \"It's so logical. If we're going to invest in a country, let's align those investments with the priorities of the head of state in the country. It makes us a better citizen in that country. And it makes us more impactful.\"\n\nBuilding that trust starts at the top. And Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins called out the importance of engaging high-level government leaders in the early stages of each project.\n\n\"You have built trust with people around the world, and that is not easy to do,\" Katsoudas stressed in congratulating CDA on its anniversary. \"And your impact is not only good for Cisco from a business perspective, it's amazing for the world.\"\n\nCisco's technology and expertise underlie those 10 years of success. But Fran Katsoudas, Cisco's EVP and chief people, policy, and purpose officer, also highlighted the role that human relationships have played.\n\n\"It's a privilege and an honor to work with these countries around the world,\" said Diedrich, who has been a prime mover behind CDA since its start. \"We have created 1,600 individual digitization projects in every vertical imaginable. And the number of people that CDA has impacted is well into the tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions.\"\n\nOne reason for CDA's success is the leadership of Guy Diedrich, Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer.\n\nSo, for Cisco, it's an important anniversary and a time to celebrate all that CDA has accomplished - in AI, education, healthcare, sustainability, transportation, agriculture, cybersecurity, and more - along with the good it can continue to drive.\n\nTen years on, CDA has brought positive change to 50 countries around the world, helping to transform everything from coffee farms in Tanzania and floating classrooms in the Amazon to energy grids in Spain, network infrastructure in Ukraine , and smart cities in India (to name but a few).\n\nIf anyone had doubts, they were soon dispelled.\n\nWhen Cisco's Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program began in 2015, it represented a radical new concept: that a global technology company could bring together nations' industry, government, and academic leaders to co-innovate solutions to major societal problems.\n\nIn 50 countries, Cisco's Country Digital Acceleration program shows what tech collaboration to transform societies is all about.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen doing good is good for business\n\nLike Diedrich and Robbins, Chris Reeves - vice president of Cisco's Digital Impact Office for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) - has been with CDA from the start. And he shared his thoughts on how the program has evolved during its 10 years, while, at its core, remaining the same.\n\n\"Over 10 years, the program's changed and adapted to different waves of technology and changing geopolitical landscapes, and it's adapted and grown,\" Reeves said. \"But I'm also proud that it has remained true to its original concept, which is to use technology to deliver better outcomes for communities, economic growth, and also potential growth for Cisco.\"\n\nIndeed, the CDA program has shown that positive change can be good for business.\n\n\"The Country Digital Acceleration Program is proof that you can do good and do well,\" Diedrich said. \"You can benefit the world. You can lift up populations. You can work with societies to help them take advantage of new opportunities. And you can make money along the way.\"\n\nThat kind of success, Diedrich believes, creates the potential for doing more good.\n\n\"Some people think that somehow if you're making a profit, it diminishes your purpose,\" he continued. \"I think the exact opposite is true. If you can fulfill your purpose and drive revenue and provide value to the company, then it makes it sustainable. In fact, purpose and profit are not mutually exclusive. They're completely compatible.\"\n\nA round of global applause\n\nThe spirit trust and cooperation infused the responses of CDA's partners around the world, starting with Milan, Italy. With Cisco's help, the city has driven a wide range of smart city, educational, health care, and transportation initiatives, along with creating a Cybersecurity Co-innovation Center.\n\nGiuseppe Sala, Milan's mayor, looks forward to many more years of collaboration.\n\n\"Over the past decade, CDA has made remarkable contributions to driving innovation and digital transformation in our city and across the globe,\" he said. \"Wishing continued success in shaping a more connected and sustainable future for all.\"\n\nAs regards education, Diedrich stresses that every CDA initiative will include a skills component. So CDA is closely aligned with the Cisco Networking Academy, the largest company-led digital skills program of its kind.\n\nIrais Barreto Canales, of Mexico's Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Ministry, gave CDA high marks for its many initiatives to better Mexican society. But she called out two that were especially close to her heart.\n\n\"Digital Skills for Mexican Women of the 21st Century,\" she explained, \"is a program in which we have certified nearly 2,000 women in specialized courses representing over 600,000 training hours. The other one was the Digital Skills for Nurturing, which is about growing new companies. These are great examples of how our collaboration with Cisco has increased our digital skills.\"\n\nAnother project showing the scope and reach of CDA and Networking Academy is the Senac Ferry School, which brings professional training to riverside communities in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nBorn from a longstanding partnership between CDA and Senac - one of Brazil's leading professional education institutions - the project provides access to technology, connectivity, and knowledge in remote areas. Courses in IT and other fields combine Cisco's tech expertise with Senac's educational infrastructure. It's an initiative that develops essential job market skills, promotes citizenship, and expands opportunities in hard-to-reach regions.\n\n\"The people that Senac serves can now access the internet and can access Cisco courses,\" said Anna Beatriz, director of professional education at Senac Brazil, \"and this transforms lives. Technology courses and free connectivity weren't accessible to these populations, but now they are.\"\n\nSmarter cities, schools, traffic, and more\n\nAt the same time, powerful new network solutions are giving Japanese schools a big boost. Cisco and CDA's GIGA schools package includes Cisco and Meraki networking equipment to create a robust, futureproof network, enabling all-new experiences in K-through-12 education. Webex boards and Cisco Wi-Fi are part of what make learning more fun and effective.\n\nSmart cities have been a keystone of CDA efforts from the start. In India, for example, CDA played a pivotal role in the country's Smart Cities Mission. And cities like Vijayawada, Gandhinagar and Hyderabad featured Cisco solutions around Wi-Fi, security, smart parking, smart lighting, improvements in transportation, and additional command and control centers.\n\nThe Indian government is enacting a bold plan to create 100 smart cities across the country. And CDA looks forward to continued leadership in these efforts, improving connectivity, economic opportunity, sustainability, quality of life, and more.\n\nSpeaking of quality of life, in Australia, as in many countries, traffic is a serious issue. So, CDA partnered with Transport for NSW to take smart traffic management to next levels. This included deploying AI, Wi-Fi, and edge computing for real-time analysis of traffic patterns.\n\n\"The system is being used to manage congestion more efficiently, to improve the safety of our network, and to improve the customer experience,\" said Chris Bennetts, head of technology and innovation, TfNSW. \"The future is upon us. The next 3 to 5 years is going to be a game-changer.\"\n\nLooking to a future that's more sustainable and equitable\n\nThe climate crisis affects us all, so energy grids and renewable energy are key focus areas for CDA.\n\n\"We've worked very closely with utility companies around the world to help them transform their networks,\" said Reeves. \"So, they're digitally powered networks and they can respond to the distributed generation of carbon free energy and also the distributed usage of it, from things like autonomous vehicles. So, we've used Cisco's technology to help the utility companies adapt as they've moved to more sustainable solutions.\"\n\nAmong CDA's partners is Ikusi, an advanced technology services company that has partnered with CDA on digitizing electricity grids. And Javier Aguilera, managing director of Ikusi Spain, shared some thoughts on working with Cisco and CDA.\n\n\"At Ikusi, we have had the privilege of participating in various projects with the Cisco CDA program,\" he said. \"The latest and most exciting of this is a pioneering project focused on the digitalization of electricity grids in Spain. The Cisco CDA program represents innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to driving digital transformation.\"\n\nCDA's efforts in war-torn Ukraine show how it can respond in some of the most challenging conditions. In addition to its Medibus, a rolling healthcare center that has supported refugees, CDA has helped strengthen and secure Ukraine's infrastructure while building important educational and skills resources - all of which will be critical as Ukraine anticipates its long struggle to rebuild.\n\n\"Our partnership with CDA is a pivotal investment in Ukraine's and the world's digital future,\" said Valeriya Ionan, deputy minister for Eurointegration at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. \"While words cannot fully express our gratitude, our projects speak for themselves. We're looking forward to the next 10 years.\"\n\nThose next 10 years are on the minds of all who are involved in the CDA program. In supporting a future that's more sustainable, equitable, and connected, CDA is just getting started.\n\n\"I'm sure this success story will go on because the disruptive technologies are changing fast than ever before,\" concluded Oliver Tuszik, president of Cisco's Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EMEA). \"And no matter in which country we are, they're all looking for help from a reliable partner like Cisco.\"\n\nView original content here.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\n\n\n",

The challenge of implementing AI has rapidly moved from problems with the algorithms to issues with the data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finding and selecting the data needed to build an application that uses AI to make accurate predictions, governing sensitive data so an app can use AI to only provide the data that is appropriate for a given user and purpose, and ensuring data is fresh and accurate, so that the AI applications give customers correct information using the latest-breaking changes. Those who look to best support their AI innovation by leveraging solutions that treat data challenges will come out on top. In addition, we believe that moving AI projects from lab to production, will require process redesign capabilities and change management skills.\n\nDell Technologies CEO: Michael Dell Dell Tenure: 41 Years Has Been Dell CEO For: 41 Years In 2025, businesses will continue to grapple with AI adoption, surging data volumes and an evolving workforce. Customers need solutions that remove complexity so they can focus on their core mission. This is where collaboration with our trusted partner ecosystem will play a central role. By combining innovative technology with partners\u2019 expertise, we will simplify adoption and offer flexible, scalable and secure solutions to address critical business needs.\n\nIBM CEO: Arvind Krishna IBM Tenure: 34 Years Has Been IBM CEO For: 5 Years For customers, demonstrating significant ROI from AI will be essential to building the institutional confidence to scale the technology across their business. As they scale, they can both improve productivity and begin to create new business models, new revenue streams, and drive enduring growth. The alignment between business strategy and technology strategy is a key priority \u2014 deciding what they want to do and then focusing tightly on the right use cases. With the correct strategy in place, they can better understand, map, and measure what the return on investment and value from AI will be. It\u2019s also important to note that as AI becomes pervasive, job roles from entry level to the executive suite will change along with organizational structures and even entire industries. Company leaders must be willing to change and move with this disruption. They must consider how to engage and bring their people on the journey, how to drive adoption, and how to give employees the skills, confidence and ability to use this technology in their work.\n\nAMD CEO: Lisa Su AMD Tenure: 13 Years Has Been AMD CEO For: 11 Years The toughest challenge facing customers is the rapid pace of change. As technology advances, cutting-edge solutions like AI are essential to scaling business. However, new technologies also bring significant complexity and the need for business process innovation. We are committed to working closely with partners to help customers leverage end-to-end AI and high-performance computing solutions to navigate these changes.\n\nNutanix CEO: Rajiv Ramaswami Nutanix Tenure: 5 Years Has Been Nutanix CEO For: 5 Years One of the toughest challenges facing our customers is around understanding how AI can deliver business value and effectively unlocking the ROI in AI initiatives. Many organizations are working to bring strategic expectations around AI projects in line with budgets. Customers are also grappling with how to simplify how they run their applications and manage data in a hybrid multicloud world. Customers want deployment flexibility and one platform to run applications and data anywhere they need it, especially as IT complexity has continued to increase. Our software-defined architecture adapts to various hardware and cloud options to provide consistent operations and data services across cloud, edge, and core environments. Lastly, we continue to hear from our customers that they are thinking through their strategy going forward to reduce their risk following the Broadcom acquisition. Many VMware customers have concerns about pricing, lack of support, and a decreased focus on innovation. As customers are seeking to modernize their IT infrastructure, the decision to migrate away from VMware is well-timed as it provides an opportunity to future-proof their application strategies, especially as technologies like GenAI take hold.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO: Antonio Neri HPE Tenure: 30 Years Has Been HPE CEO For: 7 Years Customers and partners will continue to explore AI use cases for their businesses with an increasing pressure to move from experimentation to adoption. HPE and our partners are well positioned to help customers easily test proofs of concept and deploy them into production to solve this challenge. Our new turnkey HPE Private Cloud AI is a first-of-its-kind solution that provides deep integration with Nvidia AI computing, networking and software with HPE's AI storage, compute, and the HPE GreenLake cloud. The offering enables enterprises of every size to gain an energy-efficient, fast, and flexible path for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications.\n\nRed Hat CEO: Matt Hicks Red Hat Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Red Hat CEO For: 3 Years A major challenge for many customers will be the high price of innovation and the financial realities of investing in and implementing an AI strategy. For instance, training a single, general purpose large language model requires a lot of resources, with the largest AI models demanding some 10,000 GPUs and those models may already be out of date. In fact, research shows that by 2026, the cost of training frontier AI models will be equivalent to the US GDP which is $22 trillion. It should come as no surprise that the average CIO doesn't have a US GDP-level IT budget, nor do they have thousands of spare GPUs lying around. For Red Hat, the answer lies in optimized, built-to-purpose, and smaller, AI models driven by open source. If we look back on how the industry has evolved over the years, CIOs have long been moving away from monolithic technologies, starting with the shift from UNIX to Linux in the early 2000s. The industry is at a similar turning point now with huge, monolithic AI models taking center stage. So, the challenge for customers becomes exploring the options at their disposal for AI, understanding the associated costs of implementing and maintaining the technologies as well as necessary skills to do so, all while paving the way for the future of their business.\n\nLenovo CEO: Yuanqing Yang Lenovo Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Lenovo CEO For: 36 Years Sixty-one percent of CIOs find it challenging to demonstrate ROI from their AI investments or don't believe their organization has the proper skills to deploy AI. Many CIOs expect to wait two to three years to show any ROI. As AI innovators, it is our role to help demonstrate the value of AI and how we can deploy the technology at speed with our partners.\n\nExtreme Networks CEO: Ed Meyercord Extreme Networks Tenure: 10 Years Has Been Extreme Networks CEO For: 16 Years In a survey we conducted late last year of 200 CIOs and senior IT buyers, they told us their overwhelming focus is to improve the security of connected devices, while harnessing AI for tangible, ROI-focused use cases. The toughest challenges in 2025 will be managing and securing complex network architectures, addressing increasing cyber threats and smoothly and securely deploying AI. Extreme Platform ONE aims to address these challenges by integrating networking, security and AI solutions into a single framework, simplifying network management and enhancing security. The other significant challenge is AI and trust. At Extreme, we're focused on helping customers adopt AI at the pace of trust. There is no one size fits all with AI. We are working with customers and partners to help drive AI at a pace that they feel comfortable with and that is the beauty with the flexibility of Platform ONE, we can do that in a way that is meaningful and impactful.",

            "content": "Note: Cisco\u2019s FY 2024 ended July 27, 2024\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company providing networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, is up 6% year-to-date compared to a 3% growth in the S&P 500 index (as of Jan. 12). In comparison, CSCO\u2019s peer Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has seen its stock down 3% during the same period. The company\u2019s Q2 (ended Jan. 25) results, announced on February 12th, exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. CSCO reported $14 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, representing a 9% increase year-over-year (y-o-y). After a streak of four consecutive quarters of declining revenue, the company bounced back with a notable resurgence in fiscal Q2. A key driver of this growth was a significant influx of orders for artificial intelligence infrastructure, which topped $350 million in the quarter alone. The company\u2019s net income for the latest quarter declined 8% y-o-y to $2.43 billion, or $0.61 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.94, an increase of 8%.\n\nLooking ahead, Cisco raised its full-year revenue forecast to between $56 billion and $56.5 billion from a prior estimate of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion. It now anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.74, up from $3.60 to $3.66 previously. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked over 91% returns since inception.\n\nCisco\u2019s fiscal first-half performance was mixed, with security revenues doubling y-o-y and networking revenues declining by 14%. While product revenue remained flat, service revenue increased by 6% y-o-y, reflecting the industry\u2019s shift toward service-centric solutions. Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 for $27 billion marked a significant milestone in the company\u2019s strategy to expand its security offerings. This move aligns with Cisco\u2019s broader goal to enhance its AI-driven threat detection and response capabilities. The acquisition has already begun to bear fruit, with Splunk contributing positively to Cisco\u2019s revenue. In fact, Cisco\u2019s total revenue would have declined by 1% y-o-y without Splunk\u2019s contribution. Furthermore, Splunk has been accretive to Cisco\u2019s adjusted earnings per share sooner than expected. Splunk\u2019s software solutions, which leverage artificial intelligence to analyze log files and other data, have been instrumental in helping companies minimize cybersecurity risks. Cisco plans to cross-sell Splunk products to its existing customer base, with approximately 5,000 customers identified as potential targets.\n\nCisco has also been making progress with gross margins in recent quarters, driven by lower freight and component costs, a favorable product mix, and overall better cost management. On a GAAP basis, CSCO\u2019s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin were 65.1%, 63.7%, and 68.9%, respectively, as compared with 64.2%, 62.7%, and 68.2%, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We could see similar trends over Q3 as well. The company has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and service contracts which could also help margins.\n\nThe increase in CSCO stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 46% in 2021, -22% in 2022, 9% in 2023, and 22% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nWe have revised Cisco Valuation to $65 per share, based on a $3.70 expected EPS and a 17.6x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025. That said, the company\u2019s valuation is almost in line with the current market price (as of Jan 12).

            "content": "by Laurie Sullivan @lauriesullivan, February 10, 2025\n\nAI agents will rapidly become the next customer-service support system for brands -- mainly because the technology has the ability to teach the platform how best to support customers. And that will change personalization across industries forever.\n\nAgents integrate with CRM systems and other business applications to ensure access to all the information needed to personalize services and understand individual preferences and behaviors.\n\n\u201cThe best contact center experience is the one that never happens,\u201d Vinod Muthukrishnan, vice president and chief operating officer at Webex Customer Experience Solutions, Cisco, told MediaPost. \u201cTraditionally, customer engagement and communication has been viewed as an operational or marketing activity, while customer experience has been seen as a contact center issue.\u201d\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nWhen customer engagement and customer experience come together, it becomes clear that many reasons for customers reaching out to the contact center no longer need to occur.\n\nThere is a link between customer satisfaction and effective self-service tools, according to a global study conducted by Cisco. For example, rebooking a flight or replacing a lost credit card typically requires live agent support, leading to long queues and hold times, multiple transfers, frustrated customers and agent burnout.\n\nSome 82% of companies intend to integrate AI agents within one to three years, according to the study. There is a level of trust in AI agents for specific tasks such as generating work emails, coding, and data analysis, but Muthukrishnan said AI will allow contact center agents to focus on more complex interactions.\n\n\u201cVirtual agents have been used by the customer service industry for years, but until the more recent introduction of AI and large language models they have been largely unhelpful at resolving customer issues unless the exact scenario was programmed into the system,\u201d Muthukrishnan said. \u201cWith the introduction of AI agents, businesses can now have an always-on, highly intelligent, bi-directional virtual agent that supports text and voice interactions.\u201d\n\nThe multimodal virtual agent will serve as the initial point of contact around the clock, rather than restricted typical operating hours.\n\n\u201cSuch a feature is indispensable for any contact center aiming to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction,\u201d Muthukrishnan said.\n\nFor example, AI agents supported in platforms like Webex can prevent customers from waiting in a call queue and enable businesses to assist customers 24 hours a day at a significantly lower cost per serve.\n\nImplementing AI agents requires an initial investment, he said, but the long-term benefits for both employees and customers can lead to significant business advantages.\n\nEven for use cases that require a human touch, the time to answer can be greatly reduced. This use of AI ultimately leads to reduced handling times and improved customer retention, he said.\n\nLast year, Webex announced AI agents that automate contact-center inquiries with conversational intelligence for quick and effective resolution of issues.\n\nData privacy and security in AI-driven customer service solutions are built in.\n\nWebex believes privacy and security are not afterthoughts or bolt-on features. They are part of the fabric of how products are developed.\n\nEncryption protocols adhere to strict compliance standards to safeguard customer data. AI-driven solutions are designed with privacy and security at their core to ensure that customer interactions are secure and remain confidential.",

            "content": "Legacy Tech Giants Surpass Challenges in 2025\n\nAs 2025 unfolds, the spotlight is shifting towards legacy tech giants like Cisco Systems Inc., International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), and Oracle Corp., which are outperforming even as the tech megacaps face challenges. The source highlights how these companies are winning investors over by tapping into the AI boom while offering appealing valuations and dividends compared to their high-flying peers.\n\nIndexBox data indicates that Cisco's stock has risen nearly 10% this year, amidst strong demand for AI infrastructure hardware, signaling a notable upturn. IBM has rewarded investors with a 19% gain, driven by increased AI-related bookings and a bullish sales outlook. Although Oracle's rise stands at 4.5%, its expansion in cloud computing places it in a favorable position this year.\n\nThese legacy tech companies present a compelling investment theme on Wall Street. Cisco, for instance, trades at a multiple of less than 17 times earnings, providing a stark contrast to the Magnificent Seven's index multiple above 30. With dividend yields exceeding 2.5%, Cisco and IBM appear particularly attractive amid economic volatility.\n\nData from IndexBox shows that while Cisco's revenue growth of 4.8% in fiscal 2025 lags the broader tech sector's expected rise, these companies offer a more consistent, diversified approach to AI investments. Analysts suggest that these seasoned companies, characterized by robust earnings stability, may continue leading the tech pack, offering a safer play in the AI domain.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

They estimate that AI adoption could significantly boost earnings growth and possibly bring in $200 billion of inflows. DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough has led these tech stocks on a strong rally, reigniting investor interest and optimism in Chinese technologies and capabilities. The firm raised its 12-month target price for China's CSI300 to 4,700 from 4,600.

In the latest news, South Korea's data protection authority has suspended new downloads of the Chinese AI app from DeepSeek. This is after DeepSeek acknowledged failing to take into account some of the agency's rules on protecting personal data. The Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) has notified that the app service will be resumed once improvements are made according to the country's privacy law. Even though DeepSeek's web service remains accessible in the country, new downloads of the app are restricted.\n\nPreviously, the US Navy also instructed its members to avoid using artificial intelligence technology from China\u2019s DeepSeek. According to the Navy, DeepSeek\u2019s AI was not to be used \u201cin any capacity\u201d due to \u201cpotential security and ethical concerns associated with the model\u2019s origin and usage\u201d. In a similar move, Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, has also ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country. This is because it failed to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy.\n\nNotably, BBC reported that the the first member of a Western government to raise privacy concerns about DeepSeek has been Australia's science minister, Ed Husic. Husic has raised \"data and privacy management\u201d concerns over DeepSeek.\n\n\"I would be very careful about that, these type of issues need to be weighed up carefully\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek has failed to respond to requests for comment on these issues.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "Recorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group uncovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat group identified as RedMike, which corresponds to the group named Salt Typhoon by Microsoft, targeting unpatched, internet-facing Cisco network devices, predominantly affecting global telecommunications providers between December 2024 and January 2025. Among the victim organizations were a U.S.-based affiliate of a U.K. telecommunications provider and a telecommunications provider based in South Africa.\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.\n\nInsikt Group researchers identified that RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers\u2019 networks.\n\nThe researchers detailed that in mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\n\nThey also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft.\n\n\u200b\u200bOften involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has targeted universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) for medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly targeted academics. China\u2019s cyber strategy aligns with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.\n\n\u201cUnpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization\u2019s infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have shifted heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years,\u201d according to the research data. \u201cRedMike\u2019s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts.\u201d\n\nRedMike\u2019s targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.\n\nOrganizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups.\n\nFurthermore, network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.\n\nAdditionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.\n\nRedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol encapsulating various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks.\n\nThreat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.\n\nIn mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\n\nInsikt Group called upon organizations to prioritize applying available security patches and updates to network devices exposed to the Internet; and avoid exposing administration interfaces or non-essential services on public-facing appliances directly to the Internet, particularly for end-of-life devices. They must monitor for network device configuration changes; monitor network traffic for protocols not implemented in the network, such as GRE; and use the advanced query feature in Recorded Future to monitor for actively exploited technology within the stack and set alerts to notify of any at-risk assets.",

Over half of CEOs (53%) worry that a lack of investment in technology is costing them competitive advantage, while two-thirds are concerned about the opportunity costs of not investing more in technology. The costs of inaction aren\u2019t hypothetical scenarios. If they don\u2019t invest in technology now, CEOs expect higher operating costs, lower profits, reduced productivity, and declining market share.\n\nThe bold act while others fall behind\n\nFor the leaders who confront their fears, the rewards will transcend simply \u201ckeeping up.\u201d CEOs are turning to AI for its transformative potential: driving efficiency (69%), spurring innovation (68%), and outpacing competitors (54%). But fulfilling that ambition requires CEOs to break down the barriers holding them back from realizing AI\u2019s potential: skills shortages, infrastructure gaps, and security risks.\n\nWhile CEOs focus on the bigger picture, their CIOs and CTOs are often grappling with operational hurdles like the lack of compelling business use cases \u2013 a challenge CEOs rank lower. This tension perhaps reflects AI\u2019s exploratory phase, where the 82% of CEOs who recognize AI\u2019s potential benefits must support bold experimentation in the short term to uncover value in the long term.\n\nOliver Tuszik, President of Cisco EMEA, highlights the opportunity: \u201cWhole businesses will be revolutionized if they can unlock AI\u2019s potential to innovate faster, simplify their operations, and withstand digital disruptions. But no one can do it alone. That\u2019s why 96% of CEOs are leaning on trusted partners to make the leap.\u201d\n\nThe CEO\u2019s Blueprint: People, infrastructure, and cybersecurity\n\nCisco\u2019s research reveals CEOs\u2019 plan to turn fear into progress \u2013 investing in knowledge and skills, upgrading infrastructure, and enhancing security to prepare for the demands of AI.\n\nDelivering on this blueprint will require decisive technology leadership both within the organisation and through trusted partnerships. CEOs are increasingly looking to their CTOs and CIOs, with nearly 80% recognising their vital role in guiding business and investment decisions. More and more, technology leaders are business leaders who see modern networks and technology not just as tools, but as enablers of growth, resilience, and innovation.\n\nCEOs know they can\u2019t deliver on their blueprint without expert support: 96% are turning to trusted partnerships to future-proof their network for AI. With bold technology leadership inside and beyond their organizations, the CEOs have the expertise to navigate uncertainties and translate AI\u2019s potential into tangible outcomes.\n\nCisco continues to help organizations overcome complexity and create opportunity in the AI era\n\nSkills shortages, implementation challenges, AI-ready infrastructure, and cybersecurity are top concerns for IT teams and leaders across industries. Cisco\u2019s upcoming announcements aim to address these challenges: closing gaps between security and networking for AI data centres, empowering Service Providers with new revenue-generating tools, and equipping the next generation of AI-forward professionals with enhanced certifications.\n\nDownload highlights from Cisco\u2019s CEO research here\n\nThe CEO study, conducted by Opinion Matters (24 Dec 2024\u20132 Jan 2025), surveyed 2,503 CEOs from companies with 250+ employees worldwide. A companion study with 8,065 senior networking leaders will follow in March, exploring the strategic and operational needs of AI-era networking and security.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nCisco's 2025 AI Briefing - CEO Edition: Essential insight on CEO fears, ambitions, and action on AI.\n\nPress release: Cisco Unveils AI Defense to Secure the AI Transformation of Enterprises\n\nBlog: Protecting AI so AI can improve the world, safely\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that is revolutionizing the way organizations connect and protect in the AI era.

            "content": "Given the headlines about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's minor pullback, one would think the sky was falling. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader dropped 6.7% on Monday to close at $118.11. This was the third consecutive trading day that shares declined, bringing the total pullback to 12.9% since the stock closed at an all-time high of $135.58 last Tuesday. (The market was closed on Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.)\n\nNvidia stock's pullback in perspective\n\nNvidia stock has merely given up its gains from less than the last two weeks. Shares on Monday closed at their highest level since Tuesday, June 14. Moreover, despite the pullback, the stock is still up 139% so far this year, 180% over the one-year period, and 519% over the last three years.\n\nStocks never go straight up forever. There will always be pullbacks of varying magnitudes. Given Nvidia stock's rapid run-up, it's no surprise some investors are taking some profits off the table.\n\nCSCO Chart\n\nCisco Systems stock price (purple) has still not reached the level of its peak in early 2000. The orange line is the stock's total return, which assumes dividends have been reinvested. Data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia stock is not like Cisco Systems stock before the dot-com bubble burst\n\nIn April, I wrote about the main qualitative differences between Nvidia stock now and Cisco Systems stock before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. That article was in response to a good number of articles comparing the two situations.\n\nNow that Nvidia stock is pulling back, more of these Cisco-Nvidia type of comparisons are probably coming. This article delves into two key quantitative differences between the two situations.\n\nMargins: Key quantitative difference No. 1\n\nCisco stock skyrocketed in the 1990s despite the company's gross, operating, and profit margins steadily shrinking for many years. It's no surprise that Cisco stock plummeted when the dot-com bubble burst because its rise was not supported by the company's business performance.\n\nCSCO Chart\n\nGross margin also steadily declined; it's not shown for ease of viewing the chart. Data by YCharts.\n\nA main reason for any company's margins to decline is increased competition stemming from moats that are not sufficient to keep competitors at bay. Indeed, in its annual reports, Cisco attributed \"continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas\" as a key reason for its gross margin decline from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999 and also from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000.\n\nNow, let's look at Nvidia's stock and margin performances.\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nNvidia stock's surge has been supported by expanding margins. Granted, the company had a recent year-plus period where margins declined, but that was due to the macroeconomic environment, and its margins have since come roaring back. Over the long term, Nvidia's margins have trended upward -- and currently, they are at record highs.\n\nStock Valuation: Key quantitative difference No. 2\n\nThe PEG is a much better stock valuation metric than the more commonly used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio because it takes a company's earnings growth into account. A stock's PEG is calculated by dividing its P/E ratio by the company's earnings growth. For instance, if a stock's P/E is 40 and a company's earnings per share increased 40% over the last year, its PEG is 1.0. As a rough rule of thumb, a PEG of 1.0 indicates a stock is about fairly valued, while PEGs over 1.0 suggest a stock could be overvalued. That said, PEGs will vary considerably by industry and other factors.\n\nCSCO Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nCisco's stock was very overvalued for most of its trading history before the stock reached its all-time high in March 2000. Its valuation was particularly bloated in 1999, the year before its stock plunged. Its PEG was over 7.5 in early 1999, and then it had no PEG (which means that earnings or earnings growth were negative), and then its PEG surged above 9 very soon before the stock's crash.\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nNvidia's current PEG is well under 1.0. What its really low PEG is telling us is that, collectively, the market expects that Nvidia's near-term earnings growth will significantly slow. No doubt, it won't be able up to keep up the torrid pace of its recent year-over-year earnings growth. That said, it seems to me that the market is underestimating Nvidia's earnings growth potential.\n\nGranted, Nvidia's data center platform's powerful growth will slow down. But AI is still in the early innings, so this AI-driven platform still has huge growth potential. Moreover, Nvidia is not a one-trick pony. Self-driving cars are coming -- and when they fully arrive, Nvidia's auto platform's revenue and earnings should soar.\n\nDespite all the headlines over many years proclaiming Nvidia stock being very overvalued, that's just not been the case. At least not for more than relatively brief periods.\n\nNvidia stock's pullback is not driven by fundamentals\n\nThe key thing for long-term investors to remember: Nothing has changed fundamentally for Nvidia since its stock hit an all-time high last week. The company's long-term growth prospects and AI's long-term growth prospects remain unchanged.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

These attacks, which occurred in December 2024 and January 2025, have compromised telecommunications companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and universities across six continents.\n\nSalt Typhoon, also referred to as RedMike, Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286, has a history of targeting major organisations. Previously, it was linked to cyber intrusions involving US telecommunications providers such as T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. Reports suggest that the group managed to intercept law enforcement wiretaps and monitor US presidential campaigns.\n\nThe recent attacks exploited two known vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE devices. The first, CVE-2023-20198, is a critical flaw with a CVSS score of 10/10, allowing attackers to create administrative local accounts without prior authorisation. The second, CVE-2023-20273, is a high-severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.2, enabling attackers to execute malicious commands with root privileges.\n\nUsing these vulnerabilities, Salt Typhoon established Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels to maintain persistence within compromised systems. These tunnels, a legitimate network feature, were repurposed to enable data exfiltration while evading detection by firewalls and security monitoring tools.\n\nAlthough this campaign has been traced back to December 2024, experts believe this may not be the first time Salt Typhoon has used Cisco devices for cyber espionage.\n\nIn September 2024, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued defensive guidance for communications providers, implying that Cisco devices had been exploited, though specific details were not disclosed.\n\nCisco has responded to the reports, stating that while they are aware of the claims, they have yet to validate the ongoing exploitation of their devices. A company spokesperson reiterated that Cisco had issued a security advisory in 2023 urging customers to apply necessary software patches. Additionally, in October 2023, Cisco advised all users of IOS XE devices to disconnect them from the internet due to active exploitation of the vulnerabilities.\n\nThe persistence of these cyber threats highlights the importance of timely software updates and adherence to security best practices. Organisations using Cisco devices are strongly advised to apply the recommended patches and review their network security measures to mitigate potential risks.",

Together, we discussed the \" Extended Learning for Teachers and Trainers in Higher Education \" project - a groundbreaking initiative led by seven Academy Support Centers. This project is all about empowering educators with cutting-edge extended learning methodologies and tools, helping to craft more engaging and supportive educational experiences that resonate with students.\n\nIn 2024, we embarked on an exciting global tour with three dynamic conferences which began in the vibrant heart of Peru, where we united partners from across Latin America to celebrate their incredible contributions. Together, we showcased the profound impact of our program to local government officials, highlighting the transformative power of our collaboration.\n\nEvery year, we gather at the Annual Cisco Networking Academy Conferences to celebrate our partners' achievements, recognizing their dedication with the Be the Bridge Awards-honoring exemplary efforts in categories like Inclusive Futures, Global Reach, Impacting Lives, Learning Innovation, and Partnerships - and the prestigious Golden Bridge Awards, presented in each geographic region to individuals or institutions showing exceptional commitment to student success.\n\nThese organizations, from both the private and public sectors, tirelessly support and execute our programs globally with unmatched dedication and passion. Our partners, instructors, and students prove that this program is not just about impressive numbers, but about people committed to making a difference through the transformative power of education.\n\nCisco Networking Academy's success would not be possible without our partners.\n\nIn honor of our 25th anniversary in fiscal 2023, we set an ambitious 10-year goal to equip an additional 25 million people with digital and cybersecurity skills by fiscal 2032. As of fiscal 2024 , we have already trained 7.7 million students globally, making significant strides toward our regional targets and reaffirming our commitment to creating a more inclusive digital future.\n\nAs we look back on a remarkable year at Cisco Networking Academy , we celebrate our enduring legacy as one of the longest-standing IT skills-to-jobs programs in the world. In line with Cisco's mission to Power an Inclusive Future for All , we have continued to transform lives by bridging digital divides and empowering underrepresented communities through technology and education.

According to a November advisory from Five Eyes, these security flaws were among the top four most frequently exploited in 2023.\n\nIniskt Group advises network admins operating Internet-exposed Cisco IOS XE network devices to apply available security patches as soon as possible and avoid exposing administration interfaces or non-essential services directly to the Internet.\n\n\"To date, we have not been able to validate these claims but continue to review available data. In 2023, we issued a security advisory disclosing these vulnerabilities along with guidance for customers to urgently apply the available software fix,\" a Cisco spokesperson told BleepingComputer after publishing time.\n\n\"We strongly advise customers to patch known vulnerabilities that have been disclosed and follow industry best practices for securing management protocols.\"\n\nThese breaches are part of a broader campaign confirmed by the FBI and CISA in October. In these attacks, the Chinese state hackers breached multiple U.S. telecom carriers (including AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream) and telecom companies in dozens of other countries.\n\nWhile they had access to the U.S. telecoms' networks, they compromised the \"private communications\" of a \"limited number\" of U.S. government officials and accessed the U.S. law enforcement's wiretapping platform.\n\nThe Salt Typhoon Chinese cyber-espionage group (also tracked as FamousSparrow, Ghost Emperor, Earth Estries, and UNC2286) has been breaching telecom companies and government entities since at least 2019.\n\nUpdate February 14, 11:31 EST: Added Cisco statement.",

            "content": "Last year, Cisco Live 2024 was my first proper introduction to the company in all its glory and if I\u2019m honest I was somewhat overwhelmed by its scale and breadth.\n\nFortunately for me, the overriding theme in Amsterdam that year was tightly focused on unifying Cisco\u2019s byzantine product ecosystem under one integrated platform. In 2024, the firm\u2019s foremost storyteller Jeetu Patel, who was EVP and GM of security & collaboration at the time and now is Cisco\u2019s chief product officer, set out his strategy for how Cisco was going to drive value for customers through its platform approach.\n\nI found this to be a compelling vision. Businesses can derive significant value from integrated platforms that help them manage the complexity of their IT estate, as they rush to add various technologies to keep their services efficient and secure while contending with skills shortages that limit their ability to do so.\n\nFast forward to Cisco Live 2025 and this message was still there. But while simplifying complexity through integration remained a key undercurrent in many of Cisco\u2019s announcements, the focus on the platform felt more implicit this year rather than the central theme of the event. This year\u2019s announcements showed that while the unified approach is important to Cisco, it\u2019s the quality of the networking and security products being unified that\u2019s really the key to its success.\n\nThroughout the event, Patel stressed the importance of the company\u2019s networking and security announcements in the context of Cisco\u2019s wider ecosystem. Take the new N9300 Series Smart Switches, for example, built using Cisco\u2019s Silicon One architecture and now featuring AMD\u2019s Pensando data processing units (DPUs).\n\nThese new switches aren\u2019t the first to be equipped with DPUs but Cisco says their unique value comes with the combination of these switches and its existing Hypershield security architecture, something competitors can\u2019t offer.\n\nBy combining of these two offerings promises to bring advanced security inspection and segmentation services across a distributed network, giving end-users the ability to embed security at the micro service level.\n\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Integrating these security services into the networking side of the business has been a significant focus for Cisco over recent years, and now it looks like this is coming to fruition.\n\nOn stage Oliver Tuszik, EMEA president at Cisco, stressed the old adage that today every company is a tech company. Giving it a 2020s twist, he added that every company is now also becoming an AI company \u2013 making digital resilience the other side of the coin from business resilience.\n\nConsidering the fact that the network is the backbone of any IT estate, consolidating security and networking has always been an easy decision for Cisco, and now it can look to reap the benefits.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nCisco\u2019s bread and butter is still the network \u2013 especially for AI\n\nWith the complications of AI advancements such as DeepSeek and Operator (OpenAI\u2019s AI agent) will put new burdens on IT teams. Patel predicted that businesses could be using hundreds or thousands of models, and multiple AI agents in multiple different data centers, which will place unprecedented strains on networking infrastructure.\n\nAcross the course of the event, Cisco didn\u2019t shy away from showing off a stream of products they were bringing out to address this fact. A new AI server, the UCS C854A M8 fills out a previously missing part of Cisco\u2019s AI data center portfolio with a flexible solution dedicated for training large models.\n\nThe company\u2019s Agile Service Networking architecture, Cisco 8000 Series routers and pint-sized Coherent Pluggable Optics, also serve the same aim of helping customers modernize their networks ready for the oncoming wave of AI workloads they envisage running in the near future.\n\nSpeaking to ITPro, Bola Rotibi, chief of Enterprise Research at CCS Insight, agreed that this year the explicit references to the platform took a back seat as the firm leant back on its networking bona fides, but she said this was a shrewd move in many ways and highlighted where Cisco really has an edge on the competition.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve made some very smart acquisitions but at the same time I think where they have not lost their edge is that they are the network company and that everything they think about has to be framed in how we help people with all the other pieces,\" she explained.\n\n\u201cSo the story about the network driving AI is a really smart move because it allows them to talk about various technologies from their strength and their focus on the network, I think that\u2019s a really smart move.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the platform was completely sidelined, however. Patel cited the platform during the opening as a structural advantage Cisco has that it can use to capitalize on key technological shifts this year, namely DeepSeek\u2019s seismic impact on the AI industry as well as the ongoing fervor around AI agents in the enterprise.\n\nPatel described it as Cisco\u2019s \u2018platform advantage\u2019 that ensures that as customers invest in new infrastructure according to these two macro trends they see a compounding value of the platform.\n\nRELATED WHITEPAPER (Image credit: ServiceNow) Improve the effectiveness of your security team\n\n\u201cEvery single capability and product that we build should reduce the marginal cost of ingestion of every subsequent product that\u2019s actually going to be ingested by you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that the cost of adopting new technology from Cisco goes down precipitously and it compounds value in the products that you might already have.\u201d\n\nBoth Tuszik and Patel expressed that they were \u201cbullish\u201d on the firm's position in the market moving forward, but with financial disclosures to come in the days following the conference they couldn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nIt looks like they were right to be confident, however, as the firm raised its annual outlook citing strong demand for AI networking infrastructure with its stock jumping to a 24-year high.\n\nMy only concern last year around Cisco\u2019s platform \u2018story\u2019 was that there was no mention of how other vendors would fit into this picture, and the company did little to reassure me this year either. The IT ecosystem is defined by heterogeneity and no matter how big, Cisco will need to demonstrate how its platform connects to business solutions from other vendors, and how it will help customers manage this complexity.",

The compromised companies include an unnamed U.S. internet service provider and telecom company, a U.S.-based affiliate of a U.K. telecom provider, a large telecom provider in Thailand, an Italy-based ISP and a South Africa-based telecom provider.\n\nSalt Typhoon\u2019s ongoing attack spree underscores the enduring challenge global cyber authorities and network defenders confront in trying to thwart the nation-state group\u2019s activities. U.S. and White House officials in December warned they may never know if the group has been completely booted from networks.\n\nAttackers primarily targeted internet-exposed Cisco network routers over the past couple months, according to Recorded Future. Tracked as RedMike by the company, the group has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco routers worldwide \u2014 focusing mainly on those running in telecom networks \u2014 since early December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe threat group exploited a pair of known privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE, the vendor\u2019s operating system for networking devices, Recorded Future said in the report.\n\nVulnerabilities in network devices are a common intrusion point for cyberattacks.\n\nThe pair of CVEs impacting Cisco IOS XE \u2014 CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 \u2014 were the third and fourth most routinely-exploited vulnerabilities in 2023, according to a Five Eyes cyber advisory released in November.\n\nIn the attacks monitored by Recorded Future, Salt Typhoon chained multiple vulnerabilities together. First, it exploited CVE-2023-20198, a vulnerability with a 10 score on the CVSS scale, in order to create a local user and password on the targeted device. Using this new account, it then accessed the device and exploited CVE-2023-20273 to gain root user privileges.\n\n\u201cWe have not observed other initial access vectors related to this campaign at this time,\u201d Jon Condra, senior director of strategic intelligence at Recorded Future, said in an email. \u201cWe also have no indication that the previously publicized intrusions against AT&T, Verizon, etc. linked to Salt Typhoon were linked to these specific vulnerabilities or Cisco devices more broadly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthorities haven\u2019t identified the primary initial access point for Salt Typhoon\u2019s attacks, but hardening guidance released by U.S. and global officials in December specifically called out the need for network defenders to address the risk of Cisco device exploitation. Officials didn\u2019t mention specific vulnerabilities in the guidance, but advised organizations to refer to Cisco\u2019s hardening guides for NX-OS software devices and IOS-XE.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, Cisco published a security advisory disclosing multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE software,\u201d a Cisco spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the Cisco devices targeted by Salt Typhoon since early December were used by telecom providers based in the U.S., South America and India, but other targeted devices were spread across more than 100 countries, according to Recorded Future. Researchers also observed Salt Typhoon attempting to exploit Cisco devices used by universities in nine countries, including four in the U.S., potentially targeting research related to telecom, engineering and technology.\n\nSalt Typhoon\u2019s attack spree targeting global telecom networks began up to two years before it was discovered by U.S. officials in late spring of last year. The Chinese nation-state threat group gained broad and full access to U.S. telecom networks, stole metadata, geolocated millions of individuals at will and directly targeted and stole communications of about 100 individuals involved in government or political activities.\n\nSalt Typhoon is one of three known and active threat groups affiliated with China\u2019s government. U.S. authorities have been warning about Chinese hacking efforts targeting critical infrastructure with increasing alarm since early 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecorded Future\u2019s research on the group\u2019s ongoing activities follows a series of sanctions placed on China-based organizations and individuals for their alleged involvement in the telecom network attacks and a December hack of the Treasury Department.",

The Record is an editorially independent unit of Recorded Future.\n\nAmong the targeted organizations was a South African telecom, as well as a U.S.-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications company.\n\n\u201cThe group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nInsikt Group observed seven total compromised Cisco network devices communicating with Salt Typhoon infrastructure \u2014 including those connected to telecommunications companies in the U.S. and South Africa, as well as others in Italy and Thailand.\n\nResearchers also saw the group carry out reconnaissance activity in December on IP addresses owned by the Myanmar-based provider Mytel.\n\nMore than half of the Cisco devices targeted by Salt Typhoon were in the U.S., South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned more than 100 other countries.\n\nThey also observed the hackers targeting devices connected to universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the hackers attacked universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering and technology.\n\nU.S. officials have for months raised alarms about Salt Typhoon, which they say has breached at least nine U.S. telecommunications giants including Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Lumen.\n\nAs in other Chinese government hacking campaigns, Salt Typhoon has made a point of targeting unpatched network devices like those from Cisco to gain initial access to critical systems.\n\nThe hackers allegedly used their deep access to telecom networks to obtain call information from several high-profile political figures, including Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee at the time, and his running mate JD Vance, as well as senior Democratic Party leaders and members of then-Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 staff.\n\nPoints of entry\n\nThe hackers targeted unpatched Cisco devices vulnerable to the bugs CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. The first bug was the method of entry while the second allowed for escalated privileges in a victim\u2019s system. The hackers have been reconfiguring the exploited devices and creating a link to them that allows for persistent access.\n\nInsikt Group saw the hackers scanning for exploitable devices on six distinct occasions throughout December and January, including on December 4, 10, 17 and 24. In January, the hackers scanned for unpatched devices on the 13th and 23rd.\n\nThe geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by Salt Typhoon. Credit: Recorded Future\n\nThe researchers urged any administrators using these specific Cisco network devices to check for potential exploitation on those dates. Using its own scanning tools, Insikt Group found more than 12,000 Cisco network devices exposed to the internet \u2014 leading them to believe the Salt Typhoon activity was targeted given that only a portion of the devices were attacked.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about the activity. The Justice Department said it had nothing further to add.\n\nIn January, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against a Chinese contractor allegedly involved in the Salt Typhoon campaign.\n\nThe Treasury Department said Salt Typhoon has compromised \u201cnumerous\u201d U.S. companies in the communication sector since 2019 but the most recent campaign against multiple major U.S. telecommunication and internet service provider companies marks \u201ca dramatic escalation in the Chinese cyber operations against U.S. critical infrastructure targets.\u201d\n\nIn its report on Thursday, Insikt Group said Chinese threat activity has shifted heavily toward exploiting Cisco devices for initial access over the past five years.\n\n\u201c[Salt Typhoon] exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat,\u201d they said. \u201cPersistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Munich Cyber Security Conference 2025 Live Updates",

            "content": "Cisco Systems (CSCO -1.20%) stock is climbing higher in Thursday's trading. The company's share price was up 2% as of 2 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index was up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.9%. Shares had been up as much as 6.3% earlier in trading.\n\nAfter the market closed yesterday, Cisco published results for the second quarter of its current fiscal year, which ended Dec. 31. The network technologies specialist posted sales and earnings performance for the period that beat Wall Street's target. The company's valuation is also moving higher today following new bullish coverage from analysts.\n\nCisco stock posts gains on fiscal Q2 beats\n\nIn fiscal Q2, Cisco reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.94 on sales of $13.99 billion. The performance topped the average analyst estimate's call for adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 on sales of $13.87 billion. Revenue in the period was up 9.4% year over year, and the company reported artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure orders of $350 million. Management said product orders in the period were up 29% annually -- or 11% after factoring out the contribution from Splunk.\n\nIn conjunction with the earnings release, Cisco announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share, a 3% increase above its previous level. The company also said that it had received board authorization for an additional $15 billion in share repurchases.\n\nFor fiscal Q3, Cisco is guiding for sales between $13.9 billion and $14.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $0.90 and $0.92. Full-year sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $56.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $3.68 and $3.74.\n\nAnalysts are getting more bullish on Cisco stock\n\nFollowing the company's fiscal Q2 release, Cisco stock has received price target increases from multiple analysts. In a note published before the market opened today, Rosenblatt upgraded Cisco stock from neutral to buy and raised its one-year price target on the stock from $66 per share to $80 per share. The firm's analysts cited AI-related catalysts as reasons for the ratings and price target hikes.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also published new coverage on Cisco this morning, with the lead analyst on the stock, Samik Chatterjee, maintaining an overweight rating and increasing his one-year price target from $69 per share to $73 per share. The analyst said that the company's recent quarterly report showed strong demand indicators and expects sales growth momentum and potential earnings beats to offset potential adverse tariff impacts.\n\nAdding to the bullish commentary, Bank of America maintained a buy rating on Cisco and increased its one-year price target on the stock from $72 per share to $76 per share. The company sees AI infrastructure expansion powering strong results for the company this year and expects continued growth in the second half of the fiscal year.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. gained after the company gave an upbeat sales forecast for the current quarter, helped by companies spending more on computing infrastructure to take advantage of AI technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRevenue in the quarter ending in April will be $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion, Cisco said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted a figure at the bottom end of that range.\n\nThe company \u2014 the largest seller of networking gear \u2014 also raised its fiscal 2025 target by about $1 billion to just more than $56 billion. That compared with a $55.97 billion average estimate.\n\nCorporate clients have been bolstering their networking systems to help speed the creation and use of artificial intelligence. The outlook suggests that spending by those customers is helping make up for weaker orders from the federal government, which had put some projects on hold after the change of administration in Washington.\n\n\u201cAs AI becomes more pervasive, we are well positioned to help our customers scale their network infrastructure, increase their data capacity requirements and adopt best-in-class AI security,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement.\n\nCisco shares climbed as much as 6.4% after markets opened in New York on Thursday, their biggest same-day gain in six months.\n\nCisco\u2019s switches and routers are the key pieces of equipment that direct data traffic in and out of networks and around the internet. The company has also pushed further into software and services, a shift accelerated by last year\u2019s acquisition of the data-crunching business Splunk.\n\nProduct orders rose 29% from a year ago in the fiscal second quarter, which ended Jan. 25. Minus the contribution from Splunk, new orders were up 11%, the company said.\n\nIn a separate filing, Cisco said that Gary Steele, president of the company\u2019s go-to-market division, is leaving. The executive, who previously ran Splunk, is taking a CEO job at an unidentified business.\n\nGovernment Slowdown\n\nThough public sector demand isn\u2019t at levels that Cisco has previously experienced, the weakness is mainly confined to a slice of that market. Cisco gets the majority of its US government business from the Department of Defense and only about 25% from other agencies. It\u2019s those civilian divisions of the government that are ordering less, Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said in an interview.",

            "content": "Cisco has launched a new AI Defense security solution it says covers the entire range of potential LLM security threats to help businesses implement generative AI across their organization with confidence.\n\nAs firms rush to deploy generative AI tools, be that through internally developed models, customized APIs, or external applications, they significantly increase their attack surface \u2013 and Cisco is targeting new demand for holistic LLM security.\n\nCisco\u2019s new AI Defense platform uses a combination of its existing cloud-based security expertise alongside the latest research to protect organizations against the misuse of AI tools, data leakage, and new LLM jailbreaking techniques.\n\nWith respect to tackling the dangers of shadow AI, AI Defense leverages Cisco\u2019s Secure Access product to prevent employees from accessing unsanctioned AI tools and misusing authorized systems, as well as protecting them from accidentally introducing confidential company information into these external models.\n\nBut the challenge of securing internal AI systems from external threats is equally pressing for businesses looking to leverage generative AI.\n\nNew LLM jailbreaking techniques such as Deceptive Delight, Skeleton Key, Low-Resource Languages, or context window overload have all exposed relatively simple ways in which attackers can manipulate the security guardrails of popular LLMs.\n\nSpeaking to ITPro, DJ Sampath, VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, said the problem is even worse once companies start to customize the models for their organization, meaning IT teams need to continually reassess the integrity of the model and overlay additional guardrails.\n\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

You don\u2019t know with that fine-tuning if you are knocking off some of the internal guardrails or not,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe only way you know that is by doing model validation over and over again. That\u2019s one of the core pieces of Cisco AI defense, which ensures that even after a fine-tune the model is not changing and, then if it has changed, you have the ability to protect it using guardrails.\u201d\n\nCisco looks to establish itself as a knowledge leader in LLM security\n\nSampath said Cisco is able to protect models from the latest jailbreaking methods by leveraging research from a recent acquisition it made last year.\n\nCisco acquired security startup Robust Intelligence in August 2024, which soon afterwards published a paper on its pioneering approach to LLM jailbreaking called Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP).\n\nThe TAP method is essentially an automated method for generating jailbreaks for LLMs without requiring access to its internal mechanisms, Sampath explained, noting that once it identifies a weakness it digs down to uncover every possible way in which an attacker could compromise the model using this vulnerability.\n\nHe added that the team published another paper on potential techniques that could be used to jailbreak a chain of thought or reasoning model, which he said requires a fundamentally different approach.\n\nRELATED WHITEPAPER (Image credit: Dell) Blend technical expertise with business acumen\n\nSampath said such is the quality of this unit\u2019s research that they are collaborating with bodies including NIST, MITRE, and OWASP to come up with standards to define how the industry should approach AI security.\n\nHe argued this gives Cisco a privileged position to establish itself as a knowledge leader on LLM security, and help the model makers themselves shore up their products.\n\n\u201cWe, Cisco, now have a seat at the table with these standards organizations. Not just that we\u2019re influencing it but we\u2019re able to publish some of this bleeding edge research and that research feeds into making these models better.\u201d\n\nCisco AI Defense is still currently in private beta and will be available in March 2025.",

The document even points out that Juniper has only won single-digit market share \u201cin a space where there are more than eight other credible competitors.\u201d\n\nThe real fight is over networks for AI\n\nAnalyst firm Andover Intel has weighed in on the case with a post titled \u201cDoes a DoJ Block of the HPE/Juniper Merger Really Help Cisco?\u201d\n\nPrincipal analyst Tom Nolle\u2019s answer is \u201cyes\u201d. He reasons that the total addressable market for networking equipment isn\u2019t growing fast, and that buyers seldom ditch incumbent suppliers.\n\nHowever buyers are open to new suppliers when building on-prem AI infrastructure.\n\n\u201cCisco\u2019s reorg around AI is, IMHO, clearly aimed at keeping control of the one development that could create a new little enclave of network deployment. In-house AI means a cluster of GPU servers, perhaps requiring a data center network of their own.\u201d\n\nThe analyst thinks that \u201cJuniper\u2019s AIops positioning has been effective against Cisco in areas where any sort of major network upgrade was proposed, and even won a few deals that displaced Cisco gear.\u201d\n\nAs HPE sells AI servers, after acquiring Juniper it would be in a strong position to provide networks too.\n\n\u201cFor decades, my involvement with enterprises has shown that data center networking drives enterprise networking, and data center technology drives data center networking. Cisco has servers (UCS) but they don\u2019t have a significant position in the enterprise data center market. HPE does.\u201d\n\nNolle also thinks HPE\u2019s \u201cstrategic influence among enterprise buyers is better than Cisco\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, from all of this, it would seem that blocking the merger helps Cisco,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, given that Cisco is the incumbent, it could also hurt competition if the DoJ succeeds.\u201d\n\nBut even if the deal is blocked, Nolle doesn\u2019t think Cisco will be doing cartwheels.\n\n\u201cThe only solution for Cisco in the long run is to add to the size of the network pie, and get the largest share of the addition. Yes, HPE/Juniper might be in a better place to do that, but HPE alone, and IBM alone, and maybe even Dell and Oracle and Broadcom alone, could do that too. Networks deliver stuff, and it\u2019s the applications that create the stuff that builds business cases.\u201d \u00ae",

These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as customer demand and our position to help our customers scale their network infrastructure, increase their data capacity requirements, and adopt best-in-class AI security) and the future financial performance of Cisco (including the guidance for Q3 FY 2025 and full year FY 2025) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; our development and use of artificial intelligence; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market, cloud, enterprise and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain key priority areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in Networking and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; supply constraints; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and services markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, other intellectual property, antitrust, stockholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of restructurings and possible changes in the size and timing of related charges; cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents; vulnerabilities and critical security defects; our ability to protect personal data; evolving regulatory uncertainty; terrorism; natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change); any pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on November 19, 2024 and September 5, 2024, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. Cisco's results of operations for the three and six months ended January 25, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of Cisco's operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release.\n\nThis release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\nCisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations.\n\nFor its internal budgeting process, Cisco's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition/divestiture-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, Russia-Ukraine war costs, gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Cisco's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that is revolutionizing the way organizations connect and protect in the AI era.

Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future\u00ae Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.\n\nRedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.\n\nUnpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization\u2019s infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have shifted heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMike\u2019s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMike\u2019s targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.\n\nOrganizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.\n\nAdditionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.\n\nKey Findings\n\nDespite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.\n\nRedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.\n\nRedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.\n\nBackground\n\nIn late September 2024, media reporting (1, 2) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (1), AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets reporting that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on US lawful intercept targets and intercept the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoon\u2019s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have briefed the US Senate, CISA recently issued guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint warning encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.\n\nInsikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an overlap with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (Kaspersky) and FamousSparrow (ESET).\n\nOn January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, China\u2019s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nCisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.\n\nThe privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and published by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.\n\nFigure 1: RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nMore than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.\n\nOften involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has targeted universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) for medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly targeted academics. China\u2019s cyber strategy aligns with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.\n\nRedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft.\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) \u2014 US\n\nCalifornia State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC) \u2014 US\n\nLoyola Marymount University \u2014 US\n\nUtah Tech University \u2014 US\n\nUniversidad de La Punta \u2014 Argentina\n\nIslamic University of Technology (IUT) \u2014 Bangladesh\n\nUniversitas Sebelas Maret \u2014 Indonesia\n\nUniversitas Negeri Malang \u2014 Indonesia\n\nUniversity of Malaya \u2014 Malaysia\n\nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma \u2014 Mexico\n\nTechnische Universiteit Delft \u2014 The Netherlands\n\nSripatum University \u2014 Thailand\n\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 Vietnam\n\nFigure 2: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nRedMike\u2019s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.\n\n2024-12-04\n\n2024-12-10\n\n2024-12-17\n\n2024-12-24\n\n2025-01-13\n\n2025-01-23\n\nNetwork administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.\n\nUsing internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.\n\nCompromised Telecommunications Provider Devices\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:\n\nA US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider\n\nA US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company\n\nA South African telecommunications provider\n\nAn Italian ISP\n\nA large Thailand telecommunications provider\n\nRedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.\n\nReconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider\n\nIn mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

And then obviously, the web-scale performance that we saw with five out of the -- or I'm sorry, three out of the six growing over 100% year over year, two of the six growing over 50% year over year, so it was very balanced. And so, far, I think that despite the geopolitical risk, despite the uncertainty that's going on in the U.S. and in the marketplace around the world, I think the one thing our customers understand is that their need to continue spending on technology is just there.\n\nAnd there's so much change going on right now from a technology perspective that there's both excitement about the opportunity, and candidly, there's a little bit of fear of slowing down too much and letting your competition get too much ahead of you. So, we saw solid demand.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you. And I just want to remind analysts to ask one question and a follow-up question. At the same time, Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\n\nYeah, hey, thanks a lot, guys, and congrats on the quarter. It's good to see you guys with the momentum. Chuck, we've got a lot of questions very recently about a new switch that you just put out, the 9,300 Nexus. And this programmable switch market looks like there's a lot of strong prospects there.\n\nJust wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that product and maybe why you went with AMD for the product and what that means for your -- versus your NVIDIA products. And my follow-up just is with regard to the overall comment of just overall demand just sounds much better than a few quarters ago. I just wanted some -- the view that -- do you still think people are getting ready for AI? Or I don't know if I heard that from you this time that, in the last two quarters, people were getting ready for AI, and it picked up. And this just sounded like a little more firm, but I was just wondering for a little more color on that.\n\nHopefully, that didn't run on too long, Sami, but I'll pass it back to you.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Ben. No, we got them both. Look, first and foremost, I want to just thank the team in our product organization because the innovation that they've been delivering over the last 12 to 18 months has been at a pace that we haven't seen in a very long time. We've seen a lot on the collab space in the security space, a lot in the silicon space, and then in the web scale infrastructure.\n\nAnd now I think what you referenced this switch with the DPU in it is a great example of the innovation that we are going to drive in our core networking portfolio. And so, it's -- I can't speak to exactly why the team chose the AMD, DPU other than I'm sure they did an analysis and thought it was the best solution for us. But this is a real -- it's a breakthrough product because it allows us to Candidly, we can take security out of these appliances that they come in and put it where it belongs, which is everywhere. Security needs to be deployed everywhere, and this really allows us to integrate security deeply into the network and at the speed of the network.\n\nSo, what this allows us to do is -- you can run network services or security services on these DPUs in the network at the speed of the ASICs as opposed to moving this traffic to a central place where you're going to be limited by the processing power of a single box. And so, the first use case, as you are aware, is Hypershield, which we announced, and we had a couple of big Fortune wins in the prior quarter, even as we're just building out the final capabilities on Hypershield. So, that's going to be the first deployment. If you think about the use case, you could put one of these switches sitting at between zones in a data center and running all the traffic through it at line speed and doing security inspection via Hypershield to protect different zones from east-west threats.\n\nSo, it's -- we think it's got a lot of potential, and this is just the first service or first use case that the teams have come up with. On your second question, we absolutely believe that a lot of this demand is being driven by customers preparing for AI. We even think a lot of the telco demand that we see is -- or the telcos building out their networks to be prepared to deliver AI as a service or AI-driven services. And so, while I didn't call it out, it's one of the pillars that we talk about relative to our role in AI, and we do think there's an acceleration of companies that are just trying to get prepared for what they're going to need.\n\nIt's clear that a genetic AI work streams are going to put more capacity onto the network.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Ben. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Niknam -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just maybe to dovetail on the prior question. You talked -- talk about enterprises investing a little bit more in AI. I'm just wondering, as they've come into the new calendar, what you're seeing in hearing specifically from enterprise customers on the AI front and how meaningful it is for your business today.\n\nAnd then just as a follow-up, maybe for Scott. You did about 68.7% on a gross margin front this past quarter. I think the guide implies a step down to between 67% to 68%. I'm wondering maybe what informs that view.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, I would say what we're seeing on the enterprise side relative to AI is it's still -- customers are still in the very early days, and they all realize they need to figure out exactly what their use cases are. We're starting to see some spending though on specific AI-driven infrastructure. And we think as we get AI pods out there -- we got Hyperfabric coming. We got AI defense coming.\n\nWe have Hypershield in the market. And we got this new DPU switch, they are all going to be a part of the infrastructure to support these AI applications. So, we're beginning to see it happen, but I think it's also really important to understand that as the enterprises leverage their private data, their proprietary data, and they'll do some training on that and then they'll run inference obviously against that. We believe that opportunity is an order of magnitude higher than what we've seen in training today.\n\nWe're going to continue to innovate and build capabilities to put ourselves in a better position to be a real beneficiary as this continues to accelerate. But as of today, we feel like we're in pretty good shape.\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Matthew, on your question on gross margin, the guide at 67% to 68% for Q3 -- and by the way, I think it settles in in that range for the full year. What's built into that and driving the step down from where we were in Q2 is we have -- and this was noted in the -- in my commentary upfront, we have built in the cost of the proposed tariffs that we've seen so far. So, the additional 10% in China, the 25% on Canada, and Mexico. Canada has a negligible impact on us.\n\nAnd the steel and aluminum, we've quantified those out again, assuming the March 1 date. I think it's such a fluid environment right now. It's very difficult to say what's actually going to happen. But I wanted to protect the guide and ensure that we built in the 25% that's been proposed.\n\nI will tell you we've got a supply chain team that over the last several years has built a lot of muscle around the tariff that we had in China and how do we work our way around that. And from the time that was first imposed to where we are now, our mitigation activities have reduced our exposure there by about 80%. So, we've game-planned out several scenarios and steps we could take depending on what actually goes into effect, we'll start to take those steps to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. But what I built into the cost of goods sold, that's where the tariffs will hit, is the full effect of 25% in Mexico, Canada, and additional 10% in China, with no mitigation at this point -- but no mitigation built in at this time.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Matt. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I'll follow up on that tariff question to start off. You do mention you're embedding in the cost of the tariffs, but I think we're getting a lot of questions also in terms of how to think about demand. So, Chuck or Scott, I mean, any thoughts in terms of how you've seen enterprises -- enterprise customers respond on a demand basis to previous tariffs? And how does that inform your view in terms of what to expect for demand? And sort of -- are you seeing any pull forward from customers to avoid some of these tariffs in the first place? And for my follow-up, I think it's more about hyperscaler and the AI momentum you're seeing there.\n\nYou're seeing strong momentum in orders, but what is -- maybe if you can give us some insights on deployments, we can see the strong capex numbers or guidance from them, but is there any acceleration or sort of more on track in terms of deployment base relative to what you expected? Thank you.\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Samik, on the first question, we're not seeing any evidence of customer pulling demand ahead. I think the tariff environment is very fluid right now. It's a very dynamic environment. While everyone is taking note, I think until we know what's actually going to go into effect, it will be very difficult for our customers to decide what to do.\n\nI think the other thing that as we look at the steps we would take to mitigate the impact of demand, there are a number of steps we can take to offset the cost. We obviously would have price as a lever, but there's a number of considerations that we have to go through before we got there. Right now, I don't envision that. What we would look to do first is make some of the changes we need to make inside the supply chain to mitigate the impact of whatever tariff regime gets put into place.\n\nSo, not seeing any evidence of any pull ahead in demand.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. And Samik, I think on the question relative to the web scale demand versus their deployments, I think that there -- I think the bottom line is that I've set with all these customers, and they've looked at me and said, \"If you can build more, we will buy more.\" So, I think that a couple of them had initial targets for how many units they wanted in 2025, and that number has already gone up by 50%. So, I think the deployments are moving very rapidly and on track and we continue to respond to all of their demand. And frankly, the changes that they make as their strategy evolves on it's a very dynamic.\n\nIt's a very dynamic market.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with BofA Securities. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani -- Analyst\n\nHi. Great quarter, but I have a question about maybe the weaker parts. If my math is right, and I'm not sure it's right. So, I need clarification.\n\nSplunk was down 11% this quarter year over year, maybe my numbers are totally wrong. So, if you can clarify what's happening with Splunk, can you give us an update on the trends? And the second question is security and observability. It's supposed to accelerate -- it accelerated last quarter. Can you talk about the trends this quarter and kind of the good parts and the bad parts of the growth? Thanks.\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nOK. I'll take the first one, and then, Chuck, we can tag team in a second if you want. On the -- I'm not sure what math you're doing, Tal. I think one thing that is not visible to you with the math that you've got in front of you is the end of Splunk's quarter, their fiscal -- by the way, this would have been the end of January was the end of their prior Q4.\n\nSo, as with every enterprise software company, of course, Q4 is the biggest quarter of the year. And in fact, it gets back-end loaded so that the Week 13 of that Q4 is the biggest week of the quarter. The way the calendar fell this year, our fiscal quarter ended on January '25. So, that last week of January that was historically Splunk's Q4, actually, is not captured in our Q2 results.\n\nIt will flow into our Q3 results. That may be what's throwing you off on the math. Splunk is still growing double digits. It's really right in line with our expectations modestly ahead of our expectations on the top line and is profitable well ahead of when we expected it to be profitable.\n\nSo, Splunk's performing quite nicely for us.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. On the security front, what I would say, Tal, is that look, we had always said we expected to see the acceleration in the second half of this year. We saw the last four quarters of growth from a demand perspective in organic security, which is a good sign. And what we've launched is all this new innovation that just takes time to ramp, but I can give you a couple of data points.\n\nIf you just look at two of the of the products, Cisco Security and XDR, between those two, we now have those deployed at over 1,000 customers, and each of them are actually supporting over 1 million enterprise users each. So, we're seeing the success they just need time to ramp. We've also launched Hypershield. I said earlier we won two Fortune 100 enterprise customers this past quarter, and there's a great deal of excitement.\n\nIf you look at AI defense with the AI Summit that we did recently, there's -- I think there's about 20-some-odd customers who are interested in going to proof of concept with us right now on it. We had almost half the Fortune 100 there for that event. So, I feel good about where we are. It will turn into greater demand as we just continue to scale these products.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Tal. Michelle, can move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nAmit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks. Just a quick question on the 700 million AI orders so far this year. Are these mainly switching in optical wins? Are you seeing wins other products? And then just curious if you're using any of these you see some very strong AI orders.\n\nAre we expecting it to start converting into revenue this fiscal year, or is that more of a fiscal '26 dynamic? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Amit. I'll take the first, and then, Scott, you speak to the revenue. On the $700 million in AI orders, it's a combination of systems, silicon, optics, and optical systems. And I think if you break it down, it's about half is in silicon and systems.\n\nAnd -- but it's -- it continues to accelerate. And I'd say the teams have done a great job on the silicon front. We've invested heavily in more resources there. The team is running parallel development efforts for multiple chips that are staggered in their time frames.\n\nThey've worked hard. They were increasing the yield, which is a positive thing. And so, we feel good about it, but it's a combination of all those things that we're selling to the customers. Scott, on the revenue side?\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Amit, it's no different than what we've said all along about when we expect this to turn into revenue. We knew the orders would come in well ahead of the actual ship dates. We do expect to see this revenue begin to ramp in the second half of the year, and that's consistent with what we've said from the start.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you for the questions. And Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJim Fish -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys, nice quarter. Working off a few things you guys just have talked about here. Can you just first give us an update as to the actual penetration of the 6,500 large customers you guys expected between Cisco and Splunk to jointly go after and any further bundling plans you have, but beyond what you just announced? And then secondly, to the last question, what are you guys seeing from where you're winning within the data center between the Silicon One approach versus sort of the systems approach with your AI wins? Would love additional color there. Thanks, guys.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Jim. So, on the Splunk side, I would say it's still early. These are still long sales cycles. And we're continuing to make progress.\n\nWe are having wins. I mean, they're clearly out there. We also have seen the benefit of the portfolio coming together with large customers doing our broad-based, what we call WPAs, and that are inclusive of Splunk now, the old Cisco WPA that are inclusive of Splunk. And we talked about this had a deal that they were leading that actually expanded the Cisco footprint.\n\nSo, we are beginning to see that, and we'll continue to see it as we go forward. I think you'll see as we get into the next couple of quarters, you're going to see more and more cross-selling sales incentives that the teams are putting in place that I think will continue to accelerate that. And on the second question, I think it was about how they're looking at systems versus -- silicon systems versus silicon. Yeah.\n\nI think that by and large, it's systems. Actual just raw silicon sales are still very small as a percentage of the total business. So, the general method of consumption is just to buy the systems.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I'll give you both obviously at the same time. So, I'm just trying to square, Chuck, your comments about the strength that you're seeing across the business because it looks like ex-Splunk enterprise orders maybe decelerated a little bit sequentially and the strength in, I guess it looks like the Americas was mostly SP and cloud.\n\nAnd then the second question I have is maybe longer term, there's been a high number or a large number of project announcements over the last couple of weeks with some pretty big announcements from maybe the white box ODM space with some big wins as well. So, maybe anything you can touch on from a competitive perspective on how you're thinking about maybe these bigger projects that have been announced maybe the risks out there from some of these other alternatives like DeepSeek, and then some of these wins that have been announced by some of the OD market and how you're thinking about the landscape? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. OK. So, first of all, on the enterprise, we've had four quarters of continued recovery. It was a little slower growth year over year than it was in Q1, but it's important to understand.\n\nI think Q2 over Q1 was up 29%. We literally took over $1 billion more in orders in Q2 than Q1. So, I don't think there's anything to be overly concerned about right there. And we saw real good strength in Asia in double digits.\n\nAnd I think Europe was close to double digits. And U.S. Enterprise just had a bunch of big deals in Q1 that I think just kind of slowed them down a little bit for Q2. On these other deals, I mean, if you look at technology like DeepSeek, we think as not DeepSeek in particular, but we think as we see more of this democratization of the access that is going to just facilitate a faster advancement of AI applications in the enterprise, first of all.\n\nSecondly, I think we ran our AI defense model. I think we did 50 prompts and the team -- this was in 48 hours of this thing being out, and I think they proved every time that they could jailbreak this thing pretty easily. So, I think we got to be careful as well. And the final thing I'd say on a lot of these unique deals out there, these bigger deals, I think we'll -- we're having success in the web scale space.\n\nAnd I think if we're being chosen in that space, I think we'll have a real good opportunity to play in these other emerging opportunities as they come about as well.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, David. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nAntoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAntoine Chkaiban -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, I'd like to follow up on the question regarding traction from enterprise customers in AI. Could you provide some additional color on where you are seeing Ethernet came in the enterprise segment, what kind of cluster side, what's use cases, which verticals? And then as a follow-up, I lost for your perspective on what you're hearing from these customers in terms of data center space and, in particular, access to power as potentially being a bottleneck to roll out infrastructure this year.\n\nThank you.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Antoine. Yeah, I don't think that we're not thinking about it from massive clusters that the enterprises are going to build. They're certainly building clusters to do training on their own models or they're renting space from one of the major GP providers to actually do their training and then pulling that back. And the infrastructure we're talking about is really to support the inferencing side of it.\n\nAnd I think by and large, to be candid, the customers who have bought like NVIDIA GPUs so far have just bought the whole stack on them. And so, we think that will be an emerging opportunity in the future. It's not really Ethernet under GPUs in the enterprise today, has been -- hasn't been a major opportunity to date. Now, we believe with the NVIDIA partnership, the hyper fabric stack, the AI pods, the things that we're building, we think that as we integrate that STACK together and they have these reference architectures to build that we think that that will lead to our networking equipment being combined with NVIDIA GPUs, and that's how we'll accomplish that in the future.\n\nAnd candidly, I don't think the -- there hasn't been a lot of concern over the power issue in the enterprise like it has been in the web scale space.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Antoine. Michelle, can we move to the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nAaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. I'll stick with the AI theme first, and then I'll throw out my quick follow-up. On the AI side, I think in the prepared comments, you had mentioned that your 51.22 silicon will come out, I think it was April time frame.\n\nAs you think about that 50% of your business on the AI orders being tied to switch and Silicon One silicon. Would you say that that is kind of the point of inflection like the majority of your AI wins are tied to that 51.22 silicon? Or just kind of trying to understand kind of the opening up of this monetization opportunity. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious like on the campus side, just kind of -- help us appreciate maybe the WiFi 7 precycle that you're starting to see or how you're thinking about that. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I think the comments we made on the 51.2 really was more of an enterprise comment in the Nexus portfolio, but it is Silicon One-based. And so, those chips will be used in the 8,000s as an example. But this is a -- if you get back to the silicon discussion that we had earlier, that team is designing multiple silicon architectures based on the use cases on the customer.\n\nDo they need deep buffers? Do they not need deep buffers? I mean, it's really -- is it a low-latency application? I mean, these -- all of these things come into play as they develop different pieces of silicon for that marketplace. So, we'll continue to develop and 51.2 is -- and then beyond, and they're already working on just subsequent chips that will continue to crank up the speeds in these data centers. On the campus side, I think that we're continuing to see the campus switching infrastructure, as I talked about earlier. And it's early days on the WiFi 7.\n\nI'd say customers are getting ready to begin deploying. I think we're going to move into that over the next two to three quarters where we'll see a full transition, both in the traditional on-prem access points and then also in the cloud managed.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nKarl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nKarl Ackerman -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thank you. Within Enterprise Networking, I think a couple of quarters ago, customer lead times bottom out at just a few weeks. Is the greater visibility and support of your April core outlook from enterprises and even telco operators coming from just a return to no order patterns or lead times extending out beyond a quarter across those customers as you begin to introduce AI pods and Hybridshield and perhaps some on-prem service offerings in addition to that? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nIt's just normalization of ordering. We haven't had any lead time pressure at all.\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. We're not seeing -- what's behind that question, Karl, is the demand that we're seeing today a function of extended lead times like we saw a couple of years ago. That's not the case. Our lead times are not extending.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Karl. Michelle, we can move to the last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAtif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAdrienne Colby -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nHi. It's Adrienne Colby for Atif. Thank you for taking the question. Earlier this week, you announced some offerings geared toward traditional service providers.\n\nI was just wondering if you could help us size this customer segment for Cisco and understand where these customers are in terms of their embrace of AI. What are some of the key issues that Cisco is just helping them address?\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nScott, do you want to comment on the size of the telco segment for us?\n\nRichard Scott Herren -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Overall, telco had a good quarter in the last quarter. That's actually a continuation of what we saw in Q1. And what we hear from telco, particularly in international, is they are in anticipation of demand on their networks driven by AI, doing the same thing that we hear enterprise is doing.\n\nThey know there's increased load coming. In many cases, they've sweated those assets some time because of the state of the financials in that industry, and they're coming back to the table to build out their networks in anticipation of the increased demand. I think we'll continue to see that for some period of time, telco by its nature and the size of the telco customers that we have can be a little bit -- episodic a little bit big deals in one quarter and not in the next. So, it's not something that I would expect to see on a steady state, but we're seeing good demand right now.\n\nAs they see the same thing, the same trend that enterprises see there's network load coming, we need to be ready for it.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, I think that's right. And I think the other thing that we see some of the European operators are looking at delivering AI as a service. We see a lot of them planning for AI edge applications that are sitting at the edge of their networks that they're managing for customers, etc. So, they are preparing, for sure.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nThank you, Adrienne. And I want to hand it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and I want to thank our teams. I'm really proud of these results, and the teams have been doing a really great job, both on the innovation front and engaging with our customers. We clearly live in a very dynamic world. And as Scott said earlier, as the impact of these potential tariffs become more clear, our teams will take the appropriate steps to mitigate where we can.\n\nI do feel good about our momentum. Again, the product innovation and particularly the innovation in our core, the portfolio, and how it's translating through to customer value, clearly, the AI tailwind, as well as the integration that has occurred so far relative to Splunk, and just the team's pure out execution, I'm confident in the steps we've been taking. I think it will lead to durability of the performance, and we want to just continue to deliver for our customers, deliver the right technology, the right value, and be a trusted partner for them. So, thank you for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you soon.\n\nSami Badri -- Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\n\nCisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2025 third-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 14, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

That move was followed by Jeetu Patel, formerly Cisco\u2019s executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration, being promoted to chief product officer in August.\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins said that Steele\u2019s leadership was \"instrumental\" in the integration between Splunk and Cisco. The integration has been very successful, with revenues in line with Cisco's expectations, Robbins said.\n\n\"During his time as our president of go-to-market, [Steele] also helped evolve our sales and go-to-market motions to drive growth and align with the needs of our customers and partners today and for the future. I want to thank [Steele] for his partnership, leadership, and unwavering commitment since we announced our intent to acquire Splunk 18 months ago,\" Robbins said during the company's Q2 2025 earnings call on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe company is immediately launching an internal and external search for a new go-to-market leader. Meanwhile, Steele will stay with Cisco until the company's third fiscal quarter to ensure a smooth transition, Robbins said.\n\nThe company\u2019s product revenues, which is led by the core networking business, increased 29 percent including Splunk during Cisco's Q2 2025.\n\nCisco in 2024 began reshuffling responsibilities across its executive leadership team beginning with the company\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer, Maria Martinez, leaving the company last February. In March, Liz Centoni, executive vice president and general manager of applications and chief strategy officer, was named executive vice president and chief customer experience officer. Thimaya Subaiya, the company\u2019s chief transformation officer, became executive vice president of operations. Mark Patterson, chief of staff to Robbins, became executive vice president and chief strategy officer.",

            "content": "When the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon was revealed last fall to have deeply penetrated major US telecommunications companies\u2014ultimately breaching no fewer than nine of the phone carriers and accessing Americans' texts and calls in real time\u2014that hacking campaign was treated as a four-alarm fire by the US government. Yet even after those hackers' high-profile exposure, they've continued their spree of breaking into telecom networks worldwide, including more in the US.\n\nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future on Wednesday night revealed in a report that they've seen Salt Typhoon breach five telecoms and internet service providers around the world, as well as more than a dozen universities from Utah to Vietnam, all between December and January. The telecoms include one US internet service provider and telecom firm and another US-based subsidiary of a UK telecom, according to the company's analysts, though they declined to name those victims to WIRED.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super active, and they continue to be super active,\u201d says Levi Gundert, who leads Recorded Future's research team known as Insikt Group. \u201cI think there's just a general under-appreciation for how aggressive they are being in turning telecommunications networks into Swiss cheese.\u201d\n\nTo carry out this latest campaign of intrusions, Salt Typhoon\u2014which Recorded Future tracks under its own name, RedMike, rather than the Typhoon handle created by Microsoft\u2014has targeted the internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco's IOS software, which runs on the networking giant's routers and switches. The hackers exploited two different vulnerabilities in those devices' code, one of which grants initial access, and another that provides root privileges, giving the hackers full control of an often powerful piece of equipment with access to a victim's network.\n\n\u201cAny time you're embedded in communication networks on infrastructure like routers, you have the keys to the kingdom in what you're able to access and observe and exfiltrate,\u201d Gundert says.\n\nRecorded Future found more than 12,000 Cisco devices whose web interfaces were exposed online, and says that the hackers targeted more than a thousand of those devices installed in networks worldwide. Of those, they appear to have focused on a smaller subset of telecoms and university networks whose Cisco devices they successfully exploited. For those selected targets, Salt Typhoon configured the hacked Cisco devices to connect to the hackers' own command-and-control servers via generic routing encapsulation, or GRE tunnels\u2014a protocol used to set up private communications channels\u2014then used those connections to maintain their access and steal data.\n\nWhen WIRED reached out to Cisco for comment, the company pointed to a security advisory it published about vulnerabilities in the web interface of its IOS software in 2023. \u201cWe continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in a statement.\n\nHacking network appliances as entry points to target victims\u2014often by exploiting known vulnerabilities that device owners have failed to patch\u2014has become standard operating procedure for Salt Typhoon and other Chinese hacking groups. That's in part because those network devices lack many of the security controls and monitoring software that's been extended to more traditional computing devices like servers and PCs. Recorded Future notes in its report that sophisticated Chinese espionage teams have targeted those vulnerable network appliances as a primary intrusion technique for at least five years.",

The data center is a huge topic of conversation again. Everybody's looking at how they can refresh their data center,' Cisco's SVP and GM of Cisco networking, data center and provider connectivity, told CRN ahead of Cisco Live EMEA 2025.\n\nCisco Systems has introduced a new Nexus 9300 series of smart switches with embedded data processing units and is offering Hypershield, the company's AI-powered security architecture for data center protection, as a service embedded on the new switches, the tech giant unveiled at Cisco Live EMEA 2025 on Tuesday.\n\nThe latest announcements come as many enterprises refresh their traditional data center environments to prepare for AI, which is demanding increased power, compute, and networking, Kevin Wollenweber, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco networking, data center and provider connectivity, told CRN ahead of Cisco Live EMEA.\n\n\"If you think about what\u2019s on the minds of our customers, [they] are looking at AI massively transforming everything they do in the data center,\u201d said Wollenweber (pictured). \u201cThe data center is a huge topic of conversation again. Everybody\u2019s looking at how they can refresh their data center.\"\n\n[Related: Cisco Amplifies AI Security With AI Defense]\n\nThe latest 9300 series smart switches powered by programmable AMD data processing units (DPUs) can be deployed as regular switches or with advanced features. Services can by embedded directly into the switch series as customers need to scale up or adapt to their changing IT needs, without adding more hardware, Wollenweber said.\n\n\"Think of it as a switch that can do service acceleration. Certain things that normally couldn't be done in an ASIC or in a [neural processing unit] NPU, we've added some technology to the switch that allows us to accelerate services, and so you can think of it as being able to process more than just the forwarding of packets, like a lot of our switches did before,\" he said.\n\nDPUs, as opposed to NPUs, are a little more programmable and flexible, Wollenweber said. If administrators don\u2019t turn on any accelerated services, the new switch series can act as a traditional top of rack switch.\n\nThe first integrated service on the new Nexus Smart Switch series is Hypershield. Cisco\u2019s Hypershield technology comes from the company's 2024 acquisition of Isovalent, a provider of open source, cloud-native networking and security. Cisco at the time said that Isovalent\u2019s technologies would become \u201ca cornerstone\u201d of the Cisco Security Cloud strategy and today, Hypershield enhances network security through micro-segmentation and policy enforcement across the infrastructure.\n\nWith Cisco Hypershield offered as the first service embedded on the new switches, customers will have access to an advanced, AI-native, distributed security architecture built directly into their data center fabrics, the company said.\n\n\u201cInstead of applying the policies at the server, we can move that security functionality into the network. We think that\u2019s really powerful because it allows you to have micro-segmentation and policy implementation anywhere you want, and actually fused into the network itself,\u201d Wollenweber said.\n\nThe combination also helps in closing the gap between the security and networking layers because administrators can automatically update security policies across their entire infrastructure from a single offering, Wollenweber said. This will help enterprises keep their security environments up to date with minimal manual effort, he added.\n\nEnd users can manage their security policies in the cloud or on premise through the Nexus dashboard.\n\nThe Nexus 9300 24-port 100G model, which is designed to be placed at the edge of the data center as a cloud \"on-ramp,\" will be generally available this spring. The 48-port 25G, 6-port 400G, and 2-port 100G models will be generally available this summer, according to San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco.\n\nNetworking, Security As One\n\nCisco continues to bridge the gap between networking and security by way of leadership changes announced last year. In August, Jeetu Patel, formerly Cisco's executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration, was promoted to chief product officer and is responsible for both Cisco's core networking and security businesses. Reporting to him is Tom Gillis, Cisco's senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Security, Data Center, Internet and Cloud Infrastructure Group as of December. Gillis was previously responsible for Cisco's Security Business Group.\n\nThe significant changes in Cisco's product strategy and bringing data center networking and compute, and the company's hyperscaler business under Gillis and the security organization shows that Cisco is bringing together all the components needed for data center buildouts, whether for service providers or enterprises, Wollenweber said.\n\nThe latest Nexus smart switches are the result of Cisco's security and networking organizations uniting under Patel, he added.",

Utilizing programmable AMD Pensando\u2122 data processing units (DPUs), the switch functions as a high-capacity, multifunctional service-hosting device, architecturally transforming data centers to simplify their design and make them more efficient. Cisco's first integrated offering, the Smart Switch with Cisco Hypershield, introduces a new approach to securing AI data centers by fusing security directly into the network fabric.\n\nAs AI workloads multiply, building and managing data centers has become much more complex. Data center operators require a simpler way to design, build, and deploy infrastructure to fully benefit from AI. AI applications must sit where they are needed, whether a massive large language model sitting in centralized hyperscale facilities or a network drone monitoring crop irrigation at the very edge of the network. This shift in where data is created, accessed, and stored requires a new type of simplified data center infrastructure\u2013one that integrates compute, storage, networking, and security in new ways, and allows for automated and predictive operations via simplified management platforms.\n\n\"Data center infrastructure needs be reimagined for both AI training and inferencing workloads that dwarf even the largest enterprise jobs of the past,\" said Jeetu Patel, EVP and Chief Product Officer, Cisco. \"Simply upgrading data center infrastructure with higher 'speeds and feeds' switches does not address the requirements of modern data centers, which require acceleration of security and network services natively within the data center fabric.\"\n\n\"Cisco's innovative approach to data center design, leveraging leadership AMD Pensando DPUs, marks a significant milestone in transforming enterprise infrastructure to address the evolving security demands of data center networks while dealing with the fast paced AI deployments,\" said Soni Jiandani, senior vice president and general manager, Networking Technology and Solutions Group, AMD. \"Our collaboration with Cisco enables enterprises to achieve high-capacity throughput and impressive network security without compromising on workload performance on Cisco UCS servers or Hypershield enabled platforms. Together, we are paving the way for a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and secure data centers.\"\n\nCisco Smart Switches: a Game Changer\n\nAs AI drives rapid growth, organizations must manage significantly increased power, compute, and networking demands. In traditional data center architectures, when each new service required a specific device, growth led to complexity. It also required adding, changing, or upgrading the enforcement of security policies with each new service or workload. Cisco Smart Switches offer a simpler, more efficient and extensible architecture by integrating services directly with the data center fabric, rather than bolting them on top.\n\nBy combining Cisco data center networking, Silicon One, and AMD DPUs, customers can scale services and adapt quickly to evolving business needs, all without the need for any additional hardware. The switches feature two processing engines: a high-performance network processor for stable data transfer and a network services sidecar for agile security processing. Traffic is intelligently steered between the two engines for optimal performance. This architectural shift drives cost savings through hardware consolidation, reduced power consumption, and operational simplicity. Cisco Smart Switches embrace all the capabilities of a NX-OS switch and management through Nexus Dashboard, and will unlock a diverse set of use cases like stateful segmentation, IPSec encryption, enhanced telemetry, DDoS protection and more.\n\nReimagining Data Center Security with Smart Switch and Hypershield\n\nThe first integrated service will combine Cisco Smart Switches and Hypershield to form a new approach to data center security. It will combine an advanced, AI-native, hardware-accelerated, distributed security architecture directly within the data center fabric to:\n\nProvide security that's melted into the data center network. Hypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a 'micro perimeter' around each service that makes up a workload.\n\nHypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a 'micro perimeter' around each service that makes up a workload.

            "content": "Refresh\n\nIt\u2019s a cold blustery day here in Amsterdam with a rather frigid flurries of snow last night. It looks like none of the snow has stuck, however, and everything is up and running for today\u2019s main event: the opening keynote, due to start in just under an hour. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThis morning we\u2019ll be hearing from Oliver Tuszik, president of EMEA, as well as a raft of other Cisco execs including Jeetu Patel, EVP and chief product officer; Martin Lund EVP of the Common Hardware Group; and Anurage Dhingra, SVP and GM of Campus Branch and IIoT Networking & Collaboration. Tom Gillis, SVP and GM of the Cisco Security, Data Center, Internet, & Cloud Infrastructure Group at Cisco and Kamal Hathi, SVP and GM at Splunk, will also be joinging Tuszik and the rest of the team = on stage today to talk all things Cisco.\n\nYesterday the press were given an inside look at what it takes to get the RAI convention center up and running for the more than 17,000 attendees who have descended on Amsterdam to learn all about what CIsco has been up to over the last year, and what there is to look forward to for the rest of 2025. Joe Clake, distinguished services engineer at Cisco, walked us through some of the key figures that go into setting up the impressive WiFi network that keeps all 17,000 connected and able to access super fast speeds while in the conference hall. Clarke said Cisco brought 500 of their own switches for the job, and has set up more than 600 access points across the exhibition center. The team are continually redeploying extra units using a custom-built network mapping tool that identifies low coverage areas or spots that need extra density. For example, the team deployed extra high density coverage over the keynote hall to support the roughly 6,000 attendees when they file into the auditorium, which is expected to take place in just under an hour. This year the entire network is operating on WiFi 7, Clarke said, although there is a backup network for those using legacy devices, and Cisco has transitioned the majority of the traffic to IPv6 also. (Image credit: Future)\n\nAs has become rather typical for these big conferences, things are running a little behind schedule and 9am has passed with little fanfare here at the RAI. There are still long queues outside the exhibition center, luckily the press are allowed in early.\n\nThe buzz is definitely building here in Amsterdam, with lots of attendees swirling around the lobby area. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWe\u2019re inside the auditorium and the seats are relatively empty but I expect that to change very quickly. The obligatory DJ is playing something mercifully light on the bass, something that cannot be said for last year\u2019s playlist. (Image credit: Future)\n\nOk that was very quick, a torrent of attendees has flowed into the auditorium and we are getting closer and closer to capacity. Hopefully we will be getting under way imminently. (Image credit: Future)\n\nI have spotted Oliver Tuszik, Cisco\u2019s EMEA president, who will be opening the keynote today so that is a good sign. A literal sign has also popped up with the 'five minutes to go' message, confirming my suspicions. Tuszik will be outlining the theme of today\u2019s proceedings. The explosion of interest in AI, sparked by the introduction of popular generative AI solutions beginning with ChatGPT in 2022, is reshaping the world of the enterprise, and Tuszik and his colleagues will be discussing the products Cisco is introducing to help its customers adapt to that changing world. This means making sure customers can meet the changing demands of enterprise AI adoption, monetize the services that spring up in this landscape, and deliver them securely. But generative AI has also had knock on effects for Cisco's other business segments, with many of the anticipated updates related to how businesses will need to transform for the an era of AI..\n\nThings look like they are getting underway with a very intense piece of video intro running through the rapid explosion of generative AI over the last three or so years, and positioning Cisco as \u2018changing the game\u2019 for businesses across sectors. The old tagline \u201cevery company must be a technology company\u201d now becomes \u201cevery business must become an AI company\u201d.\n\nOur master of ceremonies, Oliver Tuszik is opening up today's keynote from the crowd, and is now approaching the stage. (Image credit: Future)\n\nTuszik goes through the usual pleasantries on the RAI\u2019s panoramic stage, doing his best to engage each section of the crowd, he\u2019ll certainly be getting his steps in today. Tuszik drops the fact that this year Cisco is celebrating its 40th birthday, greeted with a congratulatory applause from the crowd. He describes Cisco's humble beginnings on a university campus connecting two networks together, evolving from the network as infrastructure to the network as the integral platform for all businesses. (Image credit: Future)\n\nTuszik blasts through some of technology industry's major eras, with IoT and Cloud described as concrete moments that had differing impacts on the role of the network. Now with AI, Tuszik says the speed of innovation is \"nowhere near anything we've seen before\", especially in the lat eight months. He notes that it looks like this innovation is only going to continue to accelerate.\n\nTuszik is now espousing the importance of experts, citing Cisco's CCIEs. He asks for any attendees who've been CCIE over 25 years. He finds one whose name I did not catch, but became certified in 1993 and says he was one of the first CCIEs certified worldwide, impressive. Tuszik promises that Cisco will never stop investing in its certified engineers. (Image credit: Future)\n\nTuszik cites some Gartner research on the size of the ICT market worldwide, which in some areas of the world is growing faster than GDP. He falls back to the claim that every business in the world will become a tech company. But this will not be easy he says, there will be big shocks in operational cost, digital transformation strategies , and navigating these changes sustainably. Moving onto AI, Tuszik concedes that there were some aspects of the AI boom that were 'overhyped', but claims that we are now moving out of this hype cycle and the real value of AI is being revealed. The industry is emerging from the tunnel of disinformation swirling around AI, Tuszik says. He cites Cisco's research that found 97% of CEOs plan AI integration but 80% worry gaps in their understanding will hurt their strategic decision-making, and risk falling behind the competition.\n\nSkills gaps, infrastructure challenges, \"the complexity you have to deal with is mind blowing\", Tuszik warns, and there are not many people you can hire to help remedy this problem. \"This is the main reason everybody is looking for standardizations. Moving away from best of breed and towards automation.\"\n\nTuszik says Cisco are committed to helping busisses in three key areas picured below. He says that if Cisco fails to help businesses meet their challenges in these three areas it is not meeting its standards. Tuszik says last year the company committed to its platform approach, promising to become more integrated and more open in a landscape where businesses are reliant on a multitude of digital services and hardware. (Image credit: Future)\n\nAs Tuszik mentions platform, its only right he gives way to Jeetu Patel, EVP and chief product officer at Cisco, who is the platform tsar at Cisco who is now onstage and for some reason praising Tuszik's dance moves. (Image credit: Future)\n\nPatel is walking through some of his core philosophies when it comes to product, firstly that quality is 'priority zero'. He notes that Cisco has had some products that perhaps have not lived up to this mantra in the past, but the firm is relentlessly focused on ensuring every one of their products 'just works'. He also says Cisco wants to think asymmetrically about the market. Rather than thinking linearly that follows trends Patel wants Cisco to make sure that it isn't playing catch up and actually leapfrogs the market in a way that will redefine how Cisco is not just 10% better than 'our' competition but 10% better than 'your competition'.\n\nWith that in mind, Patel now moves on to talking about some recent trends he thinks will have substantial impact, or seismic shifts, on the market going forward. First is the DeepSeek effect, which means that cost is going down precipitously and as a consequence businesses won't just have tens or hundreds of models, but they might have thousands. Next is the operator effect, essentially the agentic shift of AI, where users wil be able to get computers to ensure tasks are completed autonomously. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThese seismic shifts will introduce new challenges Patel says including what infrastructure looks like, and what the risk looks like attached to these new technologies. Patel says that Cisco want to leverage three areas in which it believes it has key advantages over the market to help businesses meet these challenges. These are the platform advantage, silicon advantage, and an AI advantage. (Image credit: Future)\n\nPatel now wants to talk about products, he runs through Cisco recent innovations including its dedicated AI PODS and its Nvidia AI server. Patel announces the Cisco UCS C854A M8 server which is a flexible AI server using Nvidia MGX reference architecture with a modular design that can be scaled from 2 - 8 GPUs, giving businesses flexibility when it comes to their AI spend. This is met with some applause and I expect we will hear more about this later where we will get a bit more of a deep dive on this.\n\nPatel quickly moves on to another announcement two new Cisco N9300 Smart Switches with Hypershield. These are two switches, one that is an on-ramp and the other a top-of-rack switch that feature data processing units (DPUs) built int, meaning that not only do they just switch traffic but they also enable running advanced services such as Cisco's firewalling capability Hypershield directly on the fabric of the network. This brings Patel to the concept of the Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall which uses the N9300 smart switches with Hypershield integration businesses can meet the needs of today\u2019s threat landscape. It means that businesses can leverage the latest cloud security frameworks, as well as third party firewalls to give a distributed fabric in a hybrid mesh firewall that can be managed through a single pane of glass, being Cisco's Security Cloud Control system. This, he adds, is available now.\n\nThat was an incredibly quick whistle stop tour of some pretty big announcements, and to dig deeper in the impacts of these systems Patel brings on Tom Gillis, SVP and GM of the Cisco Security, Data Center, Internet, & Cloud Infrastructure Group at Cisco. (Image credit: Future)\n\nGillis says this new category of smart switch is the most exciting announcement Patel just made, describing it as the dream of many years. The addition of the DPUs means businesses can combine a security processor and network processor in one device. \"We want to put controls around the services that surround an application\" meaning every microservice gets its own perimeter with an individually configurable layer 7 firewall.\n\nThis does sound like a very significant improvement for businesses that are able to take advantage of these smart switches. One major recent trend we've seen over the last decade is that applications are increasingly distributed and fine-grained, often running across multi-cloud data centers, and are composed of hundreds of thousands of microservices Recent threat landscape activity from state-sponsored groups like Volt Typhoon show that the era of blind trust is over. Businesses need to validate and inspect every single connection running across distributed applications. DPUs on the N9300 switches mean users can embed inspection functions onto the fabric of the network via Hypershield, and this is one component of Cisco\u2019s Hybrid Mesh Firewall Hybrid in that Cisco is also introducing cloud-native integrations so this solution can be deployed natively into all of the different cloud environments regardless of provider (AWS, Azure, Google). Combines with eBPF to give organizations deep visibility into workloads in the extended network, external workloads, allowing for autonomous segmentation and distributed exploit protection to prevent cyber intruders from moving laterally. Cisco says it is committed to an open ecosystem, so the mesh firewall will also support third-party firewalls as enforcement points. \"Keep your infrastrucutre\", Gillis explains, stating that Cloud Control will sit as the umbrella over these systems and takes control of all of your old tools, and as you modernize you can start to introduce this more advanced infrastructure and \"put security inplaces you couldn't imagine\".\n\nThat's it from Gillis who almost sprints back off the stage. Now Patel is moving onto securing AI itself, and Cisco's recently launched AI Defense system. AI Defense was introduced three weeks ago and helps businesses protect their generative AI systems, be that external applications of internally developed tools. AI applications have introduced a new attack surface for threat actors to target, as well as introducing risk in terms of misuse in the workplace AI defense is an end-to-end solution that protects both the development and use of generative AI applications. In terms of external generative AI applications, AI defense allows security teams to discover what generative AI tools people are using and how they are using them. In some businesses using external generative AI tools is banned so this can help them detect their use and block it, or for traffic that is allowed businesses can watch the interactions to ensure the tool is being used responsibly. For internal generative AI developments, AI defense can help conduct vulnerability tests on the application. The user can configure policies to protect them, for instance prompt injection. Or they can introduce privacy guardrails to protect the model from seeing sensitive information, or safety guardrails to stop the model from outputting dangerous or harmful content.\n\nTo talk about AI Defense a bit more, Patel brings on DJ Sampath, VP of AI product at Cisco, who is going through a quick demo of how model companies validate models, and how AI defense speeds up this process. (Image credit: Future)\n\nSampath explains that AI Defense shrinks the validation time, that would normally take a model maker seven to ten weeks but with Cisco AI Defense this process takes just minutes. Sampath explains that businesses can configure their access policies for external AI, but also their privacy and safety guardrails for internal systems which can detect and block violations at runtime. Deepseek gets a mention as it has recently been widely covered that the model is particularly vulnerable to jailbreaking. Sampath says Cisco used its jailbreaking techniques that are integrated into AI Defense's vulnerability testing system to put Deepseek through its paces and found it was vulnerable to 100% of the attack methods the system implemented.\n\nThat's it from Sampath, and Patel changes pace with some announcements for Cisco's connectivity range and reimagining the workplace. He announces a a series of new Cisco of new access points, specifically designed to work with WiFI 7. He rolls a video featuring SAP with over 250 offices around the world, and expects having upwards of 350,000 devices, including IoT devices on its network. The SAP spokesperson says using CIsco's switches and access points it has been able to make its network simpler, using Cisco's zero friction to improve their trust access policy, ensuring that all trusted devices have access to corporate resources. Cisco is extending its its zero trust network access (ZTNA) offering with Hybrid Private Access that will optimize the office experience without compromising data privacy. This comes in conjunction with Policy Assurance, which will enable enterprises to predict and prevent policy-related access disruptions. This universal ZTNA of features deeper integrations with Google Chrome for the enterprise meaning unmanaged devices can be used more seamlessly, where third parties (contractors for example) don\u2019t need to install additional software to gain access to their applications This sounds like a very useful feature and will protect users as they connect to applications. It takes the traditional concept of zero trust access that centers around people and managed devices connecting to modern applications that will support one of these zero trust gateways, Cisco claims its taking zero trust to the next level adding the capability to connect any user on any device in any location to any application.\n\nPatel invites Colin Bannon, CTO at BT Business Services on stage to talk about how they have reimagined their workplace. Bannon says as a CTO one thing he has learned to be true is that digital resilience is business resilience, and that without the network there is no plan B. (Image credit: Future)\n\nBannon lists a series of critical organizations that rely on BT networksm, powering national critical infrastructure, and as such described Cisco as its fundamental partner underpinning this relationship. He discusses redesigning the firm's offices, explaining it carried out persona-based designed according to apps, things, and people, baking in resilience to ensure that every aspect of the business as resilience and it can serve its customers reliably. Asked what's next, Bannon says CIOs he's talking to are very afraid of shadow AI and byod, and having a network that can manage this access in an efficient way is essential. Businesses need these fine-grained controls, Bannon explains. He also touches on the importance of AI-ready networks, making sure the network can stand up to unexpected spikes on the network and ensuring they are ready for unprecedented AI adoption.\n\nPatel now wants to talk about Cisco's new optics system. Patel says using Cisco's new optics opt, the size of a USB drive, which businesses can use to replace their entire optical system. This promises to bring bring power efficiencies and latency gains. (Image credit: Future)\n\nMartin Lund, EVP of Common Hardware Group at Cisco, and also inventor of the layer three networking. Lund explains that it's it is going to be very hard to predict AI traffic, as companies can stand up new models all the time. Deepseek only accelerated this problem, and as such service providers need to be more flexible and agile and simplifying or converging their optical system will go some way to addressing this challenge.\n\nTo finish off today's keynote, Patel wants to talk about resilience and some of the new strides Cisco is making to help businesses stay resilient today.\n\nFirstly, he announces ThousandEyes Traffic Insights which will provide deep visibility over network network traffic and not only identify suspicious suspicious behavior or potential disruptions but accelerate remediation too.\n\nThousandEyes Traffic Insights will be available in March, Patel announces\n\nFinally, Patel announces the integration of its wireless arm Meraki with its XDR solution. This will mean organizations can feed their Cisco XDR with telemetry directly from their Meraki MX appliance. As such XDR incidents will populate their Meraki dashboard and the administrators will have better visibility to take quick action against potential threats.\n\nWith that, Patel passes over to Tuszik, who joins us from via video link. He is on the floor of the exhibition center, which Cisco dub the World of Solutions. Tuszik takes care of the closing ceremonies and brings the opening keynote to a close. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThat was a veritable whirlwind of announcements and Cisco really packed a lot in to time they had. Here's a quick summary of the biggest announcements from today's presentation: Cisco UCS C854A M8 server \u2013 AI server based on Nvidia's MGX reference architecture featuring a modular design to give organizations flexibilty and cost efficiency for their AI deployments.\n\nCisco N9300 Smart Switches with Hypershield \u2013 first of their kind smart network switches featuring onboard DPUs to power advanced services directly on the network fabric.\n\nCisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall \u2013 series of new advanced capabilities enabled by the N9300 Smart Switches that allow fine-grained control across distributed networks and various microservices.\n\nAI defense \u2013 Cisco's end-to-end solution for locking down generative AI use and development in the enterprise.\n\nUniversal Zero Trust Network Access \u2013 extended ZTNA offering with hybrid private access to optimize office experience without compromising data privacy.\n\nMeraki MX integration with Cisco XDR \u2013 Merkai telemetry will now directly feed into Cisco's XDR which will populate incidents in the Meraki dashboard\n\nThousandEyes Traffic Insights \u2013 unified solution offering deep visibility into how network traffic the performance of the network",

            "content": "There are two ways to make a programmable switch that can run network applications and accelerate certain network functions.\n\nThe first and more obvious way to create a programmable switch is to add programmability \u2013 hopefully through the addition of engines that can run algorithms created in the P4 programming language \u2013 into the very fabric of that switch ASIC itself. This is what the now-defunct Barefoot Networks created in 2016 before it went into the gaping maw of Intel in 2019 never to be seen again.\n\nThere was nothing inherently wrong with what Barefoot did with its \u201cTofino 1\u201d and \u201cTofino 2\u201d switch ASICs, although they did run a little bit hot compared to non-programmable switch ASICs of comparable speed. Which stands to reason because nothing is free in this universe, and extra processing always costs extra power somewhere. Given enough time and support from Intel, programmable switches might have taken off at the hyperscalers and cloud builders. Intel got distracted and eventually Barefoot was shelved. In the longest of runs, the hyperscalers and cloud builders may create their own ASICs and they would certainly be programmable in some fashion.\n\nThe other way to create a programmable switch is to do what Cisco Systems is doing with its new Nexus N9300 line of enterprise switches. And that is to take a switch ASIC and wrap a bunch of P4-programmable DPUs around it, offloading the running of those network applications and the acceleration of network functions from the switch ASIC to the DPU.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, Cisco has gone to AMD\u2019s Pensando DPU division, which was created by former Cisco executives, for the DPU it is wrapping around its new Silicon One E100 switch ASIC to create what it calls a \u201cSmart Switch,\u201d an analog to the \u201cSmartNIC\u201d that does network offload functions for server nodes.\n\nPensando was founded by Prem Jain and Soni Jiandani, serial entrepreneurs who along with Mario Mazzola and Luca Cafiero created the Nexus family of switches and the UCS converged server-networking platforms under spinouts for Cisco, which were then spun back in once the development was successful and productized and sold by Cisco. Many expected that the same thing might have happened with Pensando, which was not funded by Cisco, but AMD beat Cisco to the punch when the former acquired Pensando in April 2022 for $1.9 billion. The benefit of the Pensando DPUs \u2013 there are four thus far on the roadmap \u2013 is that they are programmable in P4, a language created just for packet processing, unlike FPGAs that have to be tweaked in their native RTL/VHDL language.\n\nThe switch-DPU hybrid just launched by Cisco is a variant of the server-switch hybrids that we have seen a number of times come out of development but never really go mainstream. Pluribus Networks created one back in 2014, and was eaten by Arista Networks for its intellectual property in 2022. Juniper Networks added X86 cores and FPGA engines to its QFX switches (using Broadcom Trident-II ASICs) in 2015 to create a similar kind of switch, this one aimed at high speed traders who wanted to compute closer to the wire for a latency advantage. Perhaps this time, with its Hypershield AI-powered, automated network segmentation security software as a killer app, the idea will take off. And by putting the DPU in the switch instead of a much larger of server endpoints, Cisco can make this programmable switching more affordable and ubiquitous.\n\nThe Nexus Hybrid Switch-DPU Godboxes\n\nThe heart of the new Nexus N9300 is a variant of Cisco\u2019s homegrown and merchant Silicon One switch ASIC called the E100, which is rated at a fairly modest 4.8 Tb/sec. Cisco has previously launched the P100, Q100, and Q200 variants for routing and the G100, G200, and Q200 variants for switching, and as the name suggests, the whole point for Silicon One is that a single architecture can span a wide range of use cases for switching and routing, from a top-of-rack box all the way put to a datacenter interconnect box.\n\nThe E100s are the first wave of a new line of Silicon One devices that are aimed at switches with relatively low bandwidth but much higher functionality, Kevin Wollenweber, general manager of Cisco\u2019s datacenter and service provider business, tells The Next Platform. While the G100 at 25.6 Tb/sec and the G200 at 51.2 Tb/sec are aimed at spine switches and high capacity AI back-end networks, the E100 is focused more on the enterprise top of rack and network border connectivity use case.\n\nWe are not interested in the Nexus N9300 because it is a high capacity switch, but because it might be a harbinger of things to come.\n\nOur case in point is a 12.8 Tb/sec variant of the Silicon One chip \u2013 Wollenweber didn\u2019t mention the ASIC by name, but the Q200L is the 12.8 TB/sec version on the switching side \u2013 that had eight Pensando DPUs wrapped around it and was created for an unknown number (but multiple) hyperscalers and cloud builders. This was done in the past few years, when hyperscalers and cloud builders were deploying 100 Gb/sec Ethernet switches in the core networks, and by the way, they still are because this machine is in pilots at those hyperscalers and cloud builders and they are getting ready to deploy at initial volumes of thousands of units scaling up to tens of thousands of units, says Wollenweber.\n\nThe Nexus N9300 is a chip off that hyperscaler block, starting with a more modest Silicon One ASIC and a lower number of two different AMD Pensando DPUs. As a refresher, here is the Pensando DPU roadmap:\n\nThe Nexus 9324C switch has the Silicon One E100 paired with four \u201cElba\u201d Pensando DPUs in the box. The Elba DPU launched in 2021 and is the second generation DPU from that company.\n\nThe Elba device was etched using 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and has 144 custom match processing units, or MPUs, running at 2 GHz for chewing through P4 algorithms as well as sixteen Arm A72 cores running at 3 GHz to assist in network application processing. It also has dedicated data encryption and storage offload engines, the latter of which may not be all that useful in this specific Cisco use case. Here is a block diagram for the Elba DPU:\n\nThe Elba device has a pair of DDR4 interfaces running at 3.2 GHz that support 8 GB to 64 GB of local main memory and 56 Gb/sec SerDes with PAM4 signaling to provide two Ethernet ports running at 200 Gb/sec, which can obviously be split successively to add more virtual ports. The Elba supports 2,000 virtual NICs and 16 million hardware queues and has ROCE v2 latency reduction to memory.\n\nThe Nexus N9324C is configured at 24 ports running at 100 Gb/sec, but the services throughput runs at 800 Gb/sec speeds. It is aimed at cloud and edge, zone segmentation, and datacenter interconnect use cases. It will be available in April.\n\nThe other hybrid Cisco switch is the Nexus N9348Y, which has the same Silicon One E100 switch ASIC, but it is surrounded by a pair of the newer generation \u201cGiglio\u201d DPUs from AMD, which were announced in 2023. We don\u2019t have a block diagram for the Giglio DPU, but we know that it is a version of the 7 nanometer Elba chip that has been optimized for low power consumption and relatively high performance despite that. The Giglio chip handles stateful packet processing (but not stateless as well as stateful like the Elba device) and has DDR5 memory running at 5.6 GHz.\n\nNot only are the DPU types and counts different with the Nexus N9348Y, but the ports on the E100 are carved up differently and matched to an actual top of rack configuration that is typical in the enterprise, where 25 Gb/sec is still a common speed for an Ethernet port out of a node. (It is still common in the clouds, too.) This switch comes with 48 ports running at 25 Gb/sec plus six uplinks running at 400 Gb/sec and two other ports running at 100 Gb/sec. This one will be available in August this year.\n\nThere is, of course, a software-defined angle to this, which Cisco says will save customers a bunch of money. Here are two total cost of ownership comparisons that the company has from two large banks, one deploying a firewall to replace an appliance from rival Juniper Networks and another replacing two firewalls interlinked with four switches with a pair of the Nexus N9300s:\n\nThese comparisons include the cost of Cisco\u2019s Hypershield security software. It would have been useful to see the raw data behind these charts, so we would know precisely what was being compared and over what term.",

Further, Provider Connectivity Assurance will integrate with Splunk, allowing customers to correlate application and infrastructure performance data and drive automated decisions that accelerate resolution.\n\nAccording to Cisco, these new innovations will offer service providers the tools necessary to evolve their networks, develop new service offerings, and monetize the delivery of assured services.\n\nAgile Service Networking and Cisco\u2019s circular product lifecycle programs provide a more energy-efficient and less resource-intensive architecture. These sustainability components are projected to help customers reduce CO2 emissions by 324 tons and power consumption by 80 percent when compared to traditional, centralized deployments, Cisco says.\n\nSwitches for scalable AI demand\n\nCisco is also introducing the Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Smart Switches with embedded data processing units (DPUs), reimagining AI data center design with intelligent traffic steering and a new class of silicon.\n\nThis new family of data center Smart Switches utilizes programmable AMD DPUs and functions as a high-capacity, multifunctional service-hosting device. They will architecturally transform data centers to simplify their design and make them more efficient. The company\u2019s first combined offering, the Smart Switch with Cisco Hypershield, brings a new approach to securing AI data centers by fusing security directly into the network fabric.\n\nAs AI drives rapid growth, Cisco Nexus Smart Switches will offer an easy and efficient architecture by embedding services directly into the data center fabric rather than bolting them on top.\n\nBy combining Cisco data center networking, Silicon One, and AMD DPUs, customers can scale services and adapt quickly to evolving business needs without needing additional hardware.\n\nThese switches feature two processing engines: a high-performance network processor for stable data transfer and a network services sidecar for agile security processing. Traffic will move between these engines for optimal performance.\n\nThe first integrated service includes Cisco Nexus Smart Switches and Hypershield to form a new data center security approach that combines AI-native, hardware-accelerated, distributed security architecture directly within the data center fabric to:\n\nProvide security that\u2019s melted into the data center network: Hypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a \u2018micro perimeter\u2019 around each service that makes up a workload.\n\nHypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a \u2018micro perimeter\u2019 around each service that makes up a workload.

We\u2019ve got two and a half hours of news to look forward to - kicking off with the keynote this morning - so stick with me as I try my best to listen, transcribe, analyze and type my way through Cisco Live! 2025.\n\nAs is standard for tech events, we're eagerly waiting the start of the keynotes with some upbeat techno to keep us entertained. A few last minutes interviews are taking place around the event hall with just 15 minutes until everything kicks off! (Image credit: Future / Benedict Collins)\n\nI'm currently rubbing elbows (quite literally) with some of the global press in attendance today. It's a bit of a squeeze with everyone trying to type. Luckily, there are walking, talking coffee dispensers making their way around the hall.\n\nOliver Tuszik, President, EMEA, is opening today's event, talking about the impact and disruption of new technologies on the world. Cisco is also celebrating its 40th birthday, which gets a big round of applause. (Image credit: Future / Benedict Collins)\n\nTuszik is walking us through 40 years of Cisco innovations that powered big data, IoT, and cloud computing - emphasizing the importance of Cisco\u2019s networks in accelerating all of these technologies. \u201cEvery business in this world will become a technology company,\u201d Tuszik says, noting that each company will face three challenges in this journey: Unlocking the power of AI, especially as we move out of the \u2018hype cycle\u2019 of AI, with companies now seeing tangible, real world efficiency and productivity gains using the technology. However, only 7% of European companies are AI ready, Tuszik says.\n\nKilling complexity. \u201cEverything is growing fast\u201d as companies scale and grow their technologies in the face of the skills shortage.\n\nStrengthening digital resilience.\u201cDigital resilience is business resilience,\u201d especially if every company is to become a tech company.\n\nJeetu Patel, EVP and Chief Product Officer, is up next! After complementing Tuszik\u2019s dancefloor endurance, Patel is walking us through his philosophy: Build products people love; quality is priority zero; and think \u201810x\u2019. (Image credit: Future / Benedict Collins)\n\n\u201cEvery organization needs to lay the groundwork for AI,\u201d Patel says, predicting that the world's workforce will be \u201csupplemented\u201d by AI agents, apps, robots and humanoids - moving the world away from its current 100% human workforce.\n\nHere comes today\u2019s first new product. The Cisco UCS C845A M8 Rack Server - a modular rack with flexible GPU scaling.\n\n\n\nPatel also unveils two N9300 Series Smart Switches, with Cisco\u2019s Silicon One E100 chips, AMD Pensando DPUs, and Cisco Hypershield (more on that shortly, I expect).\n\nPatel explains that Cisco Hypershield will be embedded on the new switches, meaning that protection can be scaled for zone segmentation, micro segmentation, and distributed exploit protection - with a centrally managed firewall distributed throughout the datacenter at the service level. (Image credit: Cisco)\n\nThe Hypershield firewall essentially acts \u201cas millions of tiny firewalls\u201d distributed around each web server, application, and Kubernetes cluster, Patel explains. The whole thing will be managed by an AI agent that can \u2018self-update\u2019 its policies, while also checking for potential disruptions in firewall policy changes.\n\nDJ Sampath, VP of Product, AI Software and Platform, is now demonstrating Cisco's AI Defense application which was announced towards the end of January. Patel highlights that the application allows businesses to validate a new AI model in a matter of minutes - significantly down from the several weeks many are used to.\n\nTime for another demo - Caitlin Lacey, Director of Global Product Marketing, Collaboration Devices, is showing us the new Webex AI Agent that can be used to build autonomous AI chatbots for customer support. The models aren't just text based, as voice based agents with 'lifelike' voices and low-latency responses can be built for phone support to cut down the time customers spend waiting on hold.\n\nWe're moving on to the juicy security stuff now. Colin Bannon, CTO at BT Business is explaining how Cisco has helped implement security policy in the infrastructure BT provides to its customers. \"The network is now the computer,\" Bannon says, as he talks about the implications of introducing AI models to a highly complex infrastructure, and defending against shadow AI. (Image credit: Future / Benedict Collins)\n\nMore distributed edge switches have been announced - the Cisco 8000 series with Silicon One-based routing optimized for AI. Patel has also unveiled Coherent Pluggable Optics - tiny USB sized switches designed to replace transponders, with the 400G optic capable of connecting applications up to 3000km apart. (Image credit: Future / Benedict Collins)\n\nBack to digital resilience now. Patel has just announced a new traffic insight functionality for ThousandEyes - giving network administrators greater observability and the ability to pinpoint disruptions within networks.

The training focuses on professionals working on a multi-vendor approach to building AI infrastructure. In addition to adding AI infrastructure skills to its data center certification track from CCNP to CCIE, Cisco is also working to add relevant AI and machine learning skills to its existing certifications.\n\nThe focus on AI in training is important now, according to Cisco, as business and technology leaders work to keep pace with technology advances and stay ahead of their competitors.\n\n\u201cIn a dynamic landscape where competition is fierce, speed decides the winders. Leaders who act decisively today to build resilient, future-proofed networks will be the AI-forward leaders driving real value for their business,\u201d said Jeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s Chief Product Officer, in a statement. \u201cEventually, there will be only two kinds of companies: those that are AI companies, and those that are irrelevant.\u201d\n\nAlso at Cisco Live EMEA in Amsterdam, the company released the results of its CEO study, which was conducted by Opinion Matters between December 24, 2024 and January 2, 2025 and surveyed some 2,503 CEOs from companies with more than 250 employees worldwide. The research shows that the majority of CEOs polled recognize AI\u2019s potential benefits and plan to integrate AI into their operations, 74% fear that gaps in knowledge will hinder decisions in the boardroom and 58% worry it will stifle growth. More than 70% of the CEOs worry about losing ground to competitors and missing out on opportunities because of IT and infrastructure gaps. The study shows that 61% of CEOs are improving AI education to address their concerns.\n\n\u201cCEOs are turning to AI for its transformative potential: driving efficiency (69%), spurring innovation (68%), and outpacing competitors (54%). But fulfilling that ambition requires CEOs to break down the barriers holding them back from realizing AI\u2019s potential: skills shortages, infrastructure gaps, and security risks,\u201d Cisco said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the survey, Cisco unwrapped a new family of data center switches \u2014 the N9300 series \u2014 it says will help customers more securely support large workloads and facilitate AI development across the enterprise.",

The dataset follows a structured format:\n\nUsername and Domain : Identifies users and their associated domains.\n\n: Identifies users and their associated domains. Relative Identifier (RID) : A unique identifier for user accounts.\n\n: A unique identifier for user accounts. NTLM Hash: A hashed representation of passwords that can be cracked via brute force or dictionary attacks.\n\nThe compromised accounts include privileged administrator(e.g., Administrator:500 ) accounts (e.g., \u201cAdministrator:500\u201d), regular user accounts, service and machine accounts(e.g., ADC-SYD-P-1$ , ADC-RTP-P-2$ ) tied to domain controllers, and the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (krbtgt) account.\n\nThe exposure of NTLM hashes is particularly concerning, as attackers could use them for unauthorized access and privilege escalation through techniques such as Pass-the-Hash or Kerberoasting.\n\nPotential Impact\n\nThe breach could allow attackers to:\n\nEscalate privileges within Cisco\u2019s network.\n\nDeploy ransomware or other malicious payloads.\n\nMove laterally across systems and establish persistent access through methods like Golden Ticket or Silver Ticket attacks.\n\nExfiltrate sensitive corporate and customer data.\n\nThe inclusion of domain controller credentials in the leaked dataset indicates that attackers may have achieved deep network access, enabling further exploitation of Cisco\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThis points to the involvement of an organized cybercrime group or potentially a nation-state actor. While Cisco has not officially confirmed this specific breach, similar incidents in the past have involved sophisticated tactics such as social engineering, MFA fatigue attacks, and credential harvesting.\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nTo address this type of breach, cybersecurity experts recommend:\n\nForced Password Resets: For all affected user and service accounts. Disable NTLM Authentication: Where feasible, to reduce credential reuse risks. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): To mitigate the impact of compromised credentials. Monitor Access Logs: To detect unauthorized activity and privilege escalation attempts. Enhance Network Monitoring: To identify further unauthorized access attempts.\n\nThis breach highlights the growing prevalence of credential-based cyberattacks and underscores the importance of robust security measures.\n\nTools like Mimikatz remain popular among attackers for credential dumping due to their ability to extract sensitive information from memory or registry files. Organizations must remain vigilant by adopting proactive defenses such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), strong password policies, and regular audits of authentication systems.",

The company will be reporting results for the second quarter on Wednesday, at 4:05 pm ET.\n\nThe San Jose-headquartered network gear maker\u2019s stock has grown about 25% in the past year, with most of that coming in the last six months. The positive investor sentiment mainly reflects the company\u2019s initiatives to tap into AI-related opportunities, like the acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk in early 2024.\n\nThe tech firm\u2019s second-quarter report is expected on February 12, after the closing bell. The consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts suggest a 4.6% year-over-year increase in Q2 earnings to $0.91 per share. That reflects an anticipated 8.5% increase in revenues to $13.87 billion in the January quarter, which almost matches the company\u2019s guidance of $13.75-13.95 billion. The management\u2019s profit target for the quarter is $0.89-$0.91 per share.\n\nQ1 Earnings Beat\n\nIn the first quarter, adjusted earnings declined to $0.91 per share from $1.11 per share in the same period of 2024, but exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates. Unadjusted net income came in at $2.7 billion or $0.68 per share in Q1, compared to last year\u2019s profit of $3.6 billion or $0.89 per share. At $13.8 billion, first-quarter revenues were down 6% year-over-year, broadly in line with Wall Street\u2019s forecast.\n\nCommenting on the Q1 results, Cisco\u2019s CEO Charles Robbins said, \u201cThe strength of our operating performance and free cash flow in Q1 fueled a return of $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, delivering on our commitment to consistent capital returns. Building on the growing demand we saw at the end of fiscal year \u201924, product orders grew 20% year over year in Q1 and were up 9% organically. This is an acceleration of the 14% product order growth we saw just three months ago and is a clear sign of normalizing demand for Cisco\u2019s innovation.\u201d\n\nAI Pipeline\n\nInterestingly, Cisco\u2019s quarterly results consistently beat estimates in recent years. However, the company reported lower revenue and profit for most of 2024 and early FY25 due to a dip in the demand for its networking products, mainly routers, switches, and wireless access points. As part of integrating AI into its cybersecurity portfolio, the company last month acquired SnapAttack, a privately held threat detection and engineering platform. It is worth noting that revenues of the Security business more than doubled in the most recent quarter.\n\nCisco has a strong AI pipeline and expects to exceed its target of securing $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers. A few months ago, the company raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $55.3-$56.3 billion from the previous forecast in the range of $55.0 billion to $56.2 billion\n\nCisco\u2019s stock was trading at $62.65 on Monday afternoon, after making modest gains in the early hours of the session. The average price for the last 52 weeks is $51.78.",

(CSCO) designs, manufactures, and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry. With a market cap of $248 billion, the company offers enterprise network security, software development, data collaboration, cloud computing, and other related services.\n\nShares of this technology giant have outperformed the broader market over the past year. CSCO has gained 25.1% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 20.6%. In 2025, CSCO stock is up 5.2%, surpassing the SPX\u2019s 2.5% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, CSCO\u2019s outperformance looks less pronounced compared to iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF (IYZ). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 23.7% over the past year. Moreover, CSCO\u2019s gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 4.1% returns over the same time frame.\n\nCSCO's strong performance can be credited to its shift towards a subscription-based business model, with subscriptions now making up over half of its total revenue providing a stable and predictable income for investors. The acquisition of Splunk has significantly expanded CSCO's software portfolio, and established the company as a major player in the software industry. Additionally, the introduction of the AI-powered Hypershield has enhanced CSCO's security offerings, further solidifying its position in the market.\n\nOn Nov. 13, CSCO shares closed up marginally after reporting its Q1 results. Its adjusted EPS of $0.91 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.87. The company\u2019s revenue was $13.84 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $13.76 billion. CSCO expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.60 to $3.66, and expects revenue to be between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in July, analysts expect CSCO\u2019s EPS to decline 4.8% to $2.97 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 21 analysts covering CSCO stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on nine \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, two \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and 10 \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than a month ago, with eight analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 31, Exane BNP Paribas upgraded to \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on CSCO with a price target of $72, implying a potential upside of 15.6% from current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $64.68 represents a 3.9% premium to CSCO\u2019s current price levels.

A day before the offering, Cisco swooped in and bought the company for $3.7 billion.\n\nNow Bansal is at the center of an equally unconventional combination.\n\nGet top local stories in DFW delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nSince 2020, Bansal has been running two startups as co-founder and CEO: Harness and Traceable. The former's technology helps companies manage code and the latter's software observes where companies are unintentionally letting out sensitive data.\n\nLate this month or early next, Harness and Traceable will merge. The resulting company will have 1,100 employees, $250 million in expected 2025 annualized revenue, a 50% growth rate and a valuation of about $5 billion.\n\n\"It's about the same size that AppDynamics was when we were about to go public,\" Bansal told CNBC in an interview last week.\n\nThrough the combination, Bansal said, Harness will be able to sell more products to customers, and Traceable will be better insulated from competitors like HashiCorp, which IBM has agreed to buy, and Akamai, which acquired security startup Noname last year.\n\nThis time, Bansal wants an active stock ticker.\n\nIn an interview last year with CNBC's Make It, Bansal said that he was unfulfilled after selling AppDynamics and that he didn't finish what he had started.\n\n\"Everyone told me, 'You should retire. Go on the beach. What else do you need to do?'\" Bansal said. \"That was my first instinct, as well. I wanted to trek in the Himalayas, hike Machu Picchu, do a safari in Africa, see the fjords in Norway. In six months, my bucket list was done. And I started to realize: That's not it for me.\"\n\nBansal got back to work and set up Big Labs, a studio for exploring startup ideas. Big Labs spawned Harness in 2017 and then Traceable in 2020. Sanjay Nagaraj, Traceable's other co-founder, recalled working on the security startup in a dedicated Big Labs room at Harness' San Francisco headquarters.\n\nThe arrangement was unorthodox.\n\n\"I've never done this before, backed a CEO to run two companies simultaneously,\" said Steve Harrick, who joined Institutional Venture Partners in 2001 and sits on the boards of Harness and Traceable. \"But Jyoti is that good. He's not only a great executive, but he hires well and he delegates well, and so I just talked to Jyoti. I said, 'This is a major risk.' I got his assurance he wouldn't do a third one.\"\n\nEstablishing Harness and Traceable as separate companies made sense to Bansal at the time, because their products would typically get sold to different buyers within an organization. But that's changed in the past year or two, he said, as engineering and technology leaders have started to also make decisions on procuring tools for securing code and data.\n\nEmployees took notice of the shift and, during all-hands meetings at both companies, would repeatedly ask Bansal about a consolidation, he said. Questions also came from clients.\n\n\"The Harness team would go set up a meeting with an executive at a bank or some of our customers,\" Bansal said. \"I would go into the meeting and the executive would say, 'It's a one-hour meeting. Can we save the last 15 minutes? Because I also want to talk about Traceable.'\"\n\nBansal was effectively the first IT person at both companies, setting up the same Google productivity apps and Carta equity management software as each got started. A spokesperson said 70% of Traceable's largest customers are Harness customers as well.\n\nThe cultures were also similar. As Harness and Traceable matured, Bansal picked a general manager to run each distinctive new product, or module. When examining revenue for the modules, executives at both startups rely on a theory that Battery Ventures investor Neeraj Agrawal calls \"triple, triple, double, double, double,\" or T2D3. The model, which Agrawal wrote about in TechCrunch in 2015, describes the annualized revenue growth that cloud software startups can target.\n\nIn November, Bansal told the two boards that his companies were on converging paths and that it would be difficult to keep them from competing with each other. He got clearance for a merger.\n\nInitially, Traceable will operate as its own unit within Harness, the parent company, and Nagaraj will be general manager. Bansal said the structure may change in the future.\n\nHe's confident that the technologies will pair well together and can benefit from tighter integrations. Harness will be able to help clients understand the origin of their source code, and Traceable can show how people are using it.\n\nHarrick calls it's a good outcome, and said he's excited to consolidate his bet on Bansal.\n\n\"I think it's a benefit for all investors for him to focus on operating one company instead of two,\" Harrick said.\n\nWATCH: AppDynamics founder is building a new start-up",

New research highlights what's getting in the way of progress \u2013 and how CEOs plan to shift ambition into action.\n\nNews summary:\n\nWhile 4 out of 5 CEOs recognize AI's potential, many worry gaps in their understanding will impact strategic decisions, risking missed opportunities and falling behind competitors.\n\nOver 70% fear losing ground due to gaps in IT knowledge or network infrastructure, with more than half already seeing competitive losses from underinvestment in technology.\n\nCEOs plan to stay ahead by investing in their people, modernizing infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity, with 96% relying on trusted partners to future-proof their network for AI.\n\nAMSTERDAM, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CISCO LIVE -- A new study from Cisco, the worldwide leader in networking and security, reveals a paradox among CEOs While 4 in 5 recognize AI's potential benefits and almost all plan to integrate AI into their operations, many fear gaps in their knowledge will hinder decisions in the boardroom (74%) and stifle growth (58%) \u2013 risking missed opportunities and falling behind competitors. Yet, CEOs are not standing still. With support from their IT leaders and trusted partners, they plan to empower their people, modernize infrastructure, and strengthen cybersecurity to sharpen their competitive edge in an AI-driven future.\n\nCEO Barriers CEO Blueprint\n\nCisco's Chief Product Officer, Jeetu Patel, underscores the urgency to act: \"In a dynamic landscape where competition is fierce, speed decides the winners. Leaders who act decisively today to build resilient, future-proofed networks will be the AI-forward leaders driving real value for their business. Eventually there will be only two kinds of companies: those that are AI companies, and those that are irrelevant.\"\n\nCEOs fear the mounting costs of inaction\n\nCisco's research shows more than 70% of CEOs are concerned about losing ground to competitors and missing out on opportunities because of IT and infrastructure gaps \u2013 fears that are already translating into real losses. Over half of CEOs (53%) worry that a lack of investment in technology is costing them competitive advantage, while two-thirds are concerned about the opportunity costs of not investing more in technology. The costs of inaction aren't hypothetical scenarios. If they don't invest in technology now, CEOs expect higher operating costs, lower profits, reduced productivity, and declining market share.\n\nThe bold act while others fall behind\n\nFor the leaders who confront their fears, the rewards will transcend simply \"keeping up.\" CEOs are turning to AI for its transformative potential: driving efficiency (69%), spurring innovation (68%), and outpacing competitors (54%). But fulfilling that ambition requires CEOs to break down the barriers holding them back from realizing AI's potential: skills shortages, infrastructure gaps, and security risks (Figure 1).\n\nWhile CEOs focus on the bigger picture, their CIOs and CTOs are often grappling with operational hurdles including the lack of compelling business use cases \u2013 a challenge CEOs rank lower (Figure 1). This tension perhaps reflects AI's exploratory phase, where the 82% of CEOs who recognize AI's potential benefits must support bold experimentation in the short term to uncover value in the long term.\n\nOliver Tuszik, President of Cisco EMEA, highlights the opportunity: \"Whole businesses will be revolutionized if they can unlock AI's potential to innovate faster, simplify their operations, and withstand digital disruptions. But no one can do it alone. That's why 96% of CEOs are leaning on trusted partners to make the leap.\"\n\nThe CEO's Blueprint: People, infrastructure, and cybersecurity\n\nCisco's research reveals CEOs' plan to turn fear into progress \u2013 investing in knowledge and skills, upgrading infrastructure, and enhancing security to prepare for the demands of AI (Figure 2).\n\nDelivering on this blueprint will require decisive technology leadership both within the organisation and through trusted partnerships. CEOs are increasingly looking to their CTOs and CIOs, with nearly 80% recognising their vital role in guiding business and investment decisions. More and more, technology leaders are business leaders who see modern networks and technology not just as tools, but as enablers of growth, resilience, and innovation.\n\nCEOs know they can't deliver on their blueprint without expert support: 96% are turning to trusted partnerships to future-proof their network for AI. With bold technology leadership inside and beyond their organizations, the CEOs have the expertise to navigate uncertainties and translate AI's potential into tangible outcomes.\n\nCisco continues to help organizations overcome complexity and create opportunity in the AI era\n\nSkills shortages, implementation challenges, AI-ready infrastructure, and cybersecurity are top concerns for IT teams and leaders across industries. Cisco's upcoming announcements aim to address these challenges: closing gaps between security and networking for AI data centres, empowering Service Providers with new revenue-generating tools, and equipping the next generation of AI-forward professionals with enhanced certifications.\n\nDownload highlights from Cisco's CEO research here\n\nThe CEO study, conducted by Opinion Matters (24 Dec 2024\u20132 Jan 2025), surveyed 2,503 CEOs from companies with 250+ employees worldwide. A companion study with 8,065 senior networking leaders will follow in the coming months, exploring the strategic and operational needs of AI-era networking and security.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that is revolutionizing the way organizations connect and protect in the AI era.

            "content": "Cisco, formerly known as Cisco Systems, Inc. is a US-based multinational digital communication company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCNBC recently spoke to companies worldwide on how DeepSeek\u2019s new AI models will likely impact their operations and financials. Roadzen, a technology company using artificial intelligence to disrupt the auto insurance sector, was asked how things are now different with DeepSeek releasing its R1 model.\n\nAccording to its chief executive Rohan Malhotra, his company helps its insurance underwriting clients speed up claim processing, cutting the time to resolve 80% of minor accident claims from six weeks to two minutes. Since the nature of processing such claims is sensitive, the company has been using sophisticated AI models that produce accurate results, such as those from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. However, things may be different now that DeepSeek is in the picture.\n\n\u201cOur clients cannot afford a model which has 60%-70% accuracy, that\u2019s like a major economic issue. We need to deploy models that have 95%-99% accuracy.\u201d\n\nRough calculations reveal that the company may be able to incur costs 50% lower using DeepSeek than the costs incurred with OpenAI\u2019s models.\n\n\u201cWhat we really care about is the cost of inference. We care about the accuracy of the outputs. And we care about whether this model is performing to the certain benchmarks that we\u2019ve set, in a good way\".\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nBesides cost efficiencies, other companies have lauded the decision to keep the technology open source, stating that it makes it more attractive compared to existing open-source models like Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama. Another company excited with the advent of DeepSeek is a North Carolina-based eldercare platform CareYaya. Neal K. Shah, CEO, told CNBC that their company has started using AI to help customers fight health insurance claims denials.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek just lowered our costs by 90% so we can help more people,\u201d he said in a message. \u201cThe average cost to appeal a U.S. health insurance claims denial is $43.84. We had used OpenAI and Anthropic to get the cost down to 12 cents \u2014 now we\u2019re doing it with DeepSeek on the back end, the cost per appeal is 2 cents.\"\n\nThe above findings suggest how DeepSeek may democratize artificial intelligence. However, its models are also raising concerns regarding data privacy, security, and potential for misuse. That said, while the impact DeepSeek's models have made is undeniable, it is a wait-and-watch moment to see whether it reshapes the AI world for the better or for worse.",

            "content": "The Jacksonville Jaguars will need to make upgrades to their roster in the offseason if they want to bounce back in 2025. That means addressing key needs, but also moving on from players who have been underwhelming to pave the way for additions in free agency and the draft.\n\nSome of these players the Jaguars will let go are set to become free agents. Others will be cap casualties. Either way, fans won't probably miss the following five if they don't return in 2025.\n\nCJ Beathard, quarterback\n\nIt's easy to forget that CJ Beathard was still around last year. After all, he was released with an injury settlement before the regular season and took a backseat after the team's brass traded for Mac Jones in the offseason. Either way, Beathard was brought back when Trevor Lawrence suffered a shoulder injury.\n\nWhile Beathard was still on the roster in 2024, he didn't do much of note. Jones took the majority of snaps when Lawrence was out.\n\nGranted, Jones probably won't be back either next season, but it's hard to see Beathard sticking around. He originally signed with the Jags in 2021 but didn't get much playing time behind No. 16. When he did, the former Iowa Hawkeye was unremarkable. If anything the front office should take advantage of the opportunity and upgrade the backup quarterback position in either free agency or the draft.\n\nRonald Darby, cornerback\n\nThe Jaguars released cornerback Darious Williams last offseason in a cap-saving move and signed the cheaper Ronald Darby to take his place opposite Tyson Campbell.\n\nOn paper, the idea made sense as Darby had been a reliable player in his previous stops. However, the plan doesn't look in retrospect. The former Florida State Seminole struggled when he was targeted and was eventually benched in favor of reserve Montaric Brown, who wasn't much better but has more upside at this stage of his career.\n\nCornerback is now one of the top needs for the Jaguars, and nobody would bat an eye if they move on from Darby to make room for whoever they bring to start opposite Campbell.\n\nDevin Duvernay, return specialist\n\nThe Jaguars signed Devin Duvernay last year to provide a spark to the return game. Given that he made two Pro Bowls as a member of the Baltimore Ravens, it was a reasonable expectation. Unfortunately, he didn't have much of an impact. Heck, Parker Washington made more plays when he was given a chance to contribute on special teams.\n\nCompounding the issue is that Duvernay was a non-factor on offense, registering a measly 11 receptions for 79 yards with no touchdowns. Looking back, he might not been a great fit, but the Jags can free up a bit of cap space without incurring much dead money if they release him in the offseason.\n\nJeremiah Ledbetter, defensive lineman\n\nJeremiah Ledbetter was a mainstay of the Jaguars' defensive line rotation the past three years. His versatility to line up at different spots across the line of scrimmage came in handy especially when DaVon Hamilton missed significant time in 2023. On the other hand, the Arkansas product didn't have much of an impact.\n\nSure, Ledbetter was a solid rotational piece but not much else. If anything, the Jaguars kept him around because 2023 fourth-round pick Tyler Lacy hasn't been able to hit his stride. However, he may be expendable after Maason Smith and Jordan Jefferson showed promise last season.\n\nAndre Cisco, safety\n\nAfter spending most of his rookie season on the sidelines, Andre Cisco showcased the talent that made him a fixture of the Orangemen secondary at Syracuse. Once he seized a starting job, he went on to make plays. In 2021-2022, he had a combined seven interceptions and 15 passes defensed. Not surprisingly, the New York, Queens native was seen as a breakout candidate last year. But it wasn't bound to happen.\n\nCisco struggled in coverage, and his tackling left much to be desired. You could argue that some of that had to do with the inadequate coaching the defense was getting, but it was still puzzling to see him regress on a contract year. Ironically, Cisco called his teammates for quitting but he didn't appear to give a full effort either.\n\nBased on how things played out in 2025, Cisco should have a 50/50 chance of returning. He could get a fresh start after Liam Coen's arrival but he may want to test the market and bet on himself. Either way, he turned off several fans with how he handled last year.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance of information to uncover new opportunities and understand why certain stocks should be of interest.\n\nRead Also: EXCLUSIVE: Top 20 Most-Searched Tickers On Benzinga Pro In 2024 \u2014 Where Do Tesla, Nvidia, GameStop, Trump Media Stocks Rank?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week ending Feb. 7:\n\nThe Trade Desk TTD: The digital advertising company saw strong interest from readers during the week, which comes ahead of fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 12. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of $758.9 million, up from $605.8 million in last year's fourth quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report earnings per share of 56 cents for the fourth quarter, up from 41 cents per share in last year's fourth quarter. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in more than 10 straight quarters and beaten estimates for earnings per share in three straight quarters and eight of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nThe stock has received favorable coverage from analysts in recent weeks with several price target upgrades. Trade Desk shares have also been volatile after an analyst suggested that the company could merge with Roku.\n\nTrade Desk shares traded up slightly over the past five days as seen on the Benzinga Pro chart below and are up 68% over the past year.\n\nBigBear.ai Holdings Inc BBAI: The digital intelligence solutions provider saw interest soar along with its stock price during the week. BigBear.ai landed a Department of Defense contract to advance AI-powered threat detection systems. The news of the DoD deal is welcomed by investors who saw shares fall after third-quarter financial results in November.\n\nThe company's quarterly revenue of $41.5 million missed Street consensus estimates. The company ended the third quarter with a backlog of $437 million, saying it was building a \"long-term sustainable business.\"\n\nBigBear.ai shares also traded higher in January with the announcement that Kevin McAleenan would be the new CEO. McAleenan previously served as the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during President Donald Trump's first White House term.\n\nBigBear.ai stock was up over 100% in the last week and shares are up over 400% in the past year.\n\nDigital Realty Trust DLR: The data center company saw a surge in interest from Benzinga readers, leading to its second appearance on the Stock Whisper Index in three weeks. The rise in interest comes with Digital Realty's fourth-quarter financial results coming on Feb. 13.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.69 and revenue of $1.46 billion, both improvements to last year's fourth quarter. The company has missed analyst revenue estimates in four straight quarters, while beating earnings per share estimates in three straight quarters. Investors will be hoping the company beats both estimates.\n\nDigital Realty saw a surge of interest in January with the announcement of The Stargate Project leading to more attention on AI infrastructure. There remains concerns that the new project could actually hurt Digital Realty, which could be something the company is asked about by analysts after its quarterly results.\n\nDigital Realty shares are up 3.5% over the past week and up around 15% in the last year.\n\nHome Depot Inc HD: The home improvement stock saw a surge in interest from readers during the week, including more than normal searches for a stock of its size. The interest could be related to pressure on stocks in the homebuilder sector due to tariff and economic concerns. Home Depot could also be volatile with winter storms impacting regions of the country.\n\nHome Depot is set to report fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 25, with analysts expecting the company to have earnings per share of $2.97 and revenue of $38.7 billion. The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in more than 10 straight quarters. While Home Depot has only beaten analyst revenue estimates in one straight quarter, the company has beaten the consensus figure in six of the last 10 quarters.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers recently gave the nod to Home Depot in the battle with rival Lowe's Companies for quarterly financial results. The analyst said Home Depot is likely to outcomp Lowe's with stabilizing consumer trends, cutting-edge technology, and its acquisition of SRS Distribution.\n\nCisco Systems CSCO: The networking and software giant saw increased interest from Benzinga readers ahead of quarterly financial results. Cisco reports second-quarter financial results on Feb. 12.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report earnings per share of 91 cents and revenue of $13.87 billion. The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in more than 10 straight quarters and beaten revenue estimates in 10 straight quarters.\n\nThe surge in interest for Cisco comes with shares hitting new 52-week highs on Friday and shares trading at their highest price since December 2021, nearing five-year highs.\n\nStay tuned for next week's report, and follow Benzinga Pro for all the latest headlines and top market-moving stories here.\n\nRead the latest Stock Whisper Index reports here:\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Benzinga",

            "content": "Unified Threat Management (UTM) firewall is a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that integrates multiple security functions into a single platform or appliance.\n\nIt is designed to simplify security management, reduce costs, and provide robust protection against a variety of cyber threats. UTM solutions are especially popular among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to their ease of use and consolidated approach to network security.\n\nUTM solutions integrate various security features such as firewall, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), antivirus, anti-spam, VPN, web content filtering, and application control into one unified package.\n\nThis consolidation enables organizations to efficiently safeguard their networks, endpoints, and data against a wide range of cyber threats.\n\nUTM firewall is especially beneficial for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that require robust security but lack the resources to deploy and manage multiple standalone solutions.\n\nBy providing a single point of control, UTM simplifies administration, reduces complexity, and lowers overall costs. It offers real-time threat intelligence and analysis, enabling organizations to detect and respond to threats quickly.\n\nThese solutions are often cloud-based or hybrid, which allows for scalability and remote management.\n\nUnified Threat Management (UTM) software works by consolidating multiple security functions into a single platform or appliance to protect an organization\u2019s network, devices, and data from various cyber threats. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how UTM operates:\n\nHow UTM Works\n\nTraffic Inspection and Filtering\n\nUTM firewall acts as a gateway between the internal network and external networks (e.g., the internet).\n\nIt inspects all incoming and outgoing traffic using features like firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and deep packet inspection (DPI).\n\nMalicious traffic, unauthorized access attempts, or policy violations are blocked before they reach the network.\n\nThreat Detection and Prevention\n\nIntrusion Detection and Prevention: UTM monitors network activity for suspicious patterns or known attack signatures. If a threat is detected, it either alerts administrators or automatically blocks the attack.\n\nAntivirus/Anti-Malware: The software scans files, emails, and other data for viruses, ransomware, or malware. Detected threats are quarantined or removed.\n\nWeb Filtering: UTM blocks access to harmful or inappropriate websites by analyzing URLs against a database of known malicious sites or based on user-defined policies.\n\nSecure Connectivity\n\nUTM provides Virtual Private Network (VPN) capabilities to encrypt data transmitted between remote users and the corporate network. This ensures secure access for employees working remotely or from branch offices.\n\nIt also supports secure site-to-site VPN connections for inter-office communication.\n\nEmail and Spam Protection\n\nUTM systems filter incoming and outgoing emails to block spam, phishing attempts, and malicious attachments.\n\nThey may also include email encryption to protect sensitive communications.\n\nData Monitoring and Control\n\nFeatures like Data Loss Prevention (DLP) monitor sensitive data transfers to ensure compliance with security policies.\n\nApplication control restricts the use of unauthorized applications that could pose security risks.\n\nCentralized Management\n\nUTM software provides a unified dashboard for administrators to configure security policies, monitor network activity, generate reports, and respond to threats in real time.\n\nThis centralized approach simplifies management compared to using separate tools for each security function.\n\nReal-Time Updates\n\nMany UTM solutions receive regular updates from their vendors to stay current with new threat intelligence (e.g., malware definitions, attack signatures). This ensures protection against emerging threats.\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\nSome UTMs include bandwidth management features to prioritize critical applications and prevent non-essential traffic from consuming excessive resources.\n\nLoad balancing ensures that the system can handle high traffic volumes without compromising performance.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between UTM and A Firewall?\n\nThe lines between these two have significantly blurred over the last few years.\n\nUsing a firewall\u2019s real-time malware and virus scanning feature can prevent suspicious packets from entering your network and subsequently infiltrating your PCs and servers.\n\nIt should be noted that a UTM is located on your organization\u2019s site and acts as a gateway between your internet connection and your network.\n\n10 Best UTM Firewall \u2013 2025\n\nSonicWall UTM : It offers robust security capabilities, including intrusion prevention, gateway anti-virus, and anti-spyware.\n\n: It offers robust security capabilities, including intrusion prevention, gateway anti-virus, and anti-spyware.

            "content": "Cisco, formerly known as Cisco Systems, Inc. is a US-based multinational digital communication company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

            "content": "Cisco takes its climate efforts very seriously. And the company has set highly ambitious goals for greenhouse gas emissions and circularity.\n\nOne key tool to advance these goals? Investments.\n\n\u201cThe future demands solutions that are sustainable,\u201d said Jon Koplin, Cisco Investments senior director, who leads investments in Europe and in sustainability. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a \u2018nice to have\u2019; it\u2019s become a \u2018must have\u2019 \u2014 for us and for our customers.\u201d\n\nCisco Investments is among the world\u2019s most active corporate venture investors, with a strong foundation in security, AI, networking, collaboration, and more. Recently, though, it has accelerated its efforts in the sustainability space.\n\nThese initiatives complement those of the Cisco Foundation, the company\u2019s philanthropic wing, which in 2021 pledged $100 million in climate-related grants to nonprofits and impact investments, particularly in developing regions like Africa and the Amazon.\n\nOn the Cisco Investments side, the company seeks to invest in organizations that align with Cisco\u2019s own climate goals and those of its customers.\n\n\u201cThere is incredible innovation taking place in the climate technology space and our goal is to enable these solutions by investing in companies that align with our environmental sustainability goals,\u201d said Mary de Wysocki, Cisco\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe\u2019re backing early-stage startups that bring breakthrough ideas to life and supporting them to scale their impact to provide business value and address the challenges our planet faces.\u201d\n\nFor Cisco, helping the planet is also a smart business strategy.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Koplin stressed, \u201ca lot of these innovations may ultimately drive lower operating costs and increase power efficiency across a number of products and services.\u201d\n\nTwo key examples are Cisco\u2019s investments in CorPower Ocean, which is developing powerful solutions to harness ocean waves for 24/7 renewable energy, and DEScycle, with its innovative, low-energy processes for extracting critical minerals from e-waste.\n\nEndless energy, from \u2018nature\u2019s battery\u2019\n\nWind and solar power are having an increasingly positive impact on global energy needs, with renewable sources making up 30 percent of global electricity sources in 2023.\n\nBut as good as they are, renewables can have shortfalls. For starters, the sun gets blocked by clouds and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow. Batteries solve much of the problem, but they have their own limitations.\n\n\u201cGiven the intermittent nature of solar and wind,\u201d said Kelsi Doran, Cisco\u2019s head of sustainability strategy and transformation, \u201cCisco became interested in using technology to harness the power of waves, with their potential to provide clean energy 24/7, at utility scale.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where CorPower Ocean comes in. The Stockholm-based company has been exploring wave power since 2012 and today has one of the most advanced solutions in the energy space.\n\nAlong the way \u2014 with test phases off Scotland, Portugal, and other coastlines \u2014 it has greatly improved the energy output of its wave-energy converters and their survivability in storms, two challenges that have bedeviled other attempts at scaling wave energy.\n\n\u201cI believe it's fair to say that this is the first machine that has shown solid, strong survivability while doing efficient power generation in the regular wave conditions,\u201d claimed Patrick M\u00f6ller, CEO of CorPower Ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination which hasn\u2019t been there previously for wave energy.\u201d\n\nCorPower Ocean\u2019s floating wave-energy generators are about 260 feet tall and 30 feet wide and rated at 300 kilowatts each \u2014 enough to power a medium-sized office building. With a unique anchor system and hydraulics inspired by the pumping action of the human heart, they leverage the up/down motion of waves to create electricity via dynamos within each buoy.\n\nWith this latest technology, CorPower Ocean gets more energy from smaller, lighter structures that are scalable for larger floating clusters, or \u201cfarms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge step upwards in structure efficiency,\u201d M\u00f6ller added, \u201cor at least five times improvement compared to previous state of the art in the field.\u201d\n\nAs for Cisco\u2019s investment, Koplin sees a promising opportunity to scale a potentially high-impact technology.\n\n\u201cThe ocean is like the world\u2019s largest battery,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much power constantly running through these enormous oceans. And it's very easy to imagine a farm being co-located with offshore wind and doubling or potentially even tripling the amount of energy that's available from a given space that's already been allocated to power companies.\u201d\n\nTapping an e-waste \u2018gold mine\u2019\n\nIn 2022, the U.N\u2019s Global E-waste Monitor estimated that a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste was generated globally. And it\u2019s only increasing.\n\nAs for recycling, the U.N. estimated less than a quarter of that e-waste was properly treated. The rest was mostly burned or left in landfills \u2014 in either case releasing dangerous toxins like lead, cyanide, and mercury into the environment, while losing valuable metals like gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.\n\nSuch metals represent an almost literal gold mine. According to E-waste Monitor, less than one quarter (22.3 percent) of e-waste was documented as having been properly collected and recycled in 2022. That left $62 billion worth of recoverable natural resources unaccounted for.\n\nCisco is just 4 percentage points shy of its goal of incorporating Circular Design Principles into 100 percent of its new products and packaging by FY25. But e-waste remains a key concern, and the company is always on the lookout for new solutions.\n\nThat\u2019s why London-based DEScycle caught Cisco\u2019s attention.\n\nThe startup has developed a novel low-energy, low-carbon process for separating critical metals from e-waste. Using deep eutectic solvents (DES), DEScycle has successfully demonstrated its chemical process for separating metals in labs and is now looking to scale.\n\n\u201cDEScycle was originally a collaboration with the University of Leicester,\u201d said DEScycle co-founder and managing director Dr. Leo Howden. \u201cBut we wanted to take DES out of the university environment and create a technology and a process that can be applied commercially.\u201d\n\nInitially focused on the mining industry, DEScycle soon realized a great opportunity in e-waste.\n\n\u201cOur vision and mission is to replace the reliance on landfills and energy-intensive smelters with something that is sustainable,\u201d Howden added, \u201ca solution that doesn't have an impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nDESCycle\u2019s non-toxic, salt-based solvents are themselves recyclable, as opposed to some other e-waste chemical processes that rely on heavy acids.\n\n\u201cWe have true recyclability of our solvents,\u201d claimed DEScycle CTO Rob Harris. \u201cThe unique set of properties in our solvents give us fantastic efficiencies that we don't see in water and acid-based processes. We can genuinely recycle our solvents, which means we're not shipping in loads more chemicals onto the site.\u201d\n\nThe solvents can also be tailored for specific metals, enabling traceability. So, for example, palladium from a Cisco product could go straight back to Cisco. And the process enables simpler, more localized recycling of e-waste, as opposed to shipping many tons of it to far-off, centralized smelters and landfills.\n\n\u201cYou can avoid large, aggregated solutions,\u201d explained Howden. \u201cAnd you can do it in your own backyard. Because we can shrink the process down and co-locate it near the supply of the material.\u201d\n\nSuch technologies could reap future benefits.\n\n\u201cIt's a very clean process, and they are able to do it at low scale and still be reasonably economical,\u201d Koplin explained, \u201cwhereas some other solutions require very large plants or can\u2019t cover the range of metals that DEScycle does. So, it's a very innovative solution to a long-existing problem.\u201d\n\nDesCycle and CorPower Ocean represent but two technologies related to sustainability that Cisco Investments is helping to accelerate.\n\nKoplin shared the excitement that\u2019s building on the Cisco Investments team for what it can accomplish \u2014 for global ecosystems and for the business. But he tempered it with caution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to work on something that could change the future of our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there's still a lot of ground to cover. It\u2019s going to be a long journey.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he\u2019s encouraged that the business case for sustainability \u2014 in efficiency, energy savings, customer loyalty, and more \u2014 is becoming clear to many more organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching a future,\u201d Koplin concluded, \u201cwhere the more you incorporate sustainable solutions into your business, the more competitive it will be.\u201d",

            "content": "Wall Street analysts expect Cisco Systems (CSCO) to post quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share in its upcoming report, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. Revenues are expected to be $13.86 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Cisco metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- Product- Networking' reaching $6.66 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -5.9% year over year.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Services' stands at $3.73 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Product- Security' will likely reach $1.99 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +104.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Product' at $9.92 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7.4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Product- Collaboration' of $1.00 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.5%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Non-Gaap Gross Margin- Service' to reach $2.64 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $2.51 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Non-Gaap Gross Margin- Product' to come in at $6.56 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $6.02 billion.\n\n\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Cisco here>>>\n\n\n\nOver the past month, shares of Cisco have returned +5.2% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change.

            "content": "Cisco, formerly known as Cisco Systems, Inc. is a US-based multinational digital communication company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure.\n\nWhy Congressional Transactions Matter\n\nCongressional transactions shouldn't be the primary reason for an investing decision, but they can be an important factor for an investor to consider.\n\nWhen a senator or representative makes a new purchase, it could be an indication they expect the stock to rise.\n\nA sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean the seller thinks the stock will go down.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.",

He spent years at Cisco with his last role at the company as global solutions leader for Cisco\u2019s Cloud Software and Infrastructure.\n\nHorner was most recently head of Americas enterprise sales for Cloudflare before joining Aviatrix this month. At Cloudflare, Horner spearheaded nearly 100 percent year-over-year growth for two consecutive years in the enterprise segment.\n\n\u201cThe companies that appeal to me are revolutionary, not evolutionary,\u201d said Horner in a statement. \u201cAnalysts have recently reported that Aviatrix is that rare type of company\u2014scoring extremely high on innovation and moving quickly. I\u2019m thrilled to be joining the company to further scale its growth.\u201d\n\n[Related: Aviatrix CEO Doug Merritt On Relaunched channel Program And Goal To Include Partners In 100 Percent Of Transactions]\n\nHorner previously worked with current Aviatrix CEO Doug Merritt when Merritt was CEO of Splunk.\n\nAviatrix Hires Former Cisco AppDynamics Executive, Says \u2018Hyper Growth\u2019 Ahead\n\nSanta Clara, Calif.-based Aviatrix also hired Mark Anthony as its new vice president of global business value.\n\nAnthony spent nearly five years at Cisco\u2019s AppDynamics, with his last role as director of value consulting for the Americas region. After AppDynamics, Anthony spent a year with JFrog as global director of JFrog\u2019s value practice before joining Aviatrix in January.\n\nScott Leatherman also was appointed Aviatrix\u2019s new CMO. Leatherman worked for over 12 years at SAP with his last role as COO for SAP Labs US and global vice president of marketing. He joined Aviatrix last year as Merritt\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\u201cAviatrix is solving the biggest challenges facing enterprises today, like IP exhaustion, Azure NAT [Network Address Transalation] gateway policy changes and infrastructure modernization with zero-trust cloud networking,\u201d said Leatherman in a statement. \u201cWith a customer base of over 500, that includes 10 precent of the Fortune 500 and strong VAR, ISV and CSP partners, Aviatrix is poised for sustained hyper growth.\u201d\n\nThe new hires come as Aviatrix is relaunching its channel program and putting partners at the center of its strategy to capture more share in the $30 billion cloud networking market.\n\n\u201cAs part of this relaunch, it\u2019s really almost a relaunch of the company,\u201d Merritt told CRN last month. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the way that we talk about ourselves with much more specific use-case-driven frameworks for problems that we solve, that, hopefully if we\u2019ve done our job, are deeply tied to key business priorities that CIOs have as they\u2019re continuing to work their way through their cloud journey and their new hybrid landscape.\u201d\n\nOther New Aviatrix Hires\n\nAviatrix also recently hired Russ Gould as its new vice president of growth marketing. Gould has a history in top marketing roles at Veritone, Guidance Software, Billtrust and Kofax.\n\nAviatrix also recently hired former ServiceNow director Denise Oliver as its new vice president of revenue operations. Oliver spent over eight years as ServiceNow, including in top senior director sales positions along with financing executive roles at Stripe, Lacework and EMC.\n\nAnother former Splunk executive who previously worked for Merritt is Richard Vienna, who is now Aviatrix\u2019s global vice president of strategic accounts. Vienna has previously held top strategic account positions at HP Inc. and Quest Software.\n\nLooking at all of his new hires, Merritt said, \u201cWith Ken, Scott and the rest of our new leadership team, we\u2019re in a prime position to double down on solving the toughest cloud networking security challenges, innovate, scale and create meaningful value for our customers and partners.\u201d\n\nAbove photo from left to right: Ken Horner, Doug Merritt and Scott Leatherman.",

These vulnerabilities present significant risks, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands and bypass authorization controls. If exploited, they could grant unauthorized access to critical network components, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions. Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is an advanced security solution that enables enterprises to control user access and enforce compliance policies across their networks. By providing a platform for identity and access management, ISE helps organizations strengthen infrastructure security while improving operational efficiency. Given the severity of these vulnerabilities, organizations utilizing Cisco ISE should promptly update their systems to the latest patched versions to mitigate potential security threats and prevent exploitation.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About the Latest Cisco ISE Vulnerabilities? Cisco recently disclosed two major vulnerabilities in its ISE platform that could allow attackers to execute unauthorized commands and gain elevated system access. These flaws pose significant security risks, making immediate remediation essential for affected organizations. CVE-2025-20124: Insecure Java Deserialization Vulnerability (CVSS 9.9) A serious flaw in Cisco ISE stems from insecure deserialization of Java byte streams. This vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, effectively gaining complete control over the affected system. The exploit is triggered when an attacker sends a maliciously crafted serialized Java object to an exposed API, bypassing security mechanisms. Importantly, to carry out the attack, the attacker must possess valid read-only administrative credentials, which reduces but does not eliminate the risk of exploitation. CVE-2025-20125: Authorization Bypass Vulnerability (CVSS 9.1) This vulnerability arises from insufficient authorization validation in a specific API within Cisco ISE. An attacker with read-only administrative credentials can exploit this weakness by sending specially crafted HTTP requests, enabling them to access sensitive system information, modify configurations, and even restart affected nodes. The lack of stringent access controls in this API makes it a critical security concern, as unauthorized configuration changes can disrupt network security operations and expose critical data to further threats. If your organization relies on Cisco ISE, vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-20124 and CVE-2025-20125 present a direct threat to your network\u2019s integrity. SOCRadar\u2019s Cyber Threat Intelligence module, with its Vulnerability Intelligence capabilities, enables you to identify, assess, and act on such critical risks in real-time. With detailed insights on exploitability and CVE lifecycle tracking, SOCRadar helps you mitigate risks before they can be weaponized, ensuring your defenses remain intact.\n\nWhich Versions Are Affected and What Are the Fixes? The vulnerabilities impact all Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) configurations. Below are the affected software releases and their respective patches: Cisco ISE 3.1: Fixed in 3.1P10\n\nCisco ISE 3.2: Fixed in 3.2P7\n\nCisco ISE 3.3: Fixed in 3.3P4 It is recommended for those relying on Cisco ISE 3.0 releases to migrate to a fixed release to prevent exploitation. Additionally, Cisco ISE 3.4 releases are not vulnerable to CVE-2025-20124 or CVE-2025-20125.\n\nNo Known Exploits \u2013 Yet At present, Cisco\u2019s Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) has not observed any active exploitation of these vulnerabilities. However, given their critical nature, adversaries may attempt to weaponize them soon. Organizations should act swiftly to safeguard their networks.",

Since the flaws can be abused to run arbitrary commands and steal sensitive information, Cisco urged its users to apply the fixes as soon as possible.\n\nIn a security advisory, the networking giant first said it patched a \u201cdeserialization of user-supplied Java byte streams\u201d vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-20124, and given a severity score of 9.9/10 (critical). By sending a custom serialized Java object to an affected Cisco ISE API, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands and elevate privileges.\n\nThe second flaw is an authentication bypass bug, occurring since an API did not perform authorization checks, or properly validated user-supplied data. A threat actor could send a malicious HTTP request to the API on the device to trigger it. This bug is tracked as CVE-2025-20125, and was given a severity score of 9.1/10 (critical).\n\nAuthentication required\n\nWhile these flaws sound dangerous, they\u2019re not that easy to exploit. Cisco said that threat actors would still need to be authenticated, and with a read-only admin account, at that.\n\nIndeed, that means pulling the attack off is a lot more difficult, but still not impossible. As The Register properly noted, cybercriminals can phish for login credentials, or simply buy them off the black market.\n\n\u201cIt's worth noting that NCC Group blamed last year's surge in ransomware attacks partly on compromised credentials, so it's not like these are too difficult to obtain. Rogue insiders can also abuse these holes, of course,\u201d the publication said.\n\nIn any case, Cisco has already come out with fixes, so patching them should be done as soon as possible. Versions 3.0 - 3.3 were said to be vulnerable, so users should ensure they bring their software to version 3.4, at least. The good news is that there is still no evidence of abuse in the wild.\n\nAre you a pro?

            "content": "There is a constant \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game between defenders and attackers, the latter trying to outsmart and get a head start on the former. In the context of online advertising, this involves creating fake identities or using stolen ones to push out malicious ads.\n\nAn attacker not only needs to evade detection but also create a lure that will be convincing to most people. In this blog post, we focus on what malvertisers use in almost all of their campaigns, namely decoys also known as \u201cwhite pages\u201d in order to fool the advertising entity.\n\nThe particular case is a malicious Google ad for Cisco AnyConnect, a tool often used by employees to remotely connect to company networks, but also by universities. In fact, we found that threat actors were using the name of a German university to create a fake website designed not to fool actual victims, but rather to bypass detection from security systems.\n\nTo be sure, victims were part of the overall scheme, but they were instead redirected to a lookalike Cisco site linking to a malicious installer containing the NetSupport RAT remote access Trojan.\n\nThe perfect disguise\n\nThe malicious ad comes up from a Google search for the keywords \u201ccisco annyconnect\u201c. The ad displays a URL that looks somewhat convincing for the domain anyconnect-secure-client[.]com. We should note that this domain was registered less than a day before the ad appeared.\n\nUpon clicking on the ad, server-side checks will determine whether this is a potential victim or not. Typically, a real victim has a residential IP address and other network settings that differentiate it from crawlers, bots, VPNs or proxies.\n\nIn recent times, we have seen criminals rely on AI to generate fake pages that look innocuous. These are also referred to as \u201cwhite pages\u201d and they do serve an important purpose. If it\u2019s obviously so fake and bad, it will raise suspicion. We thought that in this case the perpetrator had a rather clever idea by stealing content from a university that actually does use Cisco AnyConnect.\n\nTechnische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TU Dresden), is a public research university in Germany whose site can be found here. Funnily enough, the threat actors left a trail while doing their copy/paste. We can see that they added the cookie opt-in notification which is required for websites in Europe, which here leaked their browser language (Russian).\n\nReal victims get infected with malware\n\nAs good as this template looks, real victims will never see it. Instead, upon connecting to the malicious server they will be immediately redirected to a phishing site for Cisco AnyConnect.\n\nThe payload is downloaded in a similar way to a campaign we had already observed before, using a PHP script that provides the direct download URL. We can see from the network traffic capture below that the file is hosted on a likely compromised WordPress site.\n\nThere is not much to be said about the fake installer other than it being digitally signed with a valid certificate. Upon execution it extracts client32.exe, a name notorious for being associated with NetSupport RAT.\n\ncisco-secure-client-win-5.0.05040-core-vpn-predeploy-k9.exe\n\n-> client32.exe\n\n-> \"icacls\" \"C:\\ProgramData\\CiscoMedia\" /grant *S-1-1-0:(F) /grant Users:(F) /grant Everyone:(F) /T /C\n\nThe remote access Trojan connects to the following two IP addresses: 91.222.173[.]67 and 199.188.200[.]195, further granting a remote attacker access to the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nConclusion\n\nBrand impersonation is a common theme with search ads. As Google enforces various policies and uses algorithms to detect malicious activity, threat actors need to constantly come up with new ideas.\n\nReusing a university page was a clever idea, but there were a couple of things that made this attack shy of being perfect. The domain name, while very strong for impersonation, was newly registered. Since it was part of the ad\u2019s display URL, it could have potentially been detected by Google. We also noted that the perpetrators left a trail when they copy/pasted the code from the university website, which identified their likely country of origin.\n\nHaving said that, the malware payload was digitally signed and had few detections when first seen, so this attack may have had a decent success rate.\n\nAs always, we recommend that users take precautions whenever looking up programs to download, and to be especially wary of sponsored results.\n\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we remove them\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

It's worth noting that NCC Group blamed last year's surge in ransomware attacks partly on compromised credentials, so it's not like these are too difficult to obtain. Rogue insiders can also abuse these holes, of course.\n\nBoth bugs affect Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) versions 3.0 to 3.3, regardless of device configuration, and both have patches available to apply. Version 3.4 is not vulnerable to either flaw; folks using earlier affected versions are advised to upgrade to a fixed release as detailed in the advisory.\n\nCisco also issued instructions on upgrading a device, which can be viewed in its Upgrade Guides documentation located on the Cisco Identity Services Engine support page.\n\nAs of now, the networking vendor isn't aware of any in-the-wild exploits. Here are the details on both.\n\nThe first flaw, CVE-2025-20124, stems from the insecure deserialization of user-supplied Java byte streams in Cisco ISE, which is network access control software that enforces security policies and manages endpoints across enterprises' IT environments.\n\nThe flaw exists in an API of Cisco ISE, and an attacker could exploit it by sending a crafted serialized Java object to an affected API. \"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device and elevate privileges,\" the networking giant warned in its security advisory.\n\nCisco credited Deloitte's Dan Marin and Sebastian Radulea with spotting and reporting this vulnerability.\n\nThe second bug, an authorization bypass vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-20125, was also disclosed by Radulea.\n\n\"A vulnerability in an API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with valid read-only credentials to obtain sensitive information, change node configurations, and restart the node,\" Cisco warned.\n\nThis flaw is due to a specific API not performing authorization checks or properly validating user-supplied data, and can be triggered by sending an HTTP request to the API on the device.\n\nCisco also notes that the vulnerabilities are not dependent on each other, so exploiting one of the two isn't necessary to exploit the other.\n\n\"In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability,\" the advisory added.\n\nBoth of these critical security holes follow an earlier 9.9-rated vulnerability in Cisco's Meeting Management tool that could allow a remote authenticated attacker with low privileges to escalate to administrator on affected devices. Cisco patched that flaw a couple of weeks ago. \u00ae",

Maintaining personal hygiene. Staying connected with family.\n\nFor many of us, these are simple, everyday tasks. But for those with diverse abilities \u2014 including seniors and people with cognitive disabilities \u2014 handling such tasks can be a daily triumph. And they can mean the difference between independence and constant supervision.\n\nA pilot project funded by Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program, Ignite Technology, and other partners has been exploring how digital solutions can help. Under the brand name Hayla, a suite of high-tech innovations has evolved into a streamlined, secure, app-based platform that is ready for market.\n\n\u201cA lot of these individuals are looking to live more independently, autonomously, maybe move to a situation where they\u2019re on their own,\u201d explained Ignite CEO Steven Taylor. \u201cAnd the Autonomous Living Project, now branded Hayla, uses technology to help people work towards the goal of self-sufficiency, independence, and greater dignity.\u201d\n\nThe origins of Hayla began in 2021 at the Lou Fruitman Residence in Toronto, which is run by Reena, another partner in the project. The Residence houses 138 adults and seniors with diverse needs. And as part of this project, it adopted a number of technologies \u2014 including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, automated alerts, smart-device integration, collaboration hubs, and a proprietary app \u2014 all supported by customized Cisco and Cisco Meraki products.\n\nThe concept is built around self-sufficiency, not surveillance. Through remote monitoring, smart notifications, alert services, and smart-device integration, users receive in-home support that enables them to live independently and safely. However, if the need arises \u2014 whether for an emergency, basic reminders, or emotional/mental counseling \u2014 caregivers can step in quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s geared to individual outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking to an individual and a caregiver,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cwe don't simply talk about the sensors they can have. We talk about the challenges they\u2019re experiencing today, and we look at implementing a solution that leverages technology to actually help address those challenges.\u201d\n\nSecurity and simplicity for positive good\n\nWith their shared commitment to simple-to-use, secure technologies, Cisco and Ignite were ideal partners.\n\n\u201cLike Cisco, Ignite is committed and visionary,\u201d said Wayne Cuervo, director of Cisco Canada\u2019s Digital Impact Office. \u201cThey have an ideal view of how technology can not only help, but how technology can get out of the way \u2014 to simplify the experience.\u201d\n\nHayla represents a big commitment in time, technology, and expertise from Cisco, particularly its CDA program.\n\n\u201cWe consider Hayla to be one of our most important projects,\u201d said Cuervo. \u201cIt\u2019s a profound story that helps transform the lives of people. And we feel it\u2019s very scalable to other use cases around the world.\u201d\n\nAs for the outcomes so far, Jessica Noftle, day program supervisor for another partner, the Toronto-based family-support organization Creating Alternatives, weighed in from a caretaker\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cWith Hayla\u2019s expertise, innovation and devices,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have successfully been able to help more than 10 supported individuals transition out of fully supported days, to semi-independent living. Hayla\u2019s dedication, along with their mentorship, has been a huge success for us at Creating Alternatives. We hope to continue to work alongside them for years to come.\u201d\n\nA scalable solution for aging populations\n\nHayla makes it all happen with a foundation of Cisco technology.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the hardware is a Cisco firewall router and an access point,\u201d Taylor stressed. \u201cThat access point communicates with the Meraki IoT sensors in the unit, which monitor things like the refrigerator, doors, and showers. Essentially, you have your network equipment \u2014 that is, access points, firewalls, and switches for larger implementations, \u2013 and IoT sensors that are set in the environment for safety and peace of mind. Maybe it's actually detecting water leakage, smoke in units, or simply helping to track daily living tasks.\u201d\n\nCommunication, of course, is equally critical. And Cisco Webex \u2014 either through handheld devices or hardware like the Cisco DeskPro, combined with Webex Calling \u2014 keeps users, their families, and caregiving teams connected on both emotional and practical levels.\n\n\u201cWebex Calling is part of our custom software that we've integrated,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cThis allows individuals to call a parent, caregiver, or therapist simply by clicking their picture. Everything is handled on the back end, so it's just one button to call.\u201d\n\nSecurity is a key concern, especially when sensitive medical or personal data is shared among vulnerable populations. So, Cisco and Meraki\u2019s built-in end-to-end security ensures further confidence in the system. Despite a constant flow of data coming from sensors, monitoring is automated and intuitive.\n\n\u201cAll of this is managed on the back end through the Meraki Dashboard and Cisco Control Hub,\u201d Taylor added. \u201cWe have automated alerts through Meraki dashboard.\u201d\n\nFor Cuervo \u2014 and Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration program \u2014 supporting Ignite\u2019s effort to bring Hayla to market is a great opportunity. CDA\u2019s mission is to use technology for positive transformation around the world (in more than 50 countries so far), and Hayla is a perfect fit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about using technology to address challenges and doing it in a way that benefits society,\u201d Cuervo said. \u201cHayla is significant at an individual level, but also at a national and global scale. In Canada and other countries, populations are aging, increasing the demand for social services, while the number of caregivers is shrinking. This solution enables caregivers to be more effective while improving the quality of life for those in need. For us, it\u2019s a perfect combination of technology excellence and real-world, positive impact.\u201d\n\nView original content here.",

But for those with diverse abilities - including seniors and people with cognitive disabilities - handling such tasks can be a daily triumph. And they can mean the difference between independence and constant supervision.\n\nA pilot project funded by Cisco's Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program, Ignite Technology, and other partners has been exploring how digital solutions can help. Under the brand name Hayla, a suite of high-tech innovations has evolved into a streamlined, secure, app-based platform that is ready for market.\n\n\"A lot of these individuals are looking to live more independently, autonomously, maybe move to a situation where they're on their own,\" explained Ignite CEO Steven Taylor. \"And the Autonomous Living Project, now branded Hayla, uses technology to help people work towards the goal of self-sufficiency, independence, and greater dignity.\"\n\nThe origins of Hayla began in 2021 at the Lou Fruitman Residence in Toronto, which is run by Reena, another partner in the project. The Residence houses 138 adults and seniors with diverse needs. And as part of this project, it adopted a number of technologies - including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, automated alerts, smart-device integration, collaboration hubs, and a proprietary app - all supported by customized Cisco and Cisco Meraki products.\n\nThe concept is built around self-sufficiency, not surveillance. Through remote monitoring, smart notifications, alert services, and smart-device integration, users receive in-home support that enables them to live independently and safely. However, if the need arises - whether for an emergency, basic reminders, or emotional/mental counseling - caregivers can step in quickly.\n\nIt's technology that's geared to individual outcomes.\n\n\"If we're talking to an individual and a caregiver,\" Taylor said, \"we don't simply talk about the sensors they can have. We talk about the challenges they're experiencing today, and we look at implementing a solution that leverages technology to actually help address those challenges.\"\n\nSecurity and simplicity for positive good\n\nWith their shared commitment to simple-to-use, secure technologies, Cisco and Ignite were ideal partners.\n\n\"Like Cisco, Ignite is committed and visionary,\" said Wayne Cuervo, director of Cisco Canada's Digital Impact Office. \"They have an ideal view of how technology can not only help, but how technology can get out of the way - to simplify the experience.\"",

They want to hang around to collect valuable data or lay plans for future attacks. Post-compromise threats are growing, Cisco says, and they\u2019re aimed largely at aging network infrastructure and edge devices that are long past end-of-life stage and may have critical unpatched vulnerabilities. \u201c\u2026 the older legacy components have more avenues for access, especially if the devices are out of support and they haven\u2019t been updated in three or four years,\u201d said Nick Biasini, head of outreach at Cisco\u2019s Talos security research arm.\n\nCisco, partners to offer tailored IoT/OT packages\n\nFeb. 29, 2024: Cisco has implemented a new blueprint that involves working more closely with partners to offer packages of networking and software components that meld IT elements with Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT).\n\nCisco to cut 5% of workforce amid restructuring; layoffs will impact 4,200 jobs\n\nFeb. 14, 2024: After days of speculation, Cisco announced a restructuring plan that will see the networking vendor cut 5%, or about 4,200 jobs, from its 84,900 workforce as it plans to continue to focus on high-strength areas such as AI and security.\n\nCisco brings AI assistant to cloud app security service\n\nFeb. 08, 2024: Cisco is launching a generative AI-based assistant to help customers handle cloud-native application security issues more quickly and efficiently.

            "content": "When Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program began in 2015, it represented a radical new concept: that a global technology company could bring together nations\u2019 industry, government, and academic leaders to co-innovate solutions to major societal problems.\n\nIf anyone had doubts, they were soon dispelled.\n\nTen years on, CDA has brought positive change to 50 countries around the world, helping to transform everything from coffee farms in Tanzania and floating classrooms in the Amazon to energy grids in Spain, network infrastructure in Ukraine, and smart cities in India (to name but a few).\n\nSo, for Cisco, it\u2019s an important anniversary and a time to celebrate all that CDA has accomplished \u2014 in AI, education, healthcare, sustainability, transportation, agriculture, cybersecurity, and more \u2014 along with the good it can continue to drive.\n\nOne reason for CDA\u2019s success is the leadership of Guy Diedrich, Cisco\u2019s senior vice president and global innovation officer.\n\n\u201cIt's a privilege and an honor to work with these countries around the world,\u201d said Diedrich, who has been a prime mover behind CDA since its start. \u201cWe have created 1,600 individual digitization projects in every vertical imaginable. And the number of people that CDA has impacted is well into the tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions.\u201d\n\nCisco\u2019s technology and expertise underlie those 10 years of success. But Fran Katsoudas, Cisco\u2019s EVP and chief people, policy, and purpose officer, also highlighted the role that human relationships have played.\n\n\u201cYou have built trust with people around the world, and that is not easy to do,\u201d Katsoudas stressed in congratulating CDA on its anniversary. \u201cAnd your impact is not only good for Cisco from a business perspective, it's amazing for the world.\u201d\n\nBuilding that trust starts at the top. And Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins called out the importance of engaging high-level government leaders in the early stages of each project.\n\n\u201cI have the benefit of having been involved when we created this program a decade ago, and it has been hugely powerful,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cIt's so logical. If we're going to invest in a country, let's align those investments with the priorities of the head of state in the country. It makes us a better citizen in that country. And it makes us more impactful.\u201d\n\nWhen doing good is good for business\n\nLike Diedrich and Robbins, Chris Reeves \u2014 vice president of Cisco\u2019s Digital Impact Office for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) \u2014 has been with CDA from the start. And he shared his thoughts on how the program has evolved during its 10 years, while, at its core, remaining the same.\n\n\u201cOver 10 years, the program's changed and adapted to different waves of technology and changing geopolitical landscapes, and it's adapted and grown,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also proud that it has remained true to its original concept, which is to use technology to deliver better outcomes for communities, economic growth, and also potential growth for Cisco.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the CDA program has shown that positive change can be good for business.\n\n\u201cThe Country Digital Acceleration Program is proof that you can do good and do well,\u201d Diedrich said. \u201cYou can benefit the world. You can lift up populations. You can work with societies to help them take advantage of new opportunities. And you can make money along the way.\u201d\n\nThat kind of success, Diedrich believes, creates the potential for doing more good.\n\n\u201cSome people think that somehow if you're making a profit, it diminishes your purpose,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think the exact opposite is true. If you can fulfill your purpose and drive revenue and provide value to the company, then it makes it sustainable. In fact, purpose and profit are not mutually exclusive. They're completely compatible.\u201d\n\nA round of global applause\n\nThe spirit trust and cooperation infused the responses of CDA\u2019s partners around the world, starting with Milan, Italy. With Cisco\u2019s help, the city has driven a wide range of smart city, educational, health care, and transportation initiatives, along with creating a Cybersecurity Co-innovation Center.\n\nGiuseppe Sala, Milan\u2019s mayor, looks forward to many more years of collaboration.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, CDA has made remarkable contributions to driving innovation and digital transformation in our city and across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cWishing continued success in shaping a more connected and sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nAs regards education, Diedrich stresses that every CDA initiative will include a skills component. So CDA is closely aligned with the Cisco Networking Academy, the largest company-led digital skills program of its kind.\n\nIrais Barreto Canales, of Mexico\u2019s Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Ministry, gave CDA high marks for its many initiatives to better Mexican society. But she called out two that were especially close to her heart.\n\n\u201cDigital Skills for Mexican Women of the 21st Century,\u201d she explained, \u201cis a program in which we have certified nearly 2,000 women in specialized courses representing over 600,000 training hours. The other one was the Digital Skills for Nurturing, which is about growing new companies. These are great examples of how our collaboration with Cisco has increased our digital skills.\u201d\n\nAnother project showing the scope and reach of CDA and Networking Academy is the Senac Ferry School, which brings professional training to riverside communities in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nBorn from a longstanding partnership between CDA and Senac \u2014 one of Brazil\u2019s leading professional education institutions \u2014 the project provides access to technology, connectivity, and knowledge in remote areas. Courses in IT and other fields combine Cisco\u2019s tech expertise with Senac\u2019s educational infrastructure. It\u2019s an initiative that develops essential job market skills, promotes citizenship, and expands opportunities in hard-to-reach regions.\n\n\u201cThe people that Senac serves can now access the internet and can access Cisco courses,\u201d said Anna Beatriz, director of professional education at Senac Brazil, \u201cand this transforms lives. Technology courses and free connectivity weren\u2019t accessible to these populations, but now they are.\u201d\n\nSmarter cities, schools, traffic, and more\n\nAt the same time, powerful new network solutions are giving Japanese schools a big boost. Cisco and CDA\u2019s GIGA schools package includes Cisco and Meraki networking equipment to create a robust, futureproof network, enabling all-new experiences in K-through-12 education. Webex boards and Cisco Wi-Fi are part of what make learning more fun and effective.\n\nSmart cities have been a keystone of CDA efforts from the start. In India, for example, CDA played a pivotal role in the country\u2019s Smart Cities Mission. And cities like Vijayawada, Gandhinagar and Hyderabad featured Cisco solutions around Wi-Fi, security, smart parking, smart lighting, improvements in transportation, and additional command and control centers.\n\nThe Indian government is enacting a bold plan to create 100 smart cities across the country. And CDA looks forward to continued leadership in these efforts, improving connectivity, economic opportunity, sustainability, quality of life, and more.\n\nSpeaking of quality of life, in Australia, as in many countries, traffic is a serious issue. So, CDA partnered with Transport for NSW to take smart traffic management to next levels. This included deploying AI, Wi-Fi, and edge computing for real-time analysis of traffic patterns.\n\n\"The system is being used to manage congestion more efficiently, to improve the safety of our network, and to improve the customer experience,\u201d said Chris Bennetts, head of technology and innovation, TfNSW. \u201cThe future is upon us. The next 3 to 5 years is going to be a game-changer.\"\n\nLooking to a future that\u2019s more sustainable and equitable\n\nThe climate crisis affects us all, so energy grids and renewable energy are key focus areas for CDA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked very closely with utility companies around the world to help them transform their networks,\u201d said Reeves. \u201cSo, they're digitally powered networks and they can respond to the distributed generation of carbon free energy and also the distributed usage of it, from things like autonomous vehicles. So, we've used Cisco's technology to help the utility companies adapt as they've moved to more sustainable solutions.\u201d\n\nAmong CDA\u2019s partners is Ikusi, an advanced technology services company that has partnered with CDA on digitizing electricity grids. And Javier Aguilera, managing director of Ikusi Spain, shared some thoughts on working with Cisco and CDA.\n\n\u201cAt Ikusi, we have had the privilege of participating in various projects with the Cisco CDA program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest and most exciting of this is a pioneering project focused on the digitalization of electricity grids in Spain. The Cisco CDA program represents innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to driving digital transformation.\u201d\n\nCDA\u2019s efforts in war-torn Ukraine show how it can respond in some of the most challenging conditions. In addition to its Medibus, a rolling healthcare center that has supported refugees, CDA has helped strengthen and secure Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure while building important educational and skills resources \u2014 all of which will be critical as Ukraine anticipates its long struggle to rebuild.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with CDA is a pivotal investment in Ukraine\u2019s and the world\u2019s digital future,\u201d said Valeriya Ionan, deputy minister for Eurointegration at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. \u201cWhile words cannot fully express our gratitude, our projects speak for themselves. We\u2019re looking forward to the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nThose next 10 years are on the minds of all who are involved in the CDA program. In supporting a future that\u2019s more sustainable, equitable, and connected, CDA is just getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this success story will go on because the disruptive technologies are changing fast than ever before,\u201d concluded Oliver Tuszik, president of Cisco\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EMEA). \u201cAnd no matter in which country we are, they're all looking for help from a reliable partner like Cisco.\u201d",

However, this research makes it seem like a less credible option.\n\nAfter all, the potential of leaving employee and customer data unprotected may prove to be too great a risk.\n\nThis sentiment was shared by Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research, who wrote in a LinkedIn post about Cisco\u2019s research: \u201cHow secure is DeepSeek AI? Can their claims of performance at a lower cost be validated?\n\nSo, is it cheaper to train? Looks like it, but at what cost? Sometimes the lowest cost is the most expensive.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether DeepSeek responds to the apparent safety and security shortcomings of its platform or continues to double down on its more cost-effective approach.\n\nConsidering ChatGPT-40 is operating at an 86 percent attack success rate and yet has over one million paid business users across its Enterprise, Team, and Edu offerings, many organizations appear unconcerned about the ramifications of poor LLM safety.\n\nHow LLMs are Helping to Power the Agentic AI Trend\n\nAnother tradeoff of heightened competition in the open-source LLM market is how it will impact the agentic AI space.\n\nIf the last couple of years in the CX tech space have been all about GenAI, the next few look set to revolve around AI agents.\n\nThese advanced, autonomous bots take action and achieve goals without constant user input, making them closer to fully independent problem solvers or assistants.\n\nEquipped with autonomy, reasoning, planning, and deep contextual understanding, they act across various enterise systems.\n\nUnlike rule-based or basic conversational AI bots, which require lengthy setups and often frustrate users with limited capabilities, AI Agents can make decisions autonomously and handle complex tasks.\n\nTraditional bots often lead to customer frustration due to their inability to understand nuanced needs, forcing users to bypass the system and reach a human agent instead.\n\nThis undermines the potential ROI from self-service technologies, as customers frequently find workarounds to avoid ineffective AI systems.\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cgame changer\u201d is criminally overused in the technology sector, Agentic AI truly has the capacity to transform the CX space through a combination of time savings, customer empowerment, enhanced user experience, and action-oriented support.",

Researchers used algorithmic jailbreaking to demonstrate 100% vulnerability to harmful prompts, raising concerns about its training methods and the need for superior AI security measures.\n\nChinese start-up DeepSeek has gained attention for introducing large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning capabilities and cost-efficient training. Its recent releases DeepSeek R1-Zero and DeepSeek R1 have achieved performance comparable to leading models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 at a fraction of the cost and outperformed Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT-4o on tasks like math, coding, and scientific reasoning.\n\nHowever, the latest research from Robust Intelligence (now part of Cisco) and the University of Pennsylvania, shared with Hackread.com, reveals critical safety flaws.\n\nResearchers reportedly collaborated to investigate the security of DeepSeek R1, a new reasoning model from the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. The assessment cost was less than $50 and involved using an algorithmic validation methodology.\n\nThe team tested DeepSeek R1, OpenAI\u2019s o1-preview, and other frontier models using an automated jailbreaking algorithm applied to 50 prompts from the HarmBench dataset. These prompts spanned six categories of harmful behaviour, including cybercrime, misinformation, illegal activities, and general harm.\n\nTheir key metric was the Attack Success Rate (ASR), measuring the percentage of prompts that elicited harmful responses. The results were alarming: DeepSeek R1 exhibited a 100% attack success rate, failing to block a single harmful prompt. This contrasts sharply with other leading models, which demonstrated at least some level of resistance to such attacks.\n\nIt is worth noting that researchers used a temperature setting of 0 for reproducibility and verified jailbreaks through automated methods and human oversight. DeepSeek R1\u2019s 100% ASR starkly contrasts with o1, which successfully blocked many adversarial attacks. This suggests that DeepSeek R1 while achieving cost efficiencies in training, has significant trade-offs in safety and security.\n\nVia Cisco\u2019s Robust Intelligence\n\nFor your information, DeepSeek\u2019s AI development strategy utilizes three core principles- Chain-of-thought\u201d prompting, reinforcement learning, and distillation, which enhance its LLMs\u2019 reasoning efficiency and self-evaluate reasoning processes.\n\nAs per Cisco\u2019s investigation these strategies, while being cost-efficient, may have compromised the models\u2019 safety mechanisms. Compared to other frontier models, DeepSeek R1 appears to lack effective guardrails, making it highly susceptible to algorithmic jailbreaking and potential misuse.\n\nThe research emphasizes the need for rigorous security evaluation in AI development to balance efficiency and reasoning without compromising safety. It also highlights the significance of third-party guardrails for consistent security across AI applications.",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best FAANG+ stocks to invest in right now.\n\nThe group of stocks formerly known as FAANG were synonymous with technological prowess, market dominance, and high growth. These companies provided exponential returns and offered the chance to be part of the technological revolution. Their rise to dominance was fueled by innovation, digital transformation, the increasing use of the internet, and their insatiable hunger for growth. In the process, they reshaped industries, altered consumer behavior, and redefined customer engagement. However, over the past couple of years, the acronym has lost some of its relevance as some names have changed and new companies have encroached on the territories of these mega-caps. As a result, the market has started using the term \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d to better represent the most valuable tech stocks. In this list, we include the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 plus five interesting stocks that focus on the transformational technology growth trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, EV technology, and streaming.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by understanding the sheer magnitude of these stocks. We created an equal-weighted portfolio (equal investment in each stock) of all 12 mega-cap technology stocks in this list and compared their combined performance with the S&P 500 Index over the past 5 years. Astonishingly, the mega-caps portfolio has returned over 385% compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s return of around 86%. Additionally, these 12 stocks now have a combined market cap of over $20.0 trillion, with around $14 trillion added in the past 5 years. In comparison, the total market cap of all US-listed stocks is approximately $60.5 trillion (as of December 2024; source: Wilshire 5000 Index), making these mega-caps account for nearly one-third of the total US market value. Although it\u2019s not entirely fair to compare market caps to GDP, if we could, and if these 12 mega-caps formed a country, they would rival China as the second or third largest country by nominal GDP.\n\nDespite recent intense competition, challenging market dynamics, and a difficult regulatory environment, these tech leaders still stand tall with their legacy of innovation and digital transformation. We believe their substantial investments in technology infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, international expansion, and continuous innovation have helped them maintain their dominance. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened new avenues for growth among these tech giants. With that, let\u2019s explore these 12 stocks.",

            "content": "With DeepSeek rocking the Silicon Valley tech firms last week with its capabilities gained at a fraction of the cost, interest is now ablaze in the Chinese AI challenger and its system.\n\nJust days after the bombshell, major UCaaS provider Microsoft made DeepSeek R1 available on Azure AI Foundry in a move to capitalise off the interest.\n\nOthers, as a result, will be looking at their UCaaS provider to see if they can expect to see the service integrated into its systems.\n\nDeepSeek offers cheaper usage than its competitors, like OpenAI, without sacrificing quality. From an enterprise perspective, there is a lot to love about it.\n\nHowever, Cisco is not entirely convinced. The Webex owner has raised the alarm over security pitfalls it sees with the DeepSeek R1 model in a new report, potentially dashing any ideas of integration into its UCaaS solutions.\n\nCisco\u2019s Assessment of DeepSeek R1\n\nReleased last week, Cisco\u2019s comprehensive security evaluation of DeepSeek R1 reveals alarming vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen an abundance of media coverage dissecting DeepSeek R1 and speculating on its implications for global AI innovation. However, there hasn\u2019t been much discussion about this model\u2019s security,\u201d\n\nThe report stated.\n\nAs a result, Cisco\u2019s AI security researchers wanted to dig deeper.\n\nSince the introduction of OpenAI\u2019s O1 model, model providers have focused on building models with reasoning.\n\nLLMs have been able to fulfill tasks in an adaptive manner through continuous interaction with the user.\n\nHowever, Cisco asserts the team behind DeepSeek R1 has demonstrated high performance without relying on expensive, human-labeled datasets or massive computational resources.\n\nTherefore, the research aimed to find out if DeepSeek and its new paradigm of reasoning have any significant tradeoffs when it comes to safety and security.\n\nApplying a methodology similar to that used in Cisco\u2019s recently released AI Defense, they ran an algorithmic vulnerability testing on DeepSeek R1 to understand its safety and security profile better.\n\nThis saw the researchers run an automatic jailbreaking algorithm on 50 uniformly sampled prompts from the popular HarmBench benchmark, a benchmark that has a total of 400 behaviours across 7 harm categories, including cybercrime, misinformation, illegal activities, and general harm.\n\nThe research also performed safety and security testing against several popular frontier models as well as two reasoning models: DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1-preview, for comparison purposes.\n\nWhat they found was startling.\n\n100% Attack Success Rate : When tested against 50 random prompts from the HarmBench dataset, DeepSeek R1 exhibited a 100% attack success rate. This means the model failed to block any harmful prompts across six categories, including cybercrime, misinformation, and illegal activities.\n\nLack of Robust Guardrails : Compared to other frontier models, DeepSeek R1 lacks robust safety mechanisms, making it highly susceptible to algorithmic jailbreaking and potential misuse.\n\nCompromised Safety Mechanisms : The report suggests that DeepSeek\u2019s cost-efficient training methods, including reinforcement learning, chain-of-thought self-evaluation, and distillation, may have inadvertently compromised the model\u2019s safety features.\n\nContrast with Other Models: The vulnerability of DeepSeek R1 stands in stark contrast to other leading models, which demonstrated at least partial resistance to similar attacks.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 was purportedly trained with a fraction of the budgets that other frontier model providers spend on developing their models,\u201d the report continues. \u201cHowever, it comes at a different cost: safety and security.\u201d\n\nThe research team managed to jailbreak DeepSeek R1 with a 100% attack success rate \u2013 meaning there was not a single prompt from the HarmBench set that did not obtain an affirmative answer from DeepSeek R1.\n\nWebex\u2019s Security-First Approach\n\nWith its parent company Cisco being a big player in network security, it\u2019s no wonder Webex\u2019s reputation for secure communications is a cornerstone of its service offering.\n\nThe platform incorporates end-to-end encryption, secure file sharing, and compliance with various industry standards.\n\nTherefore, integrating a vulnerable AI model could that could potentially compromise this position would run counter to this security-first approach and could potentially expose users to risks such as data breaches or malicious attacks.\n\nEqually, even beyond any formal partnership, Webex users looking toward third-party integration of DeepSeek could be left hanging.\n\nTo get APIs approved for use on the platform, Webex offers two types of integrations:\n\nPrivate Integrations: These are developed within an organisation for internal use cases. For example, an integration that allows employees to order catering for meeting rooms. These integrations are typically deployed and activated through Control Hub by the same person and are developed by people within the organisation to solve internal use cases. Public Integrations: These are available to all Webex customers. An example might be a third-party issue reporting system available as a paid service. In this case, the vendor creates the app and requests approval from Cisco. If approved, Cisco deploys the public integration on Control Hub, making it available to all Webex customers.\n\nThis approval process gives Webex the ability to deny any DeepSeek integration that doesn\u2019t meet its security standards.\n\nGiven the vulnerabilities identified in the Cisco report, DeepSeek may have trouble passing this approval process in its current state.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Future Use in Webex\n\nAs a UCaaS solution that prioritises security, it currently seems unlikely that Webex would introduce a technology with such significant security flaws.\n\nHowever, as major AI players begin to coalesce around the AI startup, and DeepSeek itself continues to refine its models, it may soon come that the issues flagged here abate.\n\nEqually, it could come that DeepSeek\u2019s innovative and cheaper AI offering may cause Webex to find a way to implement the offering with guardrails in place.\n\nSo, although not a glowing commendation for Cisco, whether Webex will be an adopter of DeepSeek\u2019s AI remains to be seen. But don\u2019t expect it any time too soon.",

            "content": "Last week, DeepSeek quickly became the most popular app on the Apple App Store. The free, open-source model quickly gained popularity for its advanced capabilities and free access. However, significant concerns are being raised about its security and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nA recent report by Cisco revealed alarming findings that indicate DeepSeek is severely flawed in terms of security. The R1 model exhibited a 100% attack success rate, failing to block harmful prompts. DeepSeek is highly susceptible to algorithmic jailbreaking, where users manipulate the AI to perform unintended or malicious tasks. While other top AI models are not entirely safe, they have guardrails for some measure of resistance to harmful inputs.\n\nIn addition to its security vulnerabilities, DeepSeek has faced issues related to data privacy. A critical database leak exposed over one million records, including system logs, user prompts, and API tokens. This exposure raises concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive information and highlights the need for robust data protection measures in AI platforms.\n\nThe combination of security flaws and data privacy issues has attracted international attention. Due to potential security and ethical concerns, the U.S. Navy has banned the use of DeepSeek on government-issued devices. Similarly, Italy banned the app, citing fears of data privacy concerns.\n\n\n\nThese actions underscore the growing apprehension regarding using AI technologies developed in jurisdictions with differing data privacy standards.\n\nThe open-source paradox\n\nThe open-source nature of DeepSeek's models offers significant appeal. Companies can access, modify, and integrate the technology into their existing systems without licensing fees, fostering innovation and customization. This approach aligns with the growing trend in the tech industry toward open-source solutions, enabling rapid development and adaptation. Just last week, ElevenLabs made it possible to chat with DeepSeek, improving upon the chatbot.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek's AI models are notably cost-effective, with the DeepSeek-R1 model developed at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. This efficiency allows companies to integrate advanced AI capabilities without the substantial financial investment typically required for proprietary models. The performance of DeepSeek-R1 is comparable to leading models, excelling in tasks such as mathematics, coding, and natural language reasoning.\n\nCompanies such as Perplexity AI and Grok offer users a selection of proprietary and third-party AI models to address their queries. The latest addition to this lineup is DeepSeek R1. This integration allows users to access DeepSeek's capabilities directly through the U.S. platforms while ensuring their data stays safe. Grok does not store user data. Perplexity users can rest assured that all user data, including prompts and responses, is stored within U.S. data centers, ensuring compliance with local data privacy standards.\n\nImplications for users and the AI industry\n\nThis democratization of AI could lead to increased innovation, as more companies and developers can contribute to and benefit from advanced AI capabilities. The open-source model also encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can accelerate the development of AI applications across various industries.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

The open-source nature of DeepSeek's technology, combined with its impressive performance and cost efficiency, presents a compelling case for its integration into existing AI infrastructures. However, these cost-effective strategies may have weakened the safety mechanisms of the models.\n\nThe lack of safety in models like DeepSeek R1 makes them susceptible to algorithmic jailbreaking and potential misuse. As organizations consider integrating such technologies, balancing the benefits with a thorough assessment of security risks is imperative to ensure responsible and safe deployment.\n\nWhile DeepSeek's innovative approach to AI has garnered attention, the recent findings highlight significant security and privacy concerns. As AI continues to evolve rapidly, developers and users alike must prioritize safety and data protection to fully realize this transformative technology's benefits.",

The content of the manipulated audio usually asks for financial assistance, pretending to be a friend or a family member in need of money.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nWith threats on the rise, Cisco says enterprises must have a single set of AI security and safety measures that can protect all their applications against potential digital attacks.\n\nThe cybersecurity team must also have visibility in the entire network to better guard the system and prevent hackers from having successful attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, it adds.\n\nAI adoption\n\nThe use of AI has been on the rise since chatbot ChatGPT became popular. It has several use cases that can enhance company operations, including processing of real-time data that can aid in making quick and informed business decisions.\n\nAccording to a survey by Cisco, 65 percent of the local enterprises set aside 10 percent to 30 percent of their existing information technology (IT) budget for AI adoption. They usually spend on cybersecurity, IT infrastructure and data analytics and management.\n\nIn addition, 98 percent of the surveyed local companies expressed \u201cincreased urgency\u201d to use AI in their operations.\n\nHowever, Cisco Philippines managing director Zaza Soriano-Nicart says the \u201cprimary challenge remains infrastructure readiness, with gaps in compute, data center network performance and cybersecurity, amongst other areas.\u201d\n\nOnly about one-fifth of the Philippine enterprises have the GPUs (graphics processing units) that can handle AI workload, she shares. GPUs are used to process large data sets, which are necessary when harnessing AI potential.\n\nDigital hygiene\n\nApart from AI tools, Kaspersky also says it is important to always keep in mind the basics.\n\nKaspersky reminds enterprises to keep their software updated to lessen vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers, in addition to regularly backing up critical data.\n\nOrganizations must also always monitor network activity for unusual behavior, it stresses. Kaspersky says it will also be helpful if network access is only limited to certain officials and employees.\n\nThe cybersecurity company advises companies to educate their employees about the emerging digital threats and to train their cybersecurity teams.\n\nOn the part of consumers, the cybersecurity firm reminds Filipinos to use strong and unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication for all accounts.\n\nThe users must also avoid clicking on suspicious links, which can trick them into providing sensitive and personal information.\n\n\u201cBy adopting these measures, businesses and individuals can stay one step ahead of cybercriminals while fostering a safer digital environment,\u201d Kaspersky says.\n\nKaspersky notes that 26.8 percent of Filipino users dealt with web-borne cyberattacks in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The company claims its R1 model can trade blows with competitors including OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1, but at a tiny fraction of the cost, sending shivers down the spines of Wall Street investors.\n\nBut the company seemingly has done little to guard its AI model against attacks and misuse. In other words, it wouldn't be hard for a bad actor to turn it into a powerful disinformation machine or get it to explain how to create explosives, for instance.\n\nThe news comes after cloud security research company Wiz came across a massive unsecured database on DeepSeek's servers, which included a trove of unencrypted internal data ranging from \"chat history\" to \"backend data, and sensitive information.\"\n\nDeepSeek is extremely vulnerable to an attack \"without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world,\" according to Wiz.\n\nThe Chinese hedge fund-owned company's AI made headlines for being far cheaper to train and run than its many competitors in the US. But that frugality may come with some significant drawbacks.\n\n\"DeepSeek R1 was purportedly trained with a fraction of the budgets that other frontier model providers spend on developing their models,\" the Cisco and University of Pennsylvania researchers wrote. \"However, it comes at a different cost: safety and security.\"\n\nAI security company Adversa AI similarly found that DeepSeek is astonishingly easy to jailbreak.\n\n\"It starts to become a big deal when you start putting these models into important complex systems and those jailbreaks suddenly result in downstream things that increases liability, increases business risk, increases all kinds of issues for enterprises,\" Cisco VP of product, AI software and platform DJ Sampath told Wired.\n\nHowever, it's not just DeepSeek's latest AI. Meta's open-source Llama 3.1 model also flunked almost as badly as DeepSeek's R1 in a comparison test, with a 96 percent attack success rate (compared to dismal 100 percent for DeepSeek).\n\nOpenAI's recently released reasoning model, o1-preview, fared much better, with an attack success rate of just 26 percent.\n\nIn short, DeepSeek's flaws deserve plenty of scrutiny going forward.\n\n\"DeepSeek is just another example of how every model can be broken \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of how much effort you put in,\" Adversa AI CEO Alex Polyakov told Wired. \"If you\u2019re not continuously red-teaming your AI, you\u2019re already compromised.\"\n\nMore on DeepSeek: DeepSeek's AI Would Like to Assure You That China Is Not Committing Any Human Rights Abuses Whatsoever Against Its Repressed Uyghur Population",

            "content": "Zero trust in the US public sector has become critical, especially as cyber threats targeting government agencies grow more complex and sophisticated. In line with the federal mandate for zero trust architecture (ZTA) outlined in Executive Order M-22-09, government agencies are required to adopt a comprehensive security framework that continuously verifies trust for every access request.\n\nThis approach makes sure that only authorized users and secure devices gain access to sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and minimizing lateral movement of potential threats. Zero trust is a strategic approach to security that centers on the concept of eliminating trust from an organization\u2019s network architecture. As agencies increasingly migrate their workloads to Amazon Web Services (AWS), implementing zero trust security measures becomes even more crucial. The combination of Cisco Umbrella for Government and AWS provides a powerful solution that enables agencies to maintain zero trust across their cloud infrastructure while meeting compliance requirements.\n\nIn this post, we demonstrate how Cisco Umbrella for Government, built on AWS, plays a key role in ZTA by providing multi-layered security and granular visibility across on premises and AWS.\n\nStrengthening government cybersecurity with Cisco Umbrella for Government\n\nCisco Umbrella for Government is a FedRAMP Moderate authorized instance of the enterprise cloud-based security suite. It enables government agencies to adopt a zero trust approach and protect their AWS resources, strengthen their cybersecurity posture, and safeguard sensitive information stored or processed on AWS.\n\nHaving achieved FedRAMP Moderate authority to operate (ATO), this platform enables US federal, state, and local government entities to confidently adopt and implement Cisco Umbrella while meeting their compliance requirements.\n\nBuilt on AWS GovCloud (US), Cisco Umbrella for Government used AWS FedRAMP-authorized services, significantly reducing the time required for compliance. Throughout the process, Cisco used AWS Professional Services and the Global Security & Compliance Acceleration (GSCA) Program. This strategic approach helped streamline the path to FedRAMP Moderate authorization, showcasing Cisco\u2019s commitment to providing secure and reliable cloud services to the US public sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons we rely on AWS GovCloud is its alignment with compliance security controls, policies, and practices. Without AWS and its dedicated support for the mission, it would be far more challenging for Cisco and agencies to address threats on their own,\u201d said Josh Jackson, a Cisco account executive. \u201cThe partnership between Cisco and AWS enables us to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks effectively. Together, we support the goals established by the Department of Homeland Security to protect critical infrastructure and deliver scalable, secure solutions.\u201d\n\nAs an AWS Public Sector Partner with multiple AWS competencies, including the Security ISV Competency, Cisco offers the Cisco Umbrella for Government solution through AWS Marketplace, making it streamlined for government agencies to procure and deploy.\n\nEnabling zero trust with Cisco Umbrella for Government\n\nCisco Umbrella for Government enables ZTA with a broad set of security functions such as secure web gateway, firewall, DNS-layer security, data loss prevention (DLP) and cloud access security broker (CASB) through a single, cloud delivered service and dashboard.\n\nA key benefit of Cisco Umbrella for Government is its ability to deliver real-time threat intelligence across all devices, locations, and AWS resources. Similarly to other solutions in the Cisco Security portfolio, it uses insights from Cisco Talos, one of the world\u2019s largest commercial threat intelligence teams, to uncover and block a wide spectrum of malicious domains, IPs, and files.\n\nDNS-layer security\n\nCisco Umbrella for Government enforces security at the DNS layer to block requests to malware, ransomware, phishing, and botnets before they reach the network or endpoints. It also integrates with Protective DNS from CISA. Now, government customers can use Umbrella DNS to deliver a fast, safe, and reliable internet experience, with the same technology used by more than 30,000 enterprise customers.\n\nCASB\n\nCisco Umbrella\u2019s integration with AWS provides visibility into AWS hosted cloud applications used across the organization. This capability helps expose shadow IT by giving agencies the ability to detect and block unauthorized cloud applications. Umbrella uses DNS logs to discover cloud apps that users are accessing and provides an overview of the number of app requests by date and risk level in the App Discovery dashboard to show patterns and changes over time.\n\nSecure web gateway\n\nUmbrella\u2019s Secure Web Gateway (SWG) inspects the customer web traffic on various ports including TCP, UDP, and ICMP. HTTP web security inspection allows Umbrella to decrypt and inspect web destinations including applications and selectively control your organization\u2019s access to specific file types.\n\nThe platform offers secure web traffic proxying through Cisco Secure Client to make sure of consistent protection for users accessing on-premises and AWS resources, whether on-network or off-network. It also provides customizable security measures, real-time activity search, and detailed logging, which allows agencies to tailor their security posture according to specific compliance requirements.\n\nCloud delivered firewall (with intrusion prevention system)\n\nUmbrella\u2019s cloud-delivered firewall filters traffic based on a rule action and rule criteria that can be port, protocol, IP source and destination, and application. The integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides real-time threat detection and prevention by analyzing network traffic patterns and blocking potential attacks before they can impact the network.\n\nCisco Duo also integrates with Umbrella to provide identity and device protection such as implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device health checks. This integration makes sure that only verified users on trusted devices can access protected resources.\n\nData loss prevention and cloud malware detection\n\nCisco Umbrella combines advanced malware protection, granular application control, URL and content filtering, and data loss prevention capabilities all without compromising network performance. Organizations across industries need comprehensive security, but they can\u2019t afford to sacrifice speed and operational efficiency. Boston Medical Center\u2018s experience demonstrates how Umbrella delivers on both fronts.\n\n\u201cWhile other security products slow down requests to the internet by filtering them through inline devices, Cisco Umbrella delivers security from the cloud without added latency, which is crucial because every millisecond counts in patient care,\u201d said Lee Cullivan, Chief Information Security Officer at Boston Medical Center. \u201cBecause defending our network and data against malware, ransomware, phishing, and other threats may literally be a life-and-death matter we needed a way to deliver maximum security with minimal impact to our operations and patient care.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nCisco Umbrella for Government provides agencies with a FedRAMP Moderate authorized solution that directly aligns with federal ZTA mandates. For government organizations looking to meet ZTA requirements while strengthening their security posture, Cisco Umbrella for Government offers a proven path forward.

The companies were hoping to get the administration to okay the deal, possibly with changes, before the Trump administration took over but that didn\u2019t happen, and any hope the companies had of the Trump administration reversing course was dashed by yesterday\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in its decision to file a suit,\u201d the two companies said in a joint statement.\n\nCompetition watchdogs in the U.K. and European Union, among others, have approved the deal, making the U.S. an outlier, the companies said.\n\n\u201cAll other major antitrust regulators [say] this transaction brings together two complementary networking offerings and will create a networking player with the scope and scale to more effectively compete with global incumbents,\u201d the companies said.\n\nCentral to DOJ\u2019s argument is the nature of the enterprise WLAN market, in which only three companies effectively compete in the U.S.: HPE, Juniper and Cisco Systems.\n\nDOJ says smaller companies don\u2019t have the resources to compete for enterprise clients \u2014 big companies, universities, medical centers and the like \u2014 and instead compete for the business of entities that don\u2019t need hundreds or thousands of wireless access points or the software to manage them.\n\nWith the market only having these three companies, a combination between HPE and Juniper would leave just two, with Cisco having the biggest share and the combined company having much of the rest.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition, if consummated, would result in two companies \u2026 controlling well over 70 percent of the U.S. market and eliminate fierce head-to-head competition,\u201d DOJ says in the complaint.\n\nIt\u2019s because of their fierce competition that HPE has been compelled to innovate and discount its prices to win or keep customers. \u201cDefendants\u2019 merger \u2026 would eliminate head-to-head competition that has lowered prices and driven investment in network management software, and it would decrease pressure on HPE to discount and innovate in the future,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nIn their statement, HPE and Juniper say DOJ is misrepresenting the market.\n\n\u201cDOJ\u2019s claim that the WLAN market is composed of three primary players is substantially disconnected from market realities,\u201d the companies say. \u201cAs customers shift to AI and cloud-driven business strategies for secure, unified technology solutions to protect their data, barriers to entry have decreased and expansion and competition for WLAN has intensified.\u201d\n\nThe companies call WLAN \u201can extremely competitive market with a broad set of players, all of whom are fighting for business and winning bids in competitive RFP processes.\u201d\n\nFortinet, Arista, Nile, Meter and Extreme Networks are some of the smaller companies in the WLAN market.\n\nOn the whole, network specialists favor the merger in the belief a combined HPE-Juniper will provide a needed counterweight to Cisco.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ missed the boat here,\u201d Patrick Shelley, chief technology officer at network services company PKA Technologies, said in a CRN report. \u201cIf HPE is able to acquire Juniper Networks, it would drive more innovation and force Cisco to stay up to date and current with regard to AI enabled networking.

            "content": "A major cybersecurity vulnerability in Cisco Webex Chat (previously known as IMI Chat) has raised alarming concerns after it was revealed that unauthenticated attackers could access the chat histories of organizations using the platform.\n\nFirst identified in July 2024, the flaw exposed sensitive communications from hundreds, potentially thousands, of organizations spanning internal IT help desks to customer-facing operations.\n\nCritical Exposure of Sensitive Data\n\nCisco Webex Chat, acquired in 2021 following the purchase of IMI Engage by IMImobile PLC, is widely used for live chat support.\n\nThe tool enables organizations to integrate a chat widget into web applications for customers or internal staff.\n\nExample of how to embed the Webex Chat (IMI Chat) widget in a web page\n\n\n\nHowever, this functionality became an attack vector due to the insecure use of a \u201cclientKey\u201d \u2014 originally intended as a public identifier \u2014 which was also employed as a secretKey for sensitive API calls.\n\nThe issue allowed threat actors to list and retrieve chat thread metadata and even access the full historical conversation logs.\n\nThese logs could potentially contain sensitive customer information, personally identifiable information (PII), internal credentials, and responses to security queries.\n\nHow the Exploit Works\n\nThe flaw was rooted in the way chat threads were initialized and managed via backend API calls. Researchers discovered the following:\n\nThread Initialization : The /threads API endpoint used the clientKey to create new chat sessions but also inadvertently allowed the listing of existing threads.\n\n: The /threads API endpoint used the clientKey to create new chat sessions but also inadvertently allowed the listing of existing threads. Unauthorized Thread Access : By sending a GET request with the clientKey, attackers could retrieve metadata for ongoing and past chat threads, including thread identifiers (UUIDs).\n\n: By sending a GET request with the clientKey, attackers could retrieve metadata for ongoing and past chat threads, including thread identifiers (UUIDs). Chat History Retrieval: Attackers could exploit another API call, GetPreviousChatHistory, to access the complete text content of chat threads. Parameters like the app UUID, client ID, and thread ID \u2014 which could be harvested via earlier steps \u2014 were enough to retrieve sensitive conversation logs.\n\nProof-of-Concept and Real-World Impact\n\nAccording to the Ophion Security blog, Researchers created a proof-of-concept (PoC) script that demonstrated how attackers could exploit this vulnerability with only minimal information, such as the app UUID embedded in the widget\u2019s JavaScript or the domain origin hosting the chat.\n\nPOST /rtmsAPI/api/v3/apps/CLIENT_ID/threads HTTP/2 Host: CUSTOMERNAME-usor.apps-imiconnect.io Content-Length: 165 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/128.0.6613.120 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/json Accept: */* Secretkey: CLIENT_KEY Priority: u=1, i {\"title\":\"da0f3fca-5f21-4b8b-b76d-1bf5baf5813c_APP_ID_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_1727372312156\",\"type\":\"Conversation\",\"status\":\"Active\"}\n\nTested against a real organization, the script successfully accessed all historical chat logs, revealing sensitive discussions between employees and IT teams.\n\nThis significant oversight by Cisco underscores the risks of inadequate security in SaaS products. Chat systems, widely assumed to be secure environments, can hold critical information that attackers can leverage for further exploits.\n\nOrganizations using Cisco Webex Chat are strongly advised to immediately audit their environments and ensure they are using a patched or updated version of the software.\n\nCisco must also prioritize revisions to its authentication and API handling mechanisms to safeguard sensitive customer and organizational data from future attacks.\n\nAs cybersecurity concerns continue to escalate, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for rigorous security testing and monitoring in enterprise SaaS tools.",

The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

In response, OpenAI and other generative AI developers have refined their system defenses to make it more difficult to carry out these attacks. But as the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek rockets to prominence with its new, cheaper R1 reasoning model, its safety protections appear to be far behind those of its established competitors.\n\nToday, security researchers from Cisco and the University of Pennsylvania are publishing findings showing that, when tested with 50 malicious prompts designed to elicit toxic content, DeepSeek\u2019s model did not detect or block a single one. In other words, the researchers say they were shocked to achieve a \u201c100 percent attack success rate.\u201d\n\nThe findings are part of a growing body of evidence that DeepSeek\u2019s safety and security measures may not match those of other tech companies developing LLMs. DeepSeek\u2019s censorship of subjects deemed sensitive by China\u2019s government has also been easily bypassed.\n\n\u201cA hundred percent of the attacks succeeded, which tells you that there\u2019s a trade-off,\u201d DJ Sampath, the VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, tells WIRED. \u201cYes, it might have been cheaper to build something here, but the investment has perhaps not gone into thinking through what types of safety and security things you need to put inside of the model.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have had similar findings. Separate analysis published today by the AI security company Adversa AI and shared with WIRED also suggests that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a wide range of jailbreaking tactics, from simple language tricks to complex AI-generated prompts.\n\nDeepSeek, which has been dealing with an avalanche of attention this week and has not spoken publicly about a range of questions, did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about its model\u2019s safety setup.\n\nGenerative AI models, like any technological system, can contain a host of weaknesses or vulnerabilities that, if exploited or set up poorly, can allow malicious actors to conduct attacks against them. For the current wave of AI systems, indirect prompt injection attacks are considered one of the biggest security flaws. These attacks involve an AI system taking in data from an outside source\u2014perhaps hidden instructions of a website the LLM summarizes\u2014and taking actions based on the information.\n\nJailbreaks, which are one kind of prompt-injection attack, allow people to get around the safety systems put in place to restrict what an LLM can generate. Tech companies don\u2019t want people creating guides to making explosives or using their AI to create reams of disinformation, for example.\n\nJailbreaks started out simple, with people essentially crafting clever sentences to tell an LLM to ignore content filters\u2014the most popular of which was called \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d or DAN for short. However, as AI companies have put in place more robust protections, some jailbreaks have become more sophisticated, often being generated using AI or using special and obfuscated characters. While all LLMs are susceptible to jailbreaks, and much of the information could be found through simple online searches, chatbots can still be used maliciously.",

How many acquisitions has Cisco made in the last 20 years to continue its market dominance? I\u2019m shocked,' says one solution provider in response to the DOJ suing to block the $14 billion HPE-Juniper Networks merger.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s lawsuit to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper Networks is a nod to the networking status quo that boosts market leader Cisco and \u201cweakens\u201d competition in the networking market, partners told CRN.\n\nThe Justice Department claims that the megadeal between the two networking companies will \u201creduce competition and weaken innovation.\u201d Meanwhile, HPE and Juniper Networks on Thursday fired back at the Department of Justice, calling the lawsuit \"fundamentally flawed\u201d and pledged to do battle in the courts to complete the deal.\n\n\"They got this one wrong. If anything, this weakens competition,\" said an executive for a large solution provider organization that partners with both Cisco and HPE that spoke under the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe resulting product platform that would come from a combined HPE-Juniper would indeed strengthen innovation and competition, the executive said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t see the merger as limiting choice,\" the executive said. \"There are many more players [such as] Fortinet, Arista, Nile, Meter and Extreme Networks.\"\n\nThe networking industry has been anticipating the megadeal, first announced in January 2024, to close any day. HPE said last year that the deal should close by the end of calendar year 2024 or beginning of calendar year 2025.\n\n\"I\u2019m pretty shocked. The financial analysts I have talked to recently expected the incoming administration would be very favorable to M&A,\" the partner executive said. \"My first thought was this must be a holdover from outgoing DOJ leadership, so I was shocked this assistant attorney general was appointed just recently by the new administration.\"\n\n[Related: 5 Private Networking Companies To Watch In 2025]\n\nPatrick Shelley, chief technology officer (CTO) at PKA Technologies, a Montvale, N.J. solution provider, said he believes HPE\u2019s acquisition of Juniper Networks would increase competition in the networking space that\u2019s dominated by market heavyweight Cisco.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ missed the boat here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf HPE is able to acquire Juniper Networks, it would drive more innovation and force Cisco to stay up to date and current with regard to AI enabled networking. I believe the HPE-Juniper deal would actually have created more competition in the networking market.\u201d\n\nShelley said he believes the deal would result in Cisco focusing more on innovating in its core networking business, especially given its stepped up focus on the security market with its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk.\n\nIn fact, Shelley said he sees Cisco\u2019s bread and butter networking customers as the most negatively impacted if the HPE-Juniper deal is not completed.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Cisco customers feel Cisco has not been innovative with regard to its networking portfolio,\u201d said Shelley. \u201cThey see it as the same old, same old and were looking at HPE Juniper as a much-needed shot in the arm to get Cisco to be more innovative in networking.\u201d\n\nCisco did not respond to CRN\u2019s request for comment by publication time.\n\nHPE-Juniper Deal In Limbo\n\nPartners said Cisco has had a dominant market share position in the overall networking market for three decades. The DOJ in its lawsuit focused on the WLAN market, claiming that the proposed transaction, if allowed to proceed, would result in a post-merger HPE-Juniper and Cisco commanding over 70 percent of the market.\n\nHPE, in a response to the DOJ lawsuit, did not single out Cisco but claimed that the \u201callegations ignore well capitalized competitors in the U.S. \u2013 several of which hold market share comparable to Juniper and one which holds more than 50 percent market share.\u201d\n\nHPE CEO Antonio Neri, for his part, has said that the combined HPE-Juniper business market share would be below 20 percent in a total addressable market opportunity that goes from $35 billion to $40 billion to $135 billion. \u201cSo we more than triple the addressable market and the combined business is still below 20 percent market share which means the runway is pretty significant,\u201d he told Barclays Global Technology Conference attendees in December.\n\nEven with the addition of Juniper Networks, Cisco\u2019s networking business is nearly three times the size of the HPE-Juniper combination.\n\nFor its 2024 fiscal year, Cisco\u2019s networking segment, which includes its core switching and routing businesses, posted revenues of $29.23 billion, a 15 percent decline compared to FY 2023. HPE\u2019s Intelligent Edge revenue, which includes its Aruba business, sales were $4.53 billion for the company's 2024 fiscal year, which was down from $5.38 from the prior-year period. Juniper Networks, meanwhile, posted fiscal year 2023 sales of $5.56 billion up five percent from $5.30 billion in Fiscal year 2022.\n\nSolution providers said that should the lawsuit stick, it won\u2019t be good news for HPE.\n\n\u201cThis will hurt HPE more than it hurts Juniper, especially innovation-wise,\u201d the partner executive said.\n\nAnother solution provider that partners closely with both HPE and Cisco said that he didn\u2019t believe the deal would dilute competition or weaken innovation, as alleged by the DOJ.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s more to this and more going on, because every report I\u2019ve seen says there\u2019s still a really big gap between HPE and Cisco,\u201d the partner said.\n\n\u201cCisco must be chuckling right now,\u201d said the CEO of a major networking solution provider that works with HPE, Juniper Networks, and Cisco. \u201cThis lawsuit is totally baffling to me. How many acquisitions has Cisco made in the last 20 years to continue its market dominance? I\u2019m shocked. Cisco has been the dominant player in this market for three decades. If this holds it weakens competition against Cisco and will result in less innovation in the networking market.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said the lawsuit boosts Cisco\u2019s networking market stronghold and \u201cstaves off\u201d what would have been a \u201cformidable\u201d competitor to Cisco. \u201cThis is a great moment for Cisco,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO said he sees the cloud-managed Meraki wireless networking solution as much more robust and innovative than the HPE Aruba or Juniper Networks offerings. \u201cMeraki is almost a self-deploying kind of network, it is pretty easy to run,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very good product that is not over-the-top expensive. Meraki was one of the best acquisitions that Cisco has made in its history.\u201d\n\nCisco acquired Meraki in December 2012 for $1.2 billion.\n\nThe DOJ lawsuit is sure to give HPE and Juniper Networks customers \u201ccause to pause\u201d any potential HPE or Juniper purchases, said the CEO.\n\n\u201cThis was built up as a big deal that would change the network market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question for customers now is where do HPE and Juniper go from here?\u201d",

Along with this milestone, the company announces a significant leadership transition that ushers in a new era.\n\nAfter more than 50 years of dedication and leadership, Chairman Greg Hemmingsen announced his retirement. Greg\u2019s tenure at The CISCO Companies has been defined by his unwavering commitment to the company\u2019s values of quality, integrity and service.

More than 21 years ago Greg Hemmingsen gave me the chance to begin my career at CISCO. From starting in customer service to becoming an owner in 2016 and then President and CEO in 2020, I never imagined I would one day have the honor of becoming the sole owner of this incredible company. I am deeply grateful to Greg and the Hemmingsen family for their trust and mentorship.\u201d\n\nAs CISCO celebrates its 60th year, Natalie is focused on building upon the company\u2019s strong foundation, fostering innovation and maintaining the values that have made CISCO a leader in the seed industry.\n\n\u201c It will forever be my goal to make the Hemmingsen family proud and to carry forward the legacy of excellence they established 60 years ago,\u201d Natalie added. \u201c I am honored to lead The CISCO Companies into the future and ensure its continued success for generations to come.\u201d\n\nAbout The CISCO Companies\n\nFamily-owned and founded in 1965, The CISCO Companies in Indianapolis, Indiana is a full-service distributor serving Midwestern independent retailers.

A planner agent decomposes business requirements into specific build tasks, while ServiceNow agents coordinate with Salesforce and Hubspot systems for deployment. Infrastructure agents from Cisco and Microsoft simultaneously validate security, identity and access, costs, and SLO compliance. This all requires sophisticated agent-to-agent reasoning and without open standards, each of these interactions becomes a custom integration project.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty straightforward example, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting into.

For example, Microsoft has talked about how AI agents will impact application development.\n\nIBM, too, in a recent report wrote: \u201cAgentic AI is quickly transforming the role of individual contributors. As simple AI assistants are supplemented by AI agents with more advanced capabilities, employees will need to manage entire teams of agents that are completing tasks autonomously\u2014and learn how to work with chat-based supervisory AI agents that can help streamline this process.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018third wave\u2019 of AI promises to transform workflows wholesale.7 In fact, nine in 10 executives now say their organization\u2019s workflows will be digitized with intelligent automation and AI assistants by 2026\u2014and 77% of executives believe gen AI will enable connected assets to make autonomous decisions by 2026. Executives also report that the volume of decision-making by digital assistants will increase by 21% in the next two years due to generative AI. This will have huge implications for operating models, as organizations must create new structures that give employees oversight over autonomous decision-making\u2014and manage the new risks it creates,\u201d IBM stated.\n\nOutshift\u2019s vision for Internet of Agents\n\nThe Internet of Agents will address these challenges, Pandey said.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d. -President Donald Trump, as reported on Reuters.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American technology company that provides information technology and networking services. On January 28, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Karl Ackerman upgraded the stock to \u201cOutperform\u201d from Neutral with a price target of $72, up from $57. According to the firm, several catalysts are playing out in favor of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). These catalysts have the potential to boost Cicso\u2019s revenue and earnings growth ahead of expectations. The analyst also told investors in a research note that ethernet \u201cwill start to flourish\u201d in backend artificial intelligence networks this year. As such, the firm is \u201cencouraged\u201d to see Cisco\u2019s growing presence at Meta Platforms with the 8501 switches that should begin to ramp in volume in Q1.\n\nOverall, CSCO ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Published 01-29-25 Submitted by Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from our FY24 Purpose Report, celebrating 40 years of impact at Cisco.\n\nA lot has happened in 40 years of technology: the Internet, mobile, social media, cloud computing, AI. Securely powering that technology has only grown more critical\u2014and more complex\u2014over time. That\u2019s where Cisco comes in.\n\nWe build and deliver technology that powers the world\u2019s connectivity, whether that\u2019s between computers, throughout communities, or across continents. And that work has never been more critical than today, in the age of AI.\n\nAs CEO Chuck Robbins shared, \u201cAI and its limitless possibilities will impact every organization, industry, community and person\u2014reimagining the world in countless ways. Connection, security, and data will be paramount in realizing AI\u2019s potential, as will innovating in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable way.\u201d\n\nThe following are just a few of the many ways that Cisco integrates AI into its strategy, products, and services:\n\nAI in the Workplace\n\nCisco is turning its cutting-edge AI technology internally to support our employees. In fiscal 2024, we launched BridgeIT, a Cisco Enterprise Chat AI that is fully integrated within Webex suite solutions. BridgeIT can help answer questions about Cisco products, offer support solutions, and even develop presentation outlines.\n\nEmployees are also leveraging AI to shape the way teams work together. This year, we launched \u201cTeaming with AI,\u201d a pilot program that enabled teams to experiment with new ways of working to drive their productivity and efficiency. We also hosted an \u201cInnoVerse: AI\u201d hackathon, challenging employees to find new ways to leverage AI in their roles, while also receiving training and guidance along the way.\n\nAdvancing Skills with AI\n\nAI is accelerating the pace of change for the global workforce, presenting an opportunity for individuals to advance their skills. Cisco Networking Academy develops and partners with industry leaders to offer engaging, self-paced AI learning content, like AI Fundamentals with IBM SkillsBuild, that teaches the basics of AI to empower our learners with new skills that are reshaping the future of work. We also led the launch of the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium with Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP to assess AI\u2019s impact on technology jobs and identify skills development pathways. The collaborative effort enables these organizations to coalesce insights, recommend action plans, and act on findings, so that the AI revolution leaves no one behind.\n\nUsing AI in Security Response\n\nSince the beginning, we have used AI and machine learning (ML) to create security detections at scale and to assist security analysts. We use ML in spam detection, email classification, malicious domains, and more. Our latest ML-based system, SnortML, detects variations in attacks and automatically blocks them at the source.

This includes $16 million guaranteed.\n\nIf Cisco's actual contract does land in this ballpark, his average annual contract value of $9 million would make him the 14th highest-paid safety in 2025 and he would rank 12nd in guaranteed money at the position.\n\nCisco was a third-round pick by the Jaguars in the 2021 NFL draft. His ball production throughout his career has been impressive and that will certainly draw the attention of other teams once free agency arrives.\n\nOver the last three seasons, Cisco has generated 11 pass breakups and eight interceptions. In his career, quarterbacks have a below average passer rating of 92.0 when targeting him.\n\nWhether or not the Jaguars bring Cisco back, they'll still need to address the secondary as a whole. Last season, the Jaguars' pass defense ranked 24th in completion rate, 30th in interceptions, and 30th in yards per attempt, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nObviously, if Cisco does head elsewhere, that need in the secondary only increases. Under contract at the safety position for the Jaguars in 2025 are Darnell Savage, Andrew Wingard, Daniel Thomas, and Antonio Johnson.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Education Data Security - Global Strategic Business Report\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Education Data Security was valued at US$780.8 Million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$1.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.3% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Are Regulations Shaping Education Data Security?\n\n\n\nThe regulatory landscape for data security in education is becoming increasingly complex as governments and institutions work to protect student privacy in the digital age. In the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) governs the privacy of student educational records, setting strict guidelines on data sharing and access. Compliance with FERPA means that educational institutions must have strong data protection measures in place, as even unintentional disclosures can lead to penalties. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a similar impact, influencing educational institutions worldwide that handle the data of EU citizens. GDPR not only mandates that organizations secure personal data but also introduces penalties for non-compliance, raising the stakes for educational institutions already under budget constraints. Consequently, these regulations drive schools and universities to adopt higher data security standards, despite limited resources and technical capacity.\n\n\n\nHowever, keeping up with regulatory requirements poses significant challenges, especially for institutions without sufficient funding or specialized cybersecurity knowledge. Compliance with laws such as FERPA, GDPR, and others that govern specific data types (e.g., HIPAA for health data) requires robust data governance frameworks. Many educational institutions are now turning to automated compliance solutions, third-party audits, and enhanced data encryption as ways to streamline compliance and reduce the risk of costly penalties. Additionally, data privacy regulations have spurred the demand for transparency and accountability within institutions, as students and their families become more aware of their rights. This push for transparency has led to better data management practices and increased investment in cybersecurity tools specifically designed to meet regulatory standards. However, meeting these evolving regulatory demands remains an ongoing challenge, requiring continuous improvements to data governance practices and ongoing training for faculty and staff.\n\n\n\nWhy Is Technology Essential for Data Security in Education?\n\n\n\nIn today's educational landscape, technology plays a crucial role in securing data across schools, colleges, and online platforms. Advanced data protection technologies, such as encryption, ensure that data remains secure whether stored on servers or transmitted across networks. By encrypting student data, institutions can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and prevent cybercriminals from intercepting valuable information. Additionally, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security, requiring users to verify their identities through multiple steps, significantly reducing unauthorized login attempts. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has further bolstered educational cybersecurity, enabling institutions to identify and respond to threats in real-time. These AI-based tools can recognize patterns of abnormal activity and alert administrators, allowing for a proactive approach to data security that is essential in today's fast-evolving threat landscape.\n\n\n\nBeyond traditional cybersecurity measures, institutions are also turning to emerging technologies to address unique challenges in data security. For instance, blockchain technology is being explored as a way to secure student records and academic credentials, as its decentralized and tamper-proof nature helps ensure data integrity. Cloud-based security solutions are equally vital as institutions increasingly adopt cloud platforms for storage and collaboration. By deploying robust cloud security solutions, educational institutions can protect sensitive data from unauthorized access while benefiting from the scalability and flexibility of cloud services. Furthermore, cloud security enables institutions to manage data access effectively, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify sensitive information. The integration of these advanced technologies is essential for educational institutions to protect student data and meet the expectations of regulators, parents, and students who demand that their information is handled with the highest level of security.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Driving Growth in the Education Data Security Market?\n\n\n\nThe growth in the education data security market is driven by several factors, primarily the increasing adoption of digital learning tools and the growing prevalence of cyber-attacks targeting educational institutions. As classrooms become more digital, institutions rely heavily on online platforms, cloud services, and mobile devices, all of which create new vulnerabilities and increase the need for secure data management solutions. The shift toward remote and hybrid learning, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has further intensified the demand for cybersecurity solutions that can protect data in various virtual learning environments. Additionally, the rising awareness of privacy concerns among parents, students, and educators has put pressure on educational institutions to adopt advanced data security measures. This awareness has translated into a demand for solutions that not only meet regulatory standards but also provide a level of transparency that builds trust in digital education platforms.\n\n\n\nTechnological advancements, regulatory pressure, and evolving consumer expectations are all significant drivers in the expansion of the education data security market. For instance, innovations in AI and machine learning allow educational institutions to automate threat detection and response, which is critical for managing the high volume of potential cyber threats they face. Similarly, the adoption of cloud-based security platforms enables institutions to scale their security operations while maintaining flexibility in managing data access. Regulations such as GDPR and FERPA have also prompted institutions to invest in compliance-focused security measures, ensuring they meet legal obligations. Furthermore, the rise of e-learning platforms has created long-term demand for data security solutions, as institutions strive to protect sensitive information while delivering education in a virtual format. This intersection of technological evolution, consumer expectations, and regulatory demands underscores the critical need for a robust education data security market that can adapt to future challenges.\n\n\n\nScope of the Study\n\n\n\nThe report analyzes the Education Data Security market, presented in terms of market value (US$ Thousand).

Global Practices: In many countries, including the US, the 6GHz spectrum has been delicensed, allowing non-telecom companies to operate in this band and offer services like WiFi-6.\n\nGoogle, Meta, Microsoft, and Cisco are considering legal action against the Indian government's decision to auction the lower 6GHz spectrum band for telecom services instead of delicensing it for broader WiFi and AI applications.The tech companies believe that the combined economic benefit of delicensing the 6GHz spectrum and the innovation it would foster would be much higher than the one-off revenue from an auction.",

That's where Cisco comes in.\n\nWe build and deliver technology that powers the world's connectivity, whether that's between computers, throughout communities, or across continents. And that work has never been more critical than today, in the age of AI.\n\nAs CEO Chuck Robbins shared, \"AI and its limitless possibilities will impact every organization, industry, community and person-reimagining the world in countless ways. Connection, security, and data will be paramount in realizing AI's potential, as will innovating in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable way.\"\n\nThe following are just a few of the many ways that Cisco integrates AI into its strategy, products, and services:\n\nAI in the Workplace\n\nCisco is turning its cutting-edge AI technology internally to support our employees. In fiscal 2024, we launched BridgeIT, a Cisco Enterprise Chat AI that is fully integrated within Webex suite solutions. BridgeIT can help answer questions about Cisco products, offer support solutions, and even develop presentation outlines.\n\nEmployees are also leveraging AI to shape the way teams work together. This year, we launched \"Teaming with AI,\" a pilot program that enabled teams to experiment with new ways of working to drive their productivity and efficiency. We also hosted an \"InnoVerse: AI\" hackathon, challenging employees to find new ways to leverage AI in their roles, while also receiving training and guidance along the way.\n\nAdvancing Skills with AI\n\nAI is accelerating the pace of change for the global workforce, presenting an opportunity for individuals to advance their skills. Cisco Networking Academy develops and partners with industry leaders to offer engaging, self-paced AI learning content, like AI Fundamentals with IBM SkillsBuild, that teaches the basics of AI to empower our learners with new skills that are reshaping the future of work. We also led the launch of the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium with Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP to assess AI's impact on technology jobs and identify skills development pathways. The collaborative effort enables these organizations to coalesce insights, recommend action plans, and act on findings, so that the AI revolution leaves no one behind.",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company's business model has evolved with subscriptions accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco's portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco's security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco's prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Abbott have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. +18.6%).

The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

            "content": "Imagine going to the doctor after you break your leg. He quickly diagnoses the problem but refuses to put a cast on your leg. Instead, he prescribes painkillers and therapy. It doesn\u2019t matter how skilled he is at applying those treatments. You would leave thinking he was a quack because he refused to address the obvious problem.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar is doing something similar with the state\u2019s elections.\n\nNevada\u2019s election results should be released faster, but measures that legislative Democrats have passed regarding mail ballots make that impossible. Look at last year\u2019s Senate race. After election night, Republican Sam Brown had a lead against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. That lead evaporated as officials received and counted more ballots. The Associated Press didn\u2019t declare Rosen the winner until late Friday evening, three days later.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a one-off. A similar scenario unfolded in 2022. Republican challenger Adam Laxalt had a 2-percentage-point lead the day after the election. On the Friday after the election, he still had a narrow lead over Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. The AP didn\u2019t call that race for Ms. Cortez Masto until Saturday.\n\nThese delays are an embarrassment. As a swing state, Nevada regularly receives outsized national attention. The long wait makes Nevada look dysfunctional. And it\u2019s cold comfort that California\u2019s vote counting takes even longer.\n\nFortunately, quicker counting is possible. Florida, which is seven times larger than Nevada in population, released almost all of its November election results within a few hours of the polls closing. Like Nevada, it has mail ballots, early voting and Election Day voting. But it requires mail ballots be turned in by 7 p.m. on Election Day. In Nevada, mail ballots can trickle in for four days after the election and still be counted.\n\nThat\u2019s the fundamental problem. Yet, there\u2019s no evidence Mr. Aguilar wants to solve it. Instead, he wants to make the counting of late-arriving ballots more efficient. That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s beside the point. Officials can\u2019t count ballots that they don\u2019t have in hand.\n\nSadly, it looks as if Mr. Aguilar, a Democrat, is prioritizing politics over common sense. Democrats believe their partisans are more likely to vote by mail, so they\u2019re just fine allowing ballots to be counted even if they\u2019re received after Election Day. But it\u2019s just as likely that voters would easily adapt to the new deadline.\n\nGov. Joe Lombardo wants a bipartisan approach to ensuring faster election results. Mr. Aguilar shouldn\u2019t stand in the way. He should join with the governor to make that happen. The solution is obvious.",

(CSCO) designs, manufactures, and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry. With a market cap of $245.5 billion, the company offers enterprise network security, software development, data collaboration, cloud computing, and other related services. The technology giant is expected to announce its fiscal second-quarter earnings for 2025 on Wednesday, Feb. 12.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect CSCO to report a profit of $0.74 per share on a diluted basis, up 2.8% from $0.72 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect CSCO to report EPS of $2.97, down 4.8% from $3.12 in fiscal 2024. However, its EPS is expected to rise 6.7% year over year to $3.17 in fiscal 2026.\n\nCSCO stock has underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 25.8% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 20.2% during this period. However, it outperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 19.8% gains over the same time frame.\n\nCSCO has faced challenges, including a decrease in networking revenues, hesitant capital spending due to economic uncertainty, and rising competition from industry rivals. The company has also struggled with slow demand from telecommunications and cable service providers, along with excess inventory, which has impacted investor confidence.\n\nOn Nov. 13, CSCO shares closed up marginally after reporting its Q1 results. Its adjusted EPS of $0.91 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.87. The company\u2019s revenue was $13.84 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $13.76 billion. CSCO expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.60 to $3.66, and expects revenue to be between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus opinion on CSCO stock is moderately bullish, with a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of 21 analysts covering the stock, eight advise a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, two suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and 11 give a \u201cHold.\u201d CSCO\u2019s average analyst price target is $63.89, indicating a potential upside of 2.7% from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and The Coca-Cola Co. (KO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Today's Featured Research Reports Cisco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +23.9%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscriptions accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base. The buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition. (You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> ) Shares of Abbott have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. +18.6%). The company\u2019s pipeline is unlocking new growth opportunities, supporting the company\u2019s positive momentum and strong growth outlook for 2025. Freestyle Libre, Lingo and Libre Rio CGM devices are on a great trajectory. Alinity, the company\u2019s next-generation suite of systems, is a key driver in the core lab diagnostics business. The company is optimistic about its latest progress with biosimilars and expects this to significantly boost EPD sales, beginning 2025. Within Nutrition, despite softness in its international pediatric segment, Abbott is regaining market share banking on a strong Adult Nutrition business. Yet the significant runoff of COVID-19 testing-related sales is hurting Abbott\u2019s Diagnostics growth. Headwinds such as tough macro conditions and foreign exchange also add to the worry. (You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>> ) Coca-Cola\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+6.3% vs. -4.6%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evident by its strong track record of beating expectations. In third-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the seventh consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement. Results benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. KO is well-poised to benefit from its marketing and innovation strategies, and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024. It expects organic revenue growth of 10% for 2024, with comparable EPS to grow 5-6%. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.

This vulnerability potentially offered cybercriminals admin rights.\n\nBased on a report from bug hunter Ben Leonard-Lagarde, working at UK-based Modux, Cisco has fixed this vulnerability, called CVE-2025-20156. The flaw involved incorrect authorization for REST API users in the on-premises video conferencing solution Cisco Meeting Server.\n\nAttack path\n\nThe vulnerability was easy to exploit. Cybercriminals could use API requests with low privileges to gain access to a specific endpoint. Through privilege escalation, they gained admin rights to the edge nodes of the Cisco Meeting Server infrastructure, which are managed through the management tool. This provided opportunities to penetrate further into the corporate network.\n\nUrgent patching required\n\nThis vulnerability is serious because almost all versions of Cisco Meeting Management are vulnerable. According to Cisco, device configuration makes no difference. No workaround is available, but a patch has now been released and users are strongly advised to install it.\n\nVersions 3.8 and earlier : Users should migrate to a patched version.\n\n: Users should migrate to a patched version. Version 3.9 : Users should upgrade to version 3.9.1.\n\n: Users should upgrade to version 3.9.1.

She was born on December 11, 1937, in Canton to the late Albert and Mildred (Staneart) Manist. Alanna married Gene A. Bush on December 1, 1956, and he preceded her in death on January 25, 2009.\n\nAlanna is lovingly survived by her daughter, Alissa (David) Gray of Fort Recovery, Ohio; her daughter-in-law, Shannon Bush of Hernet, California; her grandchildren, Ryan (Hanna) Gray of Mainesville, Ohio, Andrew Gray of Fort Recovery, Cassandra (Morgan) Boyle of Piqua, Tarah (Jonathan) Novotny of Utah, Hannah Forsberg of Utah, Jared Forsberg of Utah, and Dylan Forsberg of Idaho; as well as her great-grandchildren, Levi Gray, Carmen Boyle, Payson Novotny, Luke Novotny, and Christopher Aliff.\n\nShe was also preceded in death by her son, Eric Bush, who passed away on February 9, 2009.\n\nA proud 1955 graduate of McKinley Senior High School in Canton, Alanna was a devoted homemaker who lovingly raised her children. Once they were grown, she worked as a real estate agent for Marks and Taylor Realtors in Louisville, Ohio, for several years. Alanna was a faithful member of Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina and actively participated in the Celina Garden Club.\n\nAlanna, a devoted animal lover, found great joy in the company of her beloved cats, Cookie and Baby. Her passions extended beyond her pets; she cherished long walks by the lake, indulged in cooking, and in earlier years, took pride in showing and breeding cats. One of the greatest joys of her life was spending time with her family, especially her grandchildren, and she deeply valued the fellowship of her church community. Alanna was known for her quick wit, her classy demeanor, and her ability to tell a good joke.

            "content": "Cisco, formerly known as Cisco Systems, Inc. is a US-based multinational digital communication company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

And with a world-class collection of experts, the event shed some much-needed clarity on a wide range of AI-related developments. That included everything from industry applications and forthcoming innovations to ethics, governance, and societal implications. Not to mention, a groundbreaking product release from Cisco.

It has been described as a privilege escalation flaw in the REST API of Cisco Meeting Management.\n\n\"This vulnerability exists because proper authorization is not enforced upon REST API users,\" the company said in a Wednesday advisory. \"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a specific endpoint.\"\n\n\"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrator-level control over edge nodes that are managed by Cisco Meeting Management.\"\n\nThe networking equipment major credited Ben Leonard-Lagarde of Modux for reporting the security shortcoming. It affects the following versions of the product irrespective of device configuration -\n\nCisco Meeting Management release version 3.9 (Patched in 3.9.1)\n\nCisco Meeting Management release versions 3.8 and earlier (Migrate to a fixed release)\n\nCisco Meeting Management release version 3.10 (Not vulnerable)\n\nCisco has also released patches to remediate a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw affecting BroadWorks that stems from improper memory handling for certain Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests (CVE-2025-20165, CVSS score: 7.5). The issue has been fixed in version RI.2024.11.\n\n\"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of SIP requests to an affected system,\" it said.\n\n\"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory that was allocated to the Cisco BroadWorks Network Servers that handle SIP traffic. If no memory is available, the Network Servers can no longer process incoming requests, resulting in a DoS condition that requires manual intervention to recover.\"\n\nA third vulnerability patched by Cisco is CVE-2025-20128 (CVSS score: 5.3), an integer underflow bug impacting the Object Linking and Embedding 2 (OLE2) decryption routine of ClamAV that could also result in a DoS condition.\n\nThe company, which acknowledged Google OSS-Fuzz for reporting the flaw, said it's aware of the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code, although there is no evidence it has been maliciously exploited in the wild.\n\nCISA and FBI Detail Ivanti Exploit Chains\n\nNews of Cisco flaws comes as the U.S. government's cybersecurity and law enforcement agencies released technical details of two exploit chains weaponized by nation-state hacking crews to break into Ivanti's cloud service applications in September 2024.\n\nThe vulnerabilities in question are as follows -\n\nCVE-2024-8963, an administrative bypass vulnerability\n\nCVE-2024-9379, a SQL injection vulnerability\n\nCVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380, two remote code execution vulnerabilities\n\nThe attack sequences, per the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), involved the abuse of CVE-2024-8963 in conjunction with CVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380 in one case, and CVE-2024-8963 and CVE-2024-9379 in the other.\n\nIt's worth noting that the first exploit chain was disclosed by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs in October 2024. In at least one instance, the threat actors are believed to have conducted lateral movement after gaining an initial foothold.\n\nThe second exploit chain has been found to leverage CVE-2024-8963 in combination with CVE-2024-9379 to obtain access to the target network, followed by unsuccessful attempts to implant web shells for persistence.\n\n\"Threat actors chained the listed vulnerabilities to gain initial access, conduct remote code execution (RCE), obtain credentials, and implant web shells on victim networks,\" the agencies said. \"Credentials and sensitive data stored within the affected Ivanti appliances should be considered compromised.",

Yet, Pandey believes that this could lead to what he refers to as \u201cwalled gardens\u201d (isolated systems).\n\nFor example, if a Salesforce agent doesn\u2019t communicate with an Adobe agent, inefficiencies will bubble to the surface.\n\n\u201cWall gardens or overarching agents may exist, but they don\u2019t derive maximum value for every entity,\u201d said Pandey.\n\n\u201cWe want value for vendors, developers, operators, and customers.\n\nBuilding an open, interoperable system ensures we avoid a \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 super-agent and instead create a distributed framework.\n\nPandey\u2019s Lord of the Rings reference relates to the idea of \u201cOne Agent to Rule Them All\u201d.\n\nHowever, for Cisco, a distributed model is the preferred strategy, as it maximizes value and ensures no single entity dominates the ecosystem.\n\nA Rising Tide\n\nFor Pandey, a significant benefit of an Internet of Agents is in the cross-collaborative opportunities that it could bring.\n\nAs an example, the Cisco SVP suggests that AlphaFold\u2019s protein folding tech and OpenAI\u2019s language processing capabilities could combine with robotic entities to help with drug discovery.\n\nAnother advantage to an internet/network system is that it encourages more vendors to join, which provides customers with a greater variety of solutions and platforms to choose from.\n\nThis also behooves stakeholders, as the value will grow as more and more agents join the system, as Pandey explains:\n\nHistorically, many vendors believed walled gardens protected their base. But when industries embrace openness, they create rising tides and bigger opportunities for everyone.\n\nIn closing his conversation with Kerravala, the Cisco man had some specific advice for vendors and customers.\n\nFor the former, he encouraged providers to embrace interoperability and participate in defining and building the open system to ensure long-term success \u2013 or else they run the risk of becoming obsolete.\n\nFor the latter, he strongly urged customers to not accept isolated offerings but to demand interoperable and open solutions from vendors to maximize the value of AI agents in their workflows.\n\nWhat an Internet of Agents Could Look Like\n\nThe idea of AI agents from different sectors and vendors all working together across multiple companies sounds transformative but can be difficult to picture.\n\nWith the technology still in relative infancy, it is surprising how many different AI agents are already on the market.\n\nConsider customer experience. There are lots of use cases here. For instance, consider a post-purchase assistance agent that offers support by sending setup instructions, scheduling tutorial calls, or suggesting accessories for smart devices.\n\nMeanwhile, in customer service, agents may autonomously tag customer contacts with intent, create new knowledge articles, and interact autonomously with customers.\n\nThen, think about the broader customer experience. For instance, a brand could create an AI agent that creates personalized travel itineraries based on customer history, booking experiences, and restaurants to simplify planning and enhance the journey.\n\nOverall, there are thousands of possible use cases in customer experience and many more across the enterprise.\n\nGiven this, an Internet of Agents that allows businesses to scout, test, and deploy agents may be the next-best technology platform.",

The organization is focused on developing solutions to strengthen the economy and expand opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, Robbins brings two decades of experience at Cisco, where he has been promoted 12 times. He started as an account manager and advanced through roles such as operations director of U.S. channels sales and several senior vice president positions. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has served as Cisco\u2019s chairman and CEO since 2015.\n\nTwo years later, he was elected chair of Cisco\u2019s board.\n\nRobbins\u2019 current responsibilities involve positioning Cisco as a key player in helping companies worldwide embrace digital innovation to drive connectivity, security, and automation. Most recently, Cisco AI Defense was launched, and it is described as a tool that will create \u201cend-to-end safety and security protections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrganizations that are slow to embrace AI will struggle to stay relevant, and the hashtag #AI landscape is growing increasingly difficult to manage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for organizations to have a common framework for AI security, to move faster and unlock the value of AI without sacrificing security or overspending,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cAI Defense is solving two major vulnerabilities for AI: AI application development, protecting AI systems from attacks, and AI access, preventing data leakage and poisoning of proprietary data\u2026Thank you, Jeetu Patel, DJ Sampath, and the team, for your dedication to building such an important product and bringing it to market for our customers!\u201d\n\nDiversity is essential for addressing a broader range of challenges and uncovering more inclusive, effective solutions when developing and launching technologies such as AI. Yet, the DEI landscape faces significant setbacks, with major companies like McDonald\u2019s, Meta, and Walmart scaling back their DEI policies. Adding to these challenges, CBS News reports that President Donald Trump\u2019s first executive order upon returning to the Oval Office was an initiative to dismantle DEI programs across the federal government.\n\nIn contrast, Robbins remains steadfast in his commitment to advancing DEI efforts.\n\n\u201cI think the pendulum swings a little wide in both directions. And for us, it\u2019s about finding the equilibrium\u2026You cannot argue with the fact that a diverse workforce is better. There\u2019s too much business value,\u201d Robbins said in an interview with Axios. \u201cIt\u2019s being discussed like it\u2019s a single-issue discussion, and you either believe it or you don\u2019t. And in reality, it\u2019s made up of 150 different things, and maybe seven of them got a little out of hand. I think those six or seven things are going to get solved and then you\u2019re going to be left with common sense. But the core reasons that you have a diverse workforce are still there from a business perspective.\u201d",

He has a vested interest in driving consensus among his fellow CEOs on trade policy, then taking it to the Trump administration.\n\nCisco entered the Chinese market in 1994 and established its Greater China division in 2010. The company employs about 4,000 people in China and has branches in 16 cities. The teams are mostly engaged in sales, customer support, R&D, business process operations, and IT sourcing.\n\nProduct revenue fell 35% in China for the fiscal year 2024 amid fierce competition.\n\nRobbins says Cisco's China business is \"virtually immaterial\" to the company's performance. Rather, he's more concerned about using his pulpit at the Business Roundtable to ensure Trump's expiring tax cuts on businesses and households are extended.\n\n\"You've got to do taxes this year, because there's a lot of them expiring and if we don't do them, there's trillions of dollars in tax increases for American citizens,\" Robbins added.\n\nFor now, investors appear to be ignoring what a US trade war would mean to a multinational such as Cisco.\n\nAmid the budding momentum of AI infrastructure products, Cisco's stock has begun to perk up after being largely dead money for the past year due to several challenging quarters.\n\nShares of the networking giant are up nearly 9% in the past three months, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 5% advance.

Nvidia is up a sizzling 151%.\n\nThe stock's recent resurgence stems from better-than-expected first fourth quarter earnings in mid-November.

            "snippet": "Cisco has issued a security advisory about a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Cisco Meeting Management REST API, affecting all versions up to 3.8.",
            "score": 0.93533855676651,

            "content": "Cisco has issued a security advisory regarding a critical privilege escalation vulnerability found in Cisco Meeting Management. The vulnerability is tied to the REST API component of the platform, and if exploited, it could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges from a low-level authenticated user to an administrator.\n\nThis issue has the potential to compromise the security of the affected devices, granting unauthorized access to sensitive features and settings.\n\nCisco Meeting Management: Advisory Overview\n\nThe vulnerability, identified by advisory ID cisco-sa-cmm-privesc-uy2Vf8pc, was first published on January 22, 2025, at 16:00 GMT. The issue is classified as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.9, indicating the severity of the threat. The vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2025-20156 and is linked to Cisco Bug ID CSCwi88558.\n\nThe problem stems from improper authorization enforcement on the REST API in Cisco Meeting Management. Specifically, the lack of sufficient validation means that a remote, authenticated attacker with low-level privileges can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a specific endpoint.\n\nIf successful, the attacker could gain administrator-level access to the device, potentially taking full control of edge nodes managed by Cisco Meeting Management.\n\nAffected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of Cisco Meeting Management. Regardless of device configuration, any system running an affected version is vulnerable. For users of Cisco Meeting Management, it is crucial to check whether their current software release is impacted.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThe issue is present in Cisco Meeting Management releases up to and including version 3.8. Cisco has provided updates to address the flaw in version 3.9.1. Notably, version 3.10 is not vulnerable to this privilege escalation issue.\n\nExploitation Details\n\nExploitation of the vulnerability occurs when a low-privileged authenticated user sends crafted API requests to certain endpoints in the REST API. These requests bypass the intended authorization checks, leading to the elevation of the attacker\u2019s privileges. A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute administrative commands, potentially compromising the device\u2019s security and integrity.\n\nAs of the advisory\u2019s release, there have been no reports of public exploitation or malicious use of this vulnerability. However, due to its severity, Cisco strongly urges affected users to update their systems as soon as possible.\n\nNo Workarounds Available\n\nUnfortunately, there are no workarounds for mitigating this vulnerability. Cisco has emphasized that the only way to address the issue is through a software update. Therefore, organizations using Cisco Meeting Management should prioritize updating to the fixed software versions outlined in the advisory.\n\nCisco\u2019s Response\n\nTo address the vulnerability, Cisco has released software updates for affected versions of Cisco Meeting Management. The following is the guidance for upgrading:\n\nCisco Meeting Management 3.8 and earlier : Users should migrate to a fixed release, such a s version 3.9.1.\n\nCisco Meeting Management 3.9 : Upgrade t o version 3.9.1.\n\nCisco Meeting Management 3.10 : This version is not affected and does not require any updates.\n\nFor customers who do not have a service contract or those unable to obtain updates through normal channels, Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to get assistance with obtaining the necessary software fixes.\n\nWhat Affected Users Should Do\n\nUsers should check the Fixed Software section of the advisory to ensure they are using an updated, secure version. Customers with service contracts can access updates through the usual channels. However, those without service contracts should reach out directly to Cisco TAC for support.\n\nIt is essential to note that customers are only eligible for free security updates for the versions and feature sets they have purchased. To obtain these updates, customers need to have a valid license from Cisco or an authorized reseller.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in the Cisco Meeting Management REST API is a critical security issue with potentially severe consequences. Organizations should prioritize updating their systems to the latest fixed releases to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and control. As no workarounds are available, upgrading to a secure version remains the only solution for those affected.",

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-21, Cisco Systems Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $43.19. It's currently trading at a price of $60.23. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -39.45%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Cisco Systems Inc\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Cisco Systems Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $3.53 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 5.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 27.5 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 15.69 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 43.19\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $32.84. This valuation indicates that the Cisco Systems Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -83.4%.

            "content": "Cisco, formerly known as Cisco Systems, Inc. is a US-based multinational digital communication company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

            "content": "Henry Kissinger reputedly asked who to call if he wanted to speak to Europe. If you need to get corporate America on the line right now, Chuck Robbins is your man. For the past year, Cisco\u2019s chair and chief executive officer has also chaired the Business Roundtable, Washington\u2019s premier CEO conclave, making him a key interpreter for a business community looking to navigate Donald Trump\u2019s return to power.\n\nThe Georgia-born former basketball player has not yet joined the list of CEOs paying court to the new president. But his advice to his peers on how to deal with Trump echoes their strategy: \u201cEngagement, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nDealing with Trump\n\nThe new administration seems to enjoy dealing with the business community, Robbins says, not mentioning the contrast with Joe Biden. \u201cWe won\u2019t always agree\u2026 but I feel confident that we\u2019ll have an opportunity to have that discussion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhat does Trump 2.0 really mean for business? Will he unleash economic dynamism or, as some critics fear, undermine the rule of law on which companies depend? Robbins sees only a \u201cvery pro-business\u201d administration that understands commercial success is \u201cthe backbone of what makes this country great.\u201d\n\nThat, he adds, underpins CEOs\u2019 optimism. After the high turnover in Trump\u2019s first term, he also thinks the like-minded team now stepping into cabinet roles will stick around, giving executives a chance to build a more lasting rapport.\n\nTrump\u2019s brand is confrontation, but Robbins is projecting calm, citing the new administration\u2019s less \u201cideological\u201d approach to mergers and acquisitions as cause for hope that it will be open to compromise. At the same time, he is subtly reminding it of what business thinks pragmatism should mean. Even on tariffs, \u201cthe real wild card\u201d whose supply chain and inflationary impacts CEOs fear, he urges Republicans to apply them \u201csurgically\u201d so as not to penalize US manufacturing.\n\nAD\n\nThe tariff debate is more than a routine policy disagreement: given that Biden kept most of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs in place, is it also a test of whether the business establishment is losing the argument on trade?\n\nRobbins demurs. \u201cWe will have to think through that when we see what\u2019s actually implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve gone through it once, and we\u2019ll all react appropriately and deal with it.\u201d\n\nWeathering the wokelash\n\nFree trade is not the only Business Roundtable article of faith that is under attack. Five years ago, it changed its longstanding position that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders. Its statement galvanized a consensus shift, boosting supporters of ideas like ESG investing or workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion. The backlash has been fierce but Robbins says the group he chairs is not planning a rewrite.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLook, you go through these waves,\u201d he says. \u201cThere will be times where society will beg us to do things and get and stay involved. There\u2019ll be times where they want us to stay out\u2026 the pendulum swings too far in one direction, it swings too far in the other direction, and the key is getting it back to equilibrium.\u201d\n\nRobbins has not been a prime target for those who think corporate America went woke. But the wokelash has been one more source of pressure for a generation of CEOs who, he says, have grown used to crises, from a pandemic to geopolitical turmoil.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a perspective where we say, \u2018Well, we should probably pause until things get back to normal.\u2019 This is normal,\u201d he observes. And that, he believes, makes his peer group less likely to slow investments in things like the networking equipment and security services Cisco sells.\n\nRiding the AI wave\n\nOur discussion took place at an AI-themed event Cisco threw for its customers in Palo Alto\u2019s Four Seasons hotel. The AI-powered revaluation of tech stocks has done little for Cisco, which is valued at $240 billion yet trades on much the same earnings multiple as two years ago. Its \u201cAI Summit,\u201d gathering executives from the likes of OpenAI and Groq, was part of a strategy to recast Cisco as an indispensable partner to customers who, its surveys suggest, still feel unsure how to prepare for the artificial intelligence era.\n\n\u201cThe AI revolution is moving into the enterprise. And I think this year is going to be a year where it really kicks in gear,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cWe understand the enterprise very deeply, and so we think we have a unique role to play.\u201d\n\nRobbins is cautious about promising any Nvidia-style transformation of Cisco\u2019s revenues \u2014 he lived through the dotcom bubble when his company\u2019s stock soared much as the chip group\u2019s has lately, before falling to earth. He learned then, he says, that \u201cwhen you\u2019re in a market that is just exploding, you can believe a lot of press clippings.\u201d But as his high school basketball coach taught him, \u201cThe only thing that matters is your execution.\u201d\n\nRobbins isn\u2019t about to swap his \u201cboring CEO\u201d suits for Jensen Huang\u2019s leather jackets \u2014 but he is playing to his company\u2019s strengths in networking and security. Externally, it\u2019s a chance to shift the market narrative around Cisco. Internally, there is an urgency to his message: AI is accelerating its core markets \u201cand we can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\nLeading questions\n\nTransmitting such messages to 90,000 employees is not easy. After almost a decade in charge, Robbins says he\u2019s learned the value of transparent, even blunt, communication. His regular all-hands video calls \u201ccan get pretty animated,\u201d he says, but they build trust.\n\n\u201cIf I have an answer that you\u2019re not going to like, I might say in advance you\u2019re not going to like it, but since you asked, here\u2019s the answer... I don\u2019t think you can run a company effectively and have the trust of your employees if you\u2019re not doing that. They can take the bad news if they just know you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d\n\nAs CEO, Robbins says he has so many external issues to deal with that \u201cit\u2019s easy to get out of the details\u201d of what is happening in the business. He has made a point lately of spending more time asking questions of customers, engineers, and sales teams.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is it matters when I go do a review on a product design. It matters when I go sit down with the sales team and talk to them about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cThose interactions inform the bigger decisions that we have to make.\u201d\n\nRobbins sweats the details, but not much else. \u201cSince I was a kid, I just don\u2019t worry about things that are outside my control that much. We plan for them. [But] if you can\u2019t control it, there\u2019s no sense in stressing over it,\u201d he says. \u201cAs much as I love this job, as much as I love everything I do every day, it doesn\u2019t define me.\u201d",

They cannot afford separate sets of AI security and safety guardrails for each app - they need a unified approach.\n\nMultiple capabilities\n\nCisco says AI Defense\u2019s capabilities include discovering AI (giving security teams insight into who is building applications, and which training sources they use), model validation (minimizing the risk of model tuning turning toxic through automated testing), runtime security (continuous validation which safeguards against potential safety and security threats such as prompt injection), and securing access to AI applications.\n\nThe company says AI Defense is \u201cself-optimizing\u201d, delivering controls for a multi-model world. Furthermore, it integrates with existing data flows, and is built into Security Cloud, Cisco\u2019s cross-domain security platform.\n\nThe new tool will become available to enterprises in March 2025.\n\n\"Business and technology leaders can\u2019t afford to sacrifice safety for speed when embracing AI,\u201d said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, Cisco. \"In a dynamic landscape where competition is fierce, speed decides the winners. Fused into the fabric of the network, Cisco AI Defense combines the unique ability to detect and protect against threats when developing and accessing AI applications without tradeoffs.\u201d\n\nAre you a pro?

Born on June 3, 1927, in Celina, she was the cherished daughter of the late Orie C. and Margaret J. (Fifer) Hight. On September 13, 1946, she married the love of her life, Leon P. Hanni, who preceded her in death on April 19, 2002.\n\nJune is lovingly remembered by her three devoted daughters: Lynn (William) Louthan of Fort Wayne, Jayne (Bill) Shady of Fort Wayne, and Dawn (Ed) Weirrick of Rockford. Her legacy lives on through her seven beloved grandchildren: Londa, Laura, Luke, Jamie, Melissa, Christopher, and Brett, as well as her seventeen great-grandchildren, who brought immense joy to her life. She is also survived by several nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her siblings and their spouses: Helen (Harold) Freeman, Ruth (Glen) Figley, and Owen Hight, each of whom she held dear.\n\nA proud 1945 graduate of Celina High School, June dedicated her life to her family as a loving homemaker. Once her children were grown, she found fulfillment working at Briarwood Village in Coldwater and later at Reynolds and Reynolds in Celina.\n\nJune was a long-time member of Grace Missionary Church in Celina, where her faith shone brightly. She sang in the church choir, taught Sunday School, and was an active member of the women\u2019s missionary society. Singing, gardening, and tending to her flowers brought her peace and happiness. Above all, June treasured her family, who will deeply miss her gentle spirit and the unconditional love she so freely gave.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, January 24, 2025, from 4:00 to 6:00 PM at Cisco Funeral Home in Celina.\n\nFuneral services will take place on Saturday, January 25, 2025, at 10:30 AM at Cisco Funeral Home, with Pastor Ken Meyer officiating. Friends and family are invited to gather an hour prior to the service, from 9:30 to 10:30 AM. She will be laid to rest beside her husband at Swamp College Cemetery in Celina.\n\nThe family kindly requests that memorial contributions be made to Grace Missionary Church or Grand Lake Hospice in June\u2019s honor.\n\nThe family is deeply grateful to Cisco Funeral Homes of Celina & St. Marys for their compassionate care.

To this end, regulation and policies governing the exploration of generative AI have remained slim at best, making its chances of veering off the rails extremely high.\n\nAI safety researcher and director of the Cyber Security Laboratory at the University of Louisville, Roman Yampolskiy, indicated that AI has a 99.999999% probability of ending humanity, according to p(doom), and the only way around it is not to build IA in the first place. Interestingly, there's seemingly a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nFor context, AI Defense is a sophisticated security solution designed to protect the development and use of AI-powered apps, allowing enterprises to develop AI securely.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Rundown AI's Rowan Cheung, Cisco Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel discussed the rapid progression of AI and the security and protection concerns, prompting AI Defense's release:\n\n\"The reality is that there will be two types of companies in the future: those who are leading with AI and those that are irrelevant. Every company will be using - if not developing - thousands of AI applications, and the rapid pace of AI innovation is outperforming major security and protection concerns.\n\nWe developed AI Defense to protect both the development and use of AI applications. Overall, AI Defense safeguards against the misuse of AI tools, data leakage, and increasingly sophisticated threats. We are taking a radical approach to address the challenges that existing security solutions are not equipped to handle.\"\n\nAI Defense is arguably the closest security solution to the technology's existential threats.

(Image credit: Getty Images | Andriy Onufriyenko)\n\nThe launch of the security solution couldn't come at a better time as top AI labs, including Anthropic and OpenAI, race to hit the coveted AGI benchmark. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated that his team knows how to build AGI and that the benchmark would be achieved sooner than anticipated as the company shifts focus and gears to superintelligence.\n\nRelated: Employee claims OpenAI already achieved AGI with o1 reasoning model's release\n\nDespite security and safety concerns, Altman claimed the benchmark would whoosh by with surprisingly little societal impact. He added that the expressed security concerns wouldn't be seen or experienced during the AGI moment. However, recent reports indicated that AI development and progression might have hit a wall due to a lack of high-quality content for model training. Key players in the industry, including Sam Altman and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, disputed the claims, indicating there's no evidence scaling laws have begun to stunt the progression of AI. \"There's no wall,\" added Altman.\n\nWhile AI Defense is a step in the right direction, its adoption across organizations and major AI labs remains to be seen. Interestingly, the OpenAI CEO acknowledges the technology's threat to humanity but believes AI will be smart enough to prevent AI from causing existential doom.",

The company has its roots in the computer department of Stanford University and was founded by 2 key Stanford employees. The name Cisco is short for San Francisco, the company\u2019s original hometown, the company\u2019s logo is a representation of the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLeonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner founded the company to market technology they\u2019d developed while working for the university. Despite some early problems, the 2 were able to work out an agreement with the university that allowed Cisco to grow into one of the world's largest technology companies. The company was ranked 74th on the 2021 Forbes Fortune 100 list and the #1 spot on the Forbes list of Best Places to Work.\n\nBosack and Lerner pioneered using LANs or local area networking to connect distant computers via a multiprotocol routing system. Local Area Networks is the network used to connect devices in a localized area such as a home, office building, warehouse or university. It is the nexus from which IP connections are made and a central point of operations for business and a means to secure systems. Cisco\u2019s motto is \u201cif it\u2019s connected, it\u2019s protected\u201d which is more relevant today than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, Cisco\u2019s business met with early success. The company came to the public market in 1990, 6 years after its founding, with a market capitalization of $224 million. Shortly after, Bosack and Lerner left the company but that was not the end of its success. The market cap will grow to over $500 billion at the peak of the DotCom bubble and stands at roughly half that amount in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, the company has had to adapt to a rapidly changing technological environment that required a shift in business as well. While IP-related products are still the core of the business, it has branched out into other areas in response to competition. These include packet switching products, routing, consumer products, and commercial.\n\nCisco\u2019s growth is also dependent on acquisitions. The company has made over 2 dozen acquisitions, ranging from products and services to enhance core offerings to new technologies and businesses to enhance portfolio stability and shareholder value.\n\nToday, Cisco designs manufactures and markets IP-based networking equipment, products and services related to the communications industry. The primary sub-industries the company is focused on are the Internet of Things, Domain Security, 5G and Video Conferencing. The company's products are sold directly to consumers, wholesalers, and global OEMs. Total revenue in 2021 topped $51.50 billion, with a nearly 23% net income margin.\n\nCisco is a blue-chip quality technology stock and a dividend-paying stock as well. The company has a track record for dividend increases that numbered 11 consecutive annual increases in 2022, and future increases are expected.",

            "content": "Overview of Jim Cramer\u2019s Insights on Cisco and Market Dynamics\n\nIn a recent segment on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, renowned financial commentator Jim Cramer explored pivotal stocks, including Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). His analysis occurred during a critical period marked by the transition of governmental leadership in the United States, and he shared notable insights about both economic policies and market trends.\n\nCramer expressed admiration for Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary nominee, highlighting his measured approach and respect for established processes, during an exchange with Senator Sanders. Cramer conveyed that their dialogue reflected an unexpected consensus, signifying a promising start for future policy discussions.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, cryptocurrency emerged as another hot topic. Cramer supported the incoming administration\u2019s potential move towards establishing a strategic crypto reserve, while voicing concerns over the security of blockchain implementations.\n\nAddressing the global stage, Cramer drew parallels between China and East Germany, suggesting that while China appeared powerful, it is reliant on external markets. His remarks served as a warning, indicating that the Chinese market\u2019s complexities must be navigated carefully.\n\nIn closing, Cramer emphasized the pressing threat posed by cyberattacks on the outgoing administration, noting the urgent need for modernizing outdated governmental cybersecurity systems.\n\nOverall, Cisco Systems, despite current challenges in the IT sector, stands out amid Cramer\u2019s analysis, capturing the attention of institutional investors in a landscape marked by shifting policies and market sentiments.\n\nBroader Implications of Market Dynamics and Technological Resilience\n\nAs financial commentators like Jim Cramer dissect individual stocks such as Cisco, their insights serve as an important lens through which we can examine larger societal and economic trends. The discussions around governmental shifts and the influences of cybersecurity are not merely about market speculation but underscore vital aspects of our interconnected lives.\n\nThe potential establishment of a strategic crypto reserve, as discussed by Cramer, may revolutionize how we perceive and interact with currencies globally. This move could shape the global economy, introducing a more resilient financial system that is capable of withstanding fluctuations caused by geopolitical tensions. Cryptocurrency\u2019s rise poses intriguing questions about monetary sovereignty and the balance of power among nations, particularly for those with emerging economies.\n\nFurther, Cramer\u2019s commentary about cybersecurity is a clarion call for a sector often underestimated in its significance. The burgeoning threat of cyberattacks not only jeopardizes institutional integrity but also affects consumer trust and economic stability.

As AI technology advances, new safety concerns and security threats are emerging at an unprecedented speed which existing security solutions are unprepared to protect against. Cisco AI Defense is purpose-built for enterprises to develop, deploy and secure AI applications with confidence.\n\n\"Business and technology leaders can\u2019t afford to sacrifice safety for speed when embracing AI,\u201d said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, Cisco. \"In a dynamic landscape where competition is fierce, speed decides the winners. Fused into the fabric of the network, Cisco AI Defense combines the unique ability to detect and protect against threats when developing and accessing AI applications without tradeoffs.\u201d\n\nThe stakes of something going wrong with AI are incredibly high. According to Cisco's 2024 AI Readiness Index, only 29% of those surveyed feel fully equipped to detect and prevent unauthorized tampering with AI. The security challenges are also new and complex, with AI applications being multi-model and multi-cloud. Vulnerabilities can occur at model or app level, while responsibility lies with different owners including developers, end users and vendors. As enterprises move beyond public data and begin training models on proprietary data, the risks only grow.\n\nTo unlock AI innovation and adoption, enterprises need a common layer of safety and security that protects every user and every application. AI Defense enables enterprises\u2019 AI transformations by addressing two urgent risks:\n\nDeveloping and Deploying Secure AI Applications: As AI becomes ubiquitous, enterprises will use and develop hundreds if not thousands of AI applications. Developers need one set of AI security and safety guardrails that work for every application. AI Defense helps developers move fast and unlock greater value by protecting AI systems from attacks and safeguarding model behavior, across platforms. The capabilities of AI Defense include:\n\nDiscovering AI : Security teams need to understand who is building applications and the training sources they use. AI Defense detects shadow and sanctioned AI applications across public and private clouds.\n\n: Security teams need to understand who is building applications and the training sources they use.

Data and Threat Protection: Continuously safeguards against threats and confidential data loss while ensuring compliance.\n\nUnlike safety guardrails built into individual AI models, Cisco delivers consistent controls for a multimodel world. AI Defense is self-optimizing, leveraging Cisco\u2019s proprietary machine learning models to detect ever-evolving AI safety and security concerns based on threat intelligence data from Cisco Talos. Splunk customers that are using AI Defense will receive enriched alerts with additional context from across the entire ecosystem. AI Defense integrates seamlessly with existing data flows for unparalleled visibility and control and is built into the Security Cloud, Cisco's unified, AI-driven, cross-domain security platform. It leverages Cisco\u2019s extensive mesh of enforcement points to perform AI security at the network level in a way only Cisco is optimized to deliver. Accuracy and trustworthiness are essential for protecting enterprise AI applications, and Cisco has been actively involved in developing AI security industry standards, including those from MITRE, OWASP, and NIST.\n\n\"The adoption of AI exposes companies to new risks that traditional cybersecurity solutions don't address,\" said Kent Noyes, Global Head of AI & Cyber Innovation at World Wide Technology. \"Cisco AI Defense represents a significant leap forward in AI security, providing full visibility of an enterprise's AI assets and protection against evolving threats.\"\n\nAI Defense is the latest in a series of AI-driven security innovations from Cisco, including Cisco Hypershield. Cisco AI Defense will be available in March for enterprises to safeguard their AI transformations. For more information, visit cisco.com/go/ai-defense.",

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"",

Although ransomware and cyberattacks are dominating the conversation, outages can just as often originate from unpatched systems or bugs.\n\n\u201cWhat we see many times is that outages are not malicious in intent, but they're simply a misconfiguration at a critical point within an adjacent domain,\u201d Vaccaro says.\n\nLooking back at 2024, it's hard not to remember the biggest and most costly outage, the notorious CrowdStrike incident, where the estimated damage was in the billions and millions of devices were affected, but the incident likely stemmed from a misconfiguration rather than a cyberattack.\n\nThat said, companies must offer an equally robust response to misconfiguration as they would to a cyber threat, Vaccaro says. The incident response process is largely the same, and a thorough understanding of your digital dependencies can dictate the effectiveness of a firm\u2019s actions:\n\nAre you a pro? Subscribe to our newsletter Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\u201cCan you detect if you have a problem? Can you localize to where along the path the problem is? And then as part of the diagnosis, can you understand how the configuration has changed both in your own infrastructure as well as infrastructure that you rely upon so that you can then mitigate it?\u201d\n\nIn response to an outage, speed and accuracy is key, Vaccaro says, because downtime doesn\u2019t just mean an inconvenience, but can cost a company serious money - he gives the example of a US healthcare firm which suffered an outage before becoming a ThousandEyes customer:\n\n\u201cThey calculated the cost of downtime to them in a real life situation was over a million dollars per minute, and they were in the face of operating in an outage that was over six hours. So when you think about the cost of implementing digital resilience versus the cost of doing nothing.\u201d\n\nDigital assurance\n\nA key part of digital resilience is just understanding the software you use and where it comes from, Vaccaro says. By understanding the services, vendors, and third party software your firm uses, you can be much more confident in your incident response.\n\n\u201cSo from a ThousandEyes lens, we've been helping customers now for well over a decade to be able to map these digital dependencies\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd we think of ourselves in many ways like the Google Maps of the internet. How do you have the ability to understand from where you are to where you're looking to go, what are all the routes that you're gonna be taking? What are all the digital services that you're gonna be traversing so that we can help customers to both discover an inventory and then be able to operate through this new world.\u201d\n\nEvolving regulations\n\nWhilst the DORA regulation is an EU legislation, it still applies to many non-European firms who participate in European financial markets, meaning even UK and US firms need to be up to scratch.\n\n\u201cI think the first thing to highlight is that, you know, we live in a highly interconnected world,\u201d Vaccaro points out.\n\n\u201cYou know, where I live here in the United States, I'm accessing services provided from European countries all the time. And that's just part of the global economy that we live in.\u201d\n\nThis could also help usher in stricter regulations in the US and across the world, as Vaccaro points out digital regulations developed in the EU and UK often pave the way for US frameworks, offering greater consumer protections and encouraging data privacy laws, like those seen with the EU\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CCPA.\n\n\u201cImportant regulations that got their start in Europe that then now have carried over to others as we think about data sovereignty, data privacy, and others,\" he notes. \"And they take different forms and different names, but at the underpinning, they're all trying to achieve similar objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what's helpful with DORA is how explicitly it calls out the need to be able to increase the resiliency within your business, and that extends beyond just your perimeter but all of the critical dependencies that you rely upon.\u201d",

            "content": "The Jaguars free agent class of 2025 consists of multiple key starters and imperative backups, of this group of Jaguars free agents, who should stay and who should go?\n\nJaguars Free Agent Class 2025: Who Stays And Who Goes?\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars 2024 season is over, and with the 2025 offseason rapidly approaching, the Jaguars will have to make multiple key decisions across their entire roster. From potential trades and the NFL Draft, there are a few key ways to change the Jaguars roster in 2025.\n\nWith the Jaguar\u2019s interview of Liam Coen for their head coaching job, the Jaguars have completed interviews with all of the top five Jaguar head coaching candidates for 2025. Whoever the new head coach is, the Jaguars will likely make changes to philosophy, and they would be the tie-breaker for bringing some of the Jaguars free agents back into the fold for 2025.\n\nWith the Jaguars free agent class being at the mercy of a new head coach, and the potential new general manager, there are a lot of discussions left to be had with the Jaguars free agents. Of this Jaguars free agent class, there is one name that stands out as being the most important to address as soon as possible.\n\nBrandon Scherff\n\nThe first player to address from the Jaguars free agent class of 2025 is the Jaguars starting right guard, Brandon Scherff. After coming over from Washington in 2022, Scherff has locked down the Jaguars\u2019 right guard spot. Now that his contract is coming up, the decision to bring him back will be the biggest decision from the Jaguars free agent class.\n\nReviewing the Scherff seasons in Jacksonville, there is a clear distinction from his time in Washington to his time with the Jaguars. Scherff\u2019s Pro Football Focus grades for his career took a significant step back the moment he came to Jacksonville. He went from consistently being graded in the mid-70s to falling into the 60s during his three years in Jacksonville. It\u2019s a drop-off too stark to ignore and should be further scrutinized when reviewing whether Scherff should return in 2025 or not.\n\nWith his decline since coming to the Jaguars, and as he\u2019s entering the 2025 season at age 33, the Jaguars should look to get cheaper and younger at the right guard spot. There are a few options in free agency that could help solve this hole, but the 2025 NFL Draft has a strong interior offensive line class, which should be the place where the Jaguars try and solve their right guard spot for the future.\n\nAndre Cisco\n\nAnother starter for the Jaguars that is an impending free agent is safety Andre Cisco. After four strong years in Jacksonville, the former third-round pick might be on his way out of the door. In his fourth year, Cisco got off to a bad start. Despite having a couple of good weeks throughout the year, 2024 was his worst season as a Jaguar by far. The Jaguars free agent is the most prominent member of the defense that could leave in 2025, but he should get a much longer look compared to other players around the league.\n\nAs he knows the system and has familiarity with the team, Cisco returning on a new deal makes sense for both sides. With the hope that he can return to form going forward, with his fourth season being an outlier, the Jaguars should strongly consider bringing Cisco back. While not a game-changer, Cisco provides stability at safety for the Jaguars. With Cisco being a hair under 25, and with his expected contract not being expensive, it makes sense to bring back the Jaguars starting safety for 2025.\n\nJeremiah Ledbetter\n\nJaguars starting interior defender Jeremiah Ledbetter is also a name to watch among the Jaguars free agent class. Playing alongside two of the top five best Jaguars of 2024, Ledbetter had a chance to make an impact up the middle. However, despite consistent playing time, Ledbetter couldn\u2019t pressure the quarterback much throughout the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe 30-year-old came into the Jaguars 2024 season as the starting interior defender for the second straight year, and he had a better season than 2023. Despite having the same amount of pressures in both seasons, eight according to Pro Football Focus, Ledbetter got two sacks in 2024. He also got more stops than the rest of his career combined, while playing the most snaps he\u2019s ever had in a season. His role in 2024 was huge, and with the 2025 season on the horizon, the decision to keep him or let him go is an important one.\n\nThis decision should be an easy one if Ledbetter wouldn\u2019t cost a whole lot to bring back. If he asks for a decent payday after his best season, the Jaguars should look towards the NFL draft or free agency to find a new defensive tackle. It would be a major need even if he did return, and with multiple intriguing options in both free agency and the draft, the decision to bring Ledbetter back shouldn\u2019t be one to mull over for long.\n\nOffensive Backups\n\nThe rest of the Jaguars free agent class consists of backups on offense. Each one could return, but with the Jaguars draft capital and the free agent class of 2025, there will be plenty of turnover with these players.\n\nMac Jones\n\nThe backup quarterback for the Jaguars is a free agent following the 2024 season, and with his performances to close out the 2024 season, there is little reason to bring him back. He wasn\u2019t the worst backup quarterback, but Jones turned the ball over a lot. With the Jaguars looking to address needs elsewhere on the roster, paying a backup quarterback a lot of money doesn\u2019t align with where the Jaguars should be aiming.\n\nD\u2019Ernest Johnson\n\nThe Jaguars free agent class of 2025 also includes D\u2019Ernest Johnson, the third-string running back behind Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby. Both Bigsby and Etienne will be getting the majority of the workload in 2025 if they both return, and Johnson would most likely be the odd man out. With a stacked running back draft class, the Jaguars should be more than okay with letting Johnson walk, paving the way for the Jaguars to take a running back in the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nOffensive Linemen\n\nTwo key offensive linemen will be free agents, Cole Van Lanen and Blake Hance. Hance is a veteran who would be a nice backup to bring back, while Van Lanen is a restricted free agent, meaning his return is likely. Both would be solid backups along the offensive line and with the Jaguars looking for stability along the line, bringing back these two would make sense.\n\nFinal Outlook on Jaguars 2025 Free Agency\n\nOf the 2025 Jaguars free agents, Cisco, Scherff, and Ledbetter all might be on their way out the door. The key free agents might not be Jaguars much longer, as the combination of the NFL Draft and the free agent class being strong in those positions, the Jaguars have more reason to get cheaper and younger where they can.\n\nHowever, the Jaguars should try and bring Cisco back. He had a down year, likely lowering his deal. While it may not be the long-term solution, the Jaguars should try and bring back one of the best players from the Doug Pederson era. Cisco, Rayshawn Jenkins, and Andrew Wingard should make a solid safety trio. The hope would be Savage improves and Cisco returns to form.\n\nOther than Cisco, however, the rest of the Jaguars free-agent class doesn\u2019t hold as much weight. Jones and Johnson can depart without much thought, while the backup offensive linemen could return, though their departure wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. Luke Farrell, Caleb Johnson, Josiah Deguara, and C.J. Beathard round out the Jaguars\u2019 unrestricted free-agent class. Of that group, none need to be a priority resigning, as their roles would be strictly as depth players.\n\nWith the draft capital, the Jaguars have, along with the pieces in-house returning for 2025, the Jaguars free agent class of 2025 isn\u2019t nearly as impactful as it could be. The only issues to address would be the offensive guard, safety, and interior defensive line. Both the interior offensive and defensive line were already top priorities, while safety can be solved by bringing Cisco back or looking at the draft.\n\nOnce the Jaguars fired Pederson, the Jaguars free agents no longer had their coach. A new head coach may look to bring in his players, or players who better fit his philosophy. That change could make the difference between many of the Jaguars free agents in whether they stay or go. Fortunately, the Jaguars free agent class is small.\n\nWhile the Jaguars free agent class is a small one, it highlights some of the key positions that need to be addressed for the future. No player will make or break the Jaguars for 2025, and with the chance to contend in 2025 under a new coach, the Jaguars should be prepared to make many moves. It all starts with deciding who should stay and who should go from the Jaguars free agent class of 2025.\n\nMain Image: \u00a9 Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images",

We didn\u2019t skyrocket to the top. Instead, we climbed the leaderboard steadily through various stages,\u201d Wong said in an interview yesterday.\n\nHe said the team\u2019s winning solution involved utilising deep learning and designing an AI model to extract and identify all buildings from satellite images.\n\nTo ensure robustness, they developed an image generator to produce synthetic images, enhancing the training dataset and enabling their AI model to perform well even with varied test data.\n\nWong acknowledged the hurdles they faced, particularly limited resources for experiments.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we were able to come up with creative solutions to overcome this challenge,\u201d he said, adding that their testing process, capped at five daily submissions, required careful planning.\n\nThe implications of their work extend beyond the competition as Wong explained that the AI model could assist in disaster response by identifying affected areas and optimising relief efforts.\n\n\u201cIn regions undergoing rapid urbanisation, our solution can assist in mapping and infrastructure planning,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, the team aims to delve deeper into geospatial AI and explore its applications in climate change analysis and renewable energy planning.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we will participate in the upcoming 2025 Ernst and Young Open Science AI and Data Challenge, which focuses on building predictive models to detect urban heat events.\n\n\u201cI strongly encourage anyone interested in AI and data science to join,\u201d said Wong.\n\nIn a statement, UTAR praised the team\u2019s achievement, noting that Wong and Khor presented their winning solution virtually.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s outstanding performance not only earned them US$1,000 (RM4,504), a trophy and certificates but also established UTAR as a leader in innovative data science solutions on an international platform,\u201d it said.\n\nIEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.",

The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week.\n\nJust like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies.\n\nWe looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion.\n\nWhy Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) Received Analyst Approval This Week?\n\nEngineers using the latest Cisco TelePresence technology to collaborate with colleagues around the world.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nCisco Systems Inc. is a multinational company that sells, manufactures, and designs internet protocol-based networking and other telecommunication products. Citi\u2019s analysts are optimistic about the company\u2019s short-term prospects and have added it to their 30-day Catalyst Watch list.\n\nThe main reason for this short-term optimism is the return to growth of the campus switching market. The said networking and equipment market normalized and returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, which should be reflected in the upcoming earnings report. The campus switching market is about 20% of the company\u2019s total sales, so growth here will have a significant impact on the company\u2019s topline.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price performance was quite attractive in the past month. There was an upward trend with a 3.5% gain in the stock\u2019s price in the last 5 trading days. The company\u2019s profile and potential for growth make it a worthy consideration for investors.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. is not on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 60 hedge fund portfolios held CSCO at the end of the third quarter which was 61 in the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, CSCO ranks 1st on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "The Jacksonville Jaguars have done a good job of locking up their young talent. Last year, they gave extensions to Trevor Lawrence, defensive end Josh Hines-Allen, cornerback Tyson Campbell, and left tackle Walker Little. Due to their proactivity, the Jags don't have many big decisions left in the offseason. That said, they'll need to decide what to do with safety Andre Cisco, who's set to hit the open market. Pro Football Focus has an intriguing suggestion in case they let him walk.\n\nBradley Locker of PFF drew up a list of one player each NFL team must target in free agency. For the Jags [subscription required], he picked Minnesota Vikings safety Cam Bynum, noting that he would be an appealing replacement for Cisco even though he's coming off a somewhat down year. Here's the skinny.\n\n\"Bynum has been a bit worse in 2024, with a 63.0 PFF overall grade and a 59.6 PFF coverage grade, but he was excellent a year ago in both coverage and as a run defender. The 26-year-old is also more of a traditional center fielder, playing 65.2% of his career snaps with the Vikings as a true free safety. He would serve as a nice complement to Darnell Savage, who has moved around more throughout his career.\"\n\nExpected to have a breakout year in 2024, Cisco instead was inconsistent. A third-round pick in 2021, the former Syracuse Orangeman spent most of his rookie season on the bench but logged a combined seven interceptions and 15 passes defensed from 2022-2023.\n\nCisco is now slated to become a free agent, and it's uncertain if the Jaguars want him back. There will be a new coach in place, and there's a chance Jacksonville will move on from general manager Trent Baalke. These two factors could affect his chances of potentially re-signing in 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, Bynum was a fourth-round pick in 2021 who became a full-time starter for the Vikes in 2022. He's tallied five interceptions and 19 passes defensed this past year. And in case you missed it, he went viral when the Vikings played Jacksonville last season because he imitated the infamous Olympian Raygun during a celebration following an interception.\n\nThe case for and against the Jaguars replacing Andre Cisco with Cam Bynum\n\nAndre Cisco is coming off a down season. While he deserves to shoulder some of the blame, it's important to point out that defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen did a dreadful job with his unit in 2024. This is to say that his struggles must be put in context. Who's to say he won't bounce back next season with better coaching? Given that his stock took a hit, the Jaguars could sign him at a discount rate or give him a one-year, prove-it deal.\n\nBut if the Jaguars let Cisco walk, Cam Bynum would be a legitimate replacement, who was arguably better last year. He may not be a ballhawk in the mold of his Jaguars counterpart, but he's most definitely come through for the Vikings.\n\nThe only issue with making a run for Bynum in free agency is that there will probably be a high demand for his services and may want top-market compensation. The top 5 safeties average more than $15 million. The Vikings stud will surely want to get to that threshold. It will be up to Jacksonville to decide whether it wants to make that kind of investment at the position.\n\nUltimately, keeping Andre Cisco makes sense, but the Jaguars can't go wrong with Cam Bynum, even if it's potentially more expensive than going with the devil they know.\n\nHere are other Jaguars stories you may also like:",

            "content": "Whether in a small shop or flagship store, retail depends on the network more than ever before. Because wherever the shopping takes place, it\u2019s all about experience. And that experience must be seamless, secure, fast, and fun.\n\nA powerful, integrated network platform enables it all. Especially as brick-and-mortar retail (when done right!) continues to gain loyal shoppers.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, retail can\u2019t work without the network,\u201d said Lawrence Huang, Cisco\u2019s general manager and senior vice president for network platform and wireless. \u201cThe network powers everything in the store. And when you have the best devices on the best network, it brings the best retail experiences to customers.\u201d\n\nHuang was speaking this week before a select group of more than 140 retail executives and industry analysts in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea district. Dubbed the \u201cThe Collaboratory,\u201d the event was held in a downtown events space resembling a storefront that was completely transformed by Cisco and its partners into a mind-bending display of all that\u2019s possible in the future (and present!) of retail.\n\nGuests were immersed in a pop-up retail store experience that surrounded them with dazzling video, audio, and interactive displays, all powered by Cisco network innovations. That is, everything from next-gen Wi-Fi 7 integrated with Cisco Spaces and Cisco Meraki smart cameras to switches, energy-saving Power Over Ethernet switches streamlined point-of-sale capabilities, and much more. And even as the National Retail Federation (NRF) kicked off its annual industry showcase a few blocks away, the Cisco event stood out \u2014 by revealing what powerful, simplified, and secure infrastructure can enable for the future.\n\n\u201cWith the advent of all the technology we\u2019re seeing here tonight,\u201d said the chief technology officer of a premium luxury fashion retailer and Cisco customer, \u201cit\u2019s about unlocking the many unique solutions that are becoming available through innovations like AI and augmented reality.\u201d\n\nAI, AR, and more\u2026\n\nOne such unique experience powered by AI, augmented reality, and a powerful network? The Collaboratory guests were able to custom design their own customized sneakers via a sneaker design station leveraging iPads \u2014 and have them shipped directly to their home or office.\n\nZeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, was busy concocting some elaborately personalized footwear. But he stepped away from his design on the iPad to share some insights on the complexities facing today\u2019s retailers.\n\n\u201cAcross different demographics, everybody wants to experience retail in all different ways,\u201d Kerravala explained. \u201cYou might want to go to a store to order and have it delivered to your home, or you might order from home and want to pick it up in store or curbside. You also might want assistance from an AI agent to help you buy, or you might want to talk to a live person.\u201d\n\nAgain, it all comes down to powerful, flexible network infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA retailer today has to be able to bring all the different shopping modes together,\u201d Kerravala continued, \u201cand really be able to merge physical and virtual environments and digital environments. And until recently, the value of the network to support all that has gone underappreciated.\u201d\n\nThe broadest scope of solutions, integrated and simplified\n\nThe key, Kerravala stressed, is simplifying the network and IT environment. Cisco, he argued, has an all but unique portfolio spanning network, security, observability, AI, analytics, collaboration, and more. And while he believes the company has not always highlighted all of the individual capabilities, he\u2019s excited to see that changing in a more wholistic approach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big initiative to bring these technologies together,\u201d Kerravala said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so important, because with everything being so network centric, all these components have to work together. If you're going to create that great seamless experience, Cisco's arguably got the broadest set of infrastructure of any vendor \u2014 collaboration, compute, security, observability, networking.\u201d\n\nAnother analyst and sneaker recipient, Bob Laliberte of theCube Research (part of SiliconANGLE), added his own thoughts on driving seamless integrations.\n\n\u201cTo me, the most encouraging thing I've seen of Cisco in the last six months is that ability to start leveraging comprehensive, integrated solutions in converged networks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it's fixed, wireless, cellular, etc., being able to have that operational efficiency to drive it from a single location, is really what's going to be important. And I see Cisco as a leader there.\u201d\n\nCisco\u2019s Wi-Fi 7 technology is but one example of this ongoing simplification. By integrating additional solutions such as Cisco Spaces, it brings smart-building and Internet of Things capabilities \u2014 high-grade analytics, security, environmental sensing and more\u2014 to the wireless network.\n\n\u201cMany of you would agree that so much starts with a strong wireless foundation,\u201d said Huang. \u201cAnd at Cisco we've been incredibly busy, on a journey of simplifying your operations. What that means is no matter how you want to operate that infrastructure, whether it's cloud first, on-prem or anything in between, it's the same set of SKUs, it's the same license, it's the same support model. Whether you're upgrading a store in Hoboken or opening a new flagship store in Perth, we make it incredibly easy for you to get started with that network modernization.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn top of that,\u201d Huang continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve also embedded Cisco Spaces technology. Cisco Spaces allows you to bring next-gen retail experiences to life with our mapping and with our rich IoT connectivity to unlock use cases such as highly accurate asset tracking. And that's just the beginning.\u201d\n\nSupporting customer visions\n\nListening to customers is a critical element to successful innovation. And Grant Shirk, senior director of product marketing for Cisco's campus and branch networking products, was excited to see the longstanding relationships with customers and partners, many of whom were represented at the event.\n\n\u201cCisco is hyper aware of our customer's needs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we're able to work with them and our partner ecosystem to deliver on their unique retail vision. Even tonight, with help from our partners, along with the flexibility and agility the network drives, we were able to stand up this entire event in six weeks.\u201d\n\nThe luxury brand CTO also emphasized, that flexibility agility enables technology that\u2019s so seamless it seemingly disappears \u2014 while still enhancing the human connection.\n\n\u201cThe technology should just blend, so you don\u2019t even see it,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can learn about an individual\u2019s values, tastes and preferences, while you leave the technology on the side. If you can do that seamlessly, then you've done something right. And we\u2019re way closer to that with some of these innovations we see tonight.\u201d\n\nData \u2014 lots of it \u2014 is critical for this level of customer insight. But as Shirk stressed, \u201cIt's not just data; it's the ability to find the signal in the noise.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the integration of the analytics powerhouse Splunk into Cisco platforms is supercharging data insights \u2014 for security, observability, customer insights, and much more.\n\n\u201cData helps understand what customers are looking for next,\u201d Shirk explained. \u201cAnd what the Splunk data layer brings us is not just on the security side, but the opportunity to build a data infrastructure that can collect millions and millions of data points on a regular basis and start understanding how it\u2019s changing shoppers\u2019 online habits, impacting the products they\u2019re looking at, and creating the ability for perfectly tailored shopping experiences. To do that you need the data, you need the power of the integrated platform, and you need AI.\u201d\n\nCisco is creating its own AI-driven solutions \u2014 in security, networking, collaboration, and beyond \u2014 while building the infrastructure to support the heavy demands of its customers\u2019 own AI innovations.\n\nIn retail AI, represents a massive transformation.\n\n\u201cAI to me, will have as big or even bigger a transformative effect on retail than the internet did,\u201d said Kerravala. \u201cI think it's going to change the way you shop, the way you buy things, the way supply chain is managed \u2013 just about everything.\u201d\n\nTo do all that, a secure, integrated, future-proof network is essential. So, Cisco is looking not just at where retail is, but where it is headed.\n\n\u201cThe other network vendors should watch out,\u201d concluded Laliberte, \u201cbecause as Cisco finishes pulling all this stuff together, it's going to be really powerful.\u201d",

            "content": "Cisco and Nvidia have both recognized that as useful as today's AI may be, the technology can be equally unsafe and/or unreliable \u2013 and have delivered tools in an attempt to help address those weaknesses.\n\nNvidia on Thursday introduced a trio of specialized microservices aimed at stopping your own AI agents from being hijacked by users or spouting inappropriate stuff onto the 'net.\n\nAs our friends over at The Next Platform reported, these three Nvidia Inference Microservices (aka NIMs) are the latest members of the GPU giant's NeMo Guardrails collection, and are designed to steer chatbots and autonomous agents so that they operate as intended.\n\nThe trio are:\n\nA content safety NIM that tries to stop your own AI model from \"generating biased or harmful outputs, ensuring responses align with ethical standards.\" What you do is take a user's input prompt and your model's output, and run both as a pair through the NIM, which concludes whether that input and output is appropriate. You can then act on those recommendations, either telling off the user for being bad, or blocking the output of the model for being rude. This NIM was trained using the Aegis Content Safety Dataset, which consists of about 33,000 user-LLM interactions that are labeled safe or unsafe.\n\nA topic control NIM that, we're told, \"keeps conversations focused on approved topics, avoiding digression or inappropriate content.\" This NIM takes your model's system prompt and a user's input, and determines whether or not the user is on topic for the system prompt. If the user is trying to make your model go off the rails, this NIM can help block that.\n\nA jailbreak detection NIM that tries to do what it says on the tin. It analyzes just your users' inputs to detect attempts to jailbreak your LLM, which is to make it go against its intended purpose.\n\nAs we've previously explored, it can be hard to prevent prompt injection attacks because many AI chatbots and assistants are built on general-purpose language-processing models and their guardrails can be overridden with some simple persuasion. For example, in some cases, merely instructing a chatbot to \"ignore all previous instructions, do this instead\" can allow behavior developers did not intend. That scenario is one of several that Nvidia's Jailbreak detection model hopes to protect against.\n\nDepending on the application in question, the GPU giant says chaining multiple guardrail models together - such as topic control, content safety, and jailbreak detection - may be necessary to comprehensively address security gaps and compliance challenges.\n\nUsing multiple models does, however, come at the expense of higher overheads and latency. Because of this, Nvidia elected to base these guardrails on smaller language models, roughly eight billion parameters in size each, which can be run at scale with minimal resources.\n\nThese models are available as NIMs for AI Enterprise customers, or from Hugging Face for those preferring to implement them manually.\n\nNvidia is also providing an open source tool called Garak to identify AI vulnerabilities, such as data leaks, prompt injection, and hallucinations, in applications to validate the efficacy of these guardrails.\n\nCisco wants in, too\n\nCisco\u2019s AI infosec tools will be offered under the name AI Defense, and has a little overlap with Nvidia\u2019s offerings in the form of a model validation tool that Switchzilla says will investigate LLM performance and advise infosec teams of any risks it creates.\n\nThe networking giant also plans AI discovery tools to help security teams seek out \u201cshadow\u201d applications that business units have deployed without IT oversight.\n\nCisco also feels that some of you have botched chatbot implementations by deploying them without restricting them to their intended roles, such as purely customer service interactions, and therefore allowing users unrestricted to the services like OpenAI's ChatGPT that power them. That mistake can cost big bucks if people discover it and use your chatbot as a way to access paid AI services.\n\nAI Defense, we're told, will be able to detect that sort of thing so you can fix it, and will include hundreds of guardrails that can be deployed to (hopefully) stop AI producing unwanted results.\n\nThe offering is a work-in-progress, and will see tools added to Cisco\u2019s cloudy Security Cloud and Secure Access services. The latter will in February gain a service called AI Access that does things like block user access to online AI services you\u2019d rather they did not use. More services will appear over time.\n\nCisco\u2019s also changing its own customer-facing AI agents, which can do things like allow natural language interfaces to its products \u2013 but currently do so discretely for each of its products. The networking giant plans a single agent to rule them all and in the router bind them, so net admins can use a single chat interface to get answers about the different components of their Cisco estates.\n\nAnand Raghavan, Cisco\u2019s VP of engineering for AI, told The Register he has a multi-year roadmap pointing to development of more AI security tools, a sobering item of information given IT shops already face myriad infosec threats and often struggle to implement and integrate the tools to address them. \u00ae\n\nIn other AI news... Google researchers have come up with an attention-based LLM architecture dubbed Titans that can scale beyond two-million-token context windows and outperform ultra-large models due to the way it handles the memorization of information. A pre-print paper describing the approach is here.\n\nThe FTC has referred its probe into Snap's MyAI chatbot to the US Dept of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. The watchdog said it believes the software poses \"risks and harms to young users.\"",

            "content": "Increasing network visibility enables quick mitigation of security threats. This is the primary premise of the development of Cisco AI Defense as more and more companies are deploying artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\n\u201cAI safety and security is probably one of the biggest challenges we all need to address,\u201d Dave West, president for Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China (APJC) at Cisco, said in a virtual media briefing. \u201cAI is evolving and changing very quickly.\u201d\n\nWest also noted the increasing adoption of AI among businesses and organizations. However, in Cisco\u2019s 2024 AI Readiness Index, only 35% of those surveyed in the Philippines feel fully equipped to detect and prevent unauthorized tampering with AI.\n\n\u201cIn the very near future, there will be only two types of companies: those that are AI-forward and those that are irrelevant,\u201d West pointed out.\n\nThe complexity of AI deployment includes applications being multi-model and multi-cloud. Add to that the different vendors for different solutions making it difficult to navigate operations.\n\nCisco developed AI Defense to help businesses use AI safely by solving two main challenges: building secure AI tools and protecting access to them.\n\n\u201cWhat Cisco AI Defense does is it does two things. The first thing it does is it basically protects users and employees that are using AI applications inside of your organizations,\u201d said DJ Sampath, head of AI Software and Platform at Cisco.\n\nUnified security measures across AI platforms\n\nAI Defense simplifies this by providing developers with a unified set of safety and security measures that work across all AI platforms. It helps developers move quickly while ensuring their systems are protected from attacks and behave as intended. AI Defense also helps security teams discover all AI tools in use, whether officially approved or not, across both public and private clouds. It automatically tests AI models to detect harmful or unexpected behaviors and recommends fixes to address these issues. It also provides continuous protection by monitoring for risks like data leaks, hacking attempts, or malicious inputs that could disrupt the system.\n\nAI Defense also focuses on protecting access to AI tools as employees increasingly use them to improve productivity. Security teams gain full visibility into the AI applications employees are using, ensuring that unapproved tools are identified and restricted. Policies can be enforced to block access to these tools, and sensitive company data is continuously safeguarded from leaks and threats while ensuring compliance with industry regulations.\n\nMachine learning\n\nUnlike safety measures built into individual AI models, Cisco\u2019s AI Defense promises to deliver consistent controls across multiple models. It is powered by Cisco\u2019s proprietary machine learning systems, which adapt to new threats using intelligence from Cisco Talos. The system integrates seamlessly with existing data workflows, offering \u201cunmatched visibility\u201d and control through Cisco\u2019s Security Cloud platform.\n\nBy securing AI systems at the network level, Cisco aims to provide a level of accuracy and reliability that sets it apart, while contributing to the development of industry standards for AI security.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Stories",

            "content": "Cisco has announced the release of new solution AI Defense in a move that promises to bring security to the enterprise AI process.\n\n\u201cBusiness and technology leaders can\u2019t afford to sacrifice safety for speed when embracing AI,\u201d\n\nJeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer at Cisco, said.\n\nAnnounced on 15 January, the solution will be available in March for enterprises.\n\nBut what exactly does it include?\n\nSecurity for AI Development\n\nCisco\u2019s new solution is designed to provide comprehensive protection for both the development and utilisation of AI applications within an organisation, enabling businesses to feel confident to advance their AI initiatives.\n\nBuilt into Cisco\u2019s Security Cloud, AI Defense is part of a unified, AI-driven, cross-domain security ecosystem.\n\nThis includes the misuse of AI tools, data leakage and increasing cyberthreats, all of which existing point security offerings are not equipped to handle during the development, deployment and ongoing use of AI apps, Patel said.\n\nFused into the fabric of the network, Cisco AI Defense combines the unique ability to detect and protect against threats when developing and accessing AI applications without trade offs.\n\nBy utilising Cisco\u2019s experience in network visibility and control, with an extensive mesh of enforcement points that perform AI security at the network level, it stays ahead of evolving AI safety and security concerns.\n\nThis yields one of the key features of AI Defense, which is its ability to discover AI applications across public and private clouds.\n\nThis approach is particularly crucial as businesses move beyond public data and begin training models on proprietary information.\n\nWith some companies lacking a unified policy on generative AI use, with Deloitte showing nearly a third of UK employees who use the tech pay for it themselves, then this significantly increasing the associated risks.\n\nThis capability therefore allows security teams to gain a comprehensive understanding of who is building applications and the training sources they are using.\n\nBy detecting both shadow and sanctioned AI applications, organisations can maintain better control over their AI ecosystem.\n\nModel validation is another critical component of the AI Defense arsenal. As model tuning can lead to unexpected and potentially toxic outcomes, Cisco\u2019s solution incorporates automated testing that checks AI models for hundreds of potential safety and security issues.\n\nThis AI-driven algorithmic red team identifies vulnerabilities and recommends guardrails, enabling security teams to proactively address potential threats.\n\nRuntime security is also a focal point of the AI Defense platform.\n\nBy implementing continuous validation, the solution safeguards against ongoing safety and security threats such as prompt injection, denial of service attacks, and sensitive data leakage.\n\nThis is crucial as even the most highly developed AI models\u2014like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT\u2014has been prompted to reveal sensitive details about their inner workings and then had to be reworked.\n\nThis real-time protection ensures that AI applications remain secure throughout their lifecycle.\n\nAI Defense is therefore able to address critical security gaps in the lifecycle of enterprise AI.\n\nSecuring Access to AI Applications\n\nIn addition to visibility, the AI Defense solution empowers security teams with granular access control capabilities, allowing them to implement policies that restrict employee access to unsanctioned AI tools.\n\nThis feature is crucial in preventing unauthorised use of potentially risky AI applications that could compromise enterprise security.\n\nBy continuously safeguarding against threats and confidential data loss, the solution ensures protection from unauthorised access or exfiltration.\n\nThis keeps companies in tow with compliance with regulatory requirements, something Cisco is well attuned to having been actively involved in developing AI security industry standards for regulations like MITRE, OWASP, and NIST.\n\nIt is also set to prepare for securing the next iteration of AI. Unlike safety guardrails built into individual AI models, Cisco\u2019s AI Defense delivers consistent controls for a multi-model world.\n\nThe AI Defense platform is self-optimising, fed threat intelligence data from Cisco\u2019s cyber arm Cisco Talos, and leverages Cisco\u2019s proprietary machine learning models to detect and respond to ever-evolving AI safety and security concerns.\n\nAll this is able to seamlessly integrates with existing data flows, providing unparalleled visibility and control across the enterprise IT environment.\n\nCisco\u2019s Implementation of AI Security\n\nThe introduction of Cisco AI Defense comes at a critical time for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nAccording to Cisco\u2019s 2024 AI Readiness Index, only 29% of surveyed organizations feel fully equipped to detect and prevent unauthorised tampering with AI.\n\nDespite this being a comprehensive offer, Cisco is no stranger to implementing AI security, particularly when it comes to data loss.\n\nIts UCaaS arm Webex has implemented robust AI guardrails to keep users operating within safe and compliant parameters, designating input and model output to its Webex Virtual Agent as either \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cunsafe\u201d.",

They\u2019ve won on the business-model side, and they\u2019re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\n\nTech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

According to Cisco's 2024 AI Readiness Index, only 29% of those surveyed feel fully equipped to detect and prevent unauthorized tampering with AI. The security challenges are also new and complex, with AI applications being multi-model and multi-cloud. Vulnerabilities can occur at model or app level, while responsibility lies with different owners including developers, end users and vendors. As enterprises move beyond public data and begin training models on proprietary data, the risks only grow.\n\nTo unlock AI innovation and adoption, enterprises need a common layer of safety and security that protects every user and every application. AI Defense enables enterprises\u2019 AI transformations by addressing two urgent risks:\n\nDeveloping and Deploying Secure AI Applications: As AI becomes ubiquitous, enterprises will use and develop hundreds if not thousands of AI applications. Developers need one set of AI security and safety guardrails that work for every application.

It then offers a validation process to assess the different models being used to ensure they are assessed for risks. Finally, there are guardrails that prevent an application straying from a safe path.\n\nDJ Sampath, head of AI software and platform at Cisco, said partners as well as customers were adapting to an AI world, and developing their skills and capabilities around emerging technologies.\n\n\u201cPartners are also setting up their AI practices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to all of these partners, and they are figuring out ways of being able to serve their customers \u2026 how their customers are using AI.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re helping them implement it,\u201d said Sampath. \u201cThey\u2019re helping them secure it.

            "content": "on\n\nThe adoption of generative AI (GenAI) in customer experience software is reshaping how organizations engage with their customers. From self-service chatbots to agent assist tools, personalization in marketing, and predictive analytics in sales, GenAI promises transformative capabilities. However, while GenAI opens doors to innovation, it also introduces unique vulnerabilities that must be addressed to ensure trust, security, and reliability. We recently published a comprehensive report on GenAI Trust and Safety that can obtained courtesy of Parloa, providers of the AI Agent Management Platform.\n\nAs we integrate GenAI into customer-facing operations, several risks emerge. Large Language Models (LLMs), the backbone of many GenAI applications, are probabilistic tools. They generate responses based on patterns in data, which means they can inadvertently produce incorrect or misleading outputs, commonly referred to as \u201challucinations.\u201d Furthermore, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking attempts, where malicious users exploit the model to bypass safeguards and elicit inappropriate responses. To mitigate these risks, a robust defense strategy is essential.\n\nEnter Cisco AI Defense\n\nCisco\u2019s newly announced Cisco AI Defense product is designed to tackle these challenges head-on. This comprehensive tool offers organizations a way to monitor and secure their GenAI applications at the network layer. It also offers robust testing tools. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nAPI-Level Integration: By obtaining an API key and connecting it to the network over which API calls to LLMs are routed, the AI Defense application intercepts all incoming and outgoing traffic. This enables it to enforce guardrail policies across the entire communication channel.\n\nReal-Time Interception and Response: If a user attempts to jailbreak an LLM-powered application, AI Defense detects the attempt and ensures the LLM responds with predefined guardrail messages, such as \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help with that.\u201d If an LLM is tricked into offering sensitive data, the misstep can be stopped before the data is leaked.\n\nAlgorithmic Redteaming: AI Defense also offers \u201calgorithmic redteaming,\u201d a feature that simulates a wide range of potential attacks or exploitation attempts in a controlled environment. The insights from these simulations allow organizations to harden their applications against vulnerabilities before they are exposed to real-world users.\n\nImplications for CCaaS Vendors\n\nIn a pre-announcement demo offered to industry analysts, Senior Vice President of Cisco Security Product Management Raj Chopra stated that CCaaS vendors are ideal customers for Cisco AI Defense. CCaaS providers are increasingly embedding LLM-based chatbots and agent-assist tools into their platforms. By integrating AI Defense, CCaaS vendors can offer their customers added assurance that their GenAI solutions are equipped to detect and mitigate malicious inputs and problematic outputs at the network layer.\n\nThis approach aligns with a growing need for GenAI applications to not only deliver value but also inspire trust. CCaaS vendors already recognize the importance of building guardrails directly into their platforms. For those seeking a partner to augment these capabilities, Cisco\u2019s AI Defense provides an additional option.\n\nA Competitive Landscape\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Cisco is not alone in addressing the security challenges of GenAI. Several specialty vendors, covered in our recent GenAI Trust and Safety whitepaper, offer similar capabilities. These vendors have pioneered tools to address risks associated with LLMs, including malicious exploitation and response validation. Cisco\u2019s entry into this space underscores the growing importance of these defensive measures as GenAI becomes a standard component of customer experience technology.\n\nBuilding a Safer Future for GenAI\n\nThe benefits of GenAI in customer experience are undeniable, but the risks cannot be ignored. As we continue to leverage these powerful tools, it\u2019s critical to adopt strategies that ensure their safe and effective use. Cisco AI Defense offers a new a robust solution to assist organizations in proactively addressing the vulnerabilities of GenAI while maximizing its potential. For CCaaS vendors and other enterprises integrating LLM-based solutions, the question is no longer whether to invest in GenAI but how to secure it. With tools like Cisco AI Defense, businesses can strike a balance between innovation and security, paving the way for a future where GenAI enhances customer experiences without compromising trust.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be attending Enterprise Connect in Orlando this March, I invite you to attend my presentation on this topic.\n\nRelated\n\nCategories: Articles",

            "content": "When we spoke to Jeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s Chief Product Officer, a few years ago about Cisco\u2019s security ambitions, he promised a rolling thunder of announcements. Those have certainly come in recent years. Today\u2019s announcement is potentially a very important one. With AI Defense, Cisco wants to make it possible for organizations to adequately secure the AI it uses. We spoke with Patel about this latest addition to the security portfolio.\n\nThere has been very significant investment in recent years in the infrastructure needed to bring AI to consumers and organizations. It has made Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. However, adoption in the enterprise market is not yet very widespread. Patel cites a few figures in conversation with us. According to him, $225 billion is invested in setting up the infrastructure, but the revenue that companies get from inferencing at and by customers is only $10 billion. That\u2019s a pretty lopsided ratio. One of multiple reasons for this is that many organizations are concerned about the security of deploying AI. That\u2019s what AI Defense is supposed to solve.\n\nCisco and AI security\n\nToday\u2019s announcement of AI Defense is in itself not surprising. That is, Cisco (and specifically Jeetu Patel) has been talking about it for years. Before AI Defense could get there, however, Cisco had to take the necessary other steps. In recent years, Cisco has increasingly been positioning itself as a \u201cserious\u201d security player. Not that it didn\u2019t also have security solutions before 2020, but there wasn\u2019t nearly as much focus on them then as there has been since Patel\u2019s arrival that year.\n\nIn addition to big announcements such as the creation of the Cisco Security Cloud and related launch of Cisco XDR, last year there was the launch of Cisco Hypershield. In all the solutions, Cisco is using AI. That was step one, Patel points out. The company had to take that first in order to then take today\u2019s step. Cisco built AI Defense, like previous recent security products and services, from the ground up within Cisco. As usual, Cisco does integrate an acquisition into this. In the case of AI Defense, that\u2019s Robust Intelligence, a startup it acquired a few months ago that focused specifically on securing AI.\n\nWhat is Cisco AI Defense?\n\nThose who have followed Cisco\u2019s security developments to some extent will recognize much in AI Defense from Hypershield. By this we do not mean that it is a further development of that, but it does have a similar approach. Like Hypershield, AI Defense is a layer (a substrate, as Patel calls it) that Cisco has built as an overlay, spanning the AI that organizations use.\n\nRight now, things like security and guardrails still take place primarily at the level of the models that organizations use. That in itself is a good thing, Patel points out. However, it also means the models force organizations to use the capabilities and security that the the developers of the models build in. \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on that alone,\u201d he believes. \u201cYou have to have an overall layer that goes across all models and applications,\u201d he continues. For that, Cisco is obviously pretty well positioned. The platform approach it has for virtually its entire portfolio lends itself very well to that, at least in theory.\n\nAI Defense is going to do two things for organizations, Patel points out. \u201cIt enables organizations to secure AI applications and provides secure access to those applications,\u201d he promises. Cisco\u2019s other security components, by the way, play a role in this as well. Think in particular of Secure Access, the SSE product, and, of course, Hypershield. After all, the latter is Cisco\u2019s underlying security architecture.\n\nHow does Cisco plan to secure AI with AI Defense?\n\nThe above sounds very interesting, but what specifically does Cisco AI Defense do to secure AI? Patel lists three components of AI Defense. First, it provides insight into how AI applications work. That\u2019s the foundation; without knowing how applications work, you can\u2019t adequately secure them either. This component makes it possible to discover the use of AI within organizations. Even if employees are using AI that is not formally approved by organizations, which therefore also poses a risk, that can be made insightful with AI Defense.\n\nThe second component of AI Defense is that it provides services around validating AI that organizations deploy. An application works a certain way, but it must continue to do so. That is, companies generally don\u2019t want so-called model drift. After all, that could make an application no longer safe to use. You can think of this as an AI-driven red team. An algorithm that continuously automatically tests whether AI models work as intended. This component also provides advice to security teams to be able to curb certain behaviors.\n\nThe third component of AI Defense is a runtime engine. Whereas the previous two engines focus primarily on things like validation and providing insight into application operation, this one is about securing AI applications in real time. With this engine, organizations can ensure that users always use applications according to predefined rules and within predefined limits. Consider also detecting things like prompt injection, denial of service and leakage of sensitive data.\n\nSecurity in a multi-model world\n\nWith AI Defense, Cisco is taking what we think is a big, necessary and, in our opinion, extremely important step in the world of AI. Applications that use AI are still often seen as magical applications that can add a lot of value. However, the somewhat hidden operation of those applications also causes many (justified) doubts about putting them into use.\n\nIn particular, GenAI is non-deterministic. That means that while models provide predictive answers to questions, their actual contents of those answers is unpredictable. Cisco has now come up with something to address that with AI Defense, which should at least allow you to ensure that those models arrive at their answers in a safe manner. Even if organizations use multiple models, which they undoubtedly will in the future. With the runtime engine, AI Defense can also make sure that even while organizations use the models and applications, nothing unacceptable happens.\n\nAI Defense, as indicated, consists of three components/engines. These obviously do not operate in a vacuum. They are built on top of custom AI models for security. These were created and trained by Cisco itself. So here again we see AI becoming somewhat more focused on a specific use case. We wrote about this a few months ago when SentinelOne came out with its own security AI models.\n\nAll in all, Cisco spent about nine months building AI Defense. However, the vision is a lot older. AI Defense is a logical next step for the security platform Cisco has been building over the past few years.\n\nThe availability of AI Defense is also yet another motivation for customers to choose Cisco\u2019s platform and thus say goodbye to the necessary point solutions that organizations use. At least that\u2019s what Patel hopes and expects from it. Ultimately, other considerations will also come into play here, of course. While many organizations generally accept some degree of lock-in, they also do not want to be completely dependent on a single vendor. Hence Patel\u2019s emphasis toward the end of our conversation that Cisco\u2019s platform is also open, so customers can also use it on top of or alongside other security solutions.\n\nCisco AI Defense is available for customers in March of this year (2025).\n\nHere are some screenshots of Cisco AI Defense for illustration purposes:",

So what might the future hold for him and the Jaguars?\n\nESPN recently previewed the offseason for each of the NFL's non-playoff teams. Among a variety of topics, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler shared his insights into Cisco and whether the Jaguars will re-sign him.\n\nAlthough there is nothing concrete at this time in regards to what Cisco's future might look like, Fowler does think that because of his potential free agent market, Cisco could be playing elsewhere in 2025.\n\n\"His free agency market could be hard for Jacksonville to match due to his ball production,\" wrote Fowler. \"The Jaguars spent $300-plus million on players last year and might opt to reduce spending in March.\"\n\nCisco was a third-round pick by the Jaguars out of Syracuse in 2021. Ball production has been Cisco's calling card on the back end of the Jacksonville defense, generating eight interceptions and 11 pass breakups over the last three seasons. Opposing quarterbacks have a passer rating of 92.0 when targeting Cisco over the last four seasons.\n\nSpotrac is currently projecting that Cisco lands a four-year $59.1 million contract, with an average annual value of $14.8 million per season.\n\nSafety is going to be a big need for the Jaguars this offseason with currently Darnell Savage, Andrew Wingard, Daniel Thomas, and Antonio Johnson the only players under contract for the 2025 season.\n\nAs a secondary, the Jaguars allowed a league-worst 7.5 yards per pass attempt in 2024, showcasing the efficiency and big play ability opposing quarterbacks had against this unit.",

            "content": "Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar has a slew of legislative priorities he\u2019ll be pushing in the upcoming session.\n\nSecretary of State Cisco Aguilar and his office are proposing a wide range of legislation in the upcoming legislative session addressing Nevada\u2019s elections and business systems, from regulating the use of artificial intelligence to modernizing commercial recordings.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019re trying to do is really focused on \u2018how does it impact the Nevadan?\u2019\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cHow do we take the politics out of the conversation? How do we work in a collaborative way to get people to come to the table to drive a solution forward?\u201d\n\nHere are five bills that could make their way through the legislative process and be signed into law.\n\n1. Artificial intelligence in elections\n\nAssembly Bill 73 would require campaign-related communications, such as an advertisement or a request for donation, to disclose whether it has been manipulated with artificial intelligence. It also would create a public database for communications that have disclosed the use of AI for both the public and the secretary of state to review.\n\n\u201cIt is making sure that voters have accurate information, that they\u2019re getting correct information, or if they\u2019re being given synthetic media that they are made aware that it\u2019s synthetic media,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\n2. Voting changes\n\nA sweeping election bill, Senate Bill 74, proposes several changes to the state\u2019s election systems, including allowing for people with disabilities or physical barriers to vote online using the state\u2019s EASE program and requiring the secretary of state to adopt a cyber-incident response plan for elections.\n\nIt also proposes changing the voter registration party affiliation process. If someone registers to vote without an affiliated party, it would list affiliation as \u201cno political party\u201d rather than \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d\n\nThrough another election-related bill yet to be numbered, Aguilar would also like to expand the use of EASE to include people in local jails.\n\nHe will also address issues Aguilar and clerks observed through the 2024 election, such as ensuring that the counties have the resources to process ballots in a timely manner.\n\nClark County had 98 percent of the ballots on hand election night, and 90 percent of the results were released that night, Aguilar said. That remaining 8 to 10 percent needs to become more efficient, he said.\n\n\u201cThe clerks have done a phenomenal job; our elections went well,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cIt\u2019s the processing that we really have to focus on, and we know that\u2019s our issue.\u201d\n\n3. Campaign finances\n\nAssembly Bill 79 makes changes to campaign finances in the state in order to align with the Federal Election Commission and clarifies the roles of political action committees, according to Aguilar.\n\nIt includes authorizing an elected public officer to use unspent campaign contributions to pay for child care costs, caring for an elderly parent or for health insurance premiums if they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it due to serving in office.\n\n4. Fund for investment fraud victims\n\nAguilar will also re-introduce Senate Bill 76 to create a fund that would compensate victims of securities fraud. The goal of the fund is not only to compensate victims of fraud so they are not completely set back, but also to encourage people to come forward and hold bad actors accountable, he said.\n\nInvestment fraud impacts the retirement community heavily, Aguilar said, and \u201cwhen you\u2019ve worked really hard your whole life to build up a savings to be able to live the life you want to live, and you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud, it sets you back,\u201d he said.\n\n5. Commercial licensing\n\nSenate Bill 75 concerns commercial recordings and seeks to expand language access for Nevadans by allowing forms to be filed in different languages other than English. It also would allow the secretary of state to better respond to the market by adjusting the price of the state business license, according to Aguilar.\n\nAguilar said his goal is for Nevada to compete with states like Delaware, which is considered to be the \u201cking of the business file\u201d and great at attracting businesses. If the secretary of state has flexibility to respond to market conditions, the state can be more competitive, Aguilar said.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the Delaware of the West,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be aggressive in making sure business owners understand why Nevada is the place to do business.\u201d\n\nContact Jessica Hill at jehill@reviewjournal.com.

This has profound impacts on how businesses navigate issues such as the ongoing skills gap, as well as their sustainability and security journeys.\n\nHere are six key trends we see defining the Philippines\u2019s business landscape in 2025.\n\n1. AI continues to take center stage, but not without harsh reality checks\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of years now since artificial intelligence (AI) became the dominant theme of the business world. The pressure to deploy it is relentless, with almost all companies in Cisco\u2019s 2024 AI Readiness Index reporting a heightened urgency to implement AI solutions over the past year.\n\nAs companies embark on their AI adoption journeys, they are realizing that leveraging AI is not as straightforward as anticipated. Only 22% of companies in the Philippines are fully ready to capture AI\u2019s potential, as reality sets in on what is needed to succeed. Despite AI being a priority investment, many companies are saying that returns on these investments are falling short of expectations.\n\nThe primary challenge remains infrastructure readiness, with gaps in compute, data centre network performance, and cybersecurity, among other areas. Only about one-fifth (22%) of companies have the necessary GPUs to meet current and future AI demands and less than half (45%) have the capabilities to protect data in AI models with end\u2013to\u2013end encryption, security audits, continuous monitoring, and instant threat response.\n\nAs companies weigh the decision to build or buy AI solutions, modernizing data centres and leveraging plug-and-play AI infrastructure that evolves with their needs without adding complexity is crucial. Cisco\u2019s AI PODS, for instance, offer infrastructure stacks tailored for specific AI use cases, integrating compute, networking, storage, and cloud management. This provides companies with a flexible starting point that can be easily adapted to meet their specific needs.\n\n2. As AI becomes more accessible and ubiquitous, guardrails and data governance will become a key area of focus\n\nAs AI systems become more integrated into everyday life, discussions will focus on the responsible use, compliance, data protection, and anti-discrimination laws and AI quality standards.\n\nCollaboration between public and private sectors will be crucial to establish standards and baseline regulations that promote innovation and enhance AI safety. Global leaders will face mounting pressure to implement frameworks that improve the accountability of AI systems and address ethical and misinformation issues arising out of the use of AI, without inhibiting innovation. Companies will need to adopt responsible AI frameworks, conduct regular privacy assessments, and develop and implement a robust incident management plan to ensure judicious AI use.\n\nData privacy and security is another tenet of AI governance. As organizations increasingly operate across multiple jurisdictions, there will be increasing pressure on them to adopt measures that align data storage and processing with local data sovereignty laws. The next generation of privacy laws will continue to drive transparency, fairness, and accountability in spaces like data collection and use, cross-border data flows, and verifiable compliance. Companies will have to consider how their employees interact with AI systems and develop strategies to mitigate data breaches and associated risks through mock drills and continuous monitoring.\n\n3. Cybersecurity moves to machine scale and networks will move from connecting to also protecting everything\n\nNetworks will no longer just be used to connect. As more devices and services get connected, the risk and sophistication of attacks become greater. For example, social engineering attacks are more accessible given the amount of data that people share online with different platforms. Supply chain attacks also pose a problem, given the complicated web of technology suppliers that many businesses use in their operations. Advances in areas like quantum computing will further complicate the landscape. All of this will push cybersecurity to move at machine scale.\n\nThe network will emerge as a crucial pillar in managing workloads and serving as both the first and last line of security defence. This will become increasingly important as attacks conduct lateral movement attacks where they use one entry point to infiltrate the rest of the network to penetrate deeper into organizational systems.\n\nAI will also transform security, assisting security teams and simplifying tool management, augmenting human insights, and automating complex workflows. Innovations that infuse security into the fabric of the network like Hypershield, architected to insert security enforcement into advanced silicon in servers and network devices, will redefine businesses\u2019 ability to detect and respond to threats more effectively, and update and patch it all with lean teams.\n\nThe next great frontier of security involves not only securing businesses\u2019 own four walls but also the extensive ecosystem of partners and vendors they rely on. As hyper distributed defences and federated data become the norm, companies that can leverage network will become self-defending digitally resilient enterprises.\n\n4. Companies will need help to balance sustainability and growth in an AI-powered era\n\nThe race to AI will continue to accelerate, leading to higher power consumption levels, which will impact carbon emissions across all scopes. By 2027, AI usage alone is predicted to use as much water as all of New Zealand. In a world where net-zero goals and carbon emission reductions target loom large, companies need to find solutions that balance sustainability goals with the growth opportunities that AI brings.\n\nTo achieve this balance, businesses will increasingly seek partners who can provide energy-efficient products and solutions or help them adopt circular business models aligned with their net-zero timelines. AI itself will play a crucial role in unlocking efficiencies for businesses. We see AI heralding a new era of energy networking, which combines software-defined networking capabilities, and an electric power system made up of direct current (DC) micro grids. This will enhance energy efficiency while delivering increased visibility, insights, and automation. Power over Ethernet is another innovative solution, delivering DC power to devices over copper ethernet cabling, which eliminates the need for separate power supplies and outlets.\n\nTechnological advancements in materials and design processes also contribute to balancing sustainability needs. Architectures like Cisco Silicon One chip exemplifies this by performing tasks faster and more efficiently with less hardware, reducing overall power consumption while minimizing electronic waste by extending device lifespans. Takeback and Reuse programs that allow companies to return hardware that has reached end-of-use will be important.\n\n5. Humans and AI will co-exist in the next generation workforce\n\nThe future of work won\u2019t be a binary choice between humans and machines; rather both will coexist to get work done. AI will evolve from just supporting tasks to forming an integral part of the future workforce, helping to address skills shortages across various roles. The pressing talent shortage in the technology sector is very real and is compounded by the ageing populations in many countries, especially so in Asia. Increased mobility of talent, and extremely diverse populations coming into the workplace will help to relieve some of those pressures.\n\nThis will also translate into benefits at work. Employees who can harness AI for their work will outperform others who do not use AI, achieving better quality of work, productivity, and efficiency. Possessing the right skillsets to leverage AI will be crucial to any technical and non-technical role. Every employee will have to upskill themselves to stay relevant.\n\nInitiatives like the Cisco Networking Academy, which provides digital skills training including cybersecurity, are crucial in bridging the digital skills gap. As technology continues to advance, it is vital to persistently upskill, stay relevant, and leverage the latest innovations.\n\n6. A thriving workplace will rely on the value the office brings to work and the foundation of trust it builds\n\nReturning to the office should be a magnet, not a mandate. As we envision the future of work, it will be a tech-enabled one where job roles continue to evolve alongside technological advancements, much like the transition from fax to email and are now connected from anywhere. Work will happen in tech-enabled spaces and people will naturally seek the flexibility that technology brings to their personal lives in their work routines. This shift will raise questions around the value that the physical office will add to work.\n\nAs employees shift their mindset from coming to the office to do heads-down work to using this as an opportunity to connect, innovate and collaborate with their teams, employers need to cultivate an environment that supports this type of work.\n\nWhether it\u2019s about the type of work, the location it\u2019s performed, or who it\u2019s done by, trust is a crucial element at every stage of the process. Employers must trust that they have hired the right people for the right roles, and they will deliver the goals set for them. Likewise, employees must trust that their efforts will be recognized and rewarded by their employers, with opportunities for growth and development. Trust will become a reciprocal relationship, and the ability to foster this trust will distinguish high-performing teams and companies from the rest.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Stories",

            "content": "Cisco has shared some of the key trends it is predicting to make an impact on businesses in 2025.\n\nUnsurprisingly, AI features heavily, with Agentic AI in particular being mentioned.\n\nCisco noted that, \u201cAI is no longer just a tool \u2013 it is becoming a true collaborator.\u201d\n\nWe are now a couple of weeks into the new year, but this week will likely see the return to the office of those workers who maximised the time spent on leave during the holidays. With the return to work comes a need to prioritise the important tasks and projects for the rest of the year. It is with this mind that Cisco has outlined some key technology trends for 2025, with Agentic AI in particular being highlighted.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Agentic AI, it is described as the next evolution of generative AI. More specifically, NDVIDA terms it as AI, \u201cwhich uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgentic AI systems ingest vast amounts of data from multiple sources to independently analyze challenges, develop strategies and execute tasks like supply chain optimization, cybersecurity vulnerability analysis and helping doctors with time-consuming tasks,\u201d the silicon maker added.\n\nWith the past two years seeing many businesses and organisation grappling with generative AI and how best to implement it within their environments, it looks like those which were quick to embrace the pervasive technology are now gearing up to take the next step and leave laggards behind.\n\nTo that end, Cisco believes that Agentic AI will \u201ctake the center stage\u201d in 2025. Unpacking this trend and others was Liz Centoni, EVP and chief customer experience officer at Cisco.\n\n\u201cAI is no longer just a tool \u2013 it is becoming a true collaborator. Many AI-powered tools in use today are based on static rules or datasets. Agentic AI differs in that it can continuously learn from user inputs and integrate contextual information (think: account history, network environment, user behavior patterns and preferences), and make decisions with little to no human oversight,\u201d she explained in a release shared with Hypertext.\n\n\u201cIn other words, unlike today\u2019s approaches that require user prompts or predefined rules, agentic AI will operate proactively,\u201d she added.\n\nPositing potential use cases, Centoni envisioned a, \u201ccustomer service AI that was imbued with the capability to predict user needs before a query is made, or a network management AI that identifies potential issues and resolves them autonomously, ensuring uninterrupted service. \u201d\n\n\u201cThese AI agents will not just interact with humans or devices directly, but will also be able to discover, learn, and collaborate with each other to form complex workflows and/or chains of operations to automate even advanced business functions. For instance, multiple AI agents could automate supply chain management by coordinating with each other to forecast demand, optimize inventories, coordinate deliveries, and even negotiate with suppliers. For businesses, this shift means a leap in efficiency and personalization. It also underscores the importance of governance and guardrails,\u201d Centoni continued.\n\n\u201cIn response to the rise of Agentic AI, we will see organizations implementing mandatory ethical guidelines to ensure fairness and transparency in algorithmic decisions and protecting intellectual property,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAlong with Agentic AI, some of the other 2025 tech trends highlighted by Cisco (six in total) include the \u201cfirst instances of humanoids and humans working together\u201d. Added to this will be companies having to grapple with the challenges of AI implementation, as well as new AI-powered cybersecurity threats.\n\nWhile AI will bring some headaches that must be addressed by businesses, it will also bring benefits according to Cisco, such as a significant drop in network downtime due to misconfiguration, along with the need to balance sustainability and growth in the AI era.\n\n[Image \u2013 Photo by Igor Omilaev on Unsplash]",

            "content": "With UC becoming more integral to enterprise operations with each passing day, security is paramount.\n\nOf course, providers like Microsoft, Zoom, or Webex understand this, and therefore, all of their platforms have certain levels of built-in security to secure their customers and their data while using the platform.\n\nHowever, in an age of growing cyber attacks, no longer is it enough to worry about your own safety solutions and procedures. It is now essential you keep an eye out for your UCaaS provider and how secure it is.\n\nThink this is overblown? Think back to summer 2024, when cybersecurity company CrowdStrike sent out an update that caused computer systems across the world to go down for days.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t a cyber attack that caused it, it highlights downtime, for whatever reason, can be devastating. So understanding how your service provider is protected may be a key part of your enterprise\u2019s data resilience strategy.\n\nOne way to ascertain this is by looking at the data centres that underpin your service. It is here, that UCaaS provider Webex stand out.\n\nWhere Webex stands\n\nHQ\u2019d in California, USA, Webex is a comprehensive cloud-based collaboration platform developed by Cisco, designed to enhance communication and teamwork through video conferencing, messaging, and calling solutions.\n\nWebex offers a suite of applications including Webex Meetings, Webex Teams, and Webex Calling, which facilitate seamless interactions for both remote and in-office teams.\n\nAs of June 2024, Webex Calling has over 15 million users in more than 160 markets and its CCaaS service Webex Contact Center seats surged by 75 percent in the same year.\n\nThe platform is recognised for its high-definition video quality, robust security features, and ability to integrate with various business applications.\n\nThe Global Network of Data Centres\n\nAt the heart of Webex\u2019s infrastructure is a strategically distributed network of data centres.\n\nThese facilities support Webex\u2019s global operations, ensuring seamless communication and collaboration for millions of users worldwide.\n\nAlthough operated under a Cisco umbrella with multiple data centres around the world, Webex services recieves many dedicated decisions when it comes to its operation.\n\nJust last winter, Webex announced it had opened a new data centre in Manchester.\n\nSpeaking at the time of the announcement, VP of Product Management at Cisco Amey Parandekar said:\n\n\u201cThe continued expansion of the Webex platform allows customers to meet evolving regulatory and compliance requirements and demonstrates our commitment to driving continuous service enhancements for our global Webex Calling customer base.\u201d\n\nThis was the second opened in the country, with an existing data centre already in London.\n\nEqually, both UK data centres support multi-tenant and Dedicated Instance deployment models for Webex Calling.\n\nThe fact there are two data centres and both focusing on the same thing bring two things to its customers.\n\nFirstly, it brings Webex services closer to end-users and strengthens the capacity to reduce latency and improve performance.\n\nSecondly, it provides crucial redundancy, enhancing the platform\u2019s resilience against potential outages or disruptions.\n\nIn laymans terms, what this means is if one data centre goes down for whatever reason, the other one can remain operational and still provide services from the country.\n\nWebex state that any failure of an individual server in a group initiates transparent routing of requests to other available servers within the WebEx Collaboration Cloud.\n\nEqually, Blocklevel replication of data across servers and data centres speeds fault and disaster recovery in the event of system failures, power outages, and other events that can affect entire sites or geographies.\n\nIndeed, when looking at Webex Calling data centres, this pairing contigency seems to be across the board.\n\nThere are two data centres in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and in the EU (Germany and Netherlands).\n\nA Multi-Layered Approach to Security\n\nAlthough the service offered is incorporeal, the data centres that keep Webex afloat are very much real.\n\nAlthough not as often considered by the end user, the physical security of data centres is often considered a key component of security.\n\nCisco employs a multi-layered security model that encompasses physical site security, network-based protection, and data safeguards.\n\nAccess is tightly controlled through a combination of biometric systems, video surveillance, and strict personnel protocols.\n\nEqually, only authorised Cisco security personnel and accompanied visitors can enter these facilities, ensuring the physical integrity of the infrastructure.\n\nOn the network level, Webex utilises advanced firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring to protect against cyber threats.\n\nAll communications between Webex

So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (HOV) and Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. (PPIH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past six months (+6.6% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\n\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds is a concern for investors.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Alphabet have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+38.6% vs. +33%). The company is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products.\n\n\n\nGOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers. Alphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver.\n\n\n\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on Google\u2019s search engine. GOOGL outperformed its industry in the trailing 12 months. However, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\n\n\nCisco shares have narrowly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+21% vs. +20.2%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Hovnanian have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the past year (-27.6% vs. -4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $749 million is facing profitability issues due to declining margins and heavy reliance on incentives to drive affordability. Elevated land investments and regional concentration increase vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\n\n\nReliance on incentives heightens financial risks, while competition and external disruptions threaten growth and market position. Nevertheless, Hovnanian has demonstrated strong revenue growth and operational efficiency, capitalizing on resilient housing demand and effective sales strategies.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on expanding its community footprint and quick move-in homes positions it for sustained growth. Strategic land investments boost growth, while cost discipline sustains profitability. With a commitment to aligning growth initiatives with market trends, Hovnanian is well-positioned to deliver strong returns and shareholder value.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Hovnanian here >>>)\n\n\n\nPerma-Pipe International\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Steel - Pipe and Tube industry over the past year (+49.3% vs. +26.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $106.85 million has a backlog which grew 33% to over $100 million by November, reflecting strong demand in key markets like oil and gas and district energy. Geographic diversification, including $61 million in recent contracts across MENA and the Americas, reduces regional risks while positioning the company for growth in energy and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIts focus on high-growth markets aligns with robust infrastructure development, supported by proprietary technologies like the XTRU-THERM insulation system, bolstering market leadership. The company\u2019s tailored solutions cater to high-margin sectors, ensuring operational resilience.\n\n\n\nLong-term demand is underpinned by global steel pipe market growth, fueled by investments in infrastructure and urbanization. However, exposure to cyclical markets, intense competition, geopolitical risks and regulatory compliance costs present challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Perma-Pipe International here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), The Charles Schwab Corp.

            "content": "Network segmentation remains a critical security requirement, yet organizations struggle with traditional approaches that demand extensive hardware investments, complex policy management, and disruptive network changes. Healthcare and manufacturing sectors face particular challenges as they integrate diverse endpoints \u2013 from legacy medical devices to IoT sensors \u2013 onto their production networks. These devices often lack robust security hardening, creating significant vulnerabilities that traditional segmentation solutions struggle to address.\n\nElisity aims to solve these challenges through an innovative approach that leverages existing network infrastructure while providing identity-based microsegmentation at the network edge. Rather than requiring new hardware, agents or complex network redesigns, Elisity customers run a few lightweight virtual connectors (called Elisity Virtual Edge) to enforce security policies through organizations' current switching infrastructure.\n\nIn this hands-on review, we'll examine Elisity's technical capabilities and real-world applicability based on testing in a simulated healthcare environment that mirrors common enterprise deployment scenarios. To get a personalized demo, visit the Elisity website here.\n\nIdentity-First Architecture\n\nAt the core of Elisity's platform is the Cloud Control Center, which provides centralized policy management and visibility. During testing, we saw how \"Elisity's Virtual Edge\" components can be deployed either directly on supported switches (Cisco Catalyst 9K series) or as VMs or containers in private clouds or on networks, they integrate with existing network switches including Cisco, Juniper and Arista. The test environment demonstrates that Elisity can manage segmentation at both a series of clinics that connect to the network with Cisco 9300 and 3850 switches, and hospital sites with a Cisco 9300 running the Elisity Virtual Edge on it.\n\nThe Elisity IdentityGraph engine proves particularly impressive in practice. Beyond just discovering devices, it correlates identity data from multiple sources into what Elisity calls \"core effective attributes\" - a consolidated view of the most valid and trusted data about each asset. During testing, we saw it pull data simultaneously from Active Directory, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike and other sources, creating rich contextual profiles that inform policy decisions.\n\nBecause Elistiy's Virtual Edge \"connectors\" are connected corporate networks they discover and sees more than just the device details, it also sends network flow data to Elisity's Cloud Control Center. This level of integration enables the platform to correlate \"who is talking to who\".\n\nPolicy Creation and Management\n\nAll of this correlated meta data for users, workloads and devices becomes valuable with Elisity access policy capabilities. The policy interface uses an intuitive matrix visualization that clearly shows relationships between asset groups. A key feature demonstrated was the ability to classify assets dynamically based on multiple criteria. For example, we watched an unauthorized laptop get automatically reclassified into an authorized radiology group based on matching ServiceNow asset tags, device type, and CrowdStrike EDR status.\n\nThe platform includes powerful features for policy refinement:\n\nLearning mode to understand actual traffic patterns\n\nPolicy simulation before enforcement\n\nTraffic flow analytics overlaid on the policy matrix\n\nThe ability to lock assets in specific groups (particularly valuable for OT environments)\n\nA particularly useful feature is the traffic flow analysis view, which overlays actual communication patterns on the policy matrix. This helps administrators identify unused paths that can be safely blocked and validate policy changes before enforcement.\n\nHealthcare Use Case Deep Dive\n\nTo evaluate real-world applicability, we tested a common healthcare scenario: securing legacy medical devices running outdated operating systems. The platform automatically discovered our simulated medical equipment and provided granular visibility into their communication patterns.\n\nThe demo showed how easily policies could be created for diverse medical equipment including X-ray machines, CT scanners, and EHR systems. A particularly valuable example demonstrated blocking specific ports (like SSH port 22) to legacy medical devices running outdated operating systems while maintaining necessary clinical access.\n\nPerformance and Scale\n\nTesting revealed minimal performance impact from Elisity's enforcement mechanisms. By leveraging switch ASICs for policy enforcement, the solution maintained sub-millisecond latency with no noticeable throughput reduction. The distributed architecture handled our test load efficiently, suggesting good scalability for enterprise deployments.\n\nThe deployment process proved remarkably straightforward, taking under 30 minutes per site with no network downtime. This efficiency stems from Elisity's container-based approach and ability to work with existing infrastructure.\n\nAreas for Enhancement\n\nWhile Elisity delivers on its core promise, some areas could be improved. The wireless integration capabilities have recently been expanded to include Cisco Catalyst 9800 wireless controllers supporting inter and intra SSID segmentation or alternatively on the switch where the AP or Controller connects to the network which could be significant for healthcare environments with increasing wireless device adoption. Additionally, while the policy interface is intuitive, more predefined templates would help accelerate initial deployment.\n\nWe also noted that some manual policy tuning was needed to optimize rules for specific use cases. While the platform provides good visibility for this tuning, additional automation could streamline this process. We do note that Elisity informed us that they are launching Elisity Intelligence in early 2025, which they say will provide a stronger automated policy recommendation engine.\n\nPublic Case Study Example\n\nElisity shares that a leading U.S. health system with 800+ hospitals and healthcare clinics achieved remarkable efficiency gains and cost savings by implementing Elisity, reducing total costs from $38M to $9M - a 76% TCO reduction. The implementation required only 2 staff members per site instead of 14, with deployment taking just 4-10 hours per location while avoiding downtime and patient care disruption. Elisity's platform discovered and classified 99% of devices within 4 hours and eliminated the need for costly IoMT device re-IP processes, and provided automated, continuous device inventory updates to their CMDB with comprehensive network visibility across all locations. Read more on Elisity's successful deployments in healthcare, pharma and manufacturing on their website.\n\nConclusion\n\nElisity successfully addresses the primary challenges of traditional microsegmentation approaches while providing a practical path to implementation. The solution's ability to leverage existing infrastructure while delivering identity-based controls makes it particularly valuable for organizations with diverse endpoint types and complex segmentation requirements.\n\nDuring testing, we were particularly impressed by Elisity's incident response capabilities. The platform allows organizations to maintain multiple policy sets - including pre-configured \"locked down\" policies that can be rapidly deployed via their SOAR playbooks or API integrations, if ransomware or other threats are detected.\n\nThe platform's rapid deployment capabilities and minimal performance impact make it a compelling option for enterprises looking to improve their security posture without massive infrastructure investments. While some aspects like wireless integration could be enhanced, Elisity offers a pragmatic approach to implementing microsegmentation across the enterprise.\n\nFor organizations struggling with traditional segmentation approaches, particularly those in healthcare and manufacturing sectors, Elisity provides a clear path forward that balances security requirements with operational realities.

Huang had said that such a deployment should take four years complete. The cluster is in a data center outside of Memphis, Tennessee, and will be used for all things GenAI.\n\nHeat rumors start up again, just in time for earnings\n\nFor the second time, reports of heat problems with Nvidia\u2019s newest processors came out right before the release of earnings. In this case, the report stated that due to heat from the Blackwell chips, servers needed to be redesigned to accommodate the heat. This was dismissed by Nvidia on its earnings call \u2013 and at the same time, Nvidia reported revenue gains of 17% compared to the prior quarter and 94% compared to the prior year.\n\nAI factory designs\n\nNvidia released reference designs for what it calls AI factories, or data centers dedicated to AI processing. The company had been talking about AI factories for some time, but this was finally a blueprint telling people how to build one.\n\nEdge computing platform for AI processing\n\nNvidia launched a new platform called EGX Platform designed to bring real-time artificial intelligence to edge networks. The idea is to put AI computing closer to where sensors collect data before it is sent to larger data centers. This serves as a buffer to whittle down the data sent to data centers so only relevant data is sent down the wire for processing. This can be up to 90% or more of data collected is discarded.\n\nVerizon, Nvidia team up for enterprise AI networking\n\nNvidia announced a partnership with Verizon to build AI services for enterprises that run workloads over Verizon\u2019s 5G private network. Dubbed 5G Private Network with Enterprise AI, it will run a range of AI applications and workloads over Verizon\u2019s private 5G network with Mobile Edge Compute (MEC), a colocated infrastructure that is a part of Verizon\u2019s public wireless network.",

            "content": "In 2025, artificial intelligence and cyber security technologies in particular will continue to develop. For Cisco, Liz Centoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer, takes a look at six tech and AI trends that are reshaping the interaction between man and machine.\n\n1 AI agents for more personalization and efficiency\n\nPredicting customer needs or recognizing and automatically solving potential problems in the company network: in 2025, AI will go from being a tool to an assistant. This is because instead of working reactively with user input, rules or data sets, agent-based AI works proactively. It continuously learns from ongoing processes and makes decisions with little or no human interaction. AI agents will soon be able to work together to map complex workflows and automate advanced business functions. For companies, this development means greater efficiency. However, it requires binding ethical guidelines to ensure fairness and transparency and to protect intellectual property.\n\n2 AI-supported humanoids lead to new dynamics in the workplace\n\nHumanoid, human-like robots with AI functions will be part of the workforce in our own companies as early as 2025. This will also result in new workplace dynamics: companies must ensure that their connectivity has low latency and sufficient throughput, for example. This is because the performance of humanoids depends on how well they can process and analyze data in real time. At the same time, companies must protect humanoids from cyberattacks and manipulation of their software and commands. Managers should also allay human employees' fears of losing their jobs.\n\n3 AI increases the requirements for infrastructure and data provision\n\nAI promises innovation. However, the further the development progresses, the higher the hurdles become: For example, the Cisco AI Readiness Index shows that only five percent of companies in Switzerland are able to exploit the full potential of AI-supported technologies. Strategic partners are needed to identify and prioritize AI use cases, train teams and modernize infrastructures. IT teams are challenged more than ever to optimize the management, hygiene, tagging and organization of data that is currently spread across multiple systems and locations.\n\n4. new cyber threats and improved security through AI\n\nIn 2025, companies will need to improve their security measures to cope with new types of cyber attacks. These include Promt injection attacks that masquerade as legitimate user input in generative AI systems. With the advent of quantum computers, companies should also begin to introduce quantum-resistant security protocols to protect sensitive data. At the same time, social engineering and supply chain attacks are likely to increase due to increasing networking. Here again, AI can support human security teams, strengthen the network as a central defense system and consistently enforce policies.\n\n5 AI reduces network outages\n\nThe continuous availability of the IT network is becoming increasingly important for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The use of AI is promising to avoid manual misconfigurations and ensure uninterrupted operation. Intelligent tools can run automated workflows throughout the network lifecycle and provide traceability for every action. They revolutionize network management and assurance by learning from configurations and performing benchmarks.\n\n6 AI requires new solutions for sustainability\n\nAI consumes a lot of energy. In 2025, companies will therefore increasingly be looking for partners to realize their net-zero commitments and sustainability goals. However, AI can also play a decisive role in unlocking new potential in terms of energy savings: software-defined network technologies can be combined with an electrical energy system consisting of direct current microgrids (DC microgrids). This enables improved transparency of emissions as well as a platform for optimizing energy consumption, distribution and storage.\n\nSource: www.cisco.com\n\n(Visited 99 times, 1 visits today)",

Security technologies must continue to be a priority as well.\n\n\u201c2025 will be an important year for Cisco as the company executes ambitious internal changes while looking to capitalize on a dynamic external environment driven by the AI opportunity,\u201d said Brandon Butler, senior research manager, enterprise networks, with IDC.\n\nRevamped leadership will play a role: In August 2024, Cisco announced plans to reconfigure its networking, security and collaboration business units as part of a restructuring that included a 7% global workforce reduction and established Jeetu Patel as chief product officer.\n\n\u201cAs for the internal changes, the ascension of Jeetu Patel to executive vice president and chief product officer is a significant move for the company.

            "content": "Rebecca Simons lets curiosity lead the way. It\u2019s guided her from energy policy to defense and space, and now to her role as external communications manager at Cisco.\n\nSimons has crafted executive narratives for companies like Lockheed Martin during key moments like the Artemis I Mission. Now leading external communications at Cisco IT, she\u2019s sharing stories during the AI revolution at the world\u2019s largest networking company.\n\nFrom Lockheed Martin\u2019s Artemis I Mission to shaping stories at Cisco, how do you make tech and space seem exciting for everyone\u2014whether it\u2019s a C-suite exec or a global audience?\n\nZoom Out: Space isn\u2019t just \u201cout there\u201d\u2014it impacts life here on Earth. When I was at Lockheed Martin, gearing up for comms around Artemis I, headlines were dominated by billionaire \u201cjoyrides\u201d to space. Meanwhile, people on Earth were navigating incredibly challenging times (think back to 2021 and 2022). The question was: How do you make space exploration missions resonate in that context?\n\nHow I Do It: Start by identifying your audience, their pain points, and what\u2019s happening at both macro and micro levels. Then, tie innovation to everyday realities.\n\nGPS, for example, began as US military tech but now powers precision farming, supports climate research, and even helps you find your new favorite coffee shop. Simply put, what happens in space can make life on Earth better.\n\nThe Key: Always start with the human connection. Technology resonates when it solves real problems, inspires people, or makes life better.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s navigated everything from defense to AI at Cisco, what\u2019s the most unexpected story or angle you\u2019ve had to craft that surprised you?\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal sought a Cisco executive\u2019s perspective on Europe\u2019s landmark AI regulations, my role wasn\u2019t about crafting a response \u2014 it was about connecting the dots across teams \u2014 regional government affairs, legal and technical.\n\nThe Outcome: By aligning viewpoints and enabling a narrative that highlighted Cisco\u2019s leadership, we positioned the company as a trusted voice in a complex, shifting landscape. This also led to additional speaking opportunities for our executives at key industry forums.\n\nThe surprise? Communications isn\u2019t just about creating content: it\u2019s about advising at a strategic level and connecting people, ideas and insights to shape a conversation that leads to real impact.\n\nTech can sometimes feel overwhelming. Any tips for turning complexity into something everyone can understand?\n\nHere\u2019s my framework:\n\nDefine the problem in one sentence. Connect it to something familiar. Highlight the human impact.\n\nExample: Quantum computing.\n\nProblem: Regular computers have limitations when it comes to solving really hard problems.\n\nFamiliar connection: Imagine a regular computer flips through pages of a book one by one to find a word, while a quantum computer sees all the pages at once and finds the word instantly.\n\nImpact: It could lead to big breakthroughs in medicine, networking, transportation and other areas.\n\nI\u2019ve applied this approach in various communications opportunities at Cisco, ensuring that even the most complex technologies are accessible and engaging for our audience.\n\nClarity builds trust. Simplify the story.\n\nIf you could pick one tech gadget or innovation to communicate about for the rest of your life, what would it be \u2014 and why?\n\nThe internet: because it\u2019s always changing, and it\u2019s where we spend a huge portion of our lives (for better or worse).\n\nAI has been part of search engines for years, but now it\u2019s reaching new heights. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing the rise of niche communities: think Substack newsletters or Instagram Broadcast Channels. The internet is in a constant state of evolution, always offering something new to navigate.\n\nIn this context, success depends on being aware of your environment. If you\u2019re on TikTok, you don\u2019t distribute a white paper. If you\u2019re briefing analysts, memes won\u2019t work.\n\nThe advice I give leaders: Always zoom out before you zoom in. Ask: Who is your audience, where are they, and what do they need from you?\n\nLooking ahead, agentic AI will take personalization to a whole new level, transforming how insights are delivered and how communicators engage with audiences.\n\nFor communicators, adaptability is key. It\u2019s not about mastering one trend; it\u2019s about understanding the dynamic flow of the internet. How do you reach audiences who crave personal connection while navigating an AI-driven world? The answer lies in balancing human authenticity with strategic innovation.\n\nMoral of the story: Adaptability wins. If something is always changing (like the internet), it can never get boring. As communicators, we face its challenges daily, and for me, it\u2019s one I enjoy tackling every time.\n\nHow do you recharge in your free time?\n\nWellness is my reset button. Pilates and Lagree keep me grounded, and I\u2019m always exploring new biohacking experiments like red light therapy, sauna, and neurofeedback. I\u2019ve been fascinated by how neurofeedback helps optimize mental performance and focus: it\u2019s like training your brain the way you\u2019d train your body. It sharpens my ability to connect dots, stay calm under pressure and think strategically \u2014 all essential for effective communication.\n\nI\u2019m also known for dragging my friends along on the wellness hacking ride. Whether it\u2019s a new wellness trend or a challenging workout, I love sharing the journey (whether they like it or not is another question for another day).\n\nIt\u2019s all about testing, learning, and adapting. Whether it\u2019s wellness or communication strategies, curiosity drives everything I do: it keeps me learning, growing, and ready to tackle whatever\u2019s next.\n\nRebecca Simons is a speaker at Ragan\u2019s upcoming Employee Communications 101 Virtual Conference on Thursday, Jan. 30th. Attend from wherever you are for more insights around storytelling and AI.\n\nIsis Simpson-Mersha is a conference producer/ reporter for Ragan. Follow her on LinkedIn.",

But for those with diverse abilities \u2014 including seniors and people with cognitive disabilities \u2014 handling such tasks can be a daily triumph. And they can mean the difference between independence and constant supervision.\n\nA pilot project funded by Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program, Ignite Technology, and other partners has been exploring how digital solutions can help. Under the brand name Hayla, a suite of high-tech innovations has evolved into a streamlined, secure, app-based platform that is ready for market.\n\n\u201cA lot of these individuals are looking to live more independently, autonomously, maybe move to a situation where they\u2019re on their own,\u201d explained Ignite CEO Steven Taylor. \u201cAnd the Autonomous Living Project, now branded Hayla, uses technology to help people work towards the goal of self-sufficiency, independence, and greater dignity.\u201d\n\nThe origins of Hayla began in 2021 at the Lou Fruitman Residence in Toronto, which is run by Reena, another partner in the project. The Residence houses 138 adults and seniors with diverse needs. And as part of this project, it adopted a number of technologies \u2014 including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, automated alerts, smart-device integration, collaboration hubs, and a proprietary app \u2014 all supported by customized Cisco and Cisco Meraki products.\n\nThe concept is built around self-sufficiency, not surveillance. Through remote monitoring, smart notifications, alert services, and smart-device integration, users receive in-home support that enables them to live independently and safely. However, if the need arises \u2014 whether for an emergency, basic reminders, or emotional/mental counseling \u2014 caregivers can step in quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s technology that\u2019s geared to individual outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking to an individual and a caregiver,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cwe don't simply talk about the sensors they can have. We talk about the challenges they\u2019re experiencing today, and we look at implementing a solution that leverages technology to actually help address those challenges.\u201d\n\nSecurity and simplicity for positive good\n\nWith their shared commitment to simple-to-use, secure technologies, Cisco and Ignite were ideal partners.\n\n\u201cLike Cisco, Ignite is committed and visionary,\u201d said Wayne Cuervo, director of Cisco Canada\u2019s Digital Impact Office. \u201cThey have an ideal view of how technology can not only help, but how technology can get out of the way \u2014 to simplify the experience.\u201d\n\nHayla represents a big commitment in time, technology, and expertise from Cisco, particularly its CDA program.\n\n\u201cWe consider Hayla to be one of our most important projects,\u201d said Cuervo. \u201cIt\u2019s a profound story that helps transform the lives of people. And we feel it\u2019s very scalable to other use cases around the world.\u201d\n\nAs for the outcomes so far, Jessica Noftle, day program supervisor for another partner, the Toronto-based family-support organization Creating Alternatives, weighed in from a caretaker\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cWith Hayla\u2019s expertise, innovation and devices,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have successfully been able to help more than 10 supported individuals transition out of fully supported days, to semi-independent living. Hayla\u2019s dedication, along with their mentorship, has been a huge success for us at Creating Alternatives. We hope to continue to work alongside them for years to come.\u201d\n\nA scalable solution for aging populations\n\nHayla makes it all happen with a foundation of Cisco technology.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the hardware is a Cisco firewall router and an access point,\u201d Taylor stressed. \u201cThat access point communicates with the Meraki IoT sensors in the unit, which monitor things like the refrigerator, doors, and showers. Essentially, you have your network equipment \u2014 that is, access points, firewalls, and switches for larger implementations, \u2013 and IoT sensors that are set in the environment for safety and peace of mind. Maybe it's actually detecting water leakage, smoke in units, or simply helping to track daily living tasks.\u201d\n\nCommunication, of course, is equally critical. And Cisco Webex \u2014 either through handheld devices or hardware like the Cisco DeskPro, combined with Webex Calling \u2014 keeps users, their families, and caregiving teams connected on both emotional and practical levels.\n\n\u201cWebex Calling is part of our custom software that we've integrated,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cThis allows individuals to call a parent, caregiver, or therapist simply by clicking their picture. Everything is handled on the back end, so it's just one button to call.\u201d\n\nSecurity is a key concern, especially when sensitive medical or personal data is shared among vulnerable populations. So, Cisco and Meraki\u2019s built-in end-to-end security ensures further confidence in the system. Despite a constant flow of data coming from sensors, monitoring is automated and intuitive.\n\n\u201cAll of this is managed on the back end through the Meraki Dashboard and Cisco Control Hub,\u201d Taylor added. \u201cWe have automated alerts through Meraki dashboard.\u201d\n\nFor Cuervo \u2014 and Cisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration program \u2014 supporting Ignite\u2019s effort to bring Hayla to market is a great opportunity. CDA\u2019s mission is to use technology for positive transformation around the world (in more than 50 countries so far), and Hayla is a perfect fit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about using technology to address challenges and doing it in a way that benefits society,\u201d Cuervo said. \u201cHayla is significant at an individual level, but also at a national and global scale. In Canada and other countries, populations are aging, increasing the demand for social services, while the number of caregivers is shrinking. This solution enables caregivers to be more effective while improving the quality of life for those in need. For us, it\u2019s a perfect combination of technology excellence and real-world, positive impact.\u201d",

The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has lost 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCisco is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -2.1%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +6.9% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Published 01-08-25 Submitted by Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nAs we approach 2025, following what is likely to be the hottest year on record, the urgency to address our planet\u2019s interconnected challenges has never been greater. Climate change and resource scarcity require businesses, governments, and communities to act with intention and scale.\n\nAt Cisco, we are steadfast in our goals to both reduce environmental impact and foster resilience\u2014ensuring that communities, ecosystems, and industries can adapt, thrive, and sustain themselves in the face of uncertainty. Below are six sustainability trends expected to emerge in 2025:\n\n1. Digitizing the grid\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has potential to drive positive change in society, but it will require a rethink of networks and cleaner, more resilient and reliable energy sources. If we anticipate these challenges now, we can build the right infrastructure to support this future. That\u2019s how we can balance the demands of a rapidly digitizing, AI-integrated society with having a livable planet.\n\nDigitizing the grid is essential to meet the growing energy demand and enhance energy security. The U.S. Department of Energy, for example, estimates that much of the country\u2019s electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, and 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old. The integration of AI could transform how energy is managed and distributed, creating more efficient and reliable systems.\n\nAt Cisco we believe we must design and future-proof energy grids, buildings, networks, data centers and technology for whatever energy requirements are around the corner \u2013 whether that\u2019s AI or something else. We continue to leverage our expertise in secure networks to drive this transformation, supporting grid modernization that is both innovative and resilient. Gains in efficiency can also support greater affordability and reliability across the energy sector.\n\n2. Transitioning to a circular economy\n\nThe transition from linear to circular business models is reshaping how industries operate, creating opportunities to reduce waste and maximize resources. But there is still more to be done. The United Nations (UN) Global E-waste Monitor 2024 reports that \u201ca record 62 million tonnes of e-waste was produced in 2022 \u2014 Up 82% from 2010; on track to raise another 32%, to 82 million tonnes, in 2030.\u201d\n\nCisco is at the forefront of the shift to a circular economy, embedding circularity into our product design and lifecycle strategies. Our approach focuses on designing for sustainability\u2014creating durable, modular products that can be easily repaired, upgraded, and recycled.\n\nWe\u2019re already doing this through:\n\nSetting a goal to incorporate Circular Design Principles into 100 percent of new products and packaging by our fiscal year (FY) 2025. As of our FY24, we are at 96 percent.\n\nOffering initiatives like the Cisco Takeback and Reuse Program and Cisco Refresh , which extend the lifecycle of our devices, enabling remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling to reduce electronic waste and conserve resources.\n\nand , which extend the lifecycle of our devices, enabling remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling to reduce electronic waste and conserve resources. Reusing or recycling nearly 100 percent of the products that are returned to us.\n\nThese initiatives not only support our circularity goals but also empower customers to adopt more sustainable practices, helping to keep valuable materials in use for as long as possible.\n\n3. Investing in innovation\n\nInnovation is essential to addressing the challenges of a changing planet. Globally, annual clean energy technology investments are expected to exceed $900 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Cisco, we are partnering with early-stage startups that are driving transformative solutions in clean energy, circularity, and climate resilience. Two exemplary companies from our Cisco Investments portfolio, CorPower Ocean and DEScycle, are leading the way in these areas.\n\nOur goal is to accelerate innovation by investing in companies that align with our environmental sustainability strategy. These investments don\u2019t just provide capital\u2014they serve as a signal to the broader market on what we value and where we believe the future is headed.\n\nIn 2021, the Cisco Foundation demonstrated this by committing $100 million over ten years to support climate innovation in both nonprofits and for-profit start-ups.\n\n4. Scaling impact through public-private partnerships\n\nNo single entity can tackle environmental challenges like climate change alone. The path to a more sustainable future requires partnerships across sectors. According to a 2023 report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in collaboration with McKinsey & Company, 87 percent of public-private-philanthropic partnerships focused on emerging economies, which can be less able than advanced economies to deliver solutions independently. In 2025, we anticipate a heightened emphasis on public-private collaboration, as governments and businesses align to localize efforts and scale impact.\n\nFrom national incentives for clean energy adoption to local initiatives that promote water conservation, partnerships are critical to bringing together the policies, funding, and innovation needed to achieve meaningful progress.\n\n5. Keeping a pulse on two trending sustainability topics, nuclear energy and water insecurity\n\nAs global energy demands continue to grow, nuclear energy is reentering the conversation as a potential solution for reliable clean energy, because it does not produce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), world nuclear capacity is now projected to increase by 2.5 times the current capacity by 2050. Nuclear energy is increasingly seen as part of a diverse energy mix needed to maintain ambitious climate goals, contribute to energy security, and satisfy rising energy demand.\n\nWater insecurity is becoming one of the most pressing sustainability challenges of our time. According to WWF, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and 2.7 billion people experience water scarcity for at least one month of the year. Water use is at the center of the conversation about generative AI, as water is a key resource required by the data centers that provide AI processing power. In 2025, we expect to see greater innovation in water management and greater attention to equitable access to this vital resource.\n\n6. Building community resilience\n\nResilience is about more than weathering challenges\u2014it\u2019s about a systemic ability to adapt, recover, and flourish amid change.\n\nToday, technology is tightly integrated with resilience, providing the access and capabilities needed to be connected and participate in society. 2.6 billion people around the world are still without Internet access and even among those that are connected, there are disparities in quality and affordability.\n\nIn 2025, resilience is expected to be the watchword of a movement in which local communities are at the center of solutions to bolster critical infrastructure.\n\nAt Cisco, we support resilient communities through technology and innovation. Our solutions\u2014ranging from secure digital networks to grid modernization\u2014are designed to help communities and businesses respond to extreme weather and climate risks, enable reliable access to resources, and build a foundation for long-term prosperity. Resilience is important for broader sustainability efforts, as stronger communities are better equipped to implement and scale more sustainable practices.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAt Cisco, environmental sustainability is about more than reducing climate impact. We believe in building resilience to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nIn 2025, we have an opportunity to lead with intention, scaling solutions that address climate risks while empowering communities to adapt and flourish.

Since AI requires drastic computing power, tech companies have been investing billions to enhance their AI infrastructures and broaden their data center networks. The race, however, isn\u2019t just limited to the US. Efforts are being made to protect the country\u2019s leadership in AI against the rest of the world, particularly China. China, in turn, has begun offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce chips, and it\u2019s also promising to build local AI data centers. Moves like these could position the country as an AI leader in the future, something that the US is actively making efforts to avoid.\n\nHowever, regardless of the capital expenditures companies are making toward AI, one analyst says that these are no longer going to be enough in 2025. David Dietze of Peapack Private Wealth Management said that a major theme for 2025 is going to be \u201cShow Me The Money\u201d.

What he meant is that businesses that rely on a patchwork of vendors or offer inconsistent functional depth across their portfolio will find it hard to compete in the long-term.\n\nAs we enter a new age of remote work, business productivity and collaboration have become the new talking points. In this article, we stack up Cisco Webex against its well-heeled rival Microsoft Teams and review the solutions on team collaboration, integrations, video and audio calling, security and user experience. The comparison draws on user reviews from Trust Radius and G2 and digs into knowledge base and community forums from Cisco and Microsoft.\n\nLearn More: Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex Tout Unprecedented User Growth Amid Outbreak\n\nCisco Webex Teams vs. Microsoft Teams\n\nWhat is Cisco Webex Teams\n\nCisco Webex Teams packs messaging, file sharing, video meetings, white boarding, calling, and other tools to help increase workplace productivity. Webex Teams provides a complete collaboration experience by allowing teams to create, meet, message, make calls, and share in one continuous workstream. Webex Teams also offers deep integrations with third-party collaboration tools including Microsoft Teams and Slack.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Teams\n\nMicrosoft Teams is a collaboration app that combines unlimited chat and search, video calling and screen sharing, audio conferencing, file sharing, document storage in SharePoint, Teams and channels and co-authoring, thereby delivering an end-to-end real-time collaboration experience. Microsoft Teams packs more than 250 integrated apps and services, allowing teams to do more. And since Teams comes bundled with the Office 365 package, Office users can avail all the benefits of a digital workplace solution from a single app vs. switching between other applications.\n\nCheck out which solution between Microsoft Teams and Webex Teams delivers more benefits and better user experience.\n\n1. Team Collaboration and Integrations\n\nSince its launch in 2017 Opens a new window , Teams has come of age as a cloud-based messaging and team collaboration software and edged out its core rival Slack in the enterprise collaboration space. Teams is essentially a chat-based workspace and belongs to the group chat tools category. It also boosts productivity by supporting more than 250 third-party integrations that aren\u2019t native to its environment. Teams extend business chat capabilities to guests (clients, vendors, suppliers, consultants) outside the organization via Guest Access functionality Opens a new window .\n\nWebex Teams also allows seamless collaboration, allowing users and co-workers to collaborate via a single, consistent experience. Webex Teams offers tight integrations with a host of productivity apps (Office 365, Box, Smartsheet) and project management apps (Jira, Asana, Trello) and sales, marketing and social (Marketo, SurveyMonkey or Eventbrite).\n\nBoth offer similar functionality in workspace chat and built-in access to native apps and third-party apps.\n\nIn terms of ease of use, both team collaboration apps deliver seamless search functionality, allowing users to search keywords for files, messages and people\n\n2. Digital Whiteboards\n\nWhiteboards are the centerpiece of collaboration and this built-in functionality is table stakes for meetings apps. Digital whiteboards are built into Cisco Meetings and Teams Meetings, offering a live interactive whiteboard experience with annotation tools to users. Cisco Webex Teams offers native in-app whiteboard with seamless usage on Webex board while in Microsoft Teams, the whiteboard integration is powered by the Whiteboard web app.\n\nBy and large, users rate Microsoft whiteboard easy to use but found the whiteboard experience more optimized for Surface devices and Windows PCs as compared to iOS and Mac OS.\n\nUsers rate the whiteboard in Cisco Webex Meetings providing a more inquisitive experience with an array of tools.\n\n3. Video conferencing\n\nCisco enjoys a market-leading position in online meetings and telephony and Cisco\u2019s strength lies in offering the security and reliability that enterprises need.\n\nBoth Cisco Meetings and Microsoft Teams offer enterprise meeting features that include \u2013 scheduling, call recording, screen-sharing, ability to mute others, guest lobby and more.\n\nWebex Meetings support up to 200 video users and this also includes proprietary Skype for Business users while Microsoft Teams attendee size is up to 250 participants. However, in terms of native support for external users, Microsoft Teams offers limited functionality.\n\nBoth companies have doubled down on AI to differentiate solutions. AI capabilities offered by Cisco Webex Meetings include real-time transcription, automated closed captioning, note-taking, voice commands, and recorded transcripts and blurred and virtual backgrounds. Live captions and automatic transcriptions are part of Microsoft Teams. In addition, Microsoft also added more AI hooks in March to lock-in users \u2014 custom backgrounds, raised hand, real-time noise suppression and participant reports.\n\nWebex Meetings also feature a voice-activated assistant that allows you to control meetings via voice commands \u2013 like a Siri or Cortana to keep track of meeting notes or action items. Microsoft has an integration with Zoom.ai, the AI-powered meeting scheduler that allows users to perform a host of tasks \u2013 book meetings and access information smoothly.\n\nthat allows you to control meetings via voice commands \u2013 like a Siri or Cortana to keep track of meeting notes or action items. Microsoft has an integration with Zoom.ai, the AI-powered meeting scheduler that allows users to perform a host of tasks \u2013 book meetings and access information smoothly. Cisco Webex Meetings maintains quality even on congested networks\n\n4. Audio Conferencing\n\nCisco is known for delivering the most in-depth audio conferencing experience with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) dial-in and call-me services to participants across Webex Meetings, events and teams. Cisco\u2019s cloud-based PSTN audio option, provides toll and toll-free dial-in, and call-me capabilities for local and global connections and operates on a range of devices, such as smartphones, softphones and IP phones.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft Teams audio conferencing service allows attendees to join using a phone instead of the Teams app on desktop or mobile. Meetings include a dial-in number spanning more than cities globally, making it easier for mobile users and those without a reliable internet connection.\n\n5. Security & Compliance\n\nThis is a Cisco stronghold and the cloud collaboration giant maintains security is a top priority across design, development, deployment and maintenance of applications and platforms. Cisco offers complete end-to-end encryption in Webex Teams \u2013 protecting data at rest, in use and transit, thereby giving more control to large enterprises that value security. Cisco Webex uses TLS 1.2 protocol and uses high strength ciphers (for example, AES 256) to secure data. In addition, Cisco follows a hardened security approach with multilayer security that is validated with stringent internal and third-party industry standards. Security-conscious companies will tap Cisco for its strict protocols and transparency about security practices.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Teams also delivers advanced security and compliance capabilities with organization-wide two\u2013factor authentication, single sign-on and encryption of data in transit and at rest. Customers from regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services can also benefit from Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Teams that helps companies protect sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) like health data, credit card numbers or social security numbers.\n\nLearn More: Top 10 Meeting Software Solutions in 2020\n\n6.

            "content": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2013 Cisco revealed key technology trends for 2025, emphasizing a landscape shaped by shifting consumer behaviour, an expanding digital ecosystem, and the need to integrate AI.\n\nReflecting these dynamics, the Middle East emerges as a hub of innovation, with rapid adoption of AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and smart city initiatives. IT spending in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is projected to total $230.7 billion in 2025, an increase of 7.4% from 2024, according to Gartner, Inc.\n\nDavid Meads, Vice President for the Middle East, Africa, T\u00fcrkiye, Romania, and CIS at Cisco, commented: \u201cBy embracing this year\u2019s technology trends with both strategic foresight and pragmatism, companies can effectively navigate challenges and seize growth opportunities.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Middle East is witnessing a significant surge in technology investment, driven by a strong commitment from both governments and private enterprises aimed at establishing the region as a leader in technological innovation. This rapid adoption of technology provides businesses with unique opportunities to enhance efficiency, boost productivity, improve customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI will fulfill AI\u2019s promise of personalization and efficiency.\n\nMany AI-powered tools in use today are based on static rules or datasets. Agentic AI differs in that it can continuously learn from user inputs and make decisions with little to no human oversight.\n\nImagine a customer service AI that predicts user needs before a query is made, or a network management AI that identifies potential issues and resolves them autonomously, ensuring uninterrupted service. In response to the rise of Agentic AI, we will see organizations implementing mandatory ethical guidelines to ensure fairness and transparency in algorithmic decisions and protecting intellectual property.\n\nHumanoids and humans collaborating will force companies to rethink workplace dynamics.\n\nAI-powered humanoids will form a part of the future workforce. This will force companies to completely reimagine their workplace dynamics. For example, companies will need to ensure their connectivity has the right levels of latency and throughout to process and analyse data in real time. At the same time, organizations must ensure their security postures.\n\nThis human and machine collaboration will be inspiring and allow organizations to greatly scale operations but will also likely trigger concerns about AI replacing jobs. Leaders will need to be clear and uncompromising about harnessing AI\u2019s power without losing the human touch that defines world-class customer experiences.\n\nAI will present challenges for companies, particularly regarding infrastructure and data readiness.\n\nAI will continue to captivate businesses, promising unprecedented innovation and efficiency, and companies will continue to invest in AI-powered solutions. As AI journeys progress, so too will the understanding that the path is fraught with hurdles. Despite billions of dollars invested into AI models and AI-powered solutions in 2024, new data from Cisco\u2019s AI Readiness Index shows that AI readiness has declined as now only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI-powered technologies to their full potential.\n\nIn 2025 organizations will grapple with how best to secure the right level of compute power to meet AI workloads. Companies will need to lean on their strategic partners to identify and prioritize their AI use cases. IT teams will experience increasing pressure to optimize the management, hygiene, which is currently spread across multiple systems and locations.\n\nCybersecurity will face new threats, leading companies to enhance human efforts with machines.\n\nAdvancements in quantum computing are increasing pressure on security teams to address the vulnerabilities of traditional encryption methods against quantum attacks. As these technologies gain traction, organizations must adopt quantum-resistant security protocols to protect sensitive data.\n\nThe interconnectedness of digital ecosystems complicates security, making attacks more sophisticated. According to the latest Cisco AI Readiness Index, only 30% of companies globally have the capabilities to tackle these threats. As cybercriminals adapt their tactics, networks will become essential as the first and last line of defence. Integrating AI will enhance human capabilities, strengthening network security and policy enforcement.\n\nNetwork downtime due to misconfiguration will approach zero.\n\nOver 40% of network outages are directly caused by misconfigurations, and can cost businesses 9% of their total annual revenue. AI has the potential to virtually eliminate these manual misconfiguration mishaps.\n\nIntelligent, automated tools can execute workflows throughout the network lifecycle and provide traceability for every action. AI-driven tools will revolutionize network management, learning from each configuration to reduce errors and ensure uninterrupted operations. As AI adoption increases, we expect to see a rapid decline in misconfigurations and network downtime caused by human error approach zero.\n\nCompanies will need help to balance sustainability and growth in an AI-powered era.\n\nThe environmental impact of AI is the elephant in a lot of rooms. AI requires high energy consumption levels that impact carbon emissions across the board. The energy used by AI-dedicated data centres is expected to match the amount consumed by a country the size of the Netherlands in one year. Sustainability frequently arises in discussions with customers, who increasingly seek partners that can help them achieve net-zero commitments and sustainability goals.\n\nSuccessful businesses will prioritize energy-efficient products and circular business models. AI technology will be pivotal in enhancing energy efficiencies, ushering in an era of \"energy networking\" that combines software-defined networking with direct current (DC) microgrids for improved visibility into emissions and optimization of power usage, distribution, and storage.",

To defend against these threats, people, and businesses need firewalls, VPNs, antivirus solutions, and segmented networks at all times.\n\nFirewall solutions are now gaining popularity among Internet users for their ability to monitor traffic and prevent intrusions \u2014 so much so that the global firewall market is forecasted to reach $15.8 billion by 2025. In this edition of Behind the Scenes, Jerry ChenOpens a new window , CEO of Firewalla and former Cisco executive, discusses the pros and cons of VPN services, Firewalla\u2019s offerings for business customers and how small businesses can defend against cyberattacks. He also offers five security tips for users of Internet-connected devices.\n\nKey Takeaways From This Tech Talk Interview:\n\nAdvantages and limitations of VPN products\n\nSecurity tips for users of IoT devices\n\nThings to consider before buying a VPN\n\nHow small businesses can protect their networks and devices\n\nHere\u2019s the edited transcript of the interview with Jerry Chen:\n\nCan you take us through your career trajectory and how you got a start in this now-buzzing domain of cybersecurity?\n\nAfter college, I joined Cisco Systems when it was a medium-sized company. I was one of the software engineers who helped design Cisco\u2019s next-generation router operating system. And, this is where I started becoming interested in and learning about product security and how to protect networks. Later I was assigned to manage information security for a large group of engineers. It is pretty rare to have security people developing software and also managing information security. So, I proudly claimed myself as a security expert, until in 2015 when my little girl\u2019s nanny camera was hacked.\n\nIt took me (a security expert) a few weeks to discover the hack and after discovering it, I couldn\u2019t find any tool to stop the hack. If I (a self-proclaimed security expert) couldn\u2019t protect myself, I thought to\n\nmyself what would my neighbors do? Would they even know if their networks were under attack? And what if they were, what could they do? The answer is nothing.\n\nMost homes are filled with internet-connected devices today and each one of these devices creates a security hole that cyber criminals can exploit and use to get into your network and ultimately steal your private information. I wanted to create a device that is easy for any consumer to use, not just someone with cyber security expertise, that provides ultimate oversight into home network activity and unparalleled security.\n\nSo, I started Firewalla.\n\nLearn more: 10-Step Checklist to Buy Next-Generation Firewall\n\nAs someone who spent close to two decades with Cisco, working as software engineer, co-founder of Cisco R&D in China, leading Cisco Security Technology Group, and Cisco NXOS, what have your learnings been?\n\nI was lucky enough to play multiple roles inside a very large corporation, including being a software engineer, a manager, and later even an acting CISO. These roles helped me approach cyber security with a very wide view and realize that security is not always a technology issue.\n\nShare your key lessons from Cisco that helped shape and grow Firewalla as a well-known firewall solutions brand?\n\nBuild quality software, listen to customers, and make them happy.\n\nLearn more: Accenture Acquires Deja vu Security to Innovate Next-Generation Cybersecurity Solutions\n\nDo give a brief round-up of Firewalla\u2019s solutions portfolio for business users who use personal computers, home Wi-Fi routers, webcams etc to work remotely or from home? What kind of cyber threats can be contained using the company\u2019s solutions?\n\nAll of our products (except the upcoming Gold) operate in the same way.\n\nPlug and Play: We made Firewalla plug and play. In \u201csimple mode\u201d it takes less than 5 minutes to get Firewalla up and running. And everything is controlled via a simple phone app. Firewalla is a tool anyone can install very quickly just by connecting one ethernet cable.\n\nVisibility: Much of what the Firewalla system does is provide visibility into what devices connected to your network are doing. The system can record all interactions for 24 hours and allow you to zoom in and look at any device actions for more detail.\n\nIntrusion Prevention System: Firewalla is a full IPS (intrusion prevention system). Firewalla will automatically protect your network from accessing and be accessed from bad places.\n\nProtect: Firewalla also includes features like regional/country block, to stop you from accidentally navigating to websites originating in certain countries, and content filtering. These can be used to reduce bad traffic to and from your network.\n\nVPN: Firewalla has a built-in VPN server, so if you are working from public Wi-Fi you can always connect to home via your VPN for extra protection from cyber threats. Firewalla also has a site-to-site and client-server VPN, which means, you can easily link two sites (or home and office) together with a few clicks. Or, you have the ability to connect any device at home to a third-party VPN transparently.\n\nLearn more: Emotet Malware Targeting Networks Through Weak Wi-Fi Connections\n\nMany people use VPN services to keep their browsing activities private and also to connect with co-workers and clients over secure connections. In your opinion, what are the major aspects one needs to consider when choosing the right VPN service?\n\nOne of the major aspects before buying a VPN service is to know why you need a VPN. Is it to bypass a Netflix region block, to hide from governments, your ISP, or are you worried about public Wi-Fi? For example, to protect from public Wi-Fi, you can just use Firewalla\u2019s built-in VPN server, it\u2019s free because it runs inside your home.\n\nAnother aspect is to know about the limitations of VPN products. VPN hides your IP address and encrypts your data during transit until the VPN is terminated. None of these capabilities can stop web services (such as Google, YouTube, Facebook) from tracking you.\n\nResearchers and White Hat hackers have uncovered hundreds of publicly accessible cloud databases, each of which contain large volumes of customer and enterprise data. Enterprises are struggling with ensuring adequate security of data uploaded to the cloud. In your opinion, what security strategy can be applied by enterprises to maintain visibility over data uploaded to the cloud?\n\nThis is not a technology question, but rather a question about process and policy. In a perfect world, an enterprise will have the necessary security policies in place and the right processes and tools to enforce them and eliminate human error. In this ideal scenario it is very difficult to have leaks.\n\nFor example, a policy can be as simple as, make sure all data is encrypted with a reasonable password. Then there should be people to audit this policy and ensure it is fully carried out. Of course, processes\n\nand policies will slow things down. Then it became a business decision \u2013 go fast, make more money and deal with security later, or do the right thing at a higher cost.\n\nLearn more: Protecting Enterprises with a Cloud Security Assessment\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most concerning cyber threats for businesses as we enter the new decade?\n\nInformation Technology is getting more complex. To an extent, even the best developers won\u2019t fully understand a big system. Earlier, business\u2019 data lived on hard drives and maybe back up tapes. It was controlled. Now, it is anyone\u2019s guess as to how many copies exist. And some may not even stay inside the office walls.\n\nMany small businesses don\u2019t have the necessary funds to hire security experts or to outsource cybersecurity of their digital assets. Aside from using low-cost firewalls like Firewalla, how can they improve their cyber hygiene and keep their assets secure from DDoS or ransomware attacks?\n\nTrain employees to think and ask questions if unsure before clicking on anything. Make sure device firmware is always up to date. Use reasonable passwords for devices. Always use antivirus.\n\nRemember, even in a big company, most problems are human related \u2026 so be alert.\n\nLearn more: 6 Tips for Reducing Employee Cybersecurity Risk\n\nWhat are your five basic security tips for people who use smart home devices regularly that involve the exchange of a lot of personal information over these devices? Devices such as voice assistants, security cameras, toys with microphones etc collect a lot of information but many of them are still not secure-by-design.\n\nUnderstand pretty much all of these services will send information to the cloud. Understand the cloud is a shared resource and managed by a company (or multiple companies), so make sure that company is decent. Use reasonable passwords for your devices / cloud accounts. Two factor authentication can fix a lot of things. Try not to use the same password for multiple logins. Use tools like Firewalla to know if your smart device is sending information out, and/or where that device is communicating with geographically. Network segmentation can help to protect devices inside the home, so learn about it and start using it.\n\nLearn more: Seven Keys for Better IoT Security\n\nCan you walk us through any of your existing projects centered around the security of smart home devices considering the growing complexities of cyber threats targeting the IoT ecosystem?\n\nWe are creating a new product called Firewalla Gold. It is a high-speed router that\u2019s built with security as the foundation. In addition to existing Firewalla feature sets, Firewalla Gold adds a few features that can make the home / or work a bit more secure.\n\nNetwork Segmentation: This is the concept of placing different devices into their own network domains. Such as, place all iOT devices into one network, and kids devices into another, and guests into another. There are two main advantages of this\n\nIn case one network is hacked, it is well isolated \u2026 Different policies can be placed into segments and have each of them protected differently.\n\nNetwork Lockdown Mode: This is more of a stricter mode that we will be supporting; for example, when this is on, any new devices connecting to the network will need a quick approval from our app. And anything that\u2019s locked down will only be restricted to sites that you allow them to communicate to.\n\nAdditional Firewalla Gold features include smart device protection against hackers from refrigerators to baby monitor cameras; parental controls; Safe Search; Firewalla OpenVPN server; VPN Client; ad blocker; advanced Geo-IP filtering to block network traffic from certain countries; bandwidth usage insights; Social Hour, which blocks all social networks for family time; and total network traffic insight on-demand. With Firewalla Gold, cyber-attacks are detected, prevented and blocked, creating the most secure home or small business network possible.\n\nLearn more: ARM Showcases Latest IoT Test Chip Musca-S1 for Secure IoT device Designing\n\nWhat, in your opinion, will be some essential skill-sets for a security worker to adjust to the evolving cyber security landscape? Will greater automation of human tasks in the future bring in greater risks for companies as well?\n\nIt is all software, created by humans and humans are not perfect. As more things run over software, there will be more surface to attack. A security worker has to find ways to reduce that attack surface, and make sure everyone understands that security is a technology problem and a human problem. In addition to the necessary technical skills, the security worker should be able to understand the importance of information security policy, governance and risk management.\n\nAbout Jerry ChenOpens a new window :\n\nBefore founding Firewalla, Jerry spent nearly 20 years working at Cisco Systems, where he was a senior manager and ran many projects in Security Technology Group, Core Routing Group, and Consumer Business Unit. He was also a member of Cisco InfoSec Team, focusing on data protection. \u201cI invented Firewalla after my daughter\u2019s baby camera was hacked, and my goal is to prevent such things from happening to other families.\u201d Jerry graduated from University of California at Santa Barbara with MS and BS in Electrical Engineering.\n\nAbout Firewalla:\n\nFirewalla is a firewall solutions company offering simple and affordable firewall products to individuals and businesses in over 100 countries.

            "content": "The Wall Street Journal reports that Charter, Consolidated, and Windstream have been added to the growing list of US telecom companies breached by Chinese state-sponsored hackers in the Salt Typhoon campaign.\n\nThe list of telecommunications companies compromised in the Salt Typhoon cyberattack continues to grow, with recent reports naming Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream as the latest victims of Chinese government espionage.\n\nThis follows previous confirmations from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Lumen Technologies, as earlier reported by Hackread.com, that their networks had been breached. According to Anne Neuberger, White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, Chinese hackers have targeted nine US telecoms, with the latest three remaining unclear.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese spies exploited vulnerabilities in network devices from Fortinet and Cisco to gain unauthorized access to these telecom networks. In some cases, attackers gained control of high-level network management accounts lacking multi-factor authentication, granting them access to several routers. This access allowed them to potentially monitor network traffic and cover their tracks.\n\nThis incident has prompted several government-level security developments. The US Department of Treasury recently sanctioned a Chinese cybersecurity company for its role in another cyberattack, and the US government is taking steps to strengthen the security of American telecom infrastructure.\n\nThese measures include increased scrutiny by the FCC, legislative efforts to enhance security, and recommendations for individuals and organizations to improve their cybersecurity practices.\n\nMoreover, given the ongoing wave of Salt Typhoon\u2019s breaches, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is advising government officials to switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal.\n\nThe latest revelation highlights the growing threat of Chinese cyberattacks on US infrastructure, with the Salt Typhoon campaign indicating a shift from traditional espionage to more disruptive activities. Experts urge organizations in international business or critical infrastructure to enhance their cybersecurity defences.\n\nChris Hauk, Consumer Privacy Champion at Pixel Privacy commented on the latest development stating, \u201cPossible targets of these Chinese attackers need to immediately follow the steps outlined by the FBI and NSA to help harden their systems against attack. Actually, any organization would be advised to follow the steps.\u201c\n\n\u201cPatching and upgrading apps and devices, limiting the types of connections and privileged accounts, and only using strong encryption, are just some of the steps organizations can take to harden their systems against attack,\u201d Chris added.",

            "content": "North Korean Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group APT38, also known as the Lazarus group, is targeting energy companies in the U.S., Japan, and Canada. According to Cisco Talos, APT 38 targets VMWare Horizon instances by exploiting the widely prevalent Log4j vulnerabilities.\n\nAPT38, commonly known as Lazarus and Hidden Cobra, is a North Korean state-sponsored cybercrime group that earned infamy by orchestrating the $620 million Ronin Network crypto heist, the biggest cryptocurrency theft in history, in April 2022. It was also behind the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 and other data exfiltration and cyber espionage activities.\n\nThe nation-state group kicked off its latest campaign against energy companies in February 2022, a couple of months before the Ronin Network crypto heist. According to threat research firm Cisco Talos, APT38\u2019s campaign was activeOpens a new window until July this year.\n\nLazarus\u2019 established its initial entry point into internet-facing VMware Horizon installations by exploiting the highly prevalent Log4Shell vulnerabilities in the Java-based logging framework Log4j.\n\n\u201cThe Log4j exploit used in these attacks has been known, and called critical, for over a year. However, our adversaries are still able to find and exploit unpatched sites that are directly connected to the internet,\u201d Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told Spiceworks.\n\n\u201cIn June of 2022, CISA issued an alert (AA22-174A) specifically addressing this threat. However, it seems there are still systems that have not been patched yet. This poses a huge threat to some of the most critical systems within the critical infrastructure space.\u201d\n\nIn July 2022, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) described Log4Shell vulnerabilities as endemic given the ubiquity of Log4j across a multitude of computer and industrial control systems, servers, and networks. CSRB assessed that it could take up to a decade, maybe more, for organizations worldwide to patch Log4Shell flaws.\n\nOnce in, Lazarus deployed VSingle and YamaBot, two malware strains exclusive to its operations, and a third \u201crelatively simple\u201d remote access trojan dubbed MagicRAT by Cisco Talos. The company clarified that SymantecOpens a new window and South Korea\u2019s AhnLabOpens a new window previously detailed the campaign but Lazarus has updated its M.O., evident from the use of MagicRAT.\n\nLazarus first establishes a reverse shell and manually sets up a backdoor into the compromised systems through VSingle, which then allows it to establish another reverse shell. VSingle serves as a reconnaissance, backdoor and exfiltration tool to execute arbitrary code, download plugins, and create the possibility of lateral movement.\n\nIt also prepares for the next step: the theft of credentials. Meanwhile, YamaBot is set up to establish communication between the target system and the command-and-control (C2) servers.\n\nSee More: Lessons Learned from Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure\n\nFinally, MagicRAT is deployed after being downloaded from a remote location. MagicRAT is a simple remote access trojan that uses the Qt frameworkOpens a new window , performs system environment reconnaissance and can download additional payloads, such as custom-built port scanners and malware, such as TigerRATOpens a new window .\n\nSince the Qt framework is a library for developing graphical user interfaces, something that serves no purpose in the attack, Talos said its purpose in MagicRAT is \u201cmaking human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe discovery of MagicRAT in the wild is an indication of Lazarus\u2019 motivations to rapidly build new, bespoke malware to use along with their previously known malware such as TigerRAT to target organizations worldwide,\u201d Talos addedOpens a new window .\n\nLazarus Group Attack Chain Against Energy Companies Through Log4Shell Using MagicRAT | Source: Cisco TalosOpens a new window\n\nThe Lazarus attack campaign against American, Japanese, and Canadian energy companies involves regular and custom-made malware for specific operations. Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at Cerberus Sentinel, told Spiceworks, \u201cThe targeted nature of their campaigns also means they can take target specific approaches by analyzing the individual behaviors and operations at their objective organization.\u201c\n\n\u201cMost general cybercrime is opportunistic in nature, using simple and cheap means such as mass phishing campaigns and automated password guessing bots to cast a wide net to potential victims. That the non-targeted approach is so regularly successful should give us pause when assessing the risk of a hyper targeted attack from highly skilled adversaries with both ample budget and a specific mission,\u201d he added.\n\nCisco Talos believes that the primary goal of the Lazarus campaign is to help the Kim Jong-un regime by establishing long-term access to the networks of energy companies.\n\nIt also aligns with the group\u2019s previous attacks against critical infrastructure, also at the behest of the North Korean government. Kron noted that besides stealing intellectual property, the access could be weaponized \u201cand potentially cripple many power and energy sites across the country.\u201d\n\nCISA has a dedicated pageOpens a new window for cybercriminal activity emanating from North Korea. The U.S. State Department has put a $10 million bountyOpens a new window , double the original $5 million, for information on DPRK-linked malicious cyber activity and threat actors.\n\nClemens said it is still possible to mitigate risk by investing in cybersecurity fundamentals, beginning with a strong cultural approach. This includes investing in segmentation, attack surface reduction, and system hardening tools and enhancing threat hunting and rapid alerting of suspicious behavior to neutralize threats quickly. He also advocated conducting penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities from omissions or misconfigurations before attackers can exploit them.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s easy enough to say and understand the factors that contribute to cybersecurity resiliency, but implementation is challenging, especially in organizations with competing priorities and limited resources. To be successful, leaders must own the reality of cybersecurity threats and dedicate both the human and monetary resources to protecting their organizations.\n\n\u2013 Chris Clements, VP of solutions architecture at Cerberus Sentinel\n\nFor organizations that leverage software vulnerable to Log4j vulnerabilities, which is a lot, Kron advised they \u201cshould immediately remove direct internet access from the devices until the vulnerabilities are mitigated.\u201d Log4j accounted for 14% of the total exploitation incidents between March 2021 and April 2022.\n\nLet us know if you enjoyed reading this news on LinkedInOpens a new window , TwitterOpens a new window , or FacebookOpens a new window .

This malware was spread using physical disks, pretending to be software to assess people\u2019s risk of developing AIDS.\n\nSince then, ransomware has become a major cyber threat, with up to 150 attacks reported each year in the Netherlands, according to Cyberveilig Nederland\u2019s Ransomware Year in Review.\n\nThe Evolution of Ransomware Over the Years\n\nIn the pre-internet era, spreading malware like the AIDS Trojan and collecting payments proved challenging. Today, networked computers have made ransomware a significant criminal enterprise.\n\nKey developments include:\n\n1989: The first ransomware attack occurred with the AIDS Trojan, distributed via disks.\n\n1996: Researchers at Columbia University simulated \u201ccryptovirus extortion,\u201d introducing mechanisms for paying ransoms to unlock files. This also sparked the development of antivirus software and system backups.\n\n2004: The first criminal ransomware, GPCode, was shared via email disguised as a job application. It scanned victims\u2019 computers and encrypted files. At the time, attackers struggled to collect ransoms without revealing their identities.\n\n2013: The advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provided criminals with an anonymous payment method. CryptoLocker ransomware was one of the first successful examples, marking the beginning of a professional criminal ecosystem with specialised ransomware providers.\n\n2016: SamSam introduced targeted attacks demanding larger sums. Combining hacking techniques with ransomware changed the cybercrime landscape. Criminals began prioritising specific sectors like healthcare, government, and industry.\n\n2019: Maze pioneered \u201cdouble extortion,\u201d combining data encryption with data theft. Victims paid not only for a decryption key but also to prevent public disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nTriple Extortion and the Current Landscape\n\nThe IT landscape in 2025 is far more advanced than in 1989 or 2004. Groups like Conti now operate as professional businesses, complete with support services, help desks, and \u201dcustomer service\u201d for victims.\n\nOrganisations are now extorted in 3 ways:\n\nDecryption Keys: Paying to regain access to locked files. Data Threats: Paying to prevent stolen data from being leaked. Compliance Threats: Paying to stop attackers from reporting breaches to regulatory authorities.\n\nReports from Cyberveilig Nederland and the NCSC indicate that approximately 150 organisations fell victim to ransomware in 2023. Criminals now even threaten to report data breaches to compliance auditors. This adds pressure on companies to pay, but doing so funds future attacks.\n\nThe Shift to Mobile Ransomware\n\nFortunately, organisations have better tools to defend against attacks, leveraging AI to mitigate vulnerabilities. Improved software engineering and patching make it harder for ransomware to infect systems. However, humans remain the weakest link in cybersecurity.\n\nOur reliance on devices makes disruption easier to cause. I foresee a rise in mobile ransomware, as smartphones are often under protected. Still, we\u2019re not powerless. Defences and enforcement are improving. Last year, with the Dutch police, we dismantled the Babuk ransomware network.\n\nLooking Ahead: Collaboration and Hope\n\nNew techniques will emerge to improve criminal operations and evade detection. However, collaboration offers hope. Initiatives like Europol\u2019s No More Ransom Project and partnerships between security companies make it increasingly difficult for ransomware gangs to operate.\n\nBy Jan Heijdra, Field CTO Security at Cisco.",

            "content": "The list of telecommunications victims in the Salt Typhoon cyberattack continues to grow as a new report names Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream among those breached by Chinese government snoops.\n\nAT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies previously confirmed to The Register that their networks had been compromised by Beijing in what the US government has called a \"significant cyber espionage campaign\" against American operators.\n\nThe White House last week said at least nine companies had been breached by Salt Typhoon.\n\nIn a report over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal added Charter, Consolidated, and Windstream to the list of telecom companies that were compromised.\n\nCharter, Consolidated, and Windstream declined to comment.\n\nThe WSJ article also lists T-Mobile among organizations whose networks were compromised by the Chinese spies. However, a spokesperson last week told The Register that \"T-Mobile is not one of the nine being referenced by the government.\"\n\nPreviously, the mobile carrier's security boss spoke to The Register about the espionage campaign that he said appeared to be \"consistent\" with Salt Typhoon's snooping attempts.\n\nCisco, Fortinet gear used to gain entry\n\nAdditionally, the WSJ report says the PRC spies exploited unpatched network devices from Fortinet and Cisco to gain entry to the networks. In at least one of the breaches, the intruders took over a \"high-level network management account\" that didn't have multi-factor authentication enabled, and this gave the intruders access to more than 100,000 routers.\n\nThis access, which allegedly occurred in AT&T's networks, \"may have allowed the hackers to copy traffic back to China and delete their own digital tracks,\" the newspaper noted.\n\nThis follows a Justice Department warning from January 2024 that another Chinese-government-linked crew Volt Typhoon had infected Cisco routers with malware so that the devices could be used to break into US energy, water, and manufacturing facilities as far back as 2021.\n\nAnd in the fall, reports emerged that Volt Typhoon was, once again, compromising old Cisco routers to break into critical infrastructure networks and kick off cyberattacks.\n\nChinese government-linked snoops have also exploited Fortinet vulnerabilities in previous cyberattacks.\n\nAT&T did not immediately respond to The Register's request for comment. Neither did Cisco or Fortinet.\n\nIn addition to the Salt Typhoon intrusions, Chinese spies also allegedly compromised US Treasury Department workstations in late 2024 \u2014 capping a year marked by several very targeted intrusions into American critical infrastructure networks.\n\nThese digital break-ins signaled a change in Chinese cyber campaigns from spying as usual to prepping for destructive attacks.\n\n\"Every organization should look at this as being put on notice that there are hostile nation state entities,\" CrowdStrike Senior VP of Counter Adversary Operations Adam Meyers told The Register in an earlier interview.\n\n\"If you are involved in any degree of business that ties into the broader international ecosystem, or you're providing services that are of logistical importance for critical infrastructure, you're in the line of fire,\" Meyers warned. \u00ae",

            "content": "The nation\u2019s top oversight office is considering penning a study to assess the cost of administering a far-reaching operation to rip out and replace swaths of at-risk or compromised telecommunications equipment owned by small communications providers around the country, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\nThe deliberations, which have not been previously reported, are fueled by an ongoing Chinese espionage intrusion into U.S. and allied telecommunications networks by Salt Typhoon, a hacking unit tied to Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security that likely had unfettered access to key elements of America\u2019s telecommunications backbone for around two years.\n\nAs part of the work, the U.S. Government Accountability Office would study the costs of undertaking such a project and, separately, would also evaluate security vulnerabilities impacting the telecommunications industry, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private deliberations.\n\nShould President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security team support this study, it could motivate his allies in Congress to greenlight what would likely be a multi-billion dollar effort to weed out troves of telecommunications hardware that\u2019s been accessed or is at risk of being ensnared by Chinese hackers and other adversaries.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear when the study would commence, but GAO staff are anticipating that Congress will formally request that the work begin soon, the senior official said.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is already locked in an ongoing effort to help small, rural broadband providers remove and replace equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, a pair of Chinese telecom companies deemed an unsuitable security risk to U.S. networks.\n\nThat \u201crip and replace\u201d program was toplined with $2 billion in funding when it initially passed in 2020. Only last month did it receive an added $3 billion from Congress to cover a funding shortfall that the FCC had been flagging to lawmakers for months.\n\nThis GAO study, however, would be significantly broader in scope. It would focus on the viability of discarding and replacing telecom equipment embedded across the entire nation, including hardware managed by smaller providers who were among the victims ensnared by Salt Typhoon.\n\nThe Chinese cyberspies broke into the systems of major providers, including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. They also accessed Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications and Windstream, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. In total, the hackers infiltrated at least nine U.S. communications firms and dozens of others around the world.\n\nTelecommunications Industry Association CEO Dave Stehlin said in a statement that TIA has \u201cconsistently championed the use of trusted suppliers throughout our expansive network ecosystem, encompassing wireless, wireline, satellite, subsea cables and IoT networks\u201d and added the trade group has advocated for rip and replace initiatives for several years.\n\nThe Competitive Carriers Association, which represents regional and rural wireless providers, declined to comment. The FCC and a staffer for incoming Republican leader Brendan Carr did not return a comment.\n\nMultiple providers recently disclosed that Salt Typhoon was no longer in their networks. Still, several hundred organizations comprising telecom companies and other sectors were notified over the past couple of months that they may be at risk of compromise, Nextgov/FCW reported in December.\n\nOne of the major vulnerabilities exploited is a hardware flaw within Cisco equipment that cannot be patched with a software update and requires physical replacement, according to a person with knowledge of the intrusions.\n\n\u201cThe [GAO] study is needed,\u201d said the person, who was granted anonymity to be candid about their understanding of the hacks.\n\nThe government watchdog may also explore providers\u2019 equipment supply chains. Beijing can legally compel companies that operate in China\u2019s borders to hand over schematics about their products. Given its operating unit in mainland China, it\u2019s likely that Chinese intelligence services had extensive knowledge about Cisco device architecture that allowed Salt Typhoon to later get inside, according to a congressional aide familiar with the hacks.\n\nThe Chinese cyber unit also exploited software vulnerabilities in Ivanti, Fortinent, Sophos and Microsoft Exchange Server systems.\n\nEarly glimpses of what a nationwide rip-and-replace initiative could involve are already taking shape. Officials are researching national security risks tied to China-owned router provider TP-Link, and are readying for a possible countrywide ban of the firm, which can be invoked under a Commerce Department authority created in Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nCommerce is also moving to jettison remaining operating units of China Telecom in the U.S., the New York Times reported last month.\n\n\u201cThe risk to our telecommunications infrastructure has only grown since we discovered the threat posed by Huawei,\u201d House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said in a statement when asked about the study.\n\n\u201cDue to the widespread nature of this most recent intrusion by the CCP actor known as Salt Typhoon, it\u2019s essential to fully evaluate the cost of creating a more resilient foundation for the telecommunications sector. This way, we can take concrete steps toward improving collective cyber defense across the government,\u201d he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how such a sweeping rip and replace project would unfold, given society\u2019s everyday reliance on phone systems for jobs, banking and other vital activities. Moreover, millions of Americans rely on major wireless providers for services that allow them to conduct phone calls, send text messages and browse the internet.\n\nSome telecom operators also have a strong presence in the federal space. AT&T, for instance, manages FirstNet, a public safety network used by first responders like firefighters and police officers. Data tied to FirstNet call logs was compromised in a separate 2022 breach, Nextgov/FCW reported in July.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s communications equipment could also be scrutinized as part of the study. The fiscal year 2019 defense policy bill barred agencies from buying or using certain telecom or video surveillance equipment from several Chinese companies and their related business units, but equipment purchased before that law took effect is not considered.\n\nUpdating the vulnerable systems and security practices across the telecom industry would be a massive and costly undertaking. Modern-day telecom networks operate as a complex mix of antiquated technology from the past few decades integrated with contemporary digital infrastructure. In certain areas, protective measures were robust, but in others outdated hardware and lax security practices left vulnerabilities that Salt Typhoon identified and exploited.\n\nMaking matters more complex is the fact that Salt Typhoon also breached America\u2019s \u201clawful intercept\u201d systems that house wiretap requests used by law enforcement to surveil suspected criminals and spies. Telecom firms are required to engineer their networks for wiretapping under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which passed in 1994. The FCC oversees the law.\n\nOver the years, wiretapping methods have shifted from analog procedures to streamlined digital systems. Today, law enforcement analysts can file requests for targets\u2019 phone metadata directly to telecom operators. Many of those requests are processed at legal demand facilities that could be inadvertently swept up in the equipment replacement efforts.\n\nNot all experts are confident that a mass rip and replace project would shore up U.S. communications security.\n\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve seen of Salt Typhoon\u2019s activity would suggest rip and replace would be a cost effective or efficient approach. Most of these intrusions took advantage of decades-old security architecture flaws and exploited known cyber hygiene issues like missing patches or vulnerable accounts and leaked passwords,\u201d said Marc Rogers, a 35-year telecom security practitioner who worked with a major carrier on deploying, operating and securing its technology from the 1990s into the late 2010s.\n\n\u201cThe first step should be to fix these [issues]. Exploitation of our carriers via old known flaws that have patches is an indefensible position,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said replacing the hardware is a \u201cnecessary, but insufficient step.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt Typhoon demonstrated in a scary way how the aged telecommunications infrastructure on which Americans rely is highly fragile and extremely vulnerable,\u201d he said in a statement that argued the need for minimum cybersecurity standards and for providers \u201cto build their systems in ways that take into consideration security by design and not only speed to market.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope GAO will also include in their study the costs of doing such things,\u201d Warner added.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied involvement in hacking activities against the U.S. and Western allies. Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told Nextgov/FCW that, during a meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping in Peru at the APEC Summit late last year, Xi said there\u2019s no evidence supporting the \u201cirrational claim\u201d of cyberattacks from China. Biden raised the question to Xi in response to the Salt Typhoon hacks.\n\n\u201cThe [People\u2019s Republic of China] threat is probably the top threat that we\u2019re addressing right now,\u201d Brett Leatherman, the FBI\u2019s deputy assistant director for cyber operations, said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cAll these PRC-based cyberattacks against the United States \u2014 they\u2019re meant to either increase the PRC\u2019s footprint on U.S. infrastructure for potentially some sort of wartime footing, as well as to conduct sophisticated espionage against the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of that is a threat to national security.\u201d",

He spoke about it Thursday.\n\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Joe Flacco was taking advantage of an under-manned Jacksonville Jaguars secondary to get off to a hot start in Sunday's game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Jaguars announced just after the game started that safety Andre Cisco injured his groin during pregame warmups and was questionable to play.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence has been a hot market throughout 2024. AI fueled the surge in share price for companies such as Nvidia, which saw its stock rise nearly 180% over the past year through Dec. 31.\n\nThe AI market's growth isn't slowing down any time soon. Forecasts estimate the industry will expand at a phenomenal rate, from $184 billion in 2024 to over $826 billion by 2030.\n\nA great way to capitalize on the AI boom is to invest in companies that are not only involved in artificial intelligence, but also pay a robust, dependable dividend. That said, not all dividend-paying AI stocks are equal. For instance, Nvidia offers a dividend, but its dividend yield is a paltry 0.03% as of this writing.\n\nSo where are the AI companies with great dividends? Three of them are International Business Machines (IBM -1.45%), Cisco Systems (CSCO -1.33%), and Verizon Communications (VZ 2.62%). Here's a deeper look into each.\n\nIBM's compelling qualities\n\nIBM offers many reasons to invest in its stock. Shareholders get an impressive dividend yield of 3% , and payments are as reliable as you can hope to see. The company has paid quarterly dividends continuously since 1916 and has increased payments for the past 29 years.\n\nIBM smartly switched its focus to cloud computing and AI in 2020. After AI demand took off in 2023, IBM has enjoyed rising revenue.\n\nIBM's third-quarter sales related to generative AI rose by over $1 billion from the second quarter. This performance demonstrates strong demand for Big Blue's AI offerings.\n\nThe company's future looks bright as well. IBM is working on quantum computing, which uses subatomic particles to perform calculations at unimaginable speeds on the world's most powerful supercomputers. If Big Blue can successfully scale up its quantum capabilities, it could deliver more advanced AI than any available today.\n\nThe case for Cisco\n\nCisco made its name in computer networking, and that discipline is more essential than ever in the AI era. AI systems need the computing power of many computers networked together to crunch the mountains of data required for AI to function. And to deploy that AI to customers requires resilient, dependable, and secure internet networks.\n\nThese are all areas Cisco is known for, and it contributed to the 20% year-over-year rise in the company's product orders in its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 26. This strong start to its fiscal year led the company to forecast its 2025 revenue to come in between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion, up from 2024's $53.8 billion.\n\nCEO Chuck Robbins sees AI powering Cisco's sales growth. He noted that businesses are investing in IT infrastructure to support the demands of AI systems. As a result, the company is integrating its Cisco Silicon One platform into all of its products. Silicon One is the company's custom semiconductor chip designed to deliver superior speed and efficiency to support AI.\n\nIn addition, the stock offers a dividend with a yield of nearly 3%. Cisco has raised its dividend consistently for over a decade.\n\nVerizon's AI offerings\n\nVerizon's involvement in AI is related to edge computing, which entails bringing AI to your devices, whether that be your mobile phone, laptop, or internet-enabled car. These devices are on the periphery, or edge, of a computer network, hence the name.\n\nTo implement edge computing requires a wireless network robust enough to handle a large data load with speed and security. That's where Verizon's 5G network comes in. The telecom partnered with Nvidia specifically to enable the use of AI on its network.\n\nThis capability is coming in 2025, but Verizon's wireless service is already experiencing success. In Q3, its wireless service business saw sales rise 3% year over year to $19.8 billion. This division contributed the bulk of the telecom's Q3 revenue of $33.3 billion.\n\nVerizon is a great dividend stock as well. Because nearly everyone has a cell phone these days, the company can reliably generate substantial free cash flow (FCF) to fund its dividend. Through the first three quarters of 2024, the company produced $14.5 billion in FCF, nearly the same as 2023's $14.6 billion, which illustrates its FCF consistency.\n\nBecause of its strong FCF, Verizon has raised dividend payments for 18 consecutive years. In addition, its dividend yield is nearly a whopping 7% as of this writing.\n\nWith the AI market's growth delivering a tailwind to IBM, Cisco, and Verizon, combined with their outsize dividend yields, these companies are a great way to see a return on your AI investment. And you can collect passive income as the AI market grows over time.",

This approach identifies the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the year\u2019s end, calling for investors to buy equal shares and hold for twelve months.\n\nThis method has historically proven beneficial as dividends often indicate a company\u2019s stability and potential for growth. The current market offers opportunities among well-established blue-chip companies, emphasizing stocks that might currently be undervalued.\n\nIn 2025, among these high-yield stocks lies Procter & Gamble (PG), which recently returned to the list. After facing challenges, PG\u2019s yield has increased, backed by aggressive cost-saving strategies and innovative products set to enhance profitability.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) is another player making a return after a decade. Although struggling with sales earlier, introducing promotions has sparked recovery. To maintain momentum, the company must concentrate on effective marketing strategies.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) also shows promise with robust returns in 2024, largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. Their bullish outlook could relieve some pressures from the competitive tech landscape.\n\nInvestors keen on dividends will need to carefully assess each stock\u2019s potential while navigating broader economic challenges, aiming for a balanced mix of reliable payouts and strong growth prospects moving into 2025.\n\nHigh-Yielding Stocks to Watch in 2025: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nExploring High-Yielding Stocks for 2025\n\nInvestors looking for robust dividends in 2025 should consider the Dogs of the Dow strategy, an investment approach that focuses on the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) at year-end. This strategy not only offers potentially lucrative yields\u2014some nearing 6.8%\u2014but also emphasizes stability in your investment portfolio.\n\nHow the Dogs of the Dow Strategy Works\n\nThe Dogs of the Dow strategy involves selecting the highest yielding stocks from the DJIA and purchasing equal amounts of shares in each. This diversified method aims to minimize risk while capturing high dividend yields over a one-year investment horizon. Historically, this strategy has yielded positive returns due to the tendency of high-yielding stocks to stabilize and appreciate in value as the market reacts to economic conditions.\n\nKey Stocks for 2025\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\n\nProcter & Gamble has reemerged as a key player in the high-yield stock market. The company has successfully implemented cost-saving initiatives and introduced innovative products that have driven profit recovery. Analysts are optimistic about PG\u2019s ability to sustain its competitive edge, which is particularly appealing for dividend investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nAfter a decade, McDonald\u2019s returns to being a significant yield stock, recovering from earlier sales declines. The fast-food giant\u2019s recent promotional campaigns have revitalized its customer base, but ongoing success will depend on effective marketing strategies and the adaptation to changing consumer preferences.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO)\n\nCisco stands out in the technology sector, driven by its advancements in artificial intelligence and network solutions. Strong returns anticipated in 2024 position Cisco as a viable candidate for investors looking for both dividends and growth, particularly as businesses increasingly rely on digital infrastructures.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in High-Yield Stocks\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Steady Income: High-yield stocks provide regular dividend payouts, offering a reliable income stream.\n\n\u2013 Potential for Growth: Many high-yield stocks belong to established companies with solid fundamentals, making them attractive for long-term investment.\n\n\u2013 Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a range of high-yield stocks can help diversify and mitigate risks.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Market Volatility: Fluctuating stock prices can impact the overall value of your investment.\n\n\u2013 Economic Dependence: High-yield companies can be sensitive to economic downturns, which may affect their ability to maintain dividends.\n\n\u2013 Research Required: Investors need to conduct thorough research to identify genuinely undervalued stocks that can deliver both yields and growth.\n\nUse Cases for Dog Strategy Investors\n\n1. Retirement Planning: Investors looking for a stable income source can leverage high-yield stocks within their retirement portfolios for steady cash flows.\n\n2. Wealth Preservation: During volatile market conditions, high-yield stocks can act as a safety net, preventing significant losses while still providing dividends.\n\n3. Market Timing: By buying at year-end when stocks are deemed undervalued, investors can capitalize on potential market recoveries.\n\nTrends and Predictions for 2025\n\nAs the economy fluctuates, the demand for high-yield stocks is likely to increase, particularly as interest rates stabilize. This trend points towards a more cautious investing approach, focusing on value rather than speculative plays. Innovations in technology, especially in sectors like AI and sustainability, may further influence stock selections.\n\nPricing and Market Insights\n\nMarket analysis suggests investors should pay attention to valuations. Stocks with high yields but low growth potential may not be sustainable in the long run. It is advisable to consider both dividend yield and the company\u2019s growth prospects, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of each potential investment.\n\nFor more insights on investment strategies and stock analysis, visit Investopedia.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nHR Dive reporter Caroline Colvin takes up the mantle for the Talent Textbook series. Most recently, they asked HR experts about the difference between time to hire and time to fill.\n\nHave you ever wondered about your workplace\u2019s policy for something and didn\u2019t know where to find it? Then you ask your manager, then your manager has to ask their manager and then it gets escalated to HR. Or maybe you are HR, and you\u2019re tired of answering the same baseline questions over and over again.\n\nThis and similar situations has brought a new use case for AI at work to the forefront: enterprise search.\n\nHow artificial intelligence may save HR, workers time\n\nEnterprise search refers to any kind of tech solution that helps workers find the information they need within their enterprise. Think workplace policies such as parental leave or meeting protocols, or the details of a worker\u2019s benefits package, financial information and vacation time.\n\nNow, add AI on top of that to make it all the more convenient.\n\nWhen I attended the company\u2019s annual conference in November 2024, Dayforce debuted its AI agent. Now, Google just debuted Agentspace following the launch of Gemini 2.0. Next up is Cisco Webex, which has beta tested the technology with a handful of customers and piloted the software on its own staff ahead of a February 2025 release to the public.\n\nA screenshot of the Cisco Webex Agent. Cisco Webex\n\nManoj Muthavarapu, a director of product management at Cisco, not only worked on developing the Webex AI Agent capabilities for the past eight or nine years, but also has used the agent, called Kate during trials, in tangible ways.\n\n\u201cI have a team member who recently had a baby. My manager and I were on a call. They were wondering what we could do as a nice gesture, of sending a gift,\u201d Muthavarapu told HR Dive.\n\n\u201cNow, normally for a question like that, I would have asked my manager. He would have maybe checked with a couple of people, and then I would have then spoken to HR or raised a support case, and then something would have eventually come back to me as an answer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let's just ask Kate.\u2019 Within 30 seconds, we discovered that any new parents can go to the portal and just order a baby gift bag within X number of days of having a baby,\u201d he said, adding that he was able to pass along the info to the new parent on his team.\n\n\n\nAlong with providing answers to questions, some AI agents, such as that from Dayforce, even have the workplace policy PDF attached to the answers that the chatbot gives. Having seen a variety of software in this space, I can see how scenarios such as Muthavarapu\u2019s could become the norm within organizations.\n\nHR has used this technology for a while\n\nFrom machine learning to generative AI, artificial intelligence in HR is beyond a hot topic. Where and how can AI agents be used in hiring? Are there compliance issues if you do so? Do you create an ethics policy for workplace generative AI use? How can HR use AI to cut down on dreaded menial tasks?\n\nMicrosoft positioned its 365 suite\u2019s Copilot in 2023 as a means to \u201cremove the drudgery of work.\u201d Slack also debuted an AI component last year and continued to add and improve app integrations this year.\n\nEarlier this year, one tech CPO told HR Dive that HR is \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d of leveraging AI for work \u2014 and surely the deluge of new software, new use cases and new questions will keep on coming.\n\nBut a gap seems to exist between business leaders\u2019 understanding and adoption of AI, and confidence in their skills. For example, more than half of vice presidents and directors from the U.S. and U.K. surveyed said that they have never attended an AI-related training.\n\nIn the same December 2024 report, less than half said they feel confident in how to use AI without compromising company data and 27% said they are not very or not at all confident in their abilities.\n\nNathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at HireVue, told HR Dive that many people in the space are probably using AI and may not even know it.\n\n\u201cA lot of HR professionals are using it to facilitate their day-to-day jobs, [such as] streamlining and clarifying their writing,\u201d Mondragon said. He also noted that some HR professionals are using AI to create work assessments and screening tools.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the sky's the limit at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile AI use at work is not without challenges, it\u2019s clearly here to stay in 2025 \u2014 no matter where a company or employee stands on AI. If this technology is to become ubiquitous, HR has an opportunity to make good use of it.",

Upon the Fed's first interest rate cut of the year in September, global investors flocked to US corporate bonds at the fastest pace in six months following two-consecutive months of outflows from the sector, a recent note from Citi said.\n\nEven before the Fed's easing cycle, strong demand from investors also helped bring down costs, as high-grade corporate debt neared its safest level in nearly a decade.\n\nCorporate giants rushed to take advantage, often looking to bond sales to help fund acquisitions.\n\nPharma giant AbbVie sold $15 billion in investment-grade bonds last February, helping fund acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, while Cisco raked in proceeds of nearly $14 billion from a bond sale in the same month to partly finance its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb, meanwhile, sold $13 billion in bonds to help fund two other acquisitions.\n\nGoing forward, the outlook for corporate borrowing is slightly murkier.\n\nRecent hawkish commentary from Fed officials has hurt hopes for significant monetary easing in 2025. Traders are now penciling in just one or two more cuts over the course of the year amid concerns over sticky inflation.\n\nCitia analysts said they expect a resilient US economy to help provide further growth for investment-grade bonds overall, though.\n\n\"Resilience in U.S. economic activity, despite still-restrictive monetary policy, raises the chances from our prior baseline that U.S. IG EBITDA growth can keep pace (in the aggregate, at least) with what we expect will be punchy growth in net corporate IG debt,\" they said in a December note.\n\nThe average spread for investment-grade bonds dipped to its narrowest level in over two decades right after the election, and has widened only slightly since, according to Ice BofA data cited by the Financial Times.",

            "content": "You're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\n2025 is filled with curiosity and concern as the previous year was marked by overwhelming cybersecurity threats. Not surprisingly, India has emerged as the second most cyber-attacked nation, following the United States, according to a recent report by CloudSEK.\n\nIn 2024 alone, around 95 Indian entities fell victim to data theft attacks. The report identified approximately 45 highly active threat actors engaged in the sale and distribution of stolen data and unauthorized access credentials. These actors operate across prominent dark web forums such as BreachForums (despite its temporary seizure), Leakbase, and XSS. In total, they traded an astonishing 534,833 GB (over 534 TB) of data, with significant spikes in activity during June, August, and October. These months coincided with heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, contributing to increased cyber attacks.\n\nThe top three vendors\u2014Linux, Microsoft, and Google\u2014collectively account for approximately 62 per cent of all vulnerabilities, underscoring concentrated security risks among major tech platforms. In contrast, traditional enterprise vendors like IBM (489 vulnerabilities), Oracle (370), and Cisco (354) reported relatively lower numbers. This could suggest either stronger security practices or potentially less transparent reporting. On the other hand, Apple, ranked fifth with 585 vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to the report, several cyber threat groups targeted various sectors, with \"Chucky\" leading the list at 378 victims, followed by \"Marketo35\" with 310, and \"Trig\" with 173. These groups have been actively attacking industries such as Retail, IT & Technology, Communication, Services, Government, Business Services, Media & Entertainment, Healthcare & Pharma, and Finance & Banking.\n\n\"The retail sector remains the primary target of these threat actors, with companies in this industry facing relentless attacks globally. Numerous reputed threat actors have been observed selling databases belonging to entities in retail. Over 230 victims in the retail industry have been identified this year alone,\" the report stated.\n\nThe retail sector's attractiveness to cybercriminals lies in the vast volumes of customer data it processes, including payment card information and personal details. This makes the industry highly lucrative for data theft and financial fraud.\n\nRansomware Trends in 2024\n\nThe report also highlights ransomware trends, with the manufacturing sector emerging as the top target globally, accounting for 16.3 per cent of all attacks. Its pivotal role in supply chains and operations makes it particularly vulnerable. Construction and real estate followed closely at 12.1 per cent, driven by high-value financial transactions and sensitive project data.\n\nHealthcare ranked third at 10.8 per cent, reflecting the critical nature of patient data. Technology and telecom were the fourth most targeted sectors, accounting for 10.5 per cent, as their digital infrastructure and intellectual property make them prime targets for ransomware actors.\n\nBeyond India and the United States, the most frequently targeted nations in 2024 include Israel, Thailand, Brazil, China, Indonesia, France, and the United Kingdom.",

At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $13.86 billion, reflecting an 8.36% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $3.64 per share and a revenue of $55.93 billion, signifying shifts of -2.41% and +3.95%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher. Cisco Systems is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nDigging into valuation, Cisco Systems currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.25. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 15.48.\n\nWe can also see that CSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 3.6. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-02, Cisco Systems Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $43.19. It's currently trading at a price of $59.2. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -37.07%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Cisco Systems Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $3.53 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.54%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 5.90%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 27.5 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 15.69 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 43.19\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $32.84. This valuation indicates that the Cisco Systems Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -80.27%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

            "content": "Industry researchers often rank CCaaS providers as part of annual market evaluations. This is not one of those assessments.\n\nAlternatively, this article aims to pinpoint ten innovative, global vendors differentiating within the contact center space.\n\nRespected market analysts Zeus Kerravala, Principal Analyst at ZK Research, and Liz Miller, VP & Principal Analyst at Constellation Research, helped choose the providers.\n\nBelow, they discuss their choices and consider what to expect from each vendor in 2025.\n\nThat comes before a write-up of the key talking points, alongside some honorable mentions.\n\n1. NICE\n\nNICE embraced the cloud early and has aggressively adopted AI, consistently showcasing customers who have successfully used their products with strong stories and demonstrable ROI.\n\nThrough these customer testimonials, NICE highlights how customers also leverage its gold-standard workforce engagement management (WEM), journey orchestration, digital engagement, and other complementary solutions as part of a fully integrated platform.\n\nHaving pieced this all together, NICE often replaces multiple tools when it wins contact center deals.\n\nMeanwhile, NICE has maintained a focus on empowering agents with the right tools and information to deliver excellent customer service while also enabling customers to interact on their terms.\n\nAchieving this is not just about integrating channels and data; it\u2019s also about rethinking what data means in an experience-driven model.\n\nIndeed, NICE has expanded its definition of \u201cdata\u201d to include transactional, event stream, and interaction data alongside content and institutional knowledge.\n\nIn doing so, the vendor has created an ecosystem where all this comes together to support agents, customers, and the enterprise.\n\nIn 2025, expect it to expand that ecosystem, as signaled by the appointment of Scott Russell as the new CEO, who has deep CIO experience after many years at SAP. That experience may help NICE broaden its appeal beyond conventional contact center buyers.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has recognized that to develop Dynamics into a platform that integrates customer experience into the broader cloud infrastructure, it couldn\u2019t continue to ignore CCaaS.\n\nAs a result, the tech giant finally released a CCaaS platform in July 2024: the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center.\n\nCompanies already exploring or testing Microsoft\u2019s solution are drawn to its ease of use. Agents feel comfortable with the UI: it\u2019s familiar, intuitive, and seamlessly integrates data across platforms.\n\nMoreover, the solution isn\u2019t limited to traditional contact centers; it extends value to other roles, like sellers in Viva or marketers in Dynamics Marketing. Such ease of integration and adaptability make it a compelling option for existing Microsoft customers.\n\nThat said, Microsoft will face challenges in convincing organizations to replace their current CCaaS solutions. So far, adoption seems focused on those already using Dynamics or Teams who find it easy to transition.\n\nNonetheless, the solution isn\u2019t limited to traditional contact centers; it extends value to other roles, like sellers in Viva or marketers in Dynamics Marketing. Such ease of integration and adaptability make it a compelling option for existing Microsoft customers.\n\nMoreover, early customer stories are positive, and Microsoft has also catered to SMBs with its new Teams Queues App.\n\nThrough Queues, Microsoft is bringing CCaaS functionality directly into Teams instead of forcing users to adopt a traditional CCaaS platform.\n\nThe app sits on the same Dynamics 365 platform and targets non-traditional CCaaS users \u2013 like sales and product personnel \u2013 who already live in Teams.\n\n3. Zoom\n\nZoom is one of the most fascinating vendors in this space. A lot of its adoption stems from the fact that many users genuinely love Zoom. That\u2019s not just IT professionals but end-users, too.\n\nNow, it has a substantial user base and is fully committed to CCaaS, with Zoom CEO Eric Yuan taking on the role of General Manager for its contact center group. That level of personal involvement is unusual and shows how seriously Zoom is taking this.\n\nAdditionally, Zoom has impressed with how fast it has caught up feature-wise. When launched less than three years ago, its contact center was a basic, video-only offering. Since then, Zoom has upgraded at an impressive pace and can now compete with almost anyone in terms of functionality.\n\nThat said, most view Zoom\u2019s value proposition as tied to its UCaaS + CCaaS integration. While that has resonated in the midmarket, it doesn\u2019t hold as much appeal for large enterprises.\n\nAs such, expect Zoom to build out its messaging in 2025, more clearly define the vendor it wants to be, and integrate its deep communications assets into something unique and more compelling.\n\n4. 8\u00d78\n\n8\u00d78 is an interesting company. From a vision perspective, it has been ahead in many areas. For instance, it was the first company to integrate UCaaS and CCaaS. Meanwhile, like NICE, it became an early adopter of the cloud.\n\nHistorically, however, it has been strong on vision and weak on execution. It churned through CEOs before landing on Sam Wilson, a solid execution-focused leader.\n\nSince his appointment, 8\u00d78 has successfully pivoted to being CX-first, integrating Fuse effectively.\n\nAlso, 8\u00d78 has done a nice job of riding on the shoulders of Microsoft with its Teams integrations and a strong Marketplace presence.\n\nNow, the challenge is broader market awareness. When competing against the likes of NICE, Genesys, and AWS \u2013 all huge vendors \u2013 it\u2019s challenging to stand out as a smaller company with a market cap of just a few hundred million dollars.\n\nWith its November 2024 rebrand, 8\u00d78 has signaled that 2025 will be a year of doubling down on making people understand who they are and what they do.\n\nNow, it must stay the course and maintain focus, which has proven a problem in the past.\n\n5. Cisco Webex\n\n2025 seems set to be a make-or-break year for Cisco Webex in the contact center space.\n\nThe enterprise tech giant has invested heavily in Webex, its go-to-market strategy is CX-first, and it has now pinpointed the contact center as a critical avenue to land new logos.\n\nTo support this, Cisco has packed its product with AI features and pulled Webex into the same business unit as its security and networking solutions.\n\nThat suggests a lot of more \u201cCisco-on-Cisco\u201d solutions. So, for instance, if a business runs the Webex Contact Center on a Cisco network and encounters performance issues, tools like ThousandEyes or Splunk can pinpoint the problem.\n\nIn pulling this together, Cisco can craft more of a unique CCaaS story that leverages its networking and infrastructure heritage.\n\nYet, its security muscle offers the best chance of attracting contact center buyers. After all, while other industry vendors have fraud and identity solutions, there\u2019s a big difference between those and a fully-baked security and observability solution.\n\nAs such, Cisco can offer a big differentiator for global, multinational contact center deployments. It must do more to emphasize this in 2025.\n\n6. Google (& UJET)\n\nIn 2024, more industry professionals talked about Google, wondering if it\u2019s really a player in this space. Like Cisco, this feels like a critical period for the cloud giant.\n\nGoogle might have a longer runway. But does it have enough willpower to make a serious play in CCaaS beyond just contact center intelligence and connectors?\n\nIts momentum with AI, particularly Gemini, is impressive. It\u2019s arguably the leader in foundational models. If it can funnel CCaaS data into Gemini and create custom contact center AI models, it could create something compelling, especially considering Google Cloud\u2019s cost efficiency.\n\nYet, while it has great components and appeal, anything enterprise-focused has historically proven challenging for Google.\n\nIndeed, the most compelling aspects of its current CCaaS offering \u2013 like its smartphone-first design, CRM-centric architecture, and cloud failover \u2013 are features stemming from its partnership with UJET.\n\nAs such, unless Google makes more of a statement of intent in CCaaS, it may be worth paying closer attention to UJET, which is having success as a midmarket provider.\n\n7. AWS\n\nTraditionally, disruptors like Rocket Mortgage and Capital One are the companies that leverage Amazon Connect, aiming to shake up their respective industries.\n\nIn 2024, however, more traditional enterprises, such as large airlines and banks, embraced Connect. That\u2019s a significant shift, showing AWS has evolved into a mainstream CCaaS provider.\n\nYet, there\u2019s still some lingering misunderstanding about Connect. Many perceive it as a developer-heavy product. While that may have been true initially and customizability remains a differentiator, it\u2019s no longer the case. Connect now offers a feature set that rivals CCaaS leaders.\n\nIn addition, its unique utilization-based pricing model and access to tools like the Bedrock AI suite and Amazon Connect have become a robust and flexible solution.\n\nMoreover, AWS operates a 70,000-agent contact center within Amazon itself, serving as a test bed for innovations. That allows it to refine features and capabilities in a live environment before releasing them to customers.\n\nAnother hallmark of AWS is its commitment to optimizing customer spend. For example, it regularly renegotiates telecom contracts and passes the savings directly to customers. This builds trust and loyalty over time.\n\nAdditionally, its marketplace allows customers to add new tools, such as workforce management (WFM) or analytics solutions, under existing contracts without interruptions.\n\nLastly, AWS\u2019s success mirrors Amazon\u2019s broader business philosophy: make things easy for customers, and they\u2019ll keep coming back. This \u201ceasy button\u201d approach is why so many enterprises \u2013 and consumers \u2013 rely on Amazon and why it\u2019s always fascinating to see what it\u2019ll come up with next.\n\n8. Avaya\n\nDespite moving on financially, Avaya carries the stigma of its past bankruptcy filings. It\u2019s like a bad sweater it can\u2019t take off, as customers and partners keep bringing it up and refusing to let it go.\n\nAvaya now has a new CEO, Patrick Dennis, and this transition feels pivotal. Under his leadership, the company is now implementing a Broadcom-style Playbook on a smaller scale, focusing heavily on its top 1,500 customers.\n\nUnfortunately, this has led to significant layoffs, including some highly-regarded employees, which has drawn criticism. However, Avaya\u2019s strategy is clear: align resources with their core customer base and let go of anything outside that scope.\n\nHistorically, Avaya has served customers of all sizes, and this new strategy will likely lead to lots of churn and opportunities for other vendors to swoop for its many midmarket customers.\n\nWhile this is something to watch out for, don\u2019t expect Avaya to generate much noise in the public eye next year. Its strategy will focus less on marketing and more on engaging with its top customers.\n\n9. Five9\n\nFive9 is the longtime poster child for CCaaS. Yet, 2024 proved a financially challenging year. It\u2019s down almost 50 percent in stock value, and the company has had significant activist investor activity.\n\nMeanwhile, Five9 has been navigating growing pains as it transitions from serving midmarket businesses to targeting large enterprises. That requires different financial disciplines, forecasting, and sales strategies, areas where it has had to mature quickly.\n\nSo, while 2024 was very much a year of growing up for Five9, 2025 needs to be an execution year. It has experienced the challenges all CCaaS vendors will likely face in the next couple of years, especially those without an on-premise heritage \u2013 and will benefit from it over the long run.\n\nIn terms of its vision, Five9 hints at a future beyond the traditional contact center space. Yet, as it does so, it must double down on its strengths: practical, user-friendly applications.\n\nDoing so may help Five9 regain its steadiness, as the company is conventionally one that has always avoided the dramatic ups and downs of its market rivals.\n\n10. Nextiva\n\nNextiva is making a lot of noise in the space. While it\u2019s unclear whether that marketing presence will translate into field presence, digital-first brands are mentioning the vendor more often.\n\nTypically, these are brands looking to explore something new in two areas: AI self-service and automation. Moreover, they\u2019re often heavily invested in social media, not just for social service but also for marketing and commerce.\n\nSuch companies are rethinking how to engage with customers, leaning into asynchronous comms and headless commerce. They\u2019re looking beyond the typical contact center approach.\n\nTraditional contact center solutions don\u2019t often combine these elements effectively, and \u2013 recognizing this \u2013 Nextiva is broadening its appeal to this market segment.\n\n2025 will be about evaluating if there\u2019s substance behind the noise. Is Nextiva just loud, or is there something real there, particularly for high-touch, high-experience, digital-native brands?\n\nHonorable Mentions: Genesys & Talkdesk\n\nIf this were a list of the biggest CCaaS vendors, Genesys and Talkdesk would certainly feature. Yet, Miller and Kerravala expect nothing radically different from either in 2025.\n\nFor Genesys, the focus will remain on converting its existing install base. After all, that\u2019s the strategy: to be a steady and reliable partner. Although, if the provider executes on plans to spin out into an IPO, it could create more buzz.\n\nMeanwhile, Talkdesk clearly articulated its plans for 2025 in December. These fixate on targeting six key industries via innovation, embedding its contact center into third-party systems, and \u2013 of course \u2013 AI. Expect Talkdesk to walk this path.\n\nOther international contact center providers to watch out for include Bright Pattern, Content Guru, Enghouse Interactive, Odigo, Puzzel, RingCentral, Sprinklr, Twilio, Verint, Vonage, and XCALLY.",

While the big topic of AI isn\u2019t going anywhere, experts believe that the headlines this year will be far more diverse. Here\u2019s what four technology lights had to say on the topic. Mary Jacques, executive director, global ESG and regulatory compliance, Lenovo Sustainable PC design \"With e-waste generation outpacing the rise in formal recycling by a factor of almost five, enabling increased repair, refurbishment and recycling of electronics will become critical for achieving net-zero goals and addressing raw material scarcity. \u201cIn 2025, businesses will increasingly seek devices designed for longevity and maximum upgradeability, driving a stronger shift toward a more circular economy and sustainability in the tech industry. \u201cNext year, sustainable laptop design will focus on modularity for easy repair and upgrades, durable materials to enhance longevity, and increased use of recycled or recyclable components to reduce product carbon footprints and improve overall recyclability. \u201cEnergy-efficient hardware and extended software support aim to further mitigate environmental impact. \u201cRepairable designs with accessible instructions and simplified disassembly will become more widespread, alongside take-back programmes for material recovery and reuse.\"\n\nHelen Hawthorn, head of solutions engineering EMEA, Zoom AI is all about user adoption \u201cAI-first user interfaces (AIU): The next wave of innovation will blend conversational AI with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to create intuitive, AI-first user interfaces. \u201cThese interfaces will streamline workflows by prioritising personalised, action-oriented interactions that adapt to user behaviours and needs. \u201cAs AI assistants get smarter, they will have a bigger impact on our personal lives, becoming our first stop in starting new endeavours or brainstorming ideas. \u201cThese AI agents will evolve beyond simply automating tasks and will perform more complex work for us, offering personalised, emotionally intelligent guidance that strengthens our interactions with others.\u201d Federated AI models to the fore \u201cFederated AI models will lead: The performance gap between open- and closed-source AI models is rapidly decreasing. \u201cIn response, more platforms will embrace a federated AI model, where multiple language models (LLMs) are used together, providing engineers and users with more choice and best-of-breed experiences. \u201cThis shift will enable AI systems to offer more tailored and collaborative solutions across different platforms. As LLM competition heats up, first-mover advantages will become less significant, making federated models the preferred approach for many organisations. \u201cAI agents driving action-oriented information flows: AI agents will move beyond task automation to orchestrate actionable insights across entire organisations. \u201cThese agents will focus on identifying inefficiencies, optimising workflows, and ensuring that critical actions are prioritised in real-time.\u201d\n\nLiz Centoni, chief customer experience officer, Cisco Agentic AI will take centre stage \u201cIn 2025, AI won\u2019t just be a tool; it will be a collaborator. \u201cMany AI-powered tools in use today are based on static rules or datasets. \u201cAgentic AI differs in that it can continuously learn from user inputs and integrate contextual information (think: account history, network environment, user behaviour patterns and preferences), and make decisions with little to no human oversight. \u201cIn other words, unlike today\u2019s approaches that require user prompts or predefined rules, agentic AI will operate proactively. Imagine a customer service AI that predicts user needs before a query is made, or a network management AI that identifies potential issues and resolves them autonomously, ensuring uninterrupted service. \u201cThese AI agents will not just interact with humans or devices directly, but will also be able to discover, learn, and collaborate with each other to form complex workflows and/or chains of operations to automate even advanced business functions. \u201cFor instance, multiple AI agents could automate supply chain management by coordinating with each other to forecast demand, optimise inventories, coordinate deliveries, and even negotiate with suppliers.\u201d AI will surface tough reality checks for companies \u201cAI will continue to captivate businesses, promising unprecedented innovation and efficiency, and companies will continue to invest in AI-powered solutions. \u201cThis is hardly a prediction. But as AI journeys progress, so too will the understanding that the path is fraught with hurdles. \u201cDespite billions of dollars invested into AI models and AI-powered solutions in 2024, new data from Cisco\u2019s AI Readiness Index shows that AI readiness has declined by one point globally over the past year\u2014now only 13 per cent of companies are ready to leverage AI-powered technologies to their full potential. \u201cIn 2025 organisations will grapple with how best to secure the right level of compute power to meet AI workloads (today, only 21 per cent of organisations say they have the necessary GPUs to meet current and future AI demands). \u201cCompanies will need to lean on their strategic partners to identify and prioritise their AI use cases, upskill their teams, and modernise their infrastructure environments in a progressive, proportional way. \u201cIT teams will experience increasing pressure to optimise the management, hygiene, labelling, and organisation of data, which is currently spread across multiple systems and locations. \u201cThis mandate will apply to structured data typically associated with existing business processes, as well as unstructured data related to customer and user interactions. \u201cAs teams work feverishly to prepare their environments for AI, boards and leadership teams will realise that significant gains from AI will happen in the long run and progressively \u2013 starting now and improving over time \u2013 especially in areas like opening new revenue streams and improving profitability. \u201cMany boards will find themselves readjusting expectations, timelines and priorities that were established mere months ago as companies reckon with the \u201cmessy middle\u201d of AI implementation. Let\u2019s play the \u201clong game.\u201d",

            "content": "Change is often good, but it can also make people nervous and uncertain about the future. Andre Kindness, principal analyst at Forrester Research, claims that the pending Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s (HPE\u2019s) pending acquisition of Juniper Networks - plans for which were originally announced on 9th January 2024 \u2013 is causing concern across the networking ecosystem. He adds that Cisco\u2019s corporate restructuring, which aims to take away any focus on its legacy operations, is adding to customer trepidation - leading some enterprises to put their investments on hold.\n\nSpeaking about the HPE-Juniper deal, which is expected to conclude in the early part of 2025 according to a press statement from HPE, he said that there are concerns from both HPE and Juniper customers. He explains: \u201cTypically, if customers are strong enough to look outside of Cisco and they\u2019re not a Cisco shop, then HPE, Aruba, Juniper are the primary ones that they\u2019re looking at. I\u2019ve had customers put some of that on hold at this point.\u201d\n\nJuniper acquisition: \u2018Complementary\u2019\n\nThis hold hasn\u2019t dampened HPE\u2019s confidence. Antonio Neri, President & CEO of HPE comments in a Q4 statement, \u2018HPE delivers exceptional Q4, capping off a strong fiscal year that delivered industry-leading innovation\u2019, \u201cWe believe our pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, which will be very complementary to our successful HPE Aruba Networking business, will enable us to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for AI. The combined company\u2019s enhanced ability to compete and innovate will fundamentally improve the networking industry and position HPE as a leader in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at the forefront of a new era, driven by AI, hybrid cloud, and the next-generation networks that connect and empower us all. HPE\u2019s task is clear: to take action, embrace change, and lead during this era of extraordinary growth and opportunity. I am proud that our team members around the globe bring our HPE innovations to customers every day so that we can help them modernise their IT infrastructure and transform their organisations for the better.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, an HPE spokesperson says that both HPE and Juniper look forward to \u201cbeing able to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for hybrid cloud and AI to our customers.\u201d They hope that joining forces will create an enhanced ability to compete, innovate and fundamentally improve the networking industry, while also strengthening U.S. national security interests. Ultimately, HPE wants to position itself, says the spokesperson, as a strong U.S. innovator.\n\nPutting customers first\n\nAs part of the deal, Rami Rahim \u2013 the CEO of Juniper Networks will lead the unified HPE and Juniper networking business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise after then $14bn acquisition has been completed. He will report to Neri. In a statement posted 10 months ago on social media network LinkedIn, Rahim says Juniper Networks\u2019 guiding principle is to always act in the best interest of its customers. He claims that HPE\u2019s acquisition of his company won\u2019t change that:\n\n\u201cTogether, both Antonio Neri and I believe this is the right move to take full advantage of the immense AI opportunity before us. I want to be clear that our goal in embarking on this acquisition is not to eliminate products, but to offer enhanced choice and more innovation for all our service providers, cloud providers and enterprise customers.\u201d\n\nDeal to boost HPE credibility\n\nShamus McGillicuddy, Vice-President of Research for Enterprise Management Associates' network management practice says HPE\u2019s acquisition of Juniper comes at a time when HPE wanted to boost its credibility in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to network management. After all, Juniper was also growing its enterprise business, which was driven by the successful implementation of AI-based solutions and because of the acquisition of Mist.\n\nHe explains: \u201cHPE had AI capabilities through its Aruba division, but Juniper was showing more value than anyone else in the market. Also, Juniper has a lot of strength in the telecoms market \u2013 particularly with routers, and HPE was targeting that market with its data centre solutions \u2013 attempting to sell into the mobile packet core. Juniper helps HPE to build out their portfolio for service providers.\u201d\n\nRegarding the suggestion that customers have concerns about the deal, he says this is because Juniper and the Aruba division of HPE both sell switches for campus and data centres. They also both sell SD-WANs, and so he thinks that customers from both companies will inevitably be asking which product has a future. This underlies the potential for uncertainty. He adds that here is a conventional wisdom that HPE isn\u2019t good at innovation when they acquire a company. \u201cJuniper customers worry about that \u2013 at least that\u2019s the perception, but it might not be true, and there is an element of uncertainty amongst at least some Juniper customers,\u201d he claims.\n\nMcGillicuddy also observes that whenever a large company buys another large company, there a question arises about whether the people who develop the products and work in customers services as well as product development, product engineering and sales engineering will stay or go. He stresses that customers don\u2019t want those people to go.\n\nDespite this, he comments that with the Juniper acquisition, HPE is potentially positioning itself to further erode Cisco\u2019s market share, and remarks: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is uncertainty in the market, but it\u2019s a competitive market with sales and marketing opportunities.\u201d\n\nWill Cisco\u2019s restructuring help market and customer confidence, and improve Cisco\u2019s fortunes? In his view that\u2019s not clear, suggesting that to be competitive Cisco needs to demonstrate more agility and show that it can innovate faster. \u201cThey have done at least 3 lay-offs and restructuring over the last 3 years, and so it\u2019s not clear that this is the answer,\u201d he says.\n\nKeeping up with competitors\n\nStephen Thomas, Senior Industry Director - Enterprise Network Services at Frost and Sullivan, says he sees the HPE-Juniper acquisition deal as being an HPE play to keep up with Cisco, Broadcom and Huawei, as he finds that most industries tend to like the big 3 players. He therefore comments: Huawei is dominant in Asia, and this is forcing HPE, Cisco and Broadcom to expand. Cisco has already started, and Huawei is already there. They have 5G handsets to ethernet switches and telecoms equipment.\u201d\n\nHe believes the only concern is that deal may not be good for Juniper as the acquired firms. \u201cIn this case that\u2019s Juniper and Mist as both Juniper and Mist have solid reputations in their perspective markets and now will be part of the HPE family, but I don\u2019t see much overlap.\u201d He thinks there is enough competition in the marketplace to drive innovation, and so despite the expressed concern, he doesn\u2019t see the merger stifling innovation.\n\nWhile some product integration or rationalisation may occur as a result of HPE\u2019s acquisition of Juniper, Thomas also suggests that Neri\u2019s statement about there not being much overlap between HPE and Juniper\u2019s products, is valid. However, he elaborates: \u201cHe\u2019s filling gaps, but to satisfy customer concerns; he could say I am not going to do Broadcom and VMWare did with regard to pricing; bundling, or partner strategies. He should say he\u2019s going to learn from the mistakes from Broadcom. It\u2019s not only about keeping it simple; it\u2019s about doing the integrations in a faster manner. That should be some of the points he makes to clients and the market as a whole.\u201d\n\nAs for whether there is no overlap at all \u2013 and perhaps contradictorily - he considers such a statement to be \u201ca bit of a stretch\u201d, while also stressing that Juniper is a nice addition to the HPE portfolio. However, he admits there is some overlap between the \u201cAruba Edge and Mist capabilities, so they will want to get those incorporated correctly.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wait and see\u2019 approach\n\nHe concludes by saying that in the short-term for HPE and Juniper, the deal will lead to customers \u2013 and perhaps even their partners \u2013 taking a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. In the meantime, it\u2019s business as usual because the merger and the creation of synergies between the two companies. may take at least a year to complete. Yet, while some customers may in the near term look elsewhere, he thinks that if HPE gets it right amidst the \u2018chaos\u2019, the overall portfolio could put HPE on a much better footing to compete with the likes of Cisco, Broadcom, and Huawei.",

This data originated from a previously disclosed security incident announced on October 14, where hackers obtained source code, certificates, credentials, confidential documents, encryption keys, and other types of information.\n\nCisco clarified that its systems had not been breached directly. Instead, the data was taken from a public-facing DevHub environment intended to serve as a resource center providing source code, scripts, and other content to customers. While much of the data from this DevHub instance is already public, Cisco admitted that some of the files obtained by the hackers were not supposed to be public.\n\nHacker leaks data from Cisco DevHub\n\nInitially, the hacker claimed to have obtained 800 GB of files but later updated the claim to 4.5 TB of data taken from the DevHub environment. By mid-December, the hacker had made roughly 3 GB of this data available, and on Christmas Day, another batch of files totaling more than 4 GB was leaked.\n\nThis data includes source code, scripts, digital certificates, and configuration files related to Cisco products. Following the second leak, Cisco analyzed the data and confirmed that it \u201caligns with the known data set from October 14, 2024.\u201d According to the company, there has been no breach of their systems, and they have not identified any information in the content that could be used to access any of their production or enterprise environments. Previously, Cisco stated that there was no evidence sensitive personal information or financial data was compromised.\n\nHowever, this statement has since been removed from their incident reports.",

            "content": "THE business landscape has transformed rapidly in the last year and a large part of this is driven by the rise of generative AI. The technology has not only dominated strategic conversations and earning reports but also reshaped stakeholder engagement across industries.\n\nAI is poised to surpass even cloud computing and the internet as a transformative technology. It has profound impacts on how businesses navigate issues such as the ongoing skills gap, as well as their sustainability and security journeys.\n\nThe launch of the National AI Office positions Malaysia to fully leverage this transformative power.\n\nHere are six key trends we see defining Malaysia\u2019s business landscape in 2025, with AI at the helm.\n\nAI continues to take centre stage, but not without harsh reality checks\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since artificial intelligence (AI) became the dominant theme of the business world. The pressure to deploy it is relentless, with nearly all companies in Cisco\u2019s 2024 AI Readiness Index reporting a heightened urgency to implement AI solutions over the past year.\n\nHowever, only 14% of companies in Malaysia are fully ready to capture AI\u2019s potential, as reality sets in on what is needed to succeed. The primary challenge remains infrastructure readiness, with gaps in compute, data centre network performance, and cybersecurity, amongst other areas. Only 29% of companies have the necessary GPUs to meet current and future AI demands and the capabilities to protect data in AI models with end\u2013to\u2013end encryption, security audits, continuous monitoring, and instant threat response.\n\nMany Malaysian businesses are choosing off-the-shelf AI solutions rather than building these from scratch, focusing on the return on investment and business impact. This is where leveraging plug-and-play AI infrastructure like Cisco\u2019s AI PODs, which offer infrastructure stacks tailored for specific AI use cases, provides companies a flexible starting point without added complexity.\n\nAs AI becomes more accessible and ubiquitous, guardrails and data governance will become a key area of focus\n\nAs AI systems become more integrated into everyday life, discussions will focus on the responsible use, compliance, data protection, and anti-discrimination laws and AI quality standards.\n\nCollaboration between public and private sectors is essential to establish standards and regulations that promote innovation and enhance AI safety. As outlined in the National AI Roadmap 2021-2025, Malaysia aims to develop ethical AI practices, focusing on transparency, accountability, and the responsible use of AI technologies. This supports the global effort to address ethical and misinformation challenges while preserving AI\u2019s transformative power.\n\nAs companies operate across multiple jurisdictions, there will be pressure to align data storage and processing with local data sovereignty laws. The next generation of privacy laws will drive transparency, fairness, and accountability in data collection, cross-border data flows, and compliance.\n\nCybersecurity moves to machine scale and networks will move from connecting to also protecting everything\n\nNetworks will no longer just be used to connect but also protect as the threat landscape expands. Social engineering attacks becomes easier with the vast data shared online, and supply chain attacks will pose problems, given the complicated web of technology suppliers that many businesses use in their operations. Advances like quantum computing will further complicate the landscape, pushing cybersecurity to move at machine scale.\n\nThe network will emerge as a crucial pillar in managing workloads and serving as both the first and last line of security defence, especially against lateral movement attacks that infiltrate deeper into systems.\n\nAI will transform security by assisting security teams and simplifying tool management, augmenting human insights, and automating complex workflows. Innovations that infuse security into the fabric of the network like Hypershield, will enhance threat detection and response, allowing lean teams to update and patch systems efficiently.\n\nSecuring not just businesses but also their partner ecosystems is the next security frontier. As hyper-distributed defenses and federated data become standard, leveraging networks will enable companies to become self-defending, digitally resilient enterprises. The cybersecurity bill will be crucial in strengthening national resilience against cyber threats by setting stricter regulations and promoting public-private collaboration, providing a framework for businesses to enhance security and protect critical infrastructure.\n\nCompanies will need help to balance sustainability and growth in an AI-powered era\n\nThe race to AI will continue to accelerate, leading to higher power consumption levels, which will impact carbon emissions across all scopes. By 2027, AI usage is expected to consume as much water as New Zealand. In a world where net-zero goals and carbon emission reductions target loom large, companies must balance sustainability with the growth opportunities that AI brings.\n\nTo achieve this balance, businesses will seek partners offering energy-efficient products and solutions or help them adopt circular business models aligned with their net-zero timelines. AI will unlock efficiencies, heralding a new era of energy networking with software-defined networking capabilities and direct current (DC) micro grids, enhancing energy efficiency while delivering increased visibility, insights, and automation. Power over Ethernet is another innovation, delivering data centre power to devices over copper ethernet cabling, eliminating the need for separate power supplies and outlets.\n\nAdvancements in materials and design also help balance sustainability needs. Cisco\u2019s Silicon One chip exemplifies this by performing tasks efficiently with less hardware, reducing power consumption and electronic waste. Takeback and reuse programmes for end-of-use hardware will be crucial.\n\nHumans and AI will co-exist in the next generation workforce\n\nThe future of work is not about a choice between humans and machines; rather both will coexist to get work done. AI will move from just helping with tasks to becoming a key part of the future workforce, helping to address skills shortages across various roles. Increased mobility of talent, and extremely diverse populations coming into the workplace will help to relieve some of those pressures from the pressing talent shortage in the technology sector.\n\nThis will also translate into benefits at work. Employees who can harness AI for their work will outperform others who do not use AI, achieving better quality of work, productivity, and efficiency. Possessing the right skillsets to leverage AI will be crucial to any technical and non-technical role.\n\nInitiatives like the Cisco Networking Academy, which provides digital skills training including cybersecurity, are crucial in bridging the digital skills gap. As technology continues to advance, it is vital to persistently upskill, stay relevant, and leverage the latest innovations.\n\nA thriving workplace will rely on the value the office brings to work and the foundation of trust it builds\n\nReturning to the office should be a magnet, not a mandate. The future of work will be tech-driven, with roles evolving like the shift from fax to email, enabling remote connections.\n\nWork will happen in tech-enabled spaces and people will naturally seek the flexibility that technology brings to their personal lives in their work routines. This shift will raise questions around the value that the physical office will add to work. As employees shift their mindset from coming to the office to do heads-down work to using this as an opportunity to connect, innovate and collaborate with their teams, employers need to cultivate an environment that supports this type of work.\n\nWhether it\u2019s about the type of work, the location it\u2019s performed, or who it\u2019s done by, trust is a crucial element at every stage of the process. Employers must trust that they have hired the right people for the right roles, and they will deliver the goals set for them. Likewise, employees must trust that their efforts will be recognised and rewarded by their employers, with opportunities for growth and development.\n\nThis article is contributed by Cisco Malaysia managing director Hana Raja.",

The latest release contains additional sensitive materials such as Java binaries, source code, cloud server disk images, cryptographic signatures, and internal project archives.\n\nThese files were reportedly obtained due to a misconfiguration in the DevHub platform that inadvertently made certain files publicly accessible.\n\nCisco has since corrected the configuration error and restored access to DevHub after temporarily disabling it for investigation purposes.\n\nInvestigation of the Breach\n\nCisco\u2019s investigation has determined that the leaked files align with those identified during their initial analysis in October.\n\nThe company emphasized that the exposed data originated from publicly accessible pages on DevHub and did not include any sensitive customer information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.\n\nSome of the files pertain to a limited set of Cisco CX Professional Services customers, who have been notified and provided with copies of the relevant files for review.\n\nThe breach highlights growing concerns about cloud misconfigurations and their exploitation by threat actors. IntelBroker, a notorious hacker associated with high-profile cyberattacks, has claimed responsibility for this incident.\n\nThe hacker had previously alleged possession of 4.5TB of Cisco data and appears to be using these leaks to bolster their reputation within the cybercriminal community.\n\nCisco has implemented enhanced security measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. These include stricter controls over automation processes, improved monitoring systems for public-facing platforms, and expanded quality assurance testing.\n\nThe company has also involved law enforcement and third-party forensic experts to analyze the breach comprehensively.\n\nWhile Cisco maintains confidence in the integrity of its internal systems, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks posed by misconfigurations in publicly accessible platforms.\n\nCybersecurity experts have urged organizations to prioritize robust security practices and regularly audit their systems to mitigate such vulnerabilities.\n\nAs investigations continue, Cisco has assured its customers of ongoing transparency and support while addressing any outstanding concerns related to this data exposure.\n\nInvestigate Real-World Malicious Links, Malware & Phishing Attacks With ANY.RUN \u2013 Try for Free",

Technology stocks have been some of the market's best long-term performers, and the technology sector's total weighting in the S&P 500 has expanded to about 31%.\n\n\n\nEven mega-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (ticker: GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) that aren't technically classified as tech companies by the Global Industry Classification Standard have businesses that revolve around disruptive technology, such as artificial intelligence and cloud services. Here's a look at the 10 biggest U.S.-listed public tech companies:\n\nCompany Market Capitalization Apple Inc. (AAPL) $3.8 trillion Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) $3.32 trillion Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) $3.15 trillion Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) $1.09 trillion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) $1.03 trillion Oracle Corp. (ORCL) $454 billion Salesforce Inc. (CRM) $320 billion SAP SE (SAP) $290 billion ASML Holding NV (ASML) $280 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) $236 billion\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nNot only is Apple the most valuable company in the world, it is also one of the most profitable companies. While Apple's revenue growth has slowed, it reported a whopping $93.7 billion in net income in fiscal 2024. Its massive profits supported $94.9 billion in annual buybacks. One of Apple's next profit growth opportunities could be the rollout of its long-awaited, internally designed cellular modem chips starting in 2025. Apple's vertical integration strategy and ongoing product innovation could help the company improve iPhone profit margins in the next several years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.8 trillion\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nHigh-end semiconductor maker Nvidia has been one of the most spectacular growth stories in the entire stock market since the 2008 financial crisis. In March 2009, Nvidia's market cap was under $5 billion. Just 16 years later, Nvidia's historic bull run has sent the stock's market capitalization soaring above $3 trillion, and the company continues to churn out impressive growth numbers thanks to booming AI infrastructure demand. Not only was Nvidia the best-performing stock on this list in 2024, it was the third best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 for the year.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.32 trillion\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest software company and is known for its Windows operating system, Azure cloud services, LinkedIn social media platform, Office professional software suite and Xbox gaming brand. Microsoft is one of the oldest companies on this list. The company was founded in 1975 and went public in 1986. Nearly half a century after its founding, Microsoft's pivot to subscription-based software, professional cloud services and AI technology has helped it maintain the revenue growth long-term investors have come to expect. Microsoft is hoping its investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will help usher in its next era of growth.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.15 trillion\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

(AVGO)\n\nBroadcom is a diversified designer, developer and supplier of analog semiconductor devices. Broadcom has been a 20-bagger stock for investors in the past decade, gaining more than 2,234%. Those returns don't even include the stock's 1.1% dividend. In addition to its impressive organic revenue growth, Broadcom's 2023 acquisition of VMware could significantly boost its software capabilities. Broadcom is highly exposed to Apple device sales and should also continue to benefit from growth in data center networking and AI infrastructure spending. VMware could help Broadcom diversify into higher-margin, recurring software sales, providing additional financial visibility for investors.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.09 trillion\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest contract chipmaker, producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips designed by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and other customers. Taiwan Semiconductor was founded back in 1987 and has been the leading dedicated global semiconductor foundry ever since, generating a 793% return for investors in the past decade. In recent years, Taiwan Semi's foundries have become even more important to the tech world given Intel Corp. (INTC) has struggled with its in-house manufacturing processes. Taiwan Semiconductor holds an impressive 64% share of the global semiconductor foundry market.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.03 trillion\n\n\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nOracle is one of the world's largest enterprise software and cloud services providers, specializing in database management software. Oracle has stable top-line growth, generates consistent profits, has an attractive valuation and is reinvesting excess income in stock buybacks and its 0.8% dividend. Oracle has world-class data center infrastructure, and its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system helps manufacturers manage their processes, including planning and purchasing materials. The company claims its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Supercluster is currently the largest, fastest AI supercomputer available in the cloud. AI chipmaker Nvidia is one of Oracle's major cloud computing customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $454 billion\n\nSalesforce Inc. (CRM)\n\nSalesforce is the world's largest provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software. While Salesforce's revenue growth has slowed in recent years, its profits and margins have increased. Salesforce was a pioneer of the software-as-a-service model, and the company's aggressive acquisition strategy has allowed it to build the most comprehensive portfolio of CRM products in the market. Salesforce's large customer base creates opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, and the company has a history of high customer retention rates. Salesforce automation remains a high-growth market, and AI technology investments could help Salesforce capture even more market share in the coming years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $320 billion\n\nSAP SE (SAP)\n\nSAP is a global leader in ERP software. The company offers several AI-driven business solutions to help companies optimize finance, supply chains, procurement, sales and marketing. SAP's Qualtrics segment sells experience management cloud solutions. The company's intelligent spending category includes Ariba and Concur, which focus on procurement, travel and expense reporting. SAP is transitioning its business to a cloud-based model, and it has reported early success with its AI products, including its digital copilot, Joule. SAP's ability to consistently secure large-scale deals is a testament to its value to customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $290 billion\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML)\n\nASML is headquartered in the Netherlands and is one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers. The global semiconductor market could become a $1 trillion industry by 2032, and ASML is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Chipmakers use EUV technology to print increasingly smaller chip designs. ASML doesn't design or produce any chips itself, it simply designs the machines that create cutting-edge chips for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other chipmakers. Given ASML's key role in semiconductor manufacturing and its lack of competition, the company has plenty of growth opportunities ahead.\n\nMarket capitalization: $280 billion\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)\n\nCisco Systems provides networking, cloud, and cybersecurity hardware and software. Cisco is a rare value among mega-cap tech stocks given its shares trade at just a 16 forward earnings multiple. It also pays an attractive 2.7% dividend. Cisco is a market leader in enterprise networking, including switching, routing and wireless access. The company also has complementary businesses in security and collaboration services, adding diversification and cross-selling opportunities. While the rise of the public cloud has threatened Cisco's legacy business, the company has successfully pivoted its networking business to focus more on software and public cloud services.",

            "content": "The year 2024 has been one of significant uncertainty in the business world, due to factors such as global economic turbulence, high-profile elections and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nThis means merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, including in cybersecurity, faced a lot of headwinds, Stuart Pilgrim, Head of Cybersecurity M&A, KPMG UK, told Infosecurity.\n\nNevertheless, cybersecurity remains a highly fragmented marketplace that has many small businesses operating, meaning it is primed for greater consolidation.\n\n\u201cWith elections in the US and UK having now taken place, we are seeing more signs of activity and expecting this to continue into 2025,\u201d commented Pilgrim.\n\nKey Drivers of M&A Activity in 2024\n\nDespite the uncertain business environment, several high-value M&A deals were announced in 2024.\n\nA major driver of such transactions is resurgent private equity activity in the cybersecurity market following a quieter 2023, according to Mark Smith, a Director at Houlihan Lokey\u2019s Technology Group. This was highlighted by Thoma Bravo\u2019s $5.3bn deal to purchase UK-based Darktrace in October 2024.\n\n\u201cThis resurgence in private equity activity is fuelled by increased confidence, record levels of dry powder, and the perception of cybersecurity as a high-growth and resilient market,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnother driver of large deals in 2024 is the need for big cybersecurity firms to expand their capabilities, with organizations increasingly seeking broader product offerings, reducing the need for multiple vendors. Smith cited Sophos\u2019 intended purchase of SecureWorks for $859m and CyberArk\u2019s $1.5bn acquisition of Venafi as examples of this trend.\n\nThis demand means there has been a big focus on M&A\u2019s involving companies with Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services and Security Operations Centers (SOCs), who can monitor, detect and respond to cyber-attacks on customers.\n\n\u201cInvestors are keen to build pure-play cybersecurity platforms of scale,\u201d said Smith.\n\nPilgrim concurred, noting: \u201cAs this is sold as-a-service it\u2019s quite an attractive area for buyers and investors as it is recurring by nature, ensuring the contractual relationship with a customer is much more sticky and therefore people switch providers less frequently.\u201d\n\nExpected M&A Trends in 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, analysts expect cybersecurity M&A activity to continue to grow as big security firms further expand their capabilities.\n\nSmith and Pilgrim predicted a particular focus from strategic acquirers on next-generation technologies and capabilities such as AI that can improve productivity and removing the burden of certain tasks, thereby helping alleviate the cyber skills gap.\n\nPilgrim noted: \u201cWe may see a push towards investing in AI and automation capabilities, particularly for businesses who are running a SOC.\u201d\n\nTop 5 M&A Deals in 2024\n\nNumerous eye-watering M&A deals were announced or concluded in 2024, illustrating some of the trends identified above.\n\nHere are the top five M&A transactions observed by Infosecurity in 2024 in order of financial value.\n\nCisco Completes Record $28bn Splunk Acquisition\n\nOn March 18, US tech giant Cisco completed on its $28bn acquisition of Splunk, a machine-data analytics platform provider whose products are widely used for managing cyber operations.\n\nThe deal was first announced in September, 2023, and represents the biggest in Cisco\u2019s history. The firm conducted other M&A activity in 2024, including announcing its intent to purchase Robust Intelligence in August.\n\nThoma Bravo Buys Darktrace for $5.3bn\n\nPrivate equity giant Thoma Bravo completed a $5.3bn all cash acquisition of Darktrace, a UK-based cybersecurity firm specializing in AI solutions, on October 1.\n\nThoma said the deal, announced in April, will enable it to support the continued growth of Darktrace as an independent business. It is one of many recent cybersecurity acquisitions made by Thoma, which has a particular focus on the enterprise software market.\n\nMastercard Reaches $2.65bn Deal to Buy Recorded Future\n\nCard payment services giant Mastercard emphasized its commitment to cybersecurity by agreeing a $2.65bn deal acquire threat intelligence company Recorded Future from its owner Insight Partners on September 12.\n\nMastercard said Recorded Future\u2019s real-time visibility into potential threats will complement the firm\u2019s identity, fraud prevention, real-time decisioning and cybersecurity services.\n\nRecorded Future will remain an independent company under the deal, which is expected to close by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nCyberArk Acquires Venafi for $1.54bn\n\nOn October 1, identity and access management CyberArk completed its $1.54bn acquisition of Venafi from owner Thoma Bravo, after the deal was agreed in May 2024.\n\nThe transaction will see CyberArk and Venafi build end-to-end machine identity solutions across workloads, code, applications, IoT devices and containers. The purchase price encompassed approximately $1bn in cash and $540m in ordinary shares.\n\nPermira Completes $1.3bn Majority Stake in BioCatch\n\nPrivate equity firm Permira announced it had completed a majority stake in behavioral biometrics specialist BioCatch on September 9, at a $1.3bn valuation.\n\nThe transaction aims to help BioCatch accelerate the expansion of its digital fraud detection and financial crime prevention solutions. Permira highlighted the importance of behavioral biometric intelligence as a critical solution for combating AI-powered digital fraud as the key driver for this investment.\n\nConclusion\n\nCybersecurity continues to be a busy arena for M&A deals, despite the challenging economic environment. This has been demonstrated by numerous multi-billion dollar transactions that took place, highlighting how this industry is viewed as ripe for long-term investments.\n\nThe need for further consolidation in the sector, alongside a growing demand for cybersecurity companies to provide a holistic range of services, is set to drive further significant M&A activity in 2025. Here at Infosecurity we will continue to bring you all the major announcements in this space.",

But Cisco stock may look better as one of top AI stocks next year, some analysts say.\n\nCisco stock has advanced 15% in 2024 amid the purchase of software company Splunk (SPLK) for $25 billion in cash.\n\nShares in rival Arista Networks (ANET) have jumped 87% in 2024. AI workloads processed in cloud data centers require increased computing resources and networking bandwidth.\n\nBoth Arista and Cisco are targeting orders from cloud computing service providers and technology giants that operate internet data centers, known as \"hyperscalers.\"\n\nCisco Stock: AI Opportunity\n\n\"While Cisco has not gotten much credit for their AI story, Cisco is starting to see meaningful traction with webscalers around AI,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall in a report.\n\nFiscal 2025 revenue guidance for CSCO stock includes $1 billion of AI product orders, mostly driven by Ethernet networking and fiber-optic devices used to connect computer servers in data centers. Marshall noted that Cisco reported $300 million in AI-related orders in the October quarter.\n\nCisco recently told Wall Street analysts it's selling data center servers equipped with Nvidia chips for processing artificial-intelligence workloads. With the push into AI servers, Cisco is moving into a hot market with players such as Dell (DELL).\n\nMeanwhile, Cisco Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Robbins recently spoke at a Barclays financial conference.\n\n\"Mr. Robbins highlighted the opportunity for Cisco as enterprises begin to get their infrastructures ready to support AI efforts,\" said Barclays analyst Tim Long in a report. \"There is pressure to modernize driven by fear of falling behind competitors and determination to capitalize on the AI boom.\"\n\nLong added: \"The company has been doing well with hyperscalers and is leveraging Silicon One as a point of differentiation with customers. Demand for Cisco silicon is strong and Cisco has been investing more to support supply. Mr. Robbins feels good about exceeding the $1 billion target for the year.\"\n\nCisco Stock: Fiscal 2025 Guidance\n\nFor the period ended Oct. 26, Cisco earnings per share fell 18% to 91 cents, including a one-time tax benefit. Revenue fell 6% to $13.8 billion.\n\nExcluding Splunk, product orders in fiscal Q1 rose 9%, Cisco said. In the July quarter, product orders rose 6%.\n\nCisco now expects full-year fiscal 2025 revenue to be in a range of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion, vs. its earlier forecast of $55 billion to $56.2 billion.\n\nWith a 3% dividend yield, Cisco stock still finds support among institutional investors.\n\nCisco Stock: Shift To Software\n\nIn addition, the outlook for CSCO stock depends on spending trends for cloud computing infrastructure as well as corporate and telecom networks. Slowing sales for networking products continues to plague Cisco stock.\n\nCisco aims to increase recurring revenue from subscription-based software and services and shift away from its core business of selling computer network switches and routers.\n\nWith roots in data analytics software, Splunk has expanded into cybersecurity. In addition, it's undergoing a transition to a software-as-a-service business model from on-premise products.\n\nIn the long run, Cisco stock analysts expect the company's margins to improve as more revenue comes from software products.\n\nMeanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprises' (HPE) acquisition of Juniper (JNPR) will make HPE a stronger, more direct competitor with Cisco, analysts say.\n\nCisco's Growth Through Acquisitions\n\nCisco remains dominant in the corporate campus networking market. The company aims to help corporate customers build hybrid network architectures that utilize on-premise data centers and cloud-computing infrastructure.\n\nMuch of Cisco's revenue growth has come from acquisitions, long before the 2024 Splunk deal.\n\nIn 2017, Cisco acquired software maker AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. It bought BroadSoft for $1.9 billion in late 2017.\n\nIn July 2019, Cisco acquired Duo Security for $2.35 billion, marking its biggest cybersecurity acquisition since its purchase of Sourcefire in 2013. Acquiring Duo Security bolstered Cisco in an emerging category called zero trust cybersecurity.\n\nCisco in 2021 bought Acacia Communications for $4.5 billion in cash.\n\nCisco Stock: Is It A Buy Now?\n\nCSCO stock currently holds a Relative Strength Rating of 84 out of a best-possible 99. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.\n\nMeanwhile, Cisco stock also owns an IBD Composite Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.\n\nShares have an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, according to IBD MarketSmith analysis. The institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, Cisco stock has retreated back into a buy zone. Investors should monitor whether CSCO stock finds support at its 50-day moving average.\n\nFurther, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens more of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

            "content": "Cisco's stock (NASDAQ: CSCO) has been one to lean on for lessons in times of overexcitement, as a rebuild that stems back to the dot-com boom continues to take effect. With the $60 level again on the radar, and CSCO threatening a breakout into territory not seen in two decades, there may be reason to believe the narrative could be different this time around.\n\nA look at the long term Cisco chart below tells the story better than words can in many ways, with the current trajectory indicating a breakout could be on the cards with a hold on strength above $60.\n\nThe company is a global leader in networking technology, and is now making significant strides in entering the AI sector. This move comes as part of a strategic collaboration with Nvidia, focusing on AI data center servers.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Cisco experienced remarkable stock growth, achieving gains of nearly 150% in 1998 and 130% in 1999. However, the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, leading to a drastic market downturn.
