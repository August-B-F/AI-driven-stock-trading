            "content": "Jeff Greenberg / Contributor/Getty Images\n\nCoca-Cola announced another new flavor will debut next month. Orange Cream is scheduled to go on sale February 10 in the U.S. and Canada. Yup, you read that right. Coca-Cola with a tropical twist will be coming in just a short few days and will be sold in regular and zero sugar varieties.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nLately, Cocoa-Cola has been unveiling a lot of nostalgic flavors, like strawberry and Oreo flavors, so a fun orange flavor is a great new venture. In a news release about this new flavor, the brand explained why they eventually decided on Orange Cream.\n\nRelated: Coca-Cola Announces Six New Flavors And We Can't Wait To Try Them All\n\n\"Orange Cream is a cultural force. It\u2019s been around since 1905 but has seen a renaissance, with interest growing incrementally over the last 10 years. This flavor was crafted in response to consumer demand for the iconic and nostalgic taste of orange cream.\"\n\nI don't know about you but when I think of my childhood, orange creamsicles from the ice-cream truck in the summertime often comes to mind. Mixing the classic taste of Coca-Cola with a burst of orange seems like the perfect pairing.\n\nSue Lynne Cha, vice president of Marketing at Coca-Cola North America shared with Food & Wine more about the unique flavor. She said, \"Coca-Cola Orange Cream intends to reconnect consumers with a beloved flavor tradition while pushing the boundaries of taste. By blending our iconic Coca-Cola formula with refreshing orange and smooth creamy vanilla flavors, we are introducing an all-new beverage that reimagines the classic Coca-Cola experience.\"\n\nThis news comes right after Pepsi debuted their Pepsi Wild Cherry flavor. It looks like these two major soda brands aren't stopping anytime soon when it comes to having fun with nostalgic flavors. And we aren't complaining.\n\nRead the original article on Southern Living",

Company leaders cited market research indicating that consumers, especially younger generations, are \u201creally interested in juice and prebiotic sodas,\u201d said the CEO of Nutrition, Becca Kerr. Coca-Cola hopes to leverage its brand recognition to attract consumers who have yet to try a prebiotic soda but might be willing to try one from a familiar name.\n\nThough not sugar-free, Simply Pop contains no added sugar and is made with 25\u201330% real fruit juice from concentrate, depending on the flavor. The initial lineup will feature five flavors: Strawberry, Pineapple Mango, Fruit Punch, Lime, and Citrus Punch.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

            "content": "In a market environment that's anything but calm, both individual investors and mutual fund managers are rethinking their strategies. Growth stocks are proving elusive, so many are turning to defensive names\u2014a tactic long embraced by Warren Buffett.\n\nInvestor's Business Daily's \"Stocks That Funds Are Buying\" screener recently highlighted 14 stocks that fit the bill. Among these, Coca\u2011Cola (NYSE:KO) and O'Reilly Automotive (NYSE:ORLY) are getting a lot of attention.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDefensive Moves Gain Ground\n\nCoca\u2011Cola has managed to stand out even as major indexes have been slipping and market volatility has increased. According to Alpha Spread, over the past 12 months, Coca-Cola has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering a 19% return compared to the index\u2019s 9% growth. This strong performance highlights Coca-Cola\u2019s resilience and continued investor confidence.\n\nThe stock's weekly performance has placed it solidly in a buy zone, with critical entry levels around $71.77 and 72.65. Coca\u2011Cola's momentum has been strong since late January, and recent fourth\u2011quarter earnings estimates exceeded expectations, according to The Motley Fool.\n\nForecasts indicate earnings could grow by 3% to 4% in 2025. Notably, Simply Wall Street reports institutional investors hold approximately 65% of Coca-Cola\u2019s shares, highlighting strong confidence from major investment firms. A steady dividend yield of 2.8% only adds to the stock's appeal.\n\nTrending: This platform is reshaping how you invest in private companies \u2014 and you can be a part of it for $0.18 per share\n\nO'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is also turning heads. As consumers increasingly choose to maintain and repair their current vehicles over buying new ones in uncertain times, demand for auto parts has remained steady. Its share price has been creeping above a flat\u2011base buy zone, even hitting levels of $1,348.16.\n\nDespite some fluctuations following a mixed fourth\u2011quarter report in February, the stock has accumulated over a 13% gain year\u2011to\u2011date, as reported by Macrotrends.\n\nThe company's fundamentals\u2014reflected in an earnings stability factor of 7, an accumulation/distribution rating of B\u2013, and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio\u2014indicate a solid position. Recent data from Investors Business Daily shows that its relative strength rating has risen into the 90s, reinforcing its defensive status.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nIn the midst of this shift, big money managers scoop up shares, reinforcing a trend toward safer investments. Data from MarketWatch reveal that just 36% of actively managed U.S. large\u2011cap mutual funds outperformed their benchmarks in 2024. This underperformance has nudged managers to lean into stocks that promise steady returns.\n\nNot everyone sees the picture the same way. Some market strategists believe that high\u2011quality growth stocks still carry long\u2011term potential if market sentiment shifts. According to Washington Crossing Advisors, high-quality companies generally fare better in a difficult economic environment because they possess good balance sheets and sound earnings.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Warren Buffett's $24B Coca-Cola Bet Still Pays Off\u2014Stock Nears Record High As 'Big Money Managers Scoop Up Shares' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

To address this challenge, Anandana, in collaboration with the SM Sehgal Foundation, launched Project Jaldhara.\n\nThe initiative led to the construction of five check dams, replenishing groundwater and reviving agriculture. Farmers who once struggled with barren fields are now cultivating multiple crops, ensuring food security and improved incomes.\n\n\"Before, our lands remained dry, and farming was unpredictable. Now, with water readily available, we can grow three to five crops a year instead of just one,\" shares E Sudhakar, a farmer from Kodur village.\n\nFor women in Bijawar block, Chhatarpur, the daily struggle of fetching water meant walking miles, leaving little time for work or education. Meanwhile, water scarcity had also driven migration, with many farmers abandoning agriculture altogether.\n\nWith Project Pragati Graam, Anandana and Haritika introduced stop dams and ponds, bringing water access closer to communities. The result? Women now have the freedom to focus on their families and aspirations, while farmers are returning to their land.\n\n\"Earlier, we had to carry water on our heads from distant sources. Now, life is easier, and we have more time for our children\u2019s education,\" says Kalawati from Ganeshganj.\n\nMakkhan, a farmer who had left Bijawar due to water shortages, is now back: \"With better irrigation, I can grow multiple crops and support my family without taking loans.\"\n\nOnce a thriving agricultural hub, Tontari village in Dholpur faced severe groundwater depletion, forcing many farmers to stop cultivation and migrate to cities. Recognizing the need for intervention, Anandana partnered with the Lupin Human Welfare & Research Foundation to construct two check dams, restoring water availability.\n\nToday, farming is flourishing again, and migration has significantly reduced.\n\nKamala from Dholpur recalls, \"Every morning, I walked miles just to fetch a single bucket. But with rainwater harvesting initiatives by the Coca-Cola India Foundation, everything changed. The Coca-Cola India Foundation\u2019s rainwater harvesting didn\u2019t just transform my life \u2014 it sparked change across our community. Over 100 projects and billions of liters replenished annually prove the power of working together for a better future.\"\n\nSikar, a vast district in Rajasthan, has long struggled with erratic rainfall and over-exploited land, leading to severe socio-economic issues. High fluoride levels in water sources further worsened the crisis, affecting both human health and agricultural productivity. Forced by necessity, many families have had to leave their homes, migrating to the cities in a bid to secure better livelihoods.\n\nIn collaboration with SARA, Anandana implemented a water conservation initiative, constructing check dams and ponds to restore water availability. This intervention has rejuvenated over a billion liters of water, benefiting thousands of more people. Farmers, who once struggled with severe water shortages, now cultivate their fields with renewed confidence, growing multiple crops every year. This newfound water security has led to increased incomes and livelihood generation, reviving the local economy and community. Women, previously burdened with collecting water, now have more time for household and economic activities, fostering community resilience.\n\n\"Earlier, our sheep drank salty tanker water, and many fell sick. Now, they are healthier, and we\u2019ve expanded our herd from 20 to 50,\" explains Gumani, a farmer from Mangra village.\n\nFrom restoring barren lands to improving access to clean drinking water and enhancing community resilience, Anandana\u2019s efforts demonstrate the power of sustainable water management. These initiatives not only provide immediate relief but also create long-term resilience for communities across India.",

Co-developed by Fuji Electric, the machines don\u2019t need access to a power outlet and instead rely on replaceable hydrogen cartridges to fuel a chemical reaction that generates electricity, as spotted by SoraNews24.\n\nThe new vending machines have a slightly larger footprint thanks to an additional generator module on the side. That\u2019s where the hydrogen cartridges are installed, and where the chemical reaction between the hydrogen and oxygen takes place, generating power that\u2019s stored in a battery.\n\nThe company will install 58 vending machines at the Expo, and each will feature an informational display on the side educating visitors on how hydrogen power works.\n\nCoca-Cola hasn\u2019t shared specifics on how long the vending machines can be powered before their hydrogen cartridges need to be replaced. Cutting the power cord potentially allows these new machines to be installed almost anywhere, but the company will still need relatively easy access for regular maintenance.

            "content": "The Coca-Cola Co. has committed to disclosing its ongoing investments in reusable bottles and to report the results of those investment efforts after Green Century Capital Management, an environmentally responsible mutual fund advisor, pressed the company on the issue, the fund company said.\n\nCoca-Cola, the largest soft-drink maker in the world, sells beverages in more than 100 billion plastic bottles a year and is the world\u2019s largest plastic polluter, according to the Break Free from Plastic organization.\n\nHowever, in late 2024 the company dropped its goals to deliver 25% of beverages in reusable containers by 2030 and to cut 3 million metric tons of new plastic by 2025. That prompted Green Century and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow to renew pressure on the company to adopt a shareholder proposal drafted in 2022 by the two groups.\n\n\u201cThough Coca-Cola regrettably abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, this new commitment to disclosing reusable packaging investments and results will help investors track the company\u2019s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich,president of Green Century Funds. \u201cWith plastic pollution doubling every six years and less than 10% of it getting recycled, it\u2019s clear that reuse and reduction are key.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, one of the most effective ways to reduce both plastic use and plastic pollution is by replacing single-use plastic containers with reusable ones. Reusable packaging is good for business, too: Studies show that consumers want companies to give them more reusable packaging options, Green Century said in a press release.\n\nWhen Coca-Cola dropped its reuse goal in late 2024, the beverage giant stated that it plans to expand its use of reusable packaging in markets where existing infrastructure can support this important part of its portfolio. Coca-Cola reported that 14% of its beverages were sold in reusable containers in both 2022 and 2023, but that the share of Coca-Cola beverages sold in reusable glass bottles increased in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe will be monitoring Coca-Cola\u2019s disclosure on how it is investing in reusables and how this translates into more beverages sold in reusable packaging,\u201d said Frances Fairhead-Stanova, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cAt the end of the day, investors need these disclosures to ensure Coca-Cola is mitigating the regulatory, reputational and systemic risks posed by its role in the plastic pollution crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to Green Century;\n\nPlastic production is on pace to double by 2050 without meaningful action to reduce it \u2013 and companies like Coca-Cola can make an outsized impact.\n\nAlready, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic end up in our oceans, rivers and lakes every day.\n\nStudies show that microplastics are polluting the human body, too, and have been linked to serious health impacts.\n\nRead more: Lego more than doubles use of reusable in its kid-friendly bricks",

            "content": "In a market environment that's anything but calm, both individual investors and mutual fund managers are rethinking their strategies. Growth stocks are proving elusive, so many are turning to defensive names\u2014a tactic long embraced by Warren Buffett.\n\nInvestor's Business Daily's \"Stocks That Funds Are Buying\" screener recently highlighted 14 stocks that fit the bill. Among these, Coca\u2011Cola KO and O'Reilly Automotive ORLY are getting a lot of attention.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDefensive Moves Gain Ground\n\nCoca\u2011Cola has managed to stand out even as major indexes have been slipping and market volatility has increased. According to Alpha Spread, over the past 12 months, Coca-Cola has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering a 19% return compared to the index\u2019s 9% growth. This strong performance highlights Coca-Cola\u2019s resilience and continued investor confidence.\n\nThe stock's weekly performance has placed it solidly in a buy zone, with critical entry levels around $71.77 and 72.65. Coca\u2011Cola's momentum has been strong since late January, and recent fourth\u2011quarter earnings estimates exceeded expectations, according to The Motley Fool.\n\nForecasts indicate earnings could grow by 3% to 4% in 2025. Notably, Simply Wall Street reports institutional investors hold approximately 65% of Coca-Cola\u2019s shares, highlighting strong confidence from major investment firms. A steady dividend yield of 2.8% only adds to the stock's appeal.\n\nTrending: This platform is reshaping how you invest in private companies \u2014 and you can be a part of it for $0.18 per share\n\nO'Reilly Automotive ORLY is also turning heads. As consumers increasingly choose to maintain and repair their current vehicles over buying new ones in uncertain times, demand for auto parts has remained steady. Its share price has been creeping above a flat\u2011base buy zone, even hitting levels of $1,348.16.\n\nDespite some fluctuations following a mixed fourth\u2011quarter report in February, the stock has accumulated over a 13% gain year\u2011to\u2011date, as reported by Macrotrends.\n\nThe company's fundamentals\u2014reflected in an earnings stability factor of 7, an accumulation/distribution rating of B\u2013, and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio\u2014indicate a solid position. Recent data from Investors Business Daily shows that its relative strength rating has risen into the 90s, reinforcing its defensive status.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nIn the midst of this shift, big money managers scoop up shares, reinforcing a trend toward safer investments. Data from MarketWatch reveal that just 36% of actively managed U.S. large\u2011cap mutual funds outperformed their benchmarks in 2024. This underperformance has nudged managers to lean into stocks that promise steady returns.\n\nNot everyone sees the picture the same way. Some market strategists believe that high\u2011quality growth stocks still carry long\u2011term potential if market sentiment shifts. According to Washington Crossing Advisors, high-quality companies generally fare better in a difficult economic environment because they possess good balance sheets and sound earnings.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. ( ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Coca-Cola Consolidated Carry?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2024 Coca-Cola Consolidated had debt of US$1.79b, up from US$599.2m in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.44b, its net debt is less, at about US$349.3m.\n\nA Look At Coca-Cola Consolidated's Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Coca-Cola Consolidated had liabilities of US$1.31b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$2.58b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.44b and US$683.5m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nGiven Coca-Cola Consolidated has a humongous market capitalization of US$11.3b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated's net debt is only 0.31 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 497 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. And we also note warmly that Coca-Cola Consolidated grew its EBIT by 10% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Coca-Cola Consolidated will need earnings to service that debt. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out .\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Coca-Cola Consolidated recorded free cash flow worth 53% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Coca-Cola Consolidated's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Coca-Cola Consolidated is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Coca-Cola Consolidated, you may well want to .\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

I was much looking forward to playing with him because he was supposed to be one of the biggest stars of the future, a future 10-goaler. It was very hard for all of us.\n\n\"Obviously, Louis did an amazing job, but this final has been very emotional due to what happened in January. We played for Rufo.

Coca-Cola lost to LaDolfina/Tamera in the C.V. Whitney Cup final, 11-10.\n\nCoca-Cola jumped out to a 3-2 lead before Park Place clawed its way back, scoring five unanswered goals for a 7-3 advantage in the third chukker, and led 7-5 at the half.\n\n\"It was so intense and so even,\" Ulloa said. \"We are really playing as a team and that's what I like the most.

            "content": "The UK-based activist group Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has launched a campaign urging people to boycott Israeli produce and Coca-Cola in support of Palestine.\n\nPSC called on \"individuals, shops, caf\u00e9s, and venues to boycott Israeli produce and Coca-Cola\" with the aim of ultimately removing products from shop shelves. Products that are particularly targeted are avocados, hummus, dates, and oranges, which are sometimes produced in Israel.\n\nOn Saturday, The Telegraph reported that pro-Palestine activists had removed avocados, hummus, and dates from the shelves of a Preston branch of the supermarket Waitrose and then loaded them into trolleys.\n\nThe PSC told supporters that \u201cIsraeli fresh produce, like avocados, oranges, herbs, and dates, is grown in illegal Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land. When businesses in Britain sell this produce, they are supporting and profiting from Israel\u2019s land theft and ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Palestine Solidarity Campaign (@palestinesolidarityuk)\n\nEarlier in the month, activists from Chorley For Palestine piled avocados, dates, and hummus into trolleys and replaced them with stickers accusing Israel of genocide.\n\nPSC is also boycotting Coca-Cola, claiming it operates a regional distribution center in an Israeli settlement in east Jerusalem.\n\nAs part of the campaign, protesters will hold a national day of action on April 5.\n\nDuring an online planning meeting, Owen Chambers of Bristol Apartheid Free Zone said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing... is going around to shops in the area, specifically targeting independent greengrocers at the moment. And we are saying your community will support these shops if you also pledge to stop stocking Israeli fresh produce.\u201d\n\nBen Jamal of the PSC said, \u201cBy focusing together on the same targets across Britain, we can ensure that our boycott actions are causing real economic consequences for corporations that enable the Israeli apartheid.\u201d Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\n'Intimidation'\n\nA spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism told The Telegraph that \u201cOnce again, anti-Israel activists are resorting to the sort of boycott tactics that Jews have seen time and again over the centuries.\"\n\nCAA added that \"more than four-fifths of British Jews feel that boycotts of Israeli products constitute intimidation, according to our polling.\"\n\n\"These campaigns make no difference to events abroad but make all the difference here at home in ostracizing Jews and making their lives miserable.\"\n\nIn February 2024, an activist named Chris Dindar was charged with destroying \u00a3150 worth of Sabra hummus in a Hastings Sainsbury\u2019s branch, although the Criminal Prosecution Service ultimately dropped the charge in January 2025 after deciding \u201cthere was not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.\u201d",

            "content": "James Quincey, CEO of Coca-Cola, highlighted AI's limitations in replicating realistic human faces for advertising at the Adobe Summit. Despite AI's efficiency in producing content, Quincey noted its struggle with rendering human resolution, a crucial aspect for connecting with audiences.\n\nThis observation followed Coca-Cola's AI-driven Christmas commercial, which received mixed reviews due to perceived AI-generated imperfections. Quincey acknowledged that while AI streamlines ad creation, it currently falls short of capturing the nuances of human expression. \"Humans are incredibly effective at noticing AI that is not actually a human,\" he stated.\n\nCoca-Cola's early adoption of AI stemmed from a fear of being left behind. Quincey admitted the company initially lacked clear strategies for generative AI, but embraced it to avoid stagnation. \"We said, look, that's where the world's going. Let's get on and let's understand because being big tends to make us slow,\" he explained.\n\nLooking forward, Quincey anticipates a breakthrough in AI's ability to create realistic human faces, which, combined with cost-effective production, will revolutionize marketing. However, he cautioned against over-reliance on AI-generated ads, warning that excessive consumer targeting could lead to annoyance.\n\nBalancing global and local campaigns remains a challenge for Coca-Cola. Quincey emphasized the importance of maintaining brand relevance across diverse markets. \"I would prioritize elements that are relevant around the world. Sharing a Coke with a meal, for example, is a universal idea but the food can be different and local,\" he said.\n\nHe also stressed the need for personalization, recognizing that \"customers want to be the center of their own story.\" This customer-centric approach extends beyond digital platforms to physical experiences.\n\nCoca-Cola's innovation strategy involves strategic brand pruning and experimental campaigns. Quincey, acting as \"chief agitator,\" reduced the company's brand portfolio from 400 to 200. He also highlighted the use of attention-grabbing campaigns, such as the Oreo and Coke flavor, to maintain brand visibility.",

            "content": "By SoraNews24\n\nWe all know that Japan is the land of vending machines, with automated retail terminals selling everything from hot sauce to potential marriages. They\u2019re also sources of technological innovation as ways of serving their communities with foot-operated controls during the COVID-19 pandemic and machines that absorb CO2 from the surrounding air much like a tree does.\n\nThis thriving vending machine industry in Japan can be traced back to Expo \u201970 in Osaka Japan. Vending machines existed in Japan for decades prior but were generally considered a novelty and hadn\u2019t yet caught on with the general public.\n\nInterest in the machines started to pick up in the late \u201960s after the modern 100-yen and 50-yen coins went into circulation, but it was the drink machines developed by Fuji Electric for the Expo that really helped put the technology into the national spotlight. These machines served drinks that helped keep visitors cool during the blazing hot summer months of the event and showcased the convenience and reliability that they provided.\n\nAnd now, as the 2025 World Expo in Osaka approaches, we may see another evolution in this ingrained feature of Japanese infrastructure. Fuji Electric is returning yet again, this time with beverage giant Coca-Cola, to set up the world\u2019s first vending machine powered by a hydrogen cartridge, which is a hydrogen fuel cell that can be easily replaced as needed.\n\nImage: PR Times\n\nOne drawback of conventional vending machines is that they need to be plugged in at all times. Even those machines you can find in the most remote parts of Japan need to be wired into the grid or some other reliable power source to be usable.\n\nAlthough there are power lines running to the summit of Mount Fuji, they\u2019re very limited. These Coca-Cola vending machines are carried up there in July and taken down in August, so they are likely unique in that they run on some sort of battery or generator.\n\nBut with hydrogen cartridges, vending machines no longer need an outlet and can be placed anywhere they\u2019ll fit. This is just me spitballing here, but with some size modifications this could even conceivably give way to mobile vending machines that walk among us in the city streets for maximum coverage.\n\nBut for now we have a stationary hydrogen vending machine and it will be on display at this year\u2019s Expo on the north side of the Grand Ring, the large wooden structure that serves as the architectural highlight of the event.\n\nThere will also be 58 regular Coca-Cola machines there, all of which can be used the Coke ON app that\u2019s popular in Japan. With this app drinks can be bought cashlessly and remotely, allowing people with visual or other impairments to order more easily on their own smartphones. So, no matter how you look at it, the future continues to look bright for vending machines in Japan.\n\nSource: PR Times, Fuji Electric, Coca-Cola\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Coca-Cola\u2019s new Coke ON subscription service makes Japanese vending machines more fun to use\n\n-- Coca-Cola\u2019s new vending machines don\u2019t need electricity during the day to keep drinks cold\n\n-- Self-freezing bottled Coca-Cola now available at convenience store vending machines in Japan\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2025/03/21/worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-vending-machine-unveiled-by-coca-cola-at-osaka-kansai-expo/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24",

The advent of the internet and the subsequent proliferation of personal computers was going strong, yet conventional cable television and broadcast radio were still the chief way people consumed live media.\n\nThe creation of satellite-delivered subscription-based radio companies Satellite CD Radio Inc. and American Mobile Radio -- both of which would eventually change names and then merge become Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI) -- was almost mind-bending at the time. Shares of this whole new kind of company soared right out of the gate following their 1994 public offering, and understandably so.\n\nThings aren't quite as thrilling now. The internet, as it turns out, is also a solid and more flexible vehicle for delivering audio entertainment.\n\nStill, Sirius XM is evolving in some compelling ways. It's still adding more and better ad-supported options to its mix of exclusive shows and stations, for instance, keeping its service affordable as well as relevant. It's no wonder some investors are buzzing again.\n\nIf you're looking for a proven, less speculative prospect to invest in though, Sirius XM isn't it. You're better off with much more boring Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which has made far more millionaires than Sirius XM ever has.\n\nBigger and better than you might think it is\n\nSurprised? It would be a bit surprising if you weren't. Sirius XM Holdings' proverbial second act is at least somewhat promising. Coca-Cola is, well, soda.\n\nDon't confuse boring for unproductive though, just as you shouldn't mistake promising for productive. There's much to be said for predictability when the product in question is a cultural favorite that people buy over and over again.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nYes, Coca-Cola is its namesake cola, but that's hardly all the company is. Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drink, Minute Maid juice, Schweppes ginger ale, and Dasani water are just some of the other brands in this beverage giant's portfolio. It's got something to sell to everyone regardless of consumers' ever-changing preferences.\n\nIt's also the world's biggest and best-known non-alcoholic beverage company. Coke's current market cap of $300 billion is greater than any other player's in the business. And brand consultancy Interbrand ranks Coca-Cola as the world's seventh-best brand of 2024, behind Toyota Motor and ahead of Mercedes-Benz, and the only drinks name to crack last year's top 25.",

However, Park Place seized the reins in the second chukka \u2013 under the command of the three professional players, Hilario Ulloa, Louis Hine and Peke Gonzalez, they outscored Gillian Johnston and her boys 5-0 and took an impressive 6-3 lead.

And that\u2019s when Hilario Ulloa converted a penalty from the spot, that secured Park Place the coveted USPA Gold Cup.\n\nOn the other side, it could be said that this title was very special to Park Place. It is indeed a gift for the unforgettable Rufino Laulh\u00e9, the 15-years-old boy and a huge promise of polo, who left us far too soon last January in a painful car crash. Rufo was about to play his first season in Palm Beach with Park Place, but the dream was broken into pieces on that dreadful day. That\u2019s why Park Place pay tribute to Rufo through a sticker on the team jersey\u2019s sleeves, that simply reads \u201cRufo\u201d.\n\nPark Place\u2019s captain, and the man who produced the winning goal in OT, Hilario Ulloa, shared some remarkable and moving words about Rufo: \u201cI want to honour Rufo Lauhl\u00e9 today; we had a tough start of the season. I was much looking forward to playing with him, because he was supposed to be one of the the biggest stars of the future, a future 10-goaler. It was very hard for all of us. Obviously, Louis (Hine) did an amazing job, but this final has been very emotional due to what happened last January, for whom we played for, Rufo\u2026 I know he worked hard for us, for this group of people. As a matter of fact, today, we were five guys \u2013 Louis did great on the field, but no doubts Rufo probably was around here, so he has a bit of this\u201d.\n\nYes, Rufo, you won the USPA Gold Cup today, as well\u2026\n\nUSPA GOLD CUP \u2013 FINAL \u2013 SUNDAY MARCH 23\n\n\n\nPARK PLACE 10-9 COCA COLA (extra chukka)\n\nPark Place: Andrey Borodin 0, Hilario Ulloa 10 (3 goals), Peke Gonzalez 7 (4), Louis Hine 5 (3).

Products that are particularly targeted are avocados, hummus, dates, and oranges, which are sometimes produced in Israel.\n\nOn Saturday, The Telegraph reported that pro-Palestine activists had removed avocados, hummus, and dates from the shelves of a Preston branch of the supermarket Waitrose and then loaded them into trolleys.\n\nThe PSC told supporters that \u201cIsraeli fresh produce, like avocados, oranges, herbs, and dates, is grown in illegal Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land. When businesses in Britain sell this produce, they are supporting and profiting from Israel\u2019s land theft and ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Palestine Solidarity Campaign (@palestinesolidarityuk)\n\nEarlier in the month, activists from Chorley For Palestine piled avocados, dates, and hummus into trolleys and replaced them with stickers accusing Israel of genocide.\n\nPSC is also boycotting Coca-Cola, claiming it operates a regional distribution center in an Israeli settlement in east Jerusalem.\n\nAs part of the campaign, protesters will hold a national day of action on April 5.\n\nDuring an online planning meeting, Owen Chambers of Bristol Apartheid Free Zone said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing... is going around to shops in the area, specifically targeting independent greengrocers at the moment. And we are saying your community will support these shops if you also pledge to stop stocking Israeli fresh produce.\u201d\n\nBen Jamal of the PSC said, \u201cBy focusing together on the same targets across Britain, we can ensure that our boycott actions are causing real economic consequences for corporations that enable the Israeli apartheid.\u201d Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\n'Intimidation'\n\nA spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism told The Telegraph that \u201cOnce again, anti-Israel activists are resorting to the sort of boycott tactics that Jews have seen time and again over the centuries.\"\n\nCAA added that \"more than four-fifths of British Jews feel that boycotts of Israeli products constitute intimidation, according to our polling.\"\n\n\"These campaigns make no difference to events abroad but make all the difference here at home in ostracizing Jews and making their lives miserable.\"\n\nIn February 2024, an activist named Chris Dindar was charged with destroying \u00a3150 worth of Sabra hummus in a Hastings Sainsbury\u2019s branch, although the Criminal Prosecution Service ultimately dropped the charge in January 2025 after deciding \u201cthere was not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.\u201d",

            "content": "We went behind the scenes at the Coca-Cola factory to learn how it is made\n\nCoca-Cola is one of the world\u2019s most recognisable soft drink brands, and at a state-of-the-art factory just outside Lisburn, an average of 1.4 million litres of Coca-Cola beverages are produced every day. This modern facility is the latest chapter in a long history of Coca-Cola bottling in Northern Ireland, a story that dates back to 1938 when local businessman Tom Robinson first expressed interest in bringing the iconic drink to the region.\n\nOn 17th April 1939, a franchise agreement was signed with the Coca-Cola Company, leading to the formation of the Ulster Iced Drinks Company (UIDC) on Rumford Street, off Belfast\u2019s Shankill Road. Just a few weeks later, on 3rd May 1939, the first case of Coca-Cola produced in Northern Ireland was sold, with each bottle priced at just four old pence.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s role in the region became even more significant during World War II. With Northern Ireland serving as a strategic base for repairing and servicing U.S. aircraft, nearly one million American servicemen passed through during the war years. Thanks to Coca-Cola\u2019s President Robert Woodruff, who famously declared that \u201cevery man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5c wherever he is\u201d, the troops stationed in Northern Ireland were regularly refreshed with the drink.\n\nREAD MORE: Foster mum tells court harrowing details of boy who will die from cruelty inflicted on him\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: NI mum sounds alarm about ice pop ingredient after \"unresponsive\" child rushed to hospital\n\nBy 1952, Coca-Cola had expanded south, with the first bottling plant in the Republic of Ireland opening under Munster Bottlers of Cork. Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland operation continued to grow, rebranding as Coca-Cola Bottlers Ulster Ltd (CCBU) in 1963 and launching the distribution of Fanta Orange. The following year, the company acquired a new site in Lambeg, enabling greater production capacity. By the time Captain Terence O\u2019Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, officially opened the site in 1968, it was producing an impressive 50 million bottles of Coca-Cola, Fanta Orange, and 7UP each year.\n\nBy the 2000s, Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across the island of Ireland had been consolidated under Coca-Cola HBC. In 2005, a decision was made to relocate to a new, purpose-built all-island bottling plant at Knockmore Hill, Lisburn. Opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010, the site remains at the heart of Coca-Cola production for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAlongside the new bottling facility, Coca-Cola HBC also opened a Visitor Experience Centre, allowing groups to see behind the scenes of the production process. Though it temporarily closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has since reopened following a refurbishment.\n\nThe Coca-Cola HBC factory in Lisburn -Credit:Harry Bateman/Belfast Live\n\nShowing us around the facility, Visitor Experience Coordinator Cheryl Watterson began by explaining how Coca-Cola\u2019s plastic bottles are made on-site.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The process begins with rPET resin, which are little granules of recycled plastic delivered in big tonne bags each day. They are melted down at a high heat in a process known as injection moulding, where they are turned into a slick molten liquid and injected into moulds within the machine. This creates a PET preform that is then blown out like a balloon into the size and shape of the bottle.\n\n\"The next stage has three key steps: we\u2019ve got our rinser, filler, and capper. The smaller wheel is the rinser, so the bottles are upside down; they get flipped and rinsed with water. They then move across onto our bigger wheel, which is the filler. There are 144 filling heads on this filler that fill the bottles with water. The tank behind is the carbon dioxide, so that will slowly release into each bottle to give it its fizz.\"\n\nAfter this, the bottles are filled with Coca-Cola syrup, capped, labelled, and sent through quality control before being distributed across Ireland and beyond.\n\nCoca-Cola HBC is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. As part of this, the Lisburn site operates a combined heat and power plant, generating its own steam, electricity, and water. The factory also sources its water locally, with two boreholes at the former Lambeg site and another two at Knockmore Hill, ensuring sustainable production.\n\n1.4 million litres of drinks are produced at the site each day -Credit:Harry Bateman/Belfast Live\n\nWhile Knockmore Hill produces a variety of drinks including BPM, Dr Pepper, and Monster Energy, Coca-Cola remains the brand\u2019s most beloved product. Its unique flavour is due to the secret \"7X\" formula, a mystery ingredient that has been tightly guarded since 1886.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"7X is the secret ingredient of Coca-Cola. It has remained a secret since its invention, and apparently, only two people in the world know what the secret ingredient is. Apparently, these two people can't travel on a plane together in case there is an unfortunate accident,\" Cheryl revealed.\n\n\"So, it has remained a secret and is stored securely in a big vault in Atlanta in America. This is then delivered to us here at the site and stored securely until ready for production.\"\n\nFor those eager to see Coca-Cola\u2019s bottling process in action, free tours of the Coca-Cola HBC site in Lisburn are available for groups aged 13 and over.

Thanks to incredible profitability and the anticipation of future opportunities, Apple's valuation continued to march higher from there. While the company's valuation has sometimes fluctuated in conjunction with volatility in the broader market, the tech giant's stock has been an excellent performer for long-term investors. Apple has been among the largest public companies for a long time, and the business has plenty of room for growth over the long term. 2. Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.9%)(BRK.B 0.84%) is a major player in the insurance industry, offering various lines of commercial and personal insurance through subsidiaries GEICO and Gen Re. However, Berkshire also owns a diverse set of businesses.\n\nFor example, Berkshire owns restaurant chain Dairy Queen, railroad giant BNSF, and utility company Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It also owns water companies, consumer apparel businesses, battery brands, and more. Beyond its subsidiary businesses, the investment conglomerate owns a large portfolio of publicly traded stocks. With such a broad range of businesses, the company has a reputation for safety, security, and consistent performance. It's important to note that Berkshire Hathaway is the only blue chip stock on this list that doesn't pay a dividend. CEO Warren Buffett has one of the most impressive track records of market-beating returns in history and prefers investing the company's cash over paying dividends. So far, his strategy has worked out great for shareholders. 3. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO 0.45%) has been a leader in the beverage industry for more than a century, with its namesake soft drink spawning a global empire. Yet, Coca-Cola has also changed with the times and now provides a much broader array of products, including juices, sports drinks, and bottled water tailored for more health-conscious consumers.\n\nCoca-Cola, in particular, stands out for increasing its dividend. Its streak of consecutive annual dividend payment increases dates back to the early 1960s, a track record that places it among the top 10 dividend stocks on the market. 4. Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.12%) is well known for its popular consumer products, including baby shampoo, Band-Aids, and Tylenol pain reliever. However, through a stock spinoff completed in May 2023, J&J separated its consumer health products business into a new company called Kenvue (KVUE 0.3%).\n\nThe two companies are separate entities. However, at the time of the spinoff, J&J still owned roughly 90% of Kenvue stock, so it remains heavily invested in its major consumer products brands. Even with the spinoff, J&J is a true healthcare giant that makes a wide array of medical devices to help doctors and other medical professionals perform lifesaving procedures. Johnson & Johnson also has a vast pharmaceutical business and produces drugs, such as the arthritis treatment Remicade, prostate cancer drug Zytiga, and psoriasis drug Stelara.\n\nSpinning off Kenvue has also positioned J&J for better growth because the consumer health products business was generally considered the weaker of the company's segments. Johnson & Johnson has been restructured around its highly regarded pharmaceuticals and medical devices segments, and these businesses have promising long-term growth outlooks. 5. American Express Financial giant American Express (AXP 2.77%) is another blue chip stalwart to consider. It's both a credit card company and a payments network. Its main revenue generators are credit card fees and transaction processing fees. With new users and higher transaction volume, the company is poised to increase both revenue streams.\n\nIt's more than 170 years old, but it's staying relevant. In 2023, more than 75% of new consumer gold and consumer platinum card accounts were opened by millennials and Gen Z consumers. Adoption and spending among customers in the combined demographic continued to move even higher in 2024 -- an encouraging sign. American Express' management believes it can expand profits at a double-digit pace in years to come. It plans to pay out roughly a quarter of its profits as shareholder dividends. It announced a 17% increase in its dividend in March 2025. Ongoing earnings growth should lead to additional increases in future years. A bigger list A bigger list of blue chips Investors have a sizable number of blue chip stocks to choose from. Here's a list of 20 more:\n\nWhy invest? Investing in blue chip companies Blue chip stocks are smart choices for investors of all kinds. Beginning investors are likely familiar with the products and services of blue chip companies. Familiarity with a company makes buying shares more comfortable, and it's exciting to become a partial owner of a business you know. Meanwhile, long-time investors will have seen blue chip stocks rise to the top over the long haul, outlasting their weaker rivals and finding ways to stay relevant and continue growing, even as their industries change. Investors of all experience levels can appreciate the stability and reliability blue chip businesses give to shareholders. Many of these companies pay great dividends and have payout growth streaks that have earned them a spot among the illustrious ranks of the Dividend Kings. ETFs & mutual funds Hands-off investing with blue chip funds Investors interested in blue chips may also want to consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. Blue chip-focused ETFs and mutual funds bundle numerous blue chip stocks into a single security, offering a simple way to diversify across many high-quality stocks and build exposure to industries ranging from technology and hardware to pharmaceuticals and electric utilities. These investment vehicles also tend to be less volatile than individual stocks, making them particularly appealing to people who are retired or nearing retirement. Blue chip ETFs and mutual funds can also be a good fit for younger investors seeking the defensive advantages of diversification and those who don't have the time to research individual stocks adequately. Alternatively, blue chip ETFs can offer a narrower concentration of high-quality stocks than an S&P 500-tracking ETF or a Nasdaq-tracking ETF. Related investing topics\n\nIn your portfolio Blue chips in a well-balanced portfolio If you're looking for maximum growth in your stock investments, you'll also want to go beyond blue chip stocks to look at some up-and-coming small-cap stocks of innovative young companies seeking to disrupt their larger rivals. These high-growth upstarts aim to be the blue chip companies of tomorrow. However, just about every investor can benefit from having a portion of their portfolio invested in blue chip stocks. It doesn't have to be a set percentage; investors will have varying viewpoints about how much risk they want to assume. But the more you want to preserve and protect the money you have invested in the stock market, the more attractive blue chip stocks will be as you try to meet your objectives and reach your long-term financial goals.\n\nFAQ\n\nBlue chip stocks FAQ What are blue chip stocks? angle-down angle-up Blue chip stocks are those of large, well-known, and widely respected companies.

This commitment to expanding production capabilities underscores the company's confidence in the Costa Rican market and its strategic growth initiatives.\n\nOn the same day, Alimentos Prosalud (APS) celebrated the inauguration of its new pet food production facility in El Roble, Puntarenas, Costa Rica. This facility, which began operations in late 2024, marks APS's entry into the pet food sector as part of its broader five-year growth strategy aimed at enhancing its international presence.\n\nPuntarenas was carefully selected for the location due to its prosperous fishing industry and strategic access to maritime trade routes, which will support APS's goal of addressing the growing demand for premium pet food products. APS's new facility has an impressive investment footprint of $10 million, spans 2,600 square meters, and boasts a daily production capacity of 500,000 canned pet food units.\n\nAccording to an APS representative, \"Our entry into the pet food sector is a strategic move aligned with our growth objectives.\" This emphasizes the company's commitment to diversifying its production portfolio and meeting consumer demand in key markets such as the U.S., Canada, Spain, and Germany.\n\nBoth companies are making significant contributions to the local economy, with APS's new production facility alone directly employing over 1,500 individuals and supporting an additional 5,000 jobs indirectly. Recent expansions have also led to the hiring of more than 150 new employees, showcasing the impact of these developments on the region\u2019s job market.\n\nThe APS facility not only introduces the Vital Nutrition premium brand of wet pet food, which has been developed based on extensive market research and nutritional studies, but it also operates under strict international food safety and quality standards, holding a global certification. The product formulation incorporates insights from food technologists, animal nutritionists, and industry experts, ensuring a high nutritional value and palatability for pets.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, APS is leading the way with initiatives to optimize raw material usage and implement energy-efficient processes. This includes repurposing tuna by-products into fishmeal, illustrating the company\u2019s commitment to sustainable practices that align with global trends focused on environmental responsibility.\n\nThe investment and expansion efforts by Coca-Cola FEMSA and APS exemplify a broader trend of growth within Costa Rica\u2019s food production sector.

Photograph: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDeloitte, PwC and KPMG have launched a scathing attack on the Internal Revenue Service, which they accused of \u201ca pattern of arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable conduct\u201d towards multinational companies that risks eroding confidence in the US tax system.\n\nThe three accounting firms made the claims about the US tax authority in a court filing this week supporting Coca-Cola\u2019s attempt to overturn a ruling by the agency that could cost the drinks maker $18 billion (\u20ac16.6 billion).\n\nThe dispute centres on \u201ctransfer pricing\u201d arrangements relating to the allocation of profits between Coca-Cola subsidiaries in different countries. The tax arrangements had been blessed by the other Big Four accountancy, EY, which has audited the drinks maker\u2019s financial statements since 1921.\n\n[ Ireland at the centre of Coca-Cola\u2019s \u20ac15bn US tax caseOpens in new window ]\n\nIn a joint submission to the Atlanta appeals court, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG backed Coke\u2019s argument that the IRS had acted unfairly by changing the tax treatment of intercompany payments involving subsidiaries making syrups for its fizzy drinks.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe firms, which together advise the majority of US multinationals on their taxes, said the IRS was failing to live up to its stated mission to help taxpayers \u201cunderstand and meet their tax responsibilities\u201d.\n\nThe firms, which are not parties in the litigation, wrote they \u201chold a deeper concern\u201d that the tax authority\u2019s actions in the case \u201care part of a broader pattern of IRS enforcement actions that have whipsawed taxpayers across the country\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cIn our collective experience, the IRS in recent years has routinely felt empowered to discard and disavow prior agreements and audit history without supplying a justification for the proposed change.\u201d\n\nThe firms cited other cases involving the medical devices maker Medtronic and the industrial group Eaton Corp, adding that upholding the IRS\u2019s decisions in the Coca-Cola case \u201cwould risk significant negative consequences for the US tax system\u201d.\n\nThe accounting firms said taxpayers relied on the IRS adopting consistent policies in its approach to transfer pricing. \u201cIf this court does not restrain the IRS\u2019s unjustified shifts in position, other taxpayers will likely be subjected to similar arbitrary and unreasonable behaviour, contributing to an erosion of confidence in the fairness of the US tax system,\u201d they added.\n\nThe IRS said it does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe dispute with Coke is one of the most financially significant being fought by the US tax authorities and is being widely followed in corporate America. Business lobby groups including the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have weighed in to support Coke.\n\nThe company has paid $6 billion after losing the first round of its legal battle against the IRS, covering the tax years 2007 to 2009, but has told shareholders it is confident of winning its appeal and getting the money back.\n\nIf it loses, and the IRS\u2019s new treatment of Coke\u2019s transfer pricing arrangements is vindicated, the company estimates it would have to pay a further $12 billion to cover the shortfall since 2009 and result in it paying a higher rate in future.\n\nThe tax treatment of payments involving Coke\u2019s syrup makers, which are typically located in low-tax jurisdictions, has been a running sore between Coke and the IRS for decades.\n\nA similar dispute was settled in 1996 by reallocating more profits to the US parent company. Coke used the formula agreed in that case to calculate its tax returns for another decade without objection, before the IRS decided in 2015 that it had improperly suppressed US profits and ordered it to pay billions of dollars of back taxes.\n\nThe company is arguing this U-turn was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to stand,\u201d Deloitte, PwC and KPMG wrote in the their supporting brief, \u201cit could have a deleterious effect on tax administration by needlessly creating controversies rather than fostering a co-operative environment among taxpayers and the IRS.\u201d \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",

            "content": "Coca-Cola unplugged.\n\nWe all know that Japan is the land of vending machines, with automated retail terminals selling everything from hot sauce to potential marriages. They\u2019re also sources of technological innovation as ways of serving their communities with foot-operated controls during the COVID-19 pandemic and machines that absorb CO2 from the surrounding air much like a tree does.\n\nThis thriving vending machine industry in Japan can be traced back to Expo \u201970 in Osaka Japan. Vending machines existed in Japan for decades prior but were generally considered a novelty and hadn\u2019t yet caught on with the general public.\n\n\u25bc Replica of a postal vending machine that existed in Japan in the early 1900s\n\nImage: Wikipedia/Momotarou2012\n\nInterest in the machines started to pick up in the late \u201960s after the modern 100-yen and 50-yen coins went into circulation, but it was the drink machines developed by Fuji Electric for the Expo that really helped put the technology into the national spotlight. These machines served drinks that helped keep visitors cool during the blazing hot summer months of the event and showcased the convenience and reliability that they provided.\n\nAnd now, as the 2025 World Expo in Osaka approaches, we may see another evolution in this ingrained feature of Japanese infrastructure. Fuji Electric is returning yet again, this time with beverage giant Coca-Cola, to set up the world\u2019s first vending machine powered by a hydrogen cartridge, which is a hydrogen fuel cell that can be easily replaced as needed.\n\n\u25bc Look ma, no wires!\n\nImage: PR Times\n\nOne drawback of conventional vending machines is that they need to be plugged in at all times. Even those machines you can find in the most remote parts of Japan need to be wired into the grid or some other reliable power source to be usable.\n\n\u25bc Although there are power lines running to the summit of Mt. Fuji, they\u2019re very limited. These Coca-Cola vending machines are carried up there in July and taken down in August, so they are likely unique in that they run on some sort of battery or generator.\n\nBut with hydrogen cartridges, vending machines no longer need an outlet and can be placed anywhere they\u2019ll fit. This is just me spitballing here, but with some size modifications this could even conceivably give way to mobile vending machines that walk among us in the city streets for maximum coverage.\n\nBut for now we have a stationary hydrogen vending machine and it will be on display at this year\u2019s Expo on the north side of the Grand Ring, the large wooden structure that serves as the architectural highlight of the event.\n\nThere will also be 58 regular Coca-Cola machines there, all of which can be used the Coke ON app that\u2019s popular in Japan. With this app drinks can be bought cashlessly and remotely, allowing people with visual or other impairments to order more easily on their own smartphones. So, no matter how you look at it, the future continues to look bright for vending machines in Japan.\n\nSource: PR Times, Fuji Electric, Coca-Cola\n\nFeatured image: PR Times\n\n\u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

            "content": "James Quincey, Chief Zombie Killer at Coca-Cola\n\nFor a company as big as Coca-Cola, it\u2019s not easy to jump on the latest trend. The organization has 200 brands, produced by several hundred bottling partners and sold across 33 million outlets. Around 2.2 billion 8oz servings of its products are sold every single day, and there are 750,000 people working in the Coca-Cola eco-system, of whom fewer than 50,000 work at the company itself.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of moving parts to consider when implementing any new technology. But when generative AI burst onto the scene in late 2022, Coca-Cola knew it had to take notice, and soon. Speaking at this week\u2019s Adobe Summit in Las Vegas, James Quincey chairman and CEO of The CocaCola Company, explained:\n\nThe opportunity to go to gen AI, the breakthrough in gen AI, we had no idea how these could be jumped on. We said, look, that's where the world's going, let's at least get on, let's understand. Because we're big and that tends to make us slow, so if we're not in at the beginning, for us to get to scale, we often end up too late.\n\nThe company started with gen AI on pictures, using it for point of sale material for the millions of outlets selling its products. Most of these are mom and pop stores in the emerging world, and Coca-Cola would provide a picture of someone drinking a Coke in an advert. In the old, pre-GenAI days, producing these adverts required a photographer and a specialist putting all the information and visuals together. Now, there's a gen AI program that lets the individual outlets choose who they want in the picture, what drink, and what else is shown.\n\nHumans\n\nThe next stage in the firm\u2019s gen AI journey was video, something it made use of in its most recent Christmas advert, showing a family of polar bears enjoying a Coke. This advert was cheaper and much quicker to make than historical regular ads, Quincey revealed. But while gen AI brings huge productivity opportunities, there are also limitations, he added:\n\nWhat couldn't it do? It cannot produce resolution on people's faces that humans will buy into. The boundary is still inanimate or animal scale resolution of a picture, but we generally want to make ads with people in. You can make a video with music and voice, and you can customize it endlessly, but it is not yet at the stage where it can make all our ads because we want people, and humans are incredibly effective at noticing AI that\u2019s not actually a human.\n\nWhile Quincey believes gen AI will get to the point where it can produce people that humans accept as real, how long that will take is unclear. He added:\n\nBut when it breaks through, and marry that idea with what is the ultimate unit cost of making that, it's going to be a huge wave for marketing revolution creativity.\n\nThis revolution will bring a struggle between two different ends of the spectrum, according to Quincey. As the technology develops and especially as humans can be incorporated into GenAI programs, there will be a question over the cost of each iteration.\n\nOne end of the spectrum is, the cheaper it gets to make gen AI, the easier it is for companies to create highly personalized content that gives individuals a starring role in the adverts on their phone, simply by grabbing their image and dropping it into the ad. Quincey said:\n\nThe next stage is to say, well you looked at your phone and you didn't buy the product and I know you didn't buy it. Today what happens is, it goes back to a bunch of humans and they gnash their teeth and they go, okay, what can we do to make sure I click yes. In the future, the AI can do that. It can go, you didn't click yes but if it is cheap to redo the ad, I'll just make a few changes in the ad like an A/B test and redo the ad, and then reshow it to them and see if he clicks and I'll keep changing it until he clicks yes.\n\nSo the lower the cost of the ad, the more companies can set up gen AI plus a type of intelligent engine to chase consumers until they click yes. But at the other end of the spectrum, this will lead to a whole group of annoyed consumers. Quincey said:\n\nThey will start going, this has gone from Minority Report to something really weird now I'm in it. I want to buy those apps that block everything. So I block everything and where does Coke then spend its money?\n\nQuincey predicts that live experiences will fill this gap, pointing to how the music industry is changing, with so much money now being spent on live events. He added:\n\nThis interplay between the cost of the creativity, people's level of annoyance between being flooded and live experiences, in the center will be the quality of the creativity. I'm willing to let in the best stuff, I don't want to be spammed with rubbish and that interplay between these three different poles will put a premium on core creativity.\n\nLeadership\n\nAt the Adobe event, Quincey shared insights into his leadership style at Coca-Cola, which has seen numerous successes under his guidance, including increases in revenue and market share. During his first meetings as CEO of the organization, he wore jeans rather than the traditional suit, and chose to drink a beverage that wasn\u2019t Coke. He elaborated:\n\n\n\nI was trying to send two messages. One was, we needed to move to the times. We were in the South, we were very formal, hierarchical, stuck in our ways, and we needed to break out of it. When I was announced and all the fancy shows like this we did and investor stuff, if you'd ask people the next week, what's the one thing they could remember? The answer was he wore jeans and it wasn't Friday. That was a big deal 10 years ago.\n\nWith his choice of dress, Quincey was sending a clear message that the culture had to change.\n\nThe second point was around the product. The business had got itself trapped strategically in the idea it wanted to be a total beverage company, but Coke had to be the first and foremost brand. Quincey added:\n\nYou can't have all these different [products] if one has to be loved more than the others. You need to be able to choose. If you don't allow that, you trap everyone in a brand strategy that doesn't let the people choose. You are trying to sell what you make rather than make what sells.\n\nThe reason for communicating those two messages by what he wore and drank is, it\u2019s what the CEO does that\u2019s important, not what he says. Quincey noted:\n\nThe thing they can remember is, I was wearing jeans and I wasn't drinking a Coke on that day. And that was a very powerful communication.\n\nAs well as being known for his non-hierarchical leadership style and casual dress sense, Quincey has two nicknames within the business. The first is 'Chief Agitator', due to his thirst for innovation. This innovation could be anything from creating a new permanent product to changes in packaging or marketing to an attention grab. Quincey explained:\n\nIt can be a niche thing. We are just putting something out there to get attention and bring people back to the brand. So putting out a Coke in Oreo flavor is never going to last forever, but it brings attention back to the Coke brand. Innovation has multiple roles.\n\nThis focus on innovation has its downside, though, as the business has more ideas than could ever actually work. So while Quincey has the role of chief agitator, encouraging staff to do something, he\u2019s also known as the 'Chief Zombie Killer.' He argued:\n\nBecause whilst we have 200 brands now, five years ago we had 400 and that's just the brands. They come in multiple package sizes, so the number of brands times the number of packages is in the thousands.\n\nWhile his staff might see a product that was struggling and hadn't worked for the last few years, and want the opportunity to try and fix it with one more campaign or one more reprogramming, in the middle of Covid, Quincey took the decision to kill half the company\u2019s brands. He added:\n\nSo I agitate, but I'm also, does it work? And if it doesn\u2019t work, then it\u2019s got to go.\n\nMy take\n\nSome welcome insights into how major brands can use gen AI to augment their operational effectiveness and creativity, laced with a welcome reminder of the importance of the human factor.\n\nAs for that last comment about stuff that doesn't work has got to go, it's probably a useful maxim to bear in mind by everyone as the AI hype cycle continues to be out-of-control?",

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Coca-Cola (KO) standing at $69.28, reflecting a -0.14% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1.08% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.92%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.41%.\n\nThe the stock of world's largest beverage maker has risen by 0.48% in the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 3.42% and overreaching the S&P 500's loss of 8.26%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Coca-Cola will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.72 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $11.15 billion, indicating a 1.28% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nKO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.96 per share and revenue of $47.98 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +2.78% and +1.94%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.98 of its industry.\n\nOne should further note that KO currently holds a PEG ratio of 3.75. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory.

To have access to that is powerful for me. The idea that there is always someone that can be a mentor or have connections, meeting people in new or similar fields, was all very exciting.\u201d\n\nThough she was hoping to be named a Coca-Cola Scholar, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it,\u201d Krolik said. \u201cI was sitting at the table eating lunch and saw an email with a generic subject line telling me [I had been accepted].

I joined robotics knowing nothing and now I\u2019m captain. I like being able to give others the chance to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nKrolik plans to major in computation and cognition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, though she says her plans could change.\n\nDown the line, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going to end up.

Coca Cola and Park Place earned their tickets to the championship game, following their wins against Brookshire and La Dolfina Catamount, respectively.\n\nIn the first contest, Coca Cola were victorious 11-10 over Brookshire, in a hard fought match, that saw Brookshire leading until half time. Gillian Johnston\u2019s team took off in the fourth chukka, when they managed to tie at 7-all, and outscored Brookshire 3-2 in the fifth, to earn a 10-9 lead with only one chukka remaining. And it was a hotter than hell last chukka, with both teams presenting battle; at the end of the day, the last chukka ended tied 1-1, but that meant the 11-10 victory for Coca Cola and the first ticket to the final. It\u2019s worth to notice that this is the second consecutive final of The Gauntlet Of Polo for Coca Cola \u2013 they already played the decisive game of the CV Whitney Cup, and lost to La Dolfina Tamera.\n\nUp next, and in another hard fought match, Park Place defeated La Dolfina Catamount 12-11. The latter had a strong start, outscoring Park Place 4-1 in the first chukka, but Park Place bounced back until they managed to tie at 6-all by half time. Andrey Borodin\u2019s foursome took the lead in the fourth chukka (8-7), but La Dolfina Catamount had another ideas in mind; they presented battle and tied at 10-all, with only one chukka left. But luck was finally on Park Place\u2019s side \u2013 they outscored La Dolfina Catamount 2-1 in the last episode, which subsequently earned them the 12-11 win and the second spot in the championship game.\n\nCoca Cola and Park Place will go head-to-head for the USPA Gold Cup on Sunday March 23, at 4pm (Palm Beach time).\n\nThe USPA Gold Cup was established in 1974, and has been played at many different states and clubs, such as Oak Brook Polo Club, in Illinois, Milwaukee PC, in Winconsin, Greenwich Polo Club, in Greenwich, New Bridge Polo Club, among others, and was relocated in Florida, in 1979, at Palm Beach Polo and Country Club. Some great teams took home the title more than once, including Valiente (2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018), Audi (2011, 2015), Crab Orchard (2007, 2010) and Scone (2021, 2023). White Birch holds the all-time record wins with 12 titles spanning three decades.\n\nThe Gauntlet of Polo will come to an end on April 20, with the much anticipated championship match of the US Open.\n\nUSPA Gold Cup \u2013 Teams & Fixture\n\nTHE GAUNTLET OF POLO 2025 \u2013 TEAMS\n\nBTA: Ignacio Viana 7, Kelly Beal 0, Steve Kruger 5, Tom\u00e1s Panelo 10.

            "content": "Coca-Cola has experienced a notable 10.60% price increase over the past quarter, amid a backdrop of shareholder activism and market volatility. Recent proposals from shareholders addressed topics like executive pay and corporate governance, but these were largely recommended against by the company. This shareholder-centric climate coincided with the announcement of Coca-Cola's increased dividend and ongoing share buyback initiatives, potentially signaling confidence to the market. Despite similar earnings as the previous year, the company's guidance for revenue and EPS growth may have further influenced positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's market performance occurred against broader market challenges, including economic uncertainty and a selloff in tech stocks. However, a rally in the general market, which climbed 1.7% in the past week, potentially benefited the company's stock position. Overall, Coca-Cola's mix of financial strategies and proactive shareholder engagement likely contributed to its robust price performance amidst these broader market themes.\n\nUnderstand the uncertainties surrounding Coca-Cola's market positioning with our detailed risk analysis report.\n\nNYSE:KO Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nUncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.\n\nThe past five years have resulted in Coca-Cola achieving a total return of 117.69%, driven by consistent shareholder-focused initiatives. In February 2025, the expectation of 5%-6% organic revenue growth and comparable earnings per share growth underscored the company's proactive financial forecasts. Key financial moves included a completed share buyback program, involving 65 million shares since 2019, enhancing shareholder value, and a long-standing commitment to dividends, with the 63rd consecutive annual increase to $0.51 per share announced recently. Additionally, partnerships such as the collaboration with Bacardi for cocktail launches indicate Coca-Cola's efforts to diversify its product offerings.\n\nIn the past year, Coca-Cola exceeded both the broader US Beverage industry and the general market's returns, highlighting its resilience amidst economic uncertainties. However, challenges such as slower forecasted growth in revenue compared to the US market remain. Insiders have been actively selling shares recently, which could signal caution in the company's immediate financial outlook.\n\nIs Coca-Cola part of your asset mix?

A digital experience invites consumers to vote for their favorite fight song in a daily matchup for the chance to win free tickets.\n\nThe latest extension of the \u201cBest Coke Ever?\u201d creative platform will span out-of-home, experiential activations and in-game placements with the Coke Zero Sugar\u2019s Thirsty Fan Cam.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCoke Zero Sugar is attesting that \u201cfan work is thirsty work\u201d for its March Madness campaign. The effort is a continuation of its \u201cBest Coke Ever?\u201d platform, which was launched in 2021 to promote a reformulation and packaging redesign. In the latest iteration, creative materials argue that the best fans deserve the best Coke.\n\nKey to the campaign is a 30-second spot, \u201cFight Song,\u201d which begins with a series of fight songs of different Coke Zero Sugar NCAA Partner Schools competing in the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s March Madness tournament. The spot ends with a woman taking a sip of Coke Zero Sugar before continuing to cheer on a team. The campaign was handled alongside agency Cartwright and production company Iconoclast.\n\n\u201cFight Song\u201d will run through the National Championship game on April 7 on ABC, ESPN, TNT, CBS, TBS, TRU and across social media and digital channels. To engage with consumers, a digital experience will invite sports fans to vote for their favorite fight song in daily head-to-head matchups for the opportunity to win tickets to the 2026 NCAA Men\u2019s or Women\u2019s Final Four.\n\nThe brand will additionally host on-site experiential activations, including street sampling, in the NCAA Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Final Four host cities of San Antonio, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, respectively. Consumers attending the Final Four will also be greeted with commemorative 12-ounce cans of Coke Zero Sugar for the Semi-Final and Final rounds of the tournament. On-campus events at colleges and universities nationwide round out the effort.\n\nA number of brands have attempted to capitalize on March Madness hype, from Powerade to State Farm. Buffalo Wild Wings launched a campaign, \u201cSo Many TVs. Not Enough Eyes.,\u201d that positions the sports bar as the ideal spot for March Madness tournament viewing and riffs on infomercial tropes with its CGI buffalo mascot, Hank.\n\nPutting its Zero Sugar beverage in the spotlight could be valuable for Coke as the better-for-you category gains steam, particularly among younger consumers who are less open to full-sugar sodas. The prebiotic soda category is hitting a fever pitch, with Coke having launched its first offering in the space through its Simply line of beverages in February. This week, PepsiCo announced it will acquire prebiotic upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion.\n\nNotably, The Coca-Cola Company recently moved its media and data business in North America from WPP to Publicis Groupe following a closed door review, a move that could be timely as soft drink brands ramp up marketing activity in areas like the better-for-you space. The Coca-Cola Company saw net revenue increase 6% year over year to $11.5 billion in Q4 and 3% YoY to $47.1 billion in 2024, per its latest earnings statement.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is launching a vodka-based version of its Minute Maid lemonade and pink lemonade as beverage giants look to make a splash in the buzzy canned cocktail sector.\n\nThe drinks, to be released through Coke's alcohol subsidiary Red Tree Beverages, have 5% alcohol-by-volume, do not contain carbonation and come in flavors including classic lemonade and pink lemonade. The brand is also launching a line of Minute Maid Spike Vodka Punch, with flavors like citrus, berry and tropical punch.\n\nThe Coca-Cola subsidiary\u2019s move into spiked lemonade comes as food and beverage giants look to expand into the RTD space by leveraging well-known brand names. Kraft Heinz earlier this month entered the alcohol sector for the first time with the release of a Crystal Light vodka refresher.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Coca-Cola subsidiary\u2019s latest launch showcases a broader evolution in the RTD space toward spirits-based cocktails and non-carbonated juice refreshers.\n\nThe vodka cocktails expand on the debut of wine-based Minute Maid Spiked last year, which includes flavors Strawberry Daiquiri and Blue Hawaiian. The soda giant also sells Simply Spiked Lemonade canned RTDs, which are malt-based and lightly carbonated, in partnership with Molson Coors.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s foray into alcohol includes partnerships with Brown-Forman on Jack Daniel\u2019s & Coca-Cola, and Constellation Brands on Fresca Mixed. Red Tree Beverages said in the press release it brought these products to market \u201cthrough its relationships with authorized independent manufacturers.\u201d\n\nSome of the most popular canned cocktail brands have found success by honing in on the quality of their spirits. Non-carbonated vodka-infused tea and lemonade brand Surfside was the second best-selling canned cocktail made with spirits in 2024, with 378% year-over-year sales growth.\n\nSurfside\u2019s success with vodka cocktails clued the industry into a desire among younger drinkers for ready-to-drink cocktails that contain higher quality spirits, compared to malt-based canned drinks popularized in the late 2010s.\n\nThe Minute Maid Spiked drinks also seek to fulfill the growing desire for canned cocktails that are non-carbonated. Last year, Molson Coors debuted Happy Thursday spiked refreshers, aimed at Gen Z consumers.",

Over the years, the brand has consistently delivered campaigns that resonate with basketball enthusiasts, blending the excitement of the games with Coca-Cola\u2019s message of refreshment and unity. In 2021, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar launched the \u201cBest Coke Ever?\u201d campaign to showcase its refreshed recipe and packaging. This campaign featured playful showdowns between pop culture icons and basketball legends, emphasizing the brand\u2019s connection to the sport.\n\nIn 2024, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued its engagement with basketball fans by releasing the \u201cFree Throw Madness\u201d commercial.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Coca-Cola FEMSA. de's (NYSE:KOF) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Coca-Cola FEMSA. de, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.17 = Mex$41b \u00f7 (Mex$308b - Mex$67b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Coca-Cola FEMSA. de has an ROCE of 17%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 17%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola FEMSA. de\n\nNYSE:KOF Return on Capital Employed March 17th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Coca-Cola FEMSA. de compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Coca-Cola FEMSA. de for free.\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Coca-Cola FEMSA. de's ROCE Trend?\n\nCoca-Cola FEMSA. de's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 33% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Coca-Cola FEMSA. de's ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Coca-Cola FEMSA. de has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a staggering 188% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Coca-Cola FEMSA. de can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.",

Coke spent about $785 million on media in the U.S. last year, according to Comvergence data.\n\nPublicis, which was part of the original pitch for Coke\u2019s account back in 2020, has been on a hot streak as agency network rivals struggle for growth. The Coke win could be especially timely, as soft drink brands are ramping up marketing activity in areas like better-for-you beverages.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPublicis might be snapping up Coke\u2019s North American media business at just the right time. Competition in the prebiotic soda category is hitting a fever pitch, with Coke recently launching its first offering in the space through its Simply line of beverages. Coke\u2019s chief rival PepsiCo on Monday announced it was acquiring prebiotic upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion, teeing up a new fight in the long-running soda wars. Both beverage giants see better-for-you products as an inroad to young consumers who have shunned full-sugar sodas and are conscious of ingredients like artificial sweeteners.\n\nMultiple factors can lead to an agency review, but Publicis has continued to round out its specialty in the critical area of data-driven marketing. Earlier this month, the ad-holding group purchased identity solutions firm Lotame, a deal that gives Publicis access to nearly 4 billion unique consumer profiles around the world, or about 91% of internet-connected adults. When WPP first won the Coke business, executives cited the network\u2019s global scale as a key differentiator.\n\nWPP will retain other aspects of Coke\u2019s business, but the shift still comes as a blow for a company that is fighting to return to growth. WPP and Coke did not respond to Marketing Dive\u2019s request for comment on the news. Publicis declined to comment on the development. The pitch was overseen by MediaSense.\n\nThe year has so far been marked by setbacks for WPP, the world\u2019s largest ad agency. In January, Starbucks moved the bulk of its U.S. creative work to Stagwell\u2019s Anomaly just months after assigning WPP those duties. WPP was in the process of building out a bespoke Team Starbucks unit drawing on talent from multiple agencies, a marketing services model not dissimilar to an offering like Open X.\n\nWPP saw like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs, an important indicator of organic agency growth, decline 2.3% in Q4 while the measure was down 1% on the full year. Conversely, Publicis was up 6.3% in Q4 and 5.8% across 2024. Both agencies are contending with a gloomy macroeconomic picture as a mounting trade war threatens to tip the U.S. into a recession, which could carry severe implications on ad spending.",

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).\n\nCoca-Cola currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for KO\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Coca-Cola here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Coca-Cola, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in KO?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coca-Cola, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.96.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coca-Cola. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coca-Cola.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months.

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by retail investors in Coca-Cola HBC indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nThe top 6 shareholders own 50% of the company\n\nInsiders have sold recently\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Coca-Cola HBC AG (LON:CCH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 36% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nMeanwhile, private companies make up 24% of the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola HBC, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola HBC\n\nLSE:CCH Ownership Breakdown March 16th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola HBC?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Coca-Cola HBC does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola HBC, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nLSE:CCH Earnings and Revenue Growth March 16th 2025\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola HBC. Torval Investment Corp. is currently the largest shareholder, with 24% of shares outstanding. The Coca-Cola Company is the second largest shareholder owning 21% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 2.7% of the company stock.\n\nWe did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Coca-Cola HBC\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.",

            "content": "During Women's History Month in March, theScore is publishing stories that illustrate how women in sports lead, inspire change, and navigate their careers.\n\nDiana Matheson was never going to be done. The drive that defined her career, that led her to score the goal that clinched Olympic bronze in 2012 and to co-found a players' association to protect the Canada women's national team's interests, was unwavering after she retired in 2021.\n\nIt was time to start a professional women's league in Canada.\n\n\"It was a matter of, if we didn't start soon, we were going to miss this incredible window to build now. The market was going to get too big, we weren't going to be able to afford to get in,\" Matheson, who played 206 times for Canada, told theScore.\n\n\"I couldn't have lived with the regrets otherwise.\"\n\nEven the teammates who knew her best feared forming a league could be a step too far when she first floated the idea. National team members had wished it into existence for years. International opponents couldn't believe Canada had no professional women's clubs. But still, nothing had happened.\n\n\"I remember she was like, 'Well, if no one else is going to do it, I'm going to do it.' And it's like, 'Yeah, sure, D,'\" Canadian legend Christine Sinclair recalled of Matheson's plans immediately after calling it quits.\n\n\"And now she's gone and done that, and it's absolutely insane.\"\n\nThe Northern Super League (NSL), Matheson's brainchild, kicks off April 16.\n\nThe new Original Six\n\nCanada couldn't rely on revenue streams that helped women's soccer progress in other countries, such as investment from historic men's clubs and rich federations. So Matheson and fellow co-founder Thomas Gilbert, whom she met at the Smith School of Business at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 2021, encouraged owners and sponsors to provide the dollars needed to get the show on the road. Huge companies have backed the league; in the first week of March alone, the NSL announced partnerships with Coca-Cola, Intact Insurance, and Toyota.\n\n\"She's an incredibly bright mind, and I think with her work ethic, it just creates such a powerful combination,\" Canada midfielder Quinn said of Matheson.\n\nChanging Canada's soccer landscape\n\nAdvocacy association Canadian Women and Sport surveyed more than 2,000 Canadians aged 13-65 in late 2023 and found that two in three - a proportion that would represent 17 million people across the country - are fans of women's sports. That huge potential, in Canada and elsewhere, was evident as attendance records, huge merchandise sales, and unprecedented TV ratings were continuously logged throughout 2024.\n\n\"I think we've seen so much excitement around the PWHL, the NWSL, the WNBA, and leagues in Europe, and I think that Canadians are honestly itching for an opportunity to support women's professional athletes,\" Quinn said. \"It's something that unfortunately, as Canadians, we haven't had the opportunity to do, and I think the time is now to be able to do that.\"\n\nQuinn became the first Canadian to play for Duke's women's team in 2013 and went on to spend the majority of their professional career in the United States with the Washington Spirit and Seattle Reign of the NWSL. The 29-year-old, who is non-binary, is delighted to be back in Canada with Vancouver Rise FC, but acknowledged elements south of the border encouraged a return home.\n\n\"You play the best football when you're happy outside of football as well. For me, as an openly transgender person, I think it's also realizing that there's definitely some cities in America that would be more difficult to navigate versus others,\" they said, noting that living in Seattle was \"less stressful\" than their days at university in North Carolina.\n\nQuinn represents Canada at 2024 Olympics Eurasia Sport Images / Getty Images Sport / Getty\n\n\"I would be lying if I didn't think what's happening in the United States played an aspect in my decision. But I've always told myself that I want to be back in Canada and settle down long term here. So, to be closer to family, to be back in Canada - it's so exciting for me.\"\n\nQuinn, who won Olympic bronze in 2016 and gold in 2021, is excited to see how the NSL will affect the national team's fortunes. Canada's talent pool is small - especially compared with many of its rivals competing for honors in international soccer - and a lot of that was down to the lack of a professional league at home. Roster restrictions on foreign players in other countries further limit Canadian players' options in the professional game.\n\n\"There's so many athletes, so many incredible youth national team players who I played with, who went to college and didn't have opportunities as professional athletes after. That's a lost talent for Canada. So I think that this is going to be hugely different,\" Quinn said of the NSL's upcoming impact.\n\nQuinn was enthusiastic about helping young players in the United States and expected similar feelings in Vancouver, but their excitement has surged because of the added incentive of transforming Canada's sporting landscape. Between 68% and 100% of the six NSL teams' squads will be homegrown and some of those footballers will be entering the professional environment for the first time. Rather than grind overseas or even fade away from the sport, players can develop with regular playing time and potentially reach career milestones that previously seemed unobtainable.\n\n\"It brings like a whole new level of motivation for me seeing young Canadians come through and hoping that they're going to be the future of the Canadian national team,\" Quinn said.\n\nSetbacks, and more setbacks\n\nOttawa Rapid midfielder Miranda Smith will be 29 when the inaugural NSL season kicks off. That isn't exactly young in professional soccer terms.\n\n\"I thought that there was a lot of hope for the younger generations, but I thought, I'm getting older, I don't think it's gonna happen,\" Smith told theScore about playing professionally in Canada.\n\nSmith doing gym work with Ottawa Rapid FC Ottawa Rapid FC\n\nSmith's diminishing hope was understandable considering her arduous journey thus far. She found the atmosphere toxic at the University of Memphis - \"there was nothing that I could do really right for them\" - and lost her love for the game. Then a coach at the University of Ottawa vowed to rekindle her passion and delivered on that promise during a fruitful playing spell in her hometown. Smith then went overseas to pursue her professional dream, but the pandemic lockdown hindered her spells with clubs in Finland and Iceland before a big move to top-tier French side Fleury was followed by a cruel run of misfortune.\n\n\"How much time do you have?\" Smith asked.\n\nLaryngitis, a concussion, bronchitis, a sinus infection, COVID, a sprained ankle on her birthday, a knee injury, and two torn ankle ligaments prevented her from making a single appearance as Fleury finished fourth - just one place below the route into Champions League qualifiers. It was a lost season of her career, and her attempts to get up to speed at semi-professional side Ottawa South United were seriously hindered when she broke her foot and later tore the plantar fascia along the sole of her foot.\n\n\"It's really hard to stay in a good head space,\" Smith shared about her wretched 20-month spell. \"It motivated me more to come back and play because I don't want that to be my last memory in soccer.\"\n\nExcept there were more difficulties to overcome when she tested herself abroad again.\n\n\"My luck did not really turn around right away because when I got to Israel, I was there for five days and then the war started,\" Smith said. She played one match before Hamas and other militant groups attacked Israel in October 2023. She was \"really shook\" when the war erupted but, much to the alarm of her parents, returned to the country later in the 2023-24 campaign.\n\n\"I just want to play,\" was her message.\n\nThings will be very different for Smith and her family this year. It should be a succession of firsts in her career, including the midfielder's first preseason with a professional club and the first time her parents will see her play as a pro.\n\n\"I've always felt like I feel more comfortable playing when I'm at home,\" she said. \"There's so many external factors when you go somewhere else that can impact you as a person, which, in turn, can carry over onto the field. I know for me, in certain places, that was a huge thing.\"\n\nDesiree Scott, winner of three Olympic medals including Canada's first gold in 2021, joined Ottawa Rapid FC in January, and Smith is hoping to strike up a strong partnership with the iconic midfielder. Though Scott might not know it, they've met before.\n\nSmith and her teammates attended a Toronto FC match in their mid-teens when members of the Canadian women's team were introduced to the crowd. A few of the girls, including Smith, decided that tracking down their heroes was more important than watching the MLS side and eventually managed to get a picture with national team pair Scott and Christina Julien in the stands.\n\nSmith (left) and friends with CanWNT players Scott and Julien Miranda Smith\n\n\"To get to play with your role model is pretty exciting,\" Smith said of Scott. \"All of us will have so much to learn from her.\"\n\nScott initially retired after playing the 2024 NWSL season with the Kansas City Current. Her arrival has possibly turned more heads than any other acquisition ahead of the NSL's first campaign - and Smith should appreciate some overdue luck in that she's playing with her rather than against her.\n\nAFC Toronto playmaker Leah Pais, who's keeping her part-time job at a Hugo Boss store so her brother gets discounted clothes for his wedding, has visualized her skirmish with Scott. She's wary of the attributes that earned the 37-year-old her \"Destroyer\" nickname.\n\n\"Desiree Scott will for sure run me through the ground and I'm scared of that woman,\" Pais, who last played for Iceland's Throttur Reykjavik, told theScore. \"But in a midfield battle, I know that I'll just have to be quicker on my toes, and my decision-making will have to be a lot quicker so that way she doesn't get the chance to come up near me.\"\n\nAnd if Scott gets too close to the 23-year-old?\n\n\"I'll go flying.\"\n\n'We want to be a top-5 league'\n\nThe established pros from Canada and other countries, plus players such as Smith and Pais who played semi-pro in their homeland and in other countries' professional competitions, should ensure the Northern Super League's on-field quality is high from Day 1. But it needs to be seen.\n\nMatheson grew frustrated with how the NWSL displayed its product during her time playing in the United States. \"People were surprised when no one watched it,\" she said. She remembers the country's top women's league being awkwardly stowed away on cable network Lifetime or, even worse, practically hidden from view on a channel named \"nwslofficial2\" on live streaming service Twitch.\n\n\"I couldn't even find the product and I played in the league, so how do you expect to build a fan base like that?\" Matheson said before citing the growth of viewerships once the NWSL moved to CBS and the Women's Super League in England was shown on BBC and Sky Sports.\n\nMatheson also stresses the need for high broadcast quality to fit the on-pitch product.\n\n\"If you could find women's soccer over the past decade, odds were before the last three years, you'd find it and it maybe looked like a high school game or a college game,\" she said. \"Even if you had the best players in the world on the field, what you were seeing devalued the product.\"\n\nMatheson celebrates Canada's bronze-medal victory at London 2012 Steve Russell / Toronto Star / Getty Images\n\nThere's confidence behind the scenes that the product is going to be very strong. The minimum salary for players is a statement of intent itself at $50,000 CAD. For comparison, pay packets in Spain's top tier start at half that amount, and salaries in the PWHL, where the first puck dropped in January 2024, begin at $35,000 USD ($50,300 CAD). The minimum in the NWSL - which opened its 12th season Friday - is $48,500 USD ($69,700 CAD).\n\n\"We want to be a top-five league in the world,\" Matheson told theScore. \"With the average salary, with the average attendance we're projecting, with the player pool, we think we're already in that conversation.\"\n\nMatheson's optimism is infectious, but it might take time for the NSL to be truly considered among the best women's soccer leagues. There's a limit to how much Matheson, Sinclair, Quinn, Scott, former Canada goalkeepers Erin McLeod (Halifax Tides player) and Stephanie Labbe (Vancouver Rise sporting director), and other well-known figures associated with the NSL can entice gifted footballers to buy into the project. The league itself has no history or reputation to lean on; it only has a vision and promise.\n\n\"I would love for it to be a top standard from Day 1, but I think finding players who are ready to commit to a league that's unproven is difficult,\" Halifax Tides assistant coach Kennedi Kiarash said.\n\n\"There are top leagues that are proven, and that's where the best of the best are going right now.\"\n\nAnd even if the individual quality is high from the first whistle, the teams won't hit their peaks until they gel over hundreds of training sessions.\n\n\"It takes time to create that chemistry and the identity that each team is going to want to have. That just doesn't happen over the course of one preseason,\" Vancouver Rise co-owner Sinclair said, noting it took five years for her former club, the NWSL's Portland Thorns, to really find itself.\n\nPortland Thorns' Tobin Heath and Sinclair (right) celebrate in 2019 Icon Sportswire / Icon Sportswire / Getty\n\nThe league can fulfill one of its primary objectives as it develops: Producing Canadian talent. Matheson attended the Women's Leagues Forum in January and said one presentation revealed the Canadian squad ranked outside the top 10 for total minutes played in professional club soccer ahead of the 2023 Women's World Cup. The NSL should remedy that. AFC Toronto's Emma Regan and Vancouver's Samantha Chang played for Canada in the Pinatar Cup in February.\n\nMatheson wants the 2027 Women's World Cup to be a good measuring stick of how the NSL is helping the Canada women's national team.\n\n\"How many players are there playing in the NSL? We're hoping by that time, it's about a third of the roster,\" she said.\n\nPlaying for Canada isn't the only way for the trailblazing women of the NSL to inspire the next generation, though. Matches will be available on linear television and digital streaming platforms, and they will be in stadiums across the country - including venues such as BMO Field and BC Place for the home openers next month. It gives youngsters more chances than ever to watch women's soccer.\n\n\"It's just everything. It gives you the opportunity to think of a career or possibilities that you otherwise wouldn't have,\" Matheson said.\n\n\"I think it makes an impact on our culture for the young boys that are watching, too. They get to put on the TV in Canada now, and if it's pro sport on television, it's not necessarily men's pro sport. I think that can fundamentally shift societies and culture, and I love that part about it as well.\"\n\nMatheson, an engine in midfield during her playing career, has co-founded a league that has the potential to transcend soccer. It can be a genuine driving force for change.",

The research firm estimated its Canadian spend at $52 million.\n\nWPP has held the account for four years, having won the vast majority of the brand's global marketing business after a year-long pitch that ended in 2021.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company said that \"no other changes are expected\" and is in an \"advanced stage in the process of renewing its global partnership with WPP.\"\n\nIt shared the following statement: \"In 2021, Coca-Cola began its partnership with WPP Open X, which is the industry\u2019s first open-source marketing model. WPP is the only global marketing partner of The Coca-Cola Company.\n\n\"Over the course of more than three years, the partnership with WPP has delivered significant value to Coca-Cola,\" said Manolo Arroyo, global chief marketing officer of The Coca-Cola Company. 'This includes Coke being named Creative Brand of the Year at the Cannes Lions in 2024 and stepped-up capabilities such as Studio X.'\n\n\"After careful consideration, Coca-Cola is adding Publicis as a complementary partner for its U.S. and Canada media business.\"\n\nPublicis Groupe declined to comment. WPP could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nMediaSense, which managed Coca-Cola's previous global media agency review in 2021, reportedly supported the brand in the latest U.S. review. MediaSense could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to its annual report, Coca-Cola spent just over $4 billion on advertising expenses in 2024, slightly up from the previous year.\n\nThe soft drinks company has been increasingly looking to use artificial intelligence in its advertising and marketing, including its reimagined \"Holidays Are Coming\" campaign for Christmas 2024.\n\nThe U.S. media account loss comes at a challenging time for WPP, as revenue declined last year and is forecast to drop again in 2025.\n\nCoca-Cola is one of WPP\u2019s top clients and formed a bespoke unit called WPP Open X to operate as the brand\u2019s \u201cglobal marketing network partner\".\n\nWPP won the majority of the Coca-Cola business alongside Dentsu, which was selected as a complementary media partner in selected markets in 2021. Agencies from within Publicis Groupe and IPG were selected to be part of the \"strategic roster,\" which was expected to account for one-third of all marketing work.\n\nWPP Open X created the campaign \"It's Magic When the World Comes Together\" for the beverage giant during the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. EssenceMediacom handled the media planning and buying.\n\nWPP Open X manages creative, media, data and marketing technology across Coca-Cola\u2019s entire portfolio of brands and its global ventures, including Costa and Innocent.\n\nTheir brief was to change The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s marketing from a majority analogue output to 60% digital and incorporate more experiential work. They also wanted to create global consistency while localizing creative to each market.\n\nThe first year saw Coca-Cola transfer all of its media, creative, social and production into WPP, while the second year added commerce, data and technology influencer marketing and live experience.\n\nIn 2023, WPP assembled a global leadership team from within Grey to lead the account, pulling in talent from across Grey\u2019s global network to work on different briefs.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s brands include Fanta, Sprite and Costa Coffee.",

Construction will begin soon at the northeast corner of 146th Street and Howe Road, preparing a new level of service in another rapidly growing area of Hamilton County.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting time to be in Noblesville,\u201d Kroger Central Division President Colleen Juergensen said. \u201cKroger is thrilled to have such an important role in the awesome transformation taking place here. Our investment in this new store means Kroger is growing with Noblesville, supporting the city\u2019s ideals of commerce, culture and community. We\u2019re confident the new store will complement the quality of life that\u2019s drawing people here.\u201d\n\nThe new Kroger Marketplace will span nearly 123,000 square feet, room enough for more than two standard football fields under one roof. With the additional size the new store will feature wider aisles, Murray\u2019s Cheese and expanded deli options, Starbucks, popcorn made fresh in the store and an array of features that provide exceptional convenience and value for Kroger customers in Noblesville.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to welcoming the Kroger Marketplace to Noblesville,\u201d Mayor Chris Jensen said. \u201cThis new location will increase access to quality ingredients and provide more shopping options for our growing community. Kroger\u2019s commitment to giving back to the community and investing in our local economy will enhance our workforce and options available to residents.\u201d\n\nThe new Noblesville store represents what Kroger calls an \u201caggressive\u201d commitment to new stores in growing communities. In 2024, the grocer invested $56 million in remodeling and construction across Indiana, highlighted by the January opening of Fishers\u2019 new Kroger Marketplace. Kroger will continue such investments in 2025, dedicating an additional $25 million to enhance the shopping experience for its Hoosier customers.\n\nKroger representatives also said the project represents more than a new store. It reflects the grocer\u2019s commitment to its communities. Kroger and Coca-Cola Consolidated, the largest Coca-Cola bottler in the United States, joined for a donation of $10,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of Noblesville (BGCN). The funds will help the club provide nutritious food to its young members.\n\n\u201cEach week, the Boys & Girls Club serves over 1,000 snacks during our after-school program,\u201d BGCN Executive Director Becky Terry said. \u201cThis generous support from Kroger and Coca-Cola Consolidated will ensure that every child who walks through our doors has the energy to learn, play, and grow. Because when kids are fed, they\u2019re focused. When they\u2019re nourished, they thrive.\u201d\n\nKroger anticipates a ribbon-cutting to open the new store in mid-2026.",

            "content": "Mumbai: In a significant industry shake-up, Publicis Groupe has successfully won a crucial portion of The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s media and data business in the U.S. and Canada, displacing WPP, which had been handling the account since 2021. The decision follows a competitive closed-door review, marking a substantial shift in Coca-Cola\u2019s media strategy.\n\nWPP, which secured Coca-Cola\u2019s $4 billion integrated global marketing business just over three years ago, now faces the loss of a $700 million slice of the account. This move disrupts the OpenX model WPP had built specifically to unify Coca-Cola\u2019s marketing efforts, aiming for greater consistency and integration across territories.\n\nCoca-Cola emphasized that WPP remains its sole global marketing partner and is in the final stages of renewing its global contract. However, Publicis has now been brought on as a complementary partner for media planning and buying in the U.S. and Canada. The beverage giant cited its commitment to transforming its marketing approach to better engage with evolving consumer trends worldwide.\n\nIndustry analysts see the loss as a blow to WPP, particularly at a time when it is struggling with a weaker-than-expected financial performance. WPP\u2019s shares took a hit following the announcement, compounding the firm\u2019s recent market woes. For Publicis, this win follows a string of recent high-profile media account victories, including Pfizer and Hershey\u2019s, further cementing its growing dominance in the sector.\n\nDespite the setback, WPP still holds the majority of Coca-Cola\u2019s global business, particularly in creative and production. However, its media arm, GroupM, now faces increased pressure to reinforce its position as it navigates a challenging industry landscape.\n\nWith Publicis gaining momentum and WPP aiming to stabilize its global presence, the advertising industry is set for intensified competition as agencies battle for dominance in a rapidly evolving media environment.",

            "content": "Some Coca-Cola HBC AG ( ) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Mourad Ajarti, recently sold a substantial UK\u00a31.2m worth of stock at a price of UK\u00a334.34 per share. That sale reduced their total holding by 45% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola HBC\n\nNotably, that recent sale by Mourad Ajarti is the biggest insider sale of Coca-Cola HBC shares that we've seen in the last year. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of UK\u00a334.06. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nIn total, Coca-Cola HBC insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nI will like Coca-Cola HBC better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Coca-Cola HBC insiders own about UK\u00a391m worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Coca-Cola HBC Insiders?\n\nInsiders haven't bought Coca-Cola HBC stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Coca-Cola HBC makes money, and is growing profits. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We're in no rush to buy! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

            "content": "When its anaesthetic properties were demonstrated in 1884, one US neurologist breathlessly hailed a discovery 'almost as wonderful and important' as electricity.\n\nIn the UK, a 'new era' was announced by a senior doctor in the British Medical Association.\n\nCocaine was, as one report put it, the 'magic drug' - a substance which could cure all manner of ills, from coughs and colds to toothache and 'nervous debility'.\n\nEven Sherlock Holmes, the world's most famous fictional detective, was an avid user - albeit with some firm disapproval from his trusty sidekick Dr Watson.\n\nAs historian Dr Douglas Small explains, the Victorians saw cocaine as a 'high-tech solution to all kinds of medical problems'.\n\n'It was thought of a miracle drug and described as a wonder of the age,' he told MailOnline.\n\nOne application for its use as an anaesthetic was in cosmetic surgery, including early versions of the procedure that celebrities have come to love: the nose job.\n\nAll of this is hard to believe now, more than a century on from when cocaine - which is loved for the bursts of high-energy euphoria it induces in users - was first regulated in Britain.\n\nThe world's obsession with cocaine began in the late 19th century. Above: An 1899 advert for Coca-Cola, which then contained trace amounts of cocaine\n\nEven Sherlock Holmes, the world's most famous fictional detective, was an avid user - albeit with some firm disapproval from his trusty sidekick Dr Watson. Above: Actor William Gillette as Sherlock Holmes with his hypodermic syringe in a stage adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's 1890 novel The Sign of Four, where the detective was depicted using cocaine\n\nAround 1 in 40 people aged 15 to 64 in the UK use the substance that is known by nicknames including Charlie, White Lady, Bolivian Marching Powder and Foo-foo dust, even though it is a 'Class A' drug carrying a maximum sentence for possession of seven years in prison.\n\nCocaine - as it became known from 1860 - was first extracted from the leaves of the coca plant in 1855.\n\nAs Dr Small has outlined in his published research, the drug came to the attention of medics worldwide in 1884, when Austrian trainee ophthalmologist Karl Koller found that applying the substance to the surface of the eye completely numbed the area.\n\nUntil then, chloroform had been the anaesthetic of choice for nearly four decades, despite the significant risk it posed to health.\n\nNow there was a drug that could keep pain away from patients without knocking them out - meaning that eye operations and other procedures could be performed more easily.\n\nNews of the discovery spread quickly. The same year, the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital became the first institution in the UK to use the new drug.\n\nWalter G Smith, writing in the Dublin Journal of Medical Science in 1885, told of the 'wonderful' effects of cocaine as a local anaesthetic.\n\n'With such a character so suddenly acquired, cocaine seems practically to have sprung into existence fully armed for a great amount of future good in the art of medicine,' he went on.\n\nAround 1 in 40 people aged 15 to 64 in the UK use cocaine\n\nAn advert for 'menthol and cocaine pastilles' being sold at a chemist in Clifton, Bristol\n\nAn advert hailing the brilliance of 'Neurogene', made from a 'compound syrup of cocaine'. Available in 'all chemists', it was marketed to 'Speakers, Singers, Athletes, Business Men, and all who suffer from Brain Fag, or Nervous Debility'\n\nIn 1886, another writer declared it a 'wonder of the age'.\n\nThey went on: 'Cocaine flashed like a meteor before the eyes of the medical world, but, unlike a meteor, its impressions have proved to be enduring; while it is destined in the future to occupy a high position in the estimation of those whom duty requires to combat the ravages of disease.'\n\nA report in the Daily Mail about the dangers of cocaine, December 1918\n\nDr Small, the author of Cocaine, Literature, and Culture, 1876-1930, said: 'There is a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy behind it because it looks like Victorian medicine has succeeded in creating a perfect painkiller, a perfect remedy for all kinds of problems.'\n\nWhen chemist John Stith Pemberton created the original formula for Coca-Cola in 1886, trace quantities of cocaine found in the drink's coca leaf extract gave it a particularly distinctive kick.\n\nBy 1903, workaholic Methodist Asa Candler - who was handed control of the brand by Pemberton before his death in 1888 - had removed all traces of cocaine from the drink.\n\nIt of course went on to become the world's best-known brand, and now nearly two billion people consume its drinks every day.\n\nAmid the early obsession with cocaine, the drug became a key ingredient in medicines sold to combat the likes of asthma, dysentery, syphilis and even sore nipples.\n\nExcitable adverts for products containing the drug included one hailing the brilliance of 'Neurogene', made from a 'compound syrup of cocaine'.\n\nAn advert for Hall's Coca Wine from 1916. It was proclaimed 'The Elixir of Life'\n\nA US advert for 'Cocaine Toothache Drops' offering an 'Instantaneous Cure'\n\nAvailable in 'all chemists', it was marketed to 'Speakers, Singers, Athletes, Business Men, and all who suffer from Brain Fag, or Nervous Debility'.\n\nAnother notice told how you could 'clear your voice with menthol and cocaine pastilles'.\n\nBritons could, one doctor declared, 'completely arrest' a cold using 'a 4 per cent solution of hydrochlorate of cocaine applied to the nose by means of a camel's hair brush'.\n\nAlso on offer was a cocaine nasal spray for colds and flu that could be carried in the 'waistcoat pocket'.\n\nAs for cocaine lozenges, they promised to 'check all sea-sickness and sickness during pregnancy.'\n\nAs early as 1887, New-York based doctor John Orlando Roe was offering customers the chance to have a 'tip-tilted' nose resculpted after being numbed with cocaine, so they could get the 'desired aquiline shape'.\n\nThe drug's numbing effects made it similarly useful in treatments such as hair removal and the tattooing industry.\n\nIts popularity was such that even Sherlock Holmes was a user.\n\nAn advert using Pope Leo XIII to sell cocaine-infused wine\n\nAn advert for 'Coca Wine' placed by a London outlet. It was said to help 'fatigue of mind and body'\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's second Holmes novel, 1890 work The Sign of Four, opens with the sleuth injecting himself with a 'seven-per-cent solution' of cocaine.\n\nIn the face of protests from his faithful assistant Dr Watson, Sherlock insists the drug is 'transcendingly stimulating and clarifying to the mind'.\n\nAuthor Nicholas Meyer wrote a pastiche of a Holmes novel, where he depicted Dr Watson's efforts to enlist the help of Sigmund Freud to cure his friend of his addiction.\n\nThe book, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, led to the 1976 Oscar-nominated film of the same name starring Nicol Williamson as Holmes.\n\nTellingly though, Doyle's Sherlock gave up the drug.\n\nIn 1904 short story The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter, Watson - speaking of Holmes - tells the reader: 'For years I had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career.'\n\nTales of severe addiction to the drug became widespread. The British Medical Journal described the 'bitter thorn' of cocaine's 'sweet rose'.\n\nIndustry publication Druggist Circular described the 'dark side' of the drug, noting that, 'it makes a good servant, but a poor master'.\n\nAn advertisement for Vinacoca tonic wine for troublesome throats\n\nAn advert for Cocaine Pastilles that featured in the Evening Irish Times in 1885\n\nGlobal concern about drug use led to the 1912 Hague Convention, where it was decided that the use of opium, morphine and cocaine should be confined to 'legitimate medical purposes'.\n\nIn January 1916, 'Quex', the gossip columnist of a popular daily newspaper, told readers: 'I see that other people are turning their attention to the growing craze for opium smoking... West End Bohemia is hearing some dark stories of what is going on.\n\n'But still more prevalent is the use of that exciting drug cocaine.'\n\nThe columnist added: 'It is so easy to take \u2014 just snuffed up the nose; and no one seems to know why the girls who suffer from this body and soul racking habit find the drug so easy to obtain.\n\n'In the ladies' cloakroom of a certain establishment two bucketfuls of thrown-away small circular cardboard boxes were discovered by the cleaners the other day \u2014 discarded cocaine boxes.'\n\nCocaine was first regulated in the UK later that year under the sweeping Defence of the Realm Act.\n\nRegulation 40b restricted its sale and possession to people defined as 'authorised persons'. Users now needed a doctor's prescription to get cocaine legally.\n\nThe Dangerous Drugs Act of 1920 then solidified most of the provisions of Regulation 40B.\n\nCocaine is frequently cut with other chemicals that are even more harmful than the drug users think they are buying\n\nBy then, the Daily Mail had called cocaine a 'vice of the neurotic, not a habit of the normal'.\n\nAnd its usefulness in medical applications also declined as new local anaesthetics proved to be effective without carrying the societal and health risks of cocaine.\n\nLegislation did not mean the problem went away, with prohibition creating a huge black market.\n\nIt was the drug of choice for members of high society in the 1920s Jazz Age, and, although its popularity ebbed in the 1930s and 1940s, it came back into fashion with a bang.\n\nThe disco craze of the 1970s saw its use boom, and City workers in the 1980s used it to survive regimes of extremely long hours with very little sleep.\n\nIts popularity made drug lords such as the legendary Colombian Pablo Escobar extremely rich.\n\nBut beyond the glamour of the drug is the addiction, suffering and death. Celebrities including Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse and Richard Pryor died under its influence.\n\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Britain had the world's highest rate of cocaine use in 2023 - with only Australia in front.\n\nNow, its negative effects - restlessness and paranoia the least of them - are well-known.\n\nThe greatest visible harm is done to the nose itself, which can collapse with heavy use of the drug.\n\nAnd it is frequently cut with other chemicals that are even more harmful than the drug users think they are buying.\n\nIt is a sharp comedown from the 'wonder drug' proclamations made at the end of the Victorian era.",

It aims to strengthen Kandhari Global Beverages\u2019 market presence in the region.\n\nAccording to the combination notice, the transaction involves the transfer of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages\u2019 operations related to preparing, packaging, supplying, and distributing NAB products in the specified territories. The acquisition is expected to help Kandhari Global expand its geographical footprint and enhance its operational capabilities in the Indian beverage industry.\n\nKandhari Global Beverages is a key player in the Indian beverage sector, while Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages is a leading bottling and distribution arm of The Coca-Cola Company in India. The deal is anticipated to have a significant impact on market competition, and CCI\u2019s evaluation will determine whether it meets regulatory requirements to prevent any adverse effects on competition.\n\nIndustry experts view the proposed acquisition as a strategic move for Kandhari Global Beverages to consolidate its position in the NAB segment. If approved, the deal could lead to increased efficiency in supply chain management and broaden the acquirer\u2019s consumer reach in north Gujarat and Diu.\n\nThe CCI will now assess the potential implications of the combination on market dynamics, ensuring that the transaction does not lead to anti-competitive practices. Further details will emerge as the regulatory review progresses, economy watchers said.\n\nHCCB is now part owned by the Jubilant Bhartia Group that also has the Domino\u2019s Pizza and Dunkin Donuts franchises for India. Coca-Cola had recently sold a 40 percent stake in HCCB to the Indian group in December for \u20b912,500 crore ($1.47 billion).\n\nIt maybe recalled HCCB had last year sold its bottling operations in Rajasthan, Bihar, the Northeast and West Bengal to three local bottling partners \u2014 Kandhari Global, Moon Beverages and SLMG Beverages.",

Whether it\u2019s fresh takes on classics like Coca-Cola Orange Cream or entirely new lines like Simply Pop, the brand is always shaking up the soda aisle.\n\n\n\nHowever, most of Coca-Cola\u2019s new creations don\u2019t stick around for long. Even so-called \"permanent\" flavors aren\u2019t guaranteed to last\u2014just ask Coca-Cola Spiced, which disappeared from shelves after only seven months. So when a limited-time flavor makes a comeback, or better\u2014secures a spot in the line-up\u2014it\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with one of Sprite\u2019s most-loved LTOs.\n\n\n\nSprite Chill Cherry Lime Is Here to Stay\n\nSprite Chill Cherry Lime made its debut in 2024 as \"the coldest-est lemon-lime flavored soda in the game,\" arriving just in time to be the summer\u2019s go-to drink. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. From the moment it hit shelves, the response was overwhelmingly positive, with fans calling it a \"must-try.\"\n\n\n\nBut people didn\u2019t just try it\u2014they fell in love with it. Unlike many limited-edition sodas, Sprite Chill's popularity didn\u2019t fade. Instead, it became Coca-Cola\u2019s top-selling innovation of the year in North America. According to Marketing Dive, the soda racked up a staggering $50 million in retail sales in just 21 weeks, making its permanent status an easy decision for the brand.\n\n\n\nEven more impressive? It\u2019s converting non-Sprite drinkers. \"I despise Sprite,\" one Redditor admitted. \"I tried this Sprite Chill, and it is really different. It is a combination of cherry lime and that sort of crispy aftertaste that totally sold me on it.\"\n\n\n\n\"[Chill] grew Sprite trademark household penetration, which is amazing in a mature category,\" Kate Schaufelberger, brand director for Sprite, shared with Marketing Dive. \"It recruited consumers into the trademark, which is unbelievable and a standard we always want to achieve with innovation.\"\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried it yet, Sprite Chill Cherry Lime was designed to send a literal chill to your taste buds. The zesty lemon-lime base is elevated with a sweet cherry and tart lime punch, delivering a uniquely refreshing twist. But the real surprise? The soda actually tastes \"chill,\" offering a cooling sensation similar to what you get from a peppermint patty or Andes mint.\n\n\n\nCherry and lime naturally complement each other, making this flavor smooth and easy to drink. Fans have compared it to a pre-mixed Shirley Temple or Sonic\u2019s iconic Cherry Limeade. Add in the cooling effect, and you have a drink that\u2014dare we say\u2014is even more refreshing than classic Sprite.\n\n\n\n\"Better than regular Sprite to me,\" one customer shared on Reddit, while another added, \"It might make me a Sprite fan, honestly.\"\n\n\n\nThe Chill Cherry Lime flavor is available in both regular and sugar-free varieties, hitting shelves nationwide and online. While it remains to be seen if it will outsell the original Sprite, there\u2019s no doubt this drink has made a serious splash in a short time. Last year, fans said it was \u201cwhat summer needed,\u201d and we have a feeling the same will hold true for 2025\u2014and hopefully, for many more summers to come.\n\n\n\nRead the original article on ALLRECIPES",

The celebrated racer will be steering the No. 66 Ford Mustang for Garage 66 in the upcoming event at Martinsville Speedway, Virginia on March 30. The much-anticipated announcement was made by the team on Thursday, a day after Mears celebrated his 47th birthday.\n\nMobile RV repair and service company, HitchGO, is sponsoring Mears\u2019 comeback race. This marks the first time Mears will be participating in a Cup Series race since the 2019 Daytona 500.\n\n\u201cReturning to Martinsville, one of my favorite tracks, and being back behind the wheel of a race car is a thrilling prospect,\u201d Mears shared. He went on to express his gratitude towards Carl Long, the man behind Garage 66, for making his return possible.\n\nMears acknowledged Long\u2019s dedication and enduring presence in the sport, stating, \u201cCarl is a well-respected figure who\u2019s made a remarkable contribution to the sport.\u201d He also expressed his excitement about partnering with HitchGO, Mosby\u2019s Towing and Transport, and Coble Enterprises, as he inches closer to achieving 500 NASCAR Cup Series starts.\n\nMears boasts an impressive record in the Cup Series, having made 489 starts. His tenure as a full-time driver spanned from 2003 to 2016, during which he claimed one career win. This victory was achieved at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 2007, while Mears was driving for Rick Hendrick.\n\nOver his career, Mears has had the privilege to serve under some of NASCAR\u2019s most esteemed team owners, including Chip Ganassi, Hendrick, and Richard Childress. He also had successful stints with Red Bull Racing, Tommy Baldwin, and Germain Racing. His association with the latter from the end of the 2010 season to 2016 resulted in the creation of the iconic GEICO car.\n\nGarage 66, despite not being a full-time competitor, has a notable presence in the sport. The team, unfortunately, failed to qualify for the season-opening Daytona 500 with Chandler Smith. The upcoming Martinsville Speedway event marks the team\u2019s second attempt to enter a race.\n\nCarl Long, the man behind Garage 66, expressed his pride in having Mears drive for his team. \u201cCasey has driven for NASCAR\u2019s elite like Chip Ganassi Racing, Hendrick Motorsports, and Richard Childress Racing. Adding Garage 66 to that list is a great honor for our team,\u201d Long said. He praised Mears for his respectful demeanor towards fellow competitors and lauded his humility despite coming from a prestigious racing family.\n\nLong also shared his excitement about the upcoming race, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hit the Martinsville track with Casey and make it a victorious weekend for HitchGO, Mosby\u2019s Towing and Transport, and Coble Enterprises.\u201d This event promises to be an exciting chapter in the sport, marking the return of a seasoned racer and the perseverance of a dedicated team.",

Hamas activist being now being deported, with the missive Mahmoud Khalil has rights, dammit.\n\nI immediately thought of the DA in the movie Dirty Harry, as he explained that an insane killer, just arrested, couldn\u2019t be prosecuted: \u201cThat man had rights!\u201d\n\n\"Well, I'm all broken up about that man's rights\", Clint Eastwood would famously reply.\n\nGranted, in 1971, prosecuting the fictional killer at hand, given the circumstances, would have been difficult, but still possible. Maybe they get him for income tax.\n\nReal-life prosecutors have never been shy about those sorts of things when they really want somebody, like Al Capone or Donald Trump.\n\nIn the case of Mahmoud Khalil though, no tricks needed. If poor Mona had carefully read the law professor she quoted, the relevant statute was right there -- 8 U.S.C. 1182 . Any non-citizen who \u201cendorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization\u201d is removable. Khalil is accused of circulating pro-Hamas pamphlets. Hamas has been officially designated a terrorist organization since 1997.\n\nIf the judge insists on more, I\u2019m sure the government has plenty of instances of this chap supporting and advocating for Hamas. This guy has been on their radar for years.\n\nKhalil\u2019s defenders mostly understand he\u2019s deportable under our strict alien removal laws; they just complain that in the past, they were rarely used. So what?\n\nTimes have changed, and there is an army of foreign nationals getting student visas, not to study, but to build a Fifth Column of America haters. The anti-Semites at Columbia are just the first wave.\n\nMona ended her diatribe furious about Pres. Trump starting an EO investigation of the Perkins Coie law firm. These are the people at the center of all the Obama/Clinton/Biden Russiagate dirty tricks the last nine years.\n\nI only hope this investigation, and those involving James Comey, get far enough that some of the insiders start turning on each other. If not, I guess the native-born who would wreck our system will get off.\n\nForeign nationals who hate America though, are due a change of scenery. Khalil will even get a chance to explore his legal rights in whichever Middle East sewer he is sent back to.\n\nFrank Friday is an attorney in Louisville, KY.\n\nImage: Ted Eytan",

            "content": "The thrill of NASCAR is not just in the high-speed chases around the track; it\u2019s also in the dramatic incidents that take place and the fiery banter that follows. Recall the 1999 Bristol race when Dale Earnhardt Sr. spun Terry Labonte around and defended his action with the memorable words, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to turn him around, I meant to rattle his cage though\u201d. It\u2019s precisely these post-race moments that fans relish, yet they are often cut short due to broadcast constraints. However, this scenario is set to change, much to the delight of Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nTake the recent Atlanta race, where Carson Hocevar, dubbed \u2018NASCAR\u2019s villain\u2019, caused havoc among the veterans. The aftermath was destined to be a hotbed of heated exchanges, but alas, time was not on our side. If only each driver had been given the opportunity to voice their thoughts on Hocevar\u2019s intentions. Thankfully, this is no longer a pipe dream, as Amazon Prime steps into the ring.\n\nThe year 2025 marks a new chapter in NASCAR broadcasting as the streaming giant Amazon Prime comes on board. As the world embraces streaming, it\u2019s heartening to see NASCAR doing the same. Prime is set to stream five races this season, beginning with the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend. This inaugural venture marks a first for both NASCAR, venturing into the streaming territory, and Prime, broadcasting live sports.\n\nThe collaboration with Prime will open up a world of opportunities for NASCAR. With over 200 million subscribers globally, the Charlotte race has the potential to reach an audience far beyond the 3.103 million viewers it garnered in 2024. More importantly, as a streaming platform, Prime doesn\u2019t face the same constraints as traditional TV channels to move swiftly from one event to another. This puts Prime in a unique position to offer extended post-race coverage, a feature long desired by the NASCAR community, and championed by Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nIn a previous Dale Jr Download episode, Junior voiced his wish for more post-race coverage, and thanks to Prime, it\u2019s about to come true. The streaming platform offers the flexibility to run simultaneous streams and allows fans to choose the interviews they want to watch. This means no more being subjected to a victory speech by a driver you dislike before getting to hear from your favorite.\n\nHowever, the transition from traditional TV broadcasting to digital streaming was met with mixed reactions. Concerns were raised about the potential increase in costs. But as NASCAR president Steve Phelps pointed out, NASCAR fans are known to follow the distribution, and a significant percentage of them are Amazon Prime members.\n\nThe news of extended post-race coverage has been well received by fans. One fan pointed out, \u201cPrime hasn\u2019t officially started yet, and it\u2019s already better than Fox.\u201d Fox has been under scrutiny for its lackluster broadcast of past races and if Prime sets a new standard, Fox might lose its place. Many fans believe Fox could have benefited from taking a leaf out of Prime\u2019s book and using their app for streaming races.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s no secret that cable subscriptions are declining. A Forbes report reveals that in the first three quarters of 2024 alone, an estimated 5.7 million cable subscribers cut their pay-TV subscriptions. This is due to the increasing preference for streaming.\n\nThis shift in viewing habits presents a golden opportunity for Prime to deliver an improved viewing experience. If they succeed in doing so, we might soon see the entire NASCAR season on Prime. As one fan aptly put it, \u201cHopefully with a better overall broadcast experience!\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Prime\u2019s promise? Are you excited? We\u2019d love to hear from you in the comments below.",

            "content": "WPP is hoping to fend off Publicis to retain the brief as the pitch nears a conclusion. Win or lose, the spotlight will be on GroupM.\n\nThe timing of Coca-Cola\u2019s US media review couldn\u2019t be worse for WPP. Two weeks ago, the holding company posted a worse-than-expected revenue decline which caused its share price to hit a four-year low.\n\nIt was hoping that its vision for integrating AI and putting a revived GroupM front and center of a turnaround plan would set it on a new course. So, news that one of its biggest clients, Coca-Cola, is considering a move to rival Publicis (a stock market darling in comparison) will have rattled even the staunchest investors.\n\nWPP has been Coca-Cola\u2019s global network partner for four years. It won the year-long pitch against Publicis in November 2021, giving the agency responsibility for the marketing of over 200 brands in five categories across 195 countries in nine territories. In total, the business is worth $4bn to WPP.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nCoke said at the time that the depth and breadth of the WPP scope was greater than any other marketing partnership in the brand\u2019s history and WPP was expected to serve as \u201ca catalyst in the transformation of marketing effectiveness and efficiency.\u201d\n\nWPP quickly set up a bespoke team, Open X, to manage it. This was run by chief executive Laurent Ezekiel, chief communications and marketing officer, Julianna Richter, global chief strategy officer, Chris Binns, and chief creative officer, Andrew Keller.\n\nSpeaking to The Drum two years into the mandate, they said the brief was simple: Coke wanted to move its marketing from a majority analog output to 60% digital and to push the business into more live experience-based media. It also wanted to \u201ccreate consistency across its markets.\u201d The first year saw Coca-Cola transfer all of its media, creative, social and production into WPP, while the second year added commerce, data and technology, influencer marketing and live experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf rival Publicis potentially takes such a huge slice of this account \u2013 estimated to be worth $700m \u2013 so early into this relationship, it would blow up a model specifically designed to break down silos and deliver consistency and integration.\n\n\u201cIt's major. This is one of the iconic accounts, right? So, it's a major blow to GroupM and WPP at large if it ends up going to Publicis,\u201d said one source in the media industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAccording to the insider, and multiple reports, Publicis is considered the front-runner, and the review will conclude imminently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeither Publicis nor WPP has commented on the review, and the extent to which GroupM has been involved is unknown. But WPP chief Mark Read has made no secret of the media agency\u2019s importance to the group, saying it is the key to unlocking value for clients as it invests $300m into artificial intelligence.\n\nThe media executive said it would be \u201ctoo early for that to materialize into better momentum on this kind of competitive pitch. These things are always cyclical, but it's very clear that WPP is on a bit of a downtrend, and Publicis is very aggressive in the market at the moment.\u201d\n\nJay Pattisall, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, said if GroupM fails to convince Coca-Cola, it would \u201ccontribute to WPP\u2019s performance woes.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, said Pattisall, retaining The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s US media business would be further validation of WPP\u2019s AI investments, bespoke agency model and GroupM\u2019s centralized strategy to leverage AI.\n\nHe added: \u201cWPP has invested heavily in WPP Open, its AI-powered marketing operating system. Coca-Cola was one of its clients to benefit from the content development capabilities of WPP Open. Should GroupM retain [Coke\u2019s] media business in the US, Coca-Cola would benefit from creative and media synergies, as well as audience-first production. The connection between media and production is becoming more important for personalization.\u201d\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nThe media exec The Drum spoke to said it would go some way to boosting the confidence of clients across WPP, who are still unsure of what the future holds under this new GroupM-led proposition. \u201cThere is, even with some of the biggest clients of GroupM, a bit of uncertainty and unclarity around this all means for them.\u201d\n\nBut while a loss of this magnitude, at this critical time, would be a blow to WPP, it wouldn\u2019t be irrevocable, in the eyes of shareholders. Pattisall stressed: \u201cAgency holding companies are not \u2018meme stocks\u2019 that turn on headlines and sentiment. They are sophisticated portfolios of software, services, currency exchange rates, real estate and new business development.\u201d\n\nDespite news of the surprisingly discreet account review only coming to light this week, if the industry mood music is to be believed, it won\u2019t be long until we find out the answers.",

            "content": "by Danielle Oster , February 10, 2025\n\nCoca-Cola launched a nostalgia-stoking campaign for its newest flavor.\n\nThe company launched a \u201cWe All Scream\u201d campaign to introduce its new Coca-Cola Orange Cream and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Orange Cream to a wider audience as it rolls out across retailers in the U.S. and Canada. Coca-Cola previously announced the new flavor late last month, including on its social media channels.\n\nThe real marketing push for the new flavor kicked off this week, though. At the center of the campaign is an ad leaning into the flavor\u2019s associations with the classic ice cream bar. Running in 30-second and 15-second iterations, the spot opens on a giant can of the Orange Cream flavor fitted atop an ice cream truck, and the nostalgic sound of an ice cream truck jingle. A stampede of grown adults chases the truck down for a taste of the new flavor, which proves so popular the truck soon runs out. As a Coca-Cola truck pulls up with reinforcements, it concludes with the tagline, \u201cWe all scream for Orange Cream.\u201d\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe ad debuts today and will run nationally on linear and OTT TV, as well as online video and social media. It will be further supported digital and social media, radio advertising, OOH, experiential and sampling activations.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s new flavor arrives on the heels of rival Pepsi\u2019s Wild Cherry & Cream launch. It also follows Coca-Cola deciding last September to discontinueits Coca-Cola Spiced flavor after introducing it as a \u201cpermanent flavor\u201d early last year.\n\nThe company is not positioning the new Orange Cream flavor as a permanent addition to its roster. According to a brand spokesperson, it is \u201cplanned to be in-market until Q1 2026,\u201d with \u201cflexibility\u201d to evolve that timeline.",

Morgan Private Capital. Coca-Cola has already released a prebiotic soda called Simply Pop, and PepsiCo is planning to enter the market. The prebiotic soda market is growing, particularly among Generation Z, those born between 1997 and 2012.\n\n\u201cMarketplace\u201d host Kai Ryssdal spoke to Laura Cooper of The Wall Street Journal about the growing market for \u201cgut pop.\u201d Below is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nKai Ryssdal: Gut pop. What is this?\n\nLaura Cooper: You\u2019ve probably seen it in the supermarket, maybe walked by it, didn\u2019t know what it was. But they\u2019re prebiotic sodas, so like Olipop and Poppi. A lot of people know Poppi from their two Super Bowl commercials this year and last year, and yeah, Gen Z really enjoys it.\n\nRyssdal: Clearly I must have just spaced out during those Super Bowl commercials, because I have no memory of them. What are they supposed to do, this prebiotic thing, just to get the biology out of the way?\n\nCooper: I\u2019m not a doctor, but I spoke to a lot of dieticians and gastroenterologists about this. And so essentially, prebiotic versus probiotic: Probiotic, you might know \u2014 kombucha, yogurt, things of that nature. This soda is prebiotic because it contains dietary fibers that feed bacteria already living in your system, and probiotic puts more microbes into your system. This is feeding what\u2019s already inside your body. And when you think about prebiotic soda and any perceived health benefits you could get from that digestive health, people are all in on trying it. So, you know, as opposed to maybe having just a regular Coca-Cola or a Pepsi, people are, they\u2019re still having those, just not as often.\n\nRyssdal: These things are going to cost me two and a half bucks a piece \u2014 did I read that right?\n\nCooper: It really depends where you\u2019re buying them. But yeah, soda has similar pricing, depending on what you\u2019re buying. There\u2019s actually something at Walmart called \u201cmodern soda,\u201d and this falls under that, an aisle where all these drinks live together.\n\nRyssdal: Coke and Pepsi clearly see this, and they say, \u201cWe got to get in on this.\u201d\n\nCooper: Oh, 100%. I mean, Coca-Cola already put out their first prebiotic soda called Simply Pop. I tried the strawberry at a conference. Very strawberry. It has a lot of juice in it. It also has just things that are different from Olipop and Poppi. I believe it\u2019s Vitamin C for one, and Zinc. So PepsiCo, I believe plans to enter this space as well. It is definitely, you know, it\u2019s picking up steam with Gen Z. And as you know, Gen Z is a share of the market everyone wants to get a piece of.\n\nRyssdal: Hey, do you drink these things on the regular?\n\nCooper: I drink soda. I have drank these. I just don\u2019t drink a ton of them, but I\u2019ve tried them all, especially in reporting this, I drank a lot of them and have spoken to a lot of people who are just huge fiends of this.\n\nRyssdal: A word about the magnitude here. You point out that the co-founder and CEO of Olipop announced a valuation with a new round of investment, puts that company at like, $1.8 billion, which is, I mean, that\u2019s not peanuts.\n\nCooper: Last month they raised money, I believe it was raised with J.P. Morgan in the lead. So, you know, this is a big business. Is it, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-sized business? Unclear. But Coca-Cola already put out their first prebiotic soda, called Simply Pop, and PepsiCo, I believe, plans to enter this space as well. It\u2019s definitely picking up steam and getting a following. And I think that all the big guys are aware that they want to be involved with this. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dr Pepper was also interested.",

As the company reaches this impressive milestone, we look at how it\u2019s built up its power stable; what categories the most exciting brands are in; and how the company spots a potential winner and powers it to global success...\n\n\u2018It all started with one...\u2019\n\nThe company dates back to 1886 in downtown Atlanta, where the first glass of Coca-Cola was poured.\n\nToday, more than 2.2 billion servings of The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s drinks are enjoyed every day in more than 200 countries and territories across the world.\n\nIt all started with Coca-Cola: the company\u2019s original billion dollar brand.\n\nBut the company is constantly shifting and transforming its portfolio: not only continuing to successfully produce and market its classic sodas, but also looking at newer options such as ice tea, bottled water, fruit juice and even vitamin fortified drinks.\n\nNow, its billion-dollar brands include Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Topo Chico, Minute Maid, Smartwater, Bodyarmor, Fuze Tea and Fairlife.\n\nBut here\u2019s a surprising fact. Out of Coca-Cola\u2019s current 30 billion-dollar brands, only three were acquired as ready-made billion dollar makers. A further 12 brands were acquired as smaller propositions, which Coca-Cola then built up to billion-dollar status.\n\nBut half of Coca-Cola\u2019s billion dollar brands have been developed in-house.\n\n\u201cI think [this] is super important to pay attention to, because [in] that portfolio of 30 billion dollar brands since the creation of Coca-Cola, we have created 15 billion dollar brands organically ourselves from inception to the $1 billion of retail revenues, all being done organically from within The Coca-Cola Company,\u201d said James Quincey, CEO, speaking at CAGNY recently.\n\n\u201cOf the ones that we have created through an M&A platform, 12 were bought very small and turned into billion dollar brands and only three were bought as they are, as billion dollar brands.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that talks to the fact that the system has an incredible way of being able to both leverage consumer insights organically and to execute on what is largely a bolt-on M&A strategy that delivers value through scaling around the world.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola's billion dollar brands Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Diet Coke, Powerade, Minute Maid, Dasani, Aquarius, Ayataka, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Vitaminwater, Georgia, Simply Beverages, Del Valle, Minute Maid, Pulpy, I Lohas, Schweppes, Gold Peak, Fuze Tea, Smartwater, Ciel, Costa Coffee, Topo Chico, Bodyarmor, Thums Up, Fairlife, Fresca, Core power, Maaza, Crystal\n\nWhat Coca-Cola does and doesn\u2019t do to grow its brands\n\nOf course, Coca-Cola\u2019s might and muscle gives it a head start in brand building.\n\nBut the first myth to get out of the way is the idea that a sprinkling of Coca-Cola magic equals instant success for any brand it decides to put its might behind.\n\nIn fact, Coca-Cola\u2019s biggest brands have been built up over decades.\n\n\u201cThat massive portfolio of 30 billion dollar brands was, of course, not an overnight success,\u201d said Quincey. \u201cThe slightly ironic part of calling this industry the fast-moving consumer goods industry is, of course, it may rotate quickly on the shelf from where it gets its name, but the structure of the industry actually does not change quickly. The creation of beverage brands is an incredibly long run process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving Sprite and Fanta for many, many, many, many years since their inception, and yet now they\u2019ve achieved some absolute scale. If you were to take Sprite and Fanta together, they would be the fourth largest NARTD company. And among the top 10 brands in CPG. And yet we\u2019re still getting started.\n\n\u201cIf you compare the market share of our flavor brands to the market share of Coca-Cola within the cola category, of course there is still a long way to go. So even though they\u2019ve been around for many, many decades, they still have a huge opportunity ahead of them in the flavor category.\n\n\u201cFor example, Simply has become the number one juice brand in the US at the end of last year, but that has been several decades in the making.\u201d\n\nAnother stills category that doesn\u2019t always get a lot of attention - but where Coca-Cola is steadily building up - is ready-to-drink tea.\n\n\u201cReady-to-drink tea was actually the fastest growing category in the industry and Fuze Tea was growing at three times the industry,\u201d said Quincey. \u201cSo not only have we seen the investments behind some of these stills categories start to drive considerable growth, but we have been able to grow much more rapidly than the category.\u201d\n\nAnother success story that has been built up over the last decade is ultra-filtered milk Fairlife. The brand was launched in 2012 via a partnership between Select Milk and The Coca-Cola Company, launching onto shelves in 2014. Coca-Cola then took full ownership of the company in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the retail value of Fairlife was $10 million,\u201d said Quincey. \u201cLast year it was nearly $4 billion. And of course, it\u2019s a compounding business. It still looks small five years into that journey. But eventually, if you\u2019ve got the consumer proposition exactly right, that compounding will turn into a huge and profitable business, which is Fairlife.\u201d\n\nThe last decade: the shift to a total beverage company\n\nCoca-Cola is the top consumer brand in the world. And the brand saw an incredible $60bn in retail value growth from 2014-2024.\n\nBut Fairlife\u2019s growth in this time period also illustrates how the company is shifting its focus to a \u2018total beverage company\u2019 - one with many different beverages for all occasions.\n\nWith brands such as Dasani, Ciel, Smartwater and Topo Chico, it\u2019s the top global player in bottled water.\n\nPowerade, Bodyarmor and Aquarius make it the top international sports drinks player.\n\nAlso read \u2192\n\nIt\u2019s also the top global player in juice: with brands such as Simply, Maaza, Minute Maid and Del Valle.\n\nAnd up-and-coming categories include iced team (5% category volume growth in 2024) and milk drinks Fairlife and Core Power.\n\nOnce these power brands have been established, this then gives Coca-Cola the opportunity to use their might and scale to launch into new, trending categories with a bang. Take, for example, last month\u2019s launch of its first-ever prebiotic soda - which hopes to take a significant slice of the booming gut health category - which has been launched under the billion dollar Simply brand.\n\nSimply Pop: Coca-Cola's big splash in gut health soda (The Coca-Cola Company)\n\nKilling the zombies\n\nAnother myth is that everything Coca-Cola touches is a success.\n\nBut Quincey points to the company\u2019s COVID strategy: where it slashed the number of brands from more than 400 to 200, deciding to focus its efforts on its strongest brands.\n\nDubbed by Quincey as the company\u2019s \u2018zombies\u2019, these culled brands were ones that - despite the company\u2019s best intentions and efforts - simply hadn\u2019t taken off over a three-year period. And these brands had instead distracted attention and resources away from other brands with real potential.\n\n\u201cWe really found that focus on reduction has allowed us to get more clarity and really drive the quality leadership of those brands and their positionings,\u201d reflected Quincey at CAGNY this month. \u201cThe discipline around the innovation has made a huge difference, driving up success rates a lot over the last five years.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Quincey credits disciplined innovation with a success rate today of 3x that of 2019.\n\nSuccesses and failures Despite its brand-building success: some innovations just haven\u2019t worked out for Coca-Cola: think Coca-Cola Life , Coca-Cola Spiced or Zico Coconut Water.\n\nStudio X\n\nAnother arrow in Coca-Cola\u2019s bow is its efficient and effective marketing: one that\u2019s shifted towards digital. Its 9 operating units are connected through \u2018Studio X\u2019, a bespoke agency network.\n\nThat\u2019s helped make marketing faster from idea inception to execution, made marketing more effective and efficient, and helped Coca-Cola unlock the opportunities which come with its scale.\n\n\u201cOur ecosystem is not just an incredible physical system - the factories and the trucks and the sheer reach across all those consumers - but it has an incredible ability to lift and shift the best ideas,\u201d said Quincey. \u201cAnd so, the creation of the nine operating units and the Studio X has increased our ability to lift and shift ideas to go from siloed ideas that worked in certain places, but to really take them around the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put up some of those programs and ideas here that we\u2019ve moved around, whether it be things like the universal returnable glass bottle, which started in Brazil and has moved around to Europe, Asia Pacific, some of the digital experiences that our bottlers have been doing around order taking and digital platforms have moved much more quickly around our system than they ever used to do. And so, the combination of the refranchize system with the capabilities and the Studio X platforms, is helping ideas move around our system much more quickly.\u201d",

On January 23, the company announced that the drink machines at the food courts are switching from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola. The news got strong reactions from both Pepsi and Coke fans, but there's been no word on when the change is happening...until now.\n\nKathleen Sheffer\n\nWith the opening of a new Costco location in Brentwood, California, the launch is officially underway. And Coke fans have been excited to see images of the new partnership swirling around social media. But, before you head to your local warehouse to get an ice-cold Coke, you need to know that the nationwide launch is still a few months away.\n\nAccording to a Coca-Cola spokesperson, the change \"will begin rolling out across all Costco warehouses in July.\" That means shoppers still have a few months of Pepsi products before the change takes place, but all locations in 14 countries will be impacted.\n\nKathleen Sheffer\n\nA Coca-Cola executive spoke out on the change. Pamela Stewart, Chief Customer Officer \u2013 Retail, North America Operating Unit, The Coca-Cola Company, told Country Living, \"Nothing beats the perfect pairing of a hot dog and an ice-cold Coca-Cola, and now, Costco members in Brentwood are the first to enjoy the return of Coca-Cola beverages to the food court\u2014a change we know will delight fans of both brands. Coca-Cola and Costco share a passion for delivering quality, value and great taste. We\u2019re thrilled to refresh Costco members once again and look forward to bringing Coca-Cola back to food courts nationwide in the coming months.\"\n\nIf you're a Coke fan, you've got something to look forward to this summer. For Pepsi drinkers, take advantage of your remaining trips to the food court before the change takes place.",

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.76%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.18%.\n\nThe world's largest beverage maker's shares have seen an increase of 10.69% over the last month, surpassing the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 7% and the S&P 500's loss of 7.29%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Coca-Cola will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.72 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $11.15 billion, indicating a 1.28% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.96 per share and a revenue of $47.98 billion, signifying shifts of +2.78% and +1.94%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.49% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Coca-Cola presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Coca-Cola is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 24.16. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.68.\n\nInvestors should also note that KO has a PEG ratio of 3.86 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Beverages - Soft drinks industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.51.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nTariffs, tariff delays and retaliatory tariffs have resulted in a never-ending drumbeat of news during the past few months, leaving food and beverage companies struggling to keep up.\n\nA 20% tax on goods from China went into effect on March 4. President Donald Trump implemented 25% tariffs on some items from Canada and Mexico earlier this month while delaying taxes on certain goods from those countries through April 2. The U.S. is also set to raise duties on steel and aluminum on March 12 and implement \u201creciprocal tariffs\" on April 2 on countries around the world.\n\nWhile the tariffs are set to raise some costs for food and beverage manufacturers, a majority say the impact won't be detrimental to their bottom line. For the most part, companies aren't planning major price increases in response to tariffs, especially as persistent inflation dampens consumer spending.\n\nInstead, the bigger issue could arise from countries' retaliatory responses to Trump, which has already resulted in boycotts of U.S. products. Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman, said earlier this month that removing U.S. products from shelves is \u201cworse than a tariff.\u201d\n\nStill, duties could present a more pressing challenge for those businesses with more exposure to the agriculture sector. Canada suspended imports from a Smithfield pork processing plant, while top agricultural buyer China implemented a 15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products including beef, pork and soybeans.\n\nHere's a look at what CEOs from some of the largest food and beverage companies are saying about the unfolding tariff situation.\n\nThe Campbell's Company says tariffs could hit soup\n\nCEO Mick Beekhuizen warned tariffs could raise packaging costs and have a negative impact on its namesake soup brand.\n\nCampbell's imports steel for its cans and canola oil for its chips from Canada. The company also produces its soups in the U.S. and ships them to Canada, leaving the New Jersey company vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs.\n\nBeekhuizen said the company is working with suppliers to mitigate the potential impact. Campbell's could raise prices on its products depending on the extent of tariffs and how long they're in place.\n\n\u201cNow that being said, I'm obviously going to be very focused to make sure that we provide a good value to our consumers,\" he said.\n\nJack Daniel\u2019s owner Brown-Forman warns boycotts more harmful than tariffs\n\nCanadian boycotts over U.S. tariffs may be worse than the tariffs themselves, the CEO of Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman told analysts earlier this month.\n\nRetailers across Canada have taken U.S. products off the shelves in a move that is taking \u201csales away completely,\u201d according to Chief Executive Lawson Whiting. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario \u2014 one of the biggest importers of American alcohol to Canada \u2014 also ceased the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nBrown-Forman is preparing for tariff fallout in Europe if duties go into place in April. Potential backlash against American whiskey or other U.S.-affiliated products could limit the market for brands like Jack Daniel's.\n\n\u201cIf it rolls out where they're coming after American whiskey again \u2026 then the market for spirits once again gets very distorted,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cThat is a big disadvantage for us.\u201d\n\nWhiting added that the alcohol producer is \u201cgoing to try to continue to believe and hope that American whiskey is not involved in this big dispute.\u201d\n\nGeneral Mills says tariffs \u2018aren\u2019t really meaningful\u2019\n\nCEO Jeffrey Harmening told analysts at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York gathering that tariffs \u201caren't really meaningful\u201d for General Mills because the Cheerios and Nature Valley bar maker sources 95% of its products in the U.S.\n\nHowever, Harmening called out the potential for higher costs on Canadian goods, including oats used in the company's cereals and snack bars. Tariffs on tinplate steel could also impact packaging for soup, wet pet food or Yoplait lids.\n\nCoca-Cola could switch to more plastic bottles\n\nCEO James Quincey said on an earnings call in February that while tariffs will increase the costs of Coca-Cola soda cans,\u201dwe are in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system.\u201d\n\nCost increases from tariffs are \u201cnot insignificant,\u201d Quincey said, but he added that \u201cit is not going to radically change a multi-billion dollar U.S. business\u201d\"\n\nCoke could take a variety of steps in response to steel and aluminum tariffs. Quincey said this could include changes in sourcing and weight of cans. The beverage giant could also implement price increases and potentially switch to more plastic bottles.\n\nQuincey called tariffs a \u201cmanageable problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a cost. It will have to be managed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be better not to have it relative to the U.S. business, but we are going to manage our way through.\u201d\n\nMondel\u0113z International predicts higher cookie, cracker costs\n\nCEO Dirk Van de Put told Food Dive in an interview last month that tariffs \u201cwill have an effect\u201d on its finances since it produces some cookies and crackers for the U.S. in Canada and Mexico.\n\nAt the time, he said Mondel\u0113z was looking at possibilities to offset the higher costs. It could increase prices in the U.S., but with inflation already causing consumers to cut back on purchases, it\u2019s unlikely to be a major tool.\n\nInstead, Van de Put said Mondel\u0113z would likely boost promotions and marketing for some of its brands like Oreo, Ritz and Chips Ahoy!, with higher volumes offsetting the elevated costs incurred by the snacking giant.\n\nTyson Foods prepares for retaliatory tariffs\n\nFor meat companies and other agricultural firms, one of the biggest risks of a prolonged trade war is retaliatory tariffs against U.S. products.\n\nExports make up a substantial part of their businesses, with Tyson sending 10% of every hog it processes to Mexico. CEO Donnie King told analysts on an earnings call in February that tariffs from Mexico and Canada would force the country to find new markets.\n\nTyson is assembling contingency plans for its pork business and in chicken, where it sends legs and other parts to Mexico. The company sends very little chicken to Canada, though it does import feeder cattle and hogs into the U.S. from its northern neighbor.\n\n\u201cEssentially what we would do, whether it be pork or whether it would be chicken, is we would find other markets,\u201d King said. \u201cWe would leverage our global knowledge and expertise to try to move those products if necessary.\u201d",

But the beverage giant\u2019s early moves actually pre-date the launch of ChatGPT, giving the company a strong base from which to experiment.\n\nThe results of those experiments, at least in the marketing media bubble, have been mixed, from the successes of its \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d platform to the contentious response to last year\u2019s Christmas campaign. During it all, Pratik Thakar has been leading the way as the global vice president and head of generative AI for The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nThe following Q&A draws from a larger conversation that occurred during a virtual event hosted by Marketing Dive and has been edited for clarity and brevity. You can register here to watch a replay of the full event.\n\nMARKETING DIVE: Coca-Cola was an early mover and has been a leader in the generative AI space the last few years. Where did that journey start?\n\nPRATIK THAKAR: Pre-GPT launch, pre-hype cycle of generative AI, we actually started working with gen AI and we were working on a campaign called \u201cMasterpiece.\u201d That's where we connected with [text-to-video AI model] Stability AI in London, the makers of Stable Diffusion. That\u2019s when we understood the importance and the utility of gen AI. One of the things was the perfection we were getting, especially when you are working on a very specific project with specific timelines.\n\nThat\u2019s when we started our gen AI creative incubator, in late \u201822, and that's when GPT got launched and the whole hype cycle started. Bain is our consulting partner, and they came up with this proposal of collaborating with OpenAI, and we were the first one to raise our hand and said, \u201cYes, we want to be part of it.\u201d\n\nWe announced that partnership two years ago, and everyone was so skeptical about AI, gen AI, OpenAI. It was with a relatively unknown company [but] we believed in that technology and we knew that it was going to be big. We put together a team of six people \u2014 including legal, public affairs and communications and tech people \u2014 and we created a sandbox.\n\nWe brought DALL-E, their image creation tool, and GPT together, and we launched \u201cCreate Real Magic.\u201d It worked out very well.\n\nHow has that team grown and where does it live within the Coca-Cola organization?\n\nThere is no specific department of AI. Globally, we have a team of two: One is myself and another is a colleague looking after internal governance within the company. I focus on more consumer-facing ideas and experience development.\n\nOther team members are all living in different geographies. They're part of different units and different functions, but they are early adopters and enthusiasts that wanted to be part of this. They have specific projects which I'm leading, so they work with me very closely. They give their 50% to 40% of time every day, and they have a commitment for long-term project involvement.\n\nIt builds their career, their capability, their skill set, and at the same time, it also builds the company\u2019s ecosystem and capability overall, rather than creating a separate unit. The ideal scenario for everyone is basically that we don't need a person like me. Everything will be gen AI, like the way we use the internet and we use mobile; we don't really need the director or VP of internet and mobile nowadays.\n\nHow are you balancing the needs of both consuming-facing and internal uses with generative AI?\n\nSo let me give you an example. Gen AI is already distributed, it's democratized. Everyone has access to it, and people can come up with ideas. We have created an internal mechanism where everyone who wants to use gen AI fills out a very simple form and our small team looks at it and maybe we say, \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect use of AI\u201d \u2014 maybe just not that particular tool. We can recommend something else which is legally inline with the company's guideline prospective. Also, if we have done something similar, then they don't need to reinvent the wheel: They can learn from that or learn from some of the partnerships I'm doing.\n\nAnother part of my role, apart from creating experiences, is also reaching out to other AI innovators and tapping into their alpha and beta model products so we have early access to their products before anyone else and so we understand what innovation is coming in. We start building our products and our consumer-facing experiences with them while it's a hidden secret for the rest of the world. When they launch, we are ready with our products.\n\nCan you walk us through a campaign that utilized generative AI?\n\nCoca-Cola and Christmas was a global activation. It\u2019s very ingrained with the Coca-Cola brand. We wanted to scale our journey and stress test all the things we and our partners can do.\n\nWe looked through two different lenses. One, we took one of our 1990s commercials, \u201cHolidays are Coming,\u201d and we recreated that using gen AI. That film required a lot of super realistic but fantastical imagery and storytelling, and that's what gen AI does very well. We ended up creating three versions of that film, and we put it out in front of consumers. All three of them worked very well with consumers.\n\nWe also created this platform called \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d and we took our Santa from 1931 and put together a video about how you can converse with Santa. The insight was that everyone has shaken hands with Santa, taken a picture with Santa or gotten a gift from Santa, but no one had that opportunity or time to sit down with Santa and have a conversation and ask questions.\n\nWe worked with OpenAI, Microsoft Azure and Mimic and we created a 3D digital twin of our historic 1931 Santa and then put a conversational AI into that with OpenAI's help. You can actually talk to Santa in 26 different languages across the world. It's a real time, unique conversation, and then, based on your conversation, it will create a snow globe for you for social media. That kind of stuff, which only gen AI can do, is very true to the Coca-Cola brand. We feel that's where the technology does justice to our ambition.\n\nThe TV commercial drew a lot of attention and became a lightning rod for some of the controversy over the use of gen AI. How are people getting gen AI wrong, and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nFirst, it's not like you input one prompt saying \u201ccreate an ad\u201d and it pops out an ad. A lot of creative decisions are all made by humans. We worked with three different studios, one in L.A., one in San Francisco and one in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. All three studios have creative technologists. They are engineers, early adopters and storytellers, and we gave them as a brief our 1990s film because we knew that we had rights to use that as the prompt. That film was shot in Europe, in one village. I needed to take it to the next level. Gen AI opens up possibilities: you can show different parts of the world, it becomes international.\n\nWe also used multiple tools, and we had certain dos and don'ts in terms of what tools to use where we have our partnerships. We have a legal understanding of how those tools are built. We had our own guideline and we told our team to use those tools. There was also the music; we composed that with humans.\n\nOnce we had all three films ready, we researched it extensively with consumers in North America, Europe and Latin America, with at least three different research agencies and different sets of consumers, and it worked very well. It was not just an average success rate in terms of its acceptability, understanding and entertainment value, but it passed our own and competitions\u2019 Christmas ad benchmarks.\n\nThen, in North America, our team deployed with programmatic media. We had selected 12 different locations, and that's where you can solve content with geotagging. It's hyper personalization and a way of distributing content to different regions.\n\nSome consumers loved it, a lot of people didn't like it. They had a different perspective. Journalists reached out to ask for our side of the story. Three or four different research agencies, independently, without even checking with us, they conducted studies and they published those results. Maybe some sectors of people didn\u2019t like it. That's okay. We need to respect everyone's point of view. Not everyone will agree with everything we do; that's nature.",

While it's certainly been a forgettable period, several stocks, including Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Johnson & Johnson, have remained strong over the past month.\n\nAll three reflect defensive deployments, with their products able to carry steady demand through many economic backdrops. Let's take a closer look at each for those interested in adding in an additional layer of defense.\n\nCoca-Cola Gains Market Share\n\nConcerning headline figures in KO's latest release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily, reflecting growth rates of 12% and 6%, respectively. Notably, the company's gross margin has remained constructive over recent periods, recovering nicely from early 2023 lows.\n\nNotably, Coca-Cola gained market share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in North America, with its overall price/mix also increasing by an impressive 11% throughout its FY24. The stock also reflects a prime selection for those with an appetite for income, with KO holding the elite Dividend King title.\n\nConsistent cash flows have aided the shareholder-friendly nature, with KO sporting a 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nPM Innovation Paints Bright Outlook\n\nPhilip Morris shares have benefited nicely from its latest set of better-than-expected results, with EPS growing 14% alongside a strong 7% move higher in sales. Demand has remained strong for the tobacco titan, with product innovations remaining key for its future.\n\nPM's top line continues to grow at a solid pace, posting YoY growth rates of at least 5% over its last seven periods.\n\nNotably, smoke-free products exceeded 40 billion units for the first time throughout its FY24, with full-year net revenues for its Smoke-free Business (SFB) increasing by 14.2% alongside an 18.7% move higher in gross profit.\n\nShares also provide a high level of passive income, currently yielding a market-beating 3.5% annually. Dividend growth has been rock-solid, with PM also holding the ranks of a Dividend King.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company's FY25 EPS outlook has remained constructive, with PM expected to see 8.9% year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nJNJ Shares Ready to Breakout\n\nJNJ shares have traded primarily sideways over the past three years, up a modest 5% compared to the S&P 500's 46% gain. While the performance has undoubtedly been 'boring', the stability of the stock is a stronger takeaway here.",

            "content": "It's a clash between the world's largest beverage company and an emerging competitor.\n\nIn one corner, Coca-Cola (KO -0.49%) has a long history of rewarding shareholders with steady growth and rising profitability, propelling the stock to a 16% return over the past year.\n\nOn the other side, shares of the once high-flying Celsius (CELH -3.96%) have lost their fizz amid a string of lackluster quarterly earnings. A reset in company expectations has driven the stock down a staggering 74% from its 52-week high.\n\nShould investors stick with the proven industry leader, or can the energy drink phenomenon regain its pop? Let's discuss whether Coca-Cola or Celsius is the better stock to buy now.\n\nThe case for Coca-Cola\n\nThe allure of Coca-Cola as an investment stems from its iconic and globally recognized brand. From its traditional focus on soft drinks, Coca-Cola today is more diversified than ever, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands across categories like sports drinks, flavored water, juices, and dairy products. That ability to innovate with new concepts to adapt to changing consumer tastes is a big part of the company's continued success. Beyond the economy's ebb and flow, there's a good chance this company will be around for the next 100 years.\n\nFor the full year ended Dec. 31, 2024, organic revenue climbed by 12% from 2023, through higher unit volumes and pricing initiatives. Notably, the company even gained market share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry last year, with developing and emerging markets also representing important growth drivers.\n\nIts increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) on a currency-neutral basis was even stronger, up 17% year over year, reflecting a premiumization of its sales mix that has helped lift margins. For 2025, Coca-Cola expects another banner year, targeting organic revenue growth between 5% and 6% alongside an 8% to 10% EPS increase.\n\nInvestors are confident in the company's ability to execute its growth strategy and consolidate global market share, and they have plenty of reasons to buy and hold Coca-Cola for the long run.\n\nThe case for Celsius\n\nCelsius has capitalized on consumers seeking healthier beverage options, with its fitness-focused sugar-free energy drinks proving highly popular as sales climbed 319% between 2021 and 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, 2024 marked a setback in the company's trajectory, with annual revenue of $1.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, up just 3%. Management cited an inventory glut at its main distributor, PepsiCo, which impacted the timing of large orders, to explain the slowdown leading to 2024 EPS of $0.70, down 10% from 2023.\n\nDespite the disappointing 2024, Celsius maintains overall solid fundamentals with its trends at the retail level, suggesting its product portfolio continues to resonate with consumers.\n\nPerhaps the company's biggest development is its recently announced acquisition of Alani Nu, a fast-growing specialty energy drink brand targeted toward women. Celsius believes the combined company will unlock significant synergies and strengthen its position in functional energy drinks.\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, Celsius is projected to post EPS of $0.96 this year, marking a 37% rebound compared to 2024, as total revenue surges by more than 30%. Those figures are particularly compelling, considering that the stock is trading at a forward P/E of 27, down from as high as 130 last year. While Celsius still commands a modest premium to Coca-Cola and its forward P/E of 24, the spread could be justified given Celsius' more robust outlook for 2025.\n\nBy this measure, the best reason to buy Celsius stock may hinge on viewing 2024's weakness as temporary, with a strong recovery on the horizon.\n\nDecision time: I'll take a sip of Celsius\n\nChoosing between Coca-Cola and Celsius is a tough call, as I'm bullish on both stocks. Coca-Cola defines the classic blue chip investment with its 3% dividend yield, while Celsius may have more growth potential as it expands internationally.\n\nIf forced to choose just one stock to buy now, I'd favor Celsius with the prediction that it will outperform in 2025 as its turnaround strategy gains traction. Investors comfortable navigating the ups and downs of the market could consider a small position in Celsius within a diversified portfolio.",

It's the first sparkling-beverage brand in the U.S. to take this step.\n\nThrough the initiative, Coca-Cola expects to save 80 million pounds of new plastic use \u2014 or the equivalent of roughly 2 billion bottles.\n\nAll this said, plastic can generally only be recycled one or two times before it becomes too weak, and Coca-Cola is the largest producer of branded plastic waste in the world. Glass bottles and aluminum cans are still far more environmentally friendly than recycled plastic bottles.\n\nThe new 20-ounce bottles were initially launched in 2021 across California, New York, and Texas. Dasani, the water brand owned by Coca-Cola, has had 100% recycled bottles since 2022 in its 20-ounce, 1-liter, and 1.5-liter sizes.\n\n\"By properly recycling bottles and cans, we can help sustain a circular economy where we can source more recycled material to use in future packaging,\" the company says.\n\nCoca-Cola touts this as being a key part of its \"World Without Waste\" strategy. But as is the case with many large companies, the reality of Coca-Cola's carbon footprint doesn't always align with what it says publicly.\n\nThe soft-drink behemoth previously announced that it would make one-quarter of its packaging reusable by 2030, but it appears to have quietly pulled that pledge. Meanwhile, a 2024 French study found that opening a plastic drink bottle, such as a liter bottle of Coca-Cola, can leach microplastic particles into your drink.\n\nThe company also came under fire for its 2024 Christmas television ad, which was made using artificial intelligence. AI is remarkably energy-intensive \u2014 generating 1,000 images emits the same amount of carbon dioxide as driving more than four miles in a gas-powered car.\n\nOn the other hand, one of Coca-Cola's bottling plants in India and a production facility in the United Arab Emirates are both getting major solar-energy upgrades.\n\nIf you have a tough time following which companies are taking the right steps with their environmental practices, you're not alone. That's why we put together this guide, showing eco-friendly initiatives by large brands.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n",

In a key example coming out of Mexico, HipLatina has reported that in the drought-stricken state of Chiapas, a Coca-Cola bottling plant is extracting over 300,000 gallons of water per day, while residents go without.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Chiapas is Mexico's wettest region. It produces 30% of the country's fresh water supply with plentiful rainfall.\n\nFor the last few years, however, Chiapas has been experiencing severe drought. Only about a third of the local residents have access to drinking water in their homes, and residents \u2014 mostly women and girls \u2014 might spend hours a day walking to carry water for their families.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite these conditions, the Coca-Cola plant \u2014 which sits beside the Huitepec volcano basin \u2014 is first in line for water from that source. The plant uses it to produce soft drinks and food, thereby ultimately shipping the precious water out of the community.\n\nThe lack of water access and the chokehold Coca-Cola has on the region are so severe that residents drink more Coke than water. It comes to about 2.2 liters per day, according to El Heraldo de Chiapas, making the state, by some estimations, Earth's biggest Coke consumer per capita.\n\nWhy is Coca-Cola's water usage important?\n\nResidents in Chiapas are consuming huge amounts of sugar daily, with expected impacts on their health. Diabetes mortality rose by 30% between 2013 and 2016, for example.\n\nMeanwhile, residents lack access to water, something that is considered a basic necessity for human life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's sad. We can't bathe. We can't drink. We can't clean water,\" resident Silvia Perez Mendez told CBS This Morning in 2021.\n\nShould the government be allowed to restrict how much water we use? Definitely Only during major droughts No way I'm not sure Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nContinuing to drain water in the midst of a drought could not only harm the population but also the surrounding tropical environment. And it could have devastating effects for anyone who relies on the local plants and animals for a living.\n\nMeanwhile, Coca-Cola is barely even paying for the privilege of hoarding the water of Chiapas, HipLatina reported.\n\nWhat's being done about water shortages?\n\nWhile Coca-Cola says it \"seeks to return\" the water it uses in \"high-risk\" locations, residents have not seen a difference.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut activists and nonprofits like the We Are Water Foundation, Agua y Vida, and C\u00e1ntaro Azul are protesting and lobbying to change the way their country handles water rights. C\u00e1ntaro Azul's \"Plan de Justicia H\u00eddrica para Chiapas,\" published this year, calls for a sustainable water system and protection of water as a human right.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Coca-Cola Consolidated ( ). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola Consolidated with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nHow Fast Is Coca-Cola Consolidated Growing?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Coca-Cola Consolidated's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 53%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Coca-Cola Consolidated maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 3.7% to US$6.9b. That's a real positive.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nWhile it's always good to see growing profits, you should always remember that a weak balance sheet could come back to bite. So check Coca-Cola Consolidated's , before getting too excited.\n\nAre Coca-Cola Consolidated Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$12b company like Coca-Cola Consolidated. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$2.2b. That equates to 19% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.\n\nShould You Add Coca-Cola Consolidated To Your Watchlist?\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Coca-Cola Consolidated for a spot on your watchlist.

Said activation is done in partnership with WPP Open X, led by Ogilvy Singapore.\n\nRiddled with easter eggs only OG \u2018bunnies\u2019 of the K-Pop ensemble will spot, the \u2018So Fresh So Clean\u2019 laundromat is a pop-up experience where you can upcycle your old jeans into brand new NewJeans with exclusive RFID patches that unlock personalised messages from NewJeans.\n\nIn order to participate in the activation, fans must bring their old jeans to the Metropolitan Dobi Express in Kuala Lumpur. From there, fans can get limited-edition Coke x NewJeans patches by showing up with six Coca-Cola bottle caps or they can buy six bottles on-site. Fans are also encouraged to snap a picture in the funky photo booth to flex their refreshed style.\n\nMoreover, the activation also brings NewJeans virtually to the laundromat. Fans can engage with the interactive videos on-site. Furthermore, RFID Patches allow fans to scan the patches using an NFC-compatible device to unlock exclusive NewJeans videos, offering a new and refreshing way to engage with the band.\n\nNikhil Panjwani, regional ECD at Ogilvy Singapore, sums it up, \u201cThis campaign from Coke lives at the intersection of fandom, Y2K fashion, collectible tech and a good ol\u2019 pun. Who knew doing laundry could be so uplifting?\u201d\n\nNewJeans are no stranger to collaborations with Coca-Cola. In April 2023, they released the single \u2018Zero\u2019 as part of the soft drink\u2019s campaign in South Korea for the Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.

            "content": "It is virtually impossible not to look at Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) if you are considering buying PepsiCo (PEP 0.45%) and vice versa. The two companies are iconic and globally dominant beverage giants. The price charts of the two stocks, however, look very different today. If you are a long-term dividend investor, PepsiCo looks like it is the most attractive after Coca-Cola's recent rally. Here's why.\n\nWhat do Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do?\n\nCoca-Cola makes a wide range of beverages. Basically, that's all it does. The company does this very well, with a massive global distribution network, research and development acumen, and marketing skills that place it in the pantheon of the consumer staples sector. It also has the scale to act as an industry consolidator, buying up companies with attractive products and growing them by simply plugging the new products into Coca-Cola's distribution system. It is a one-trick pony, but it is a very good trick.\n\nPepsiCo makes a wide range of beverages. It also makes a wide range of snacks and packaged food products. It has a massive global distribution network, a strong research and development department, and a marketing team every bit as good as Coca-Cola's. As for scale, PepsiCo has a long history of buying smaller brands and expanding them, just like Coca-Cola. PepsiCo's most recent endeavor on this front is Mexican American food maker Siete, which offers both snacks and packaged food items.\n\nPepsiCo may not be as dominant a beverage company as Coca-Cola; Pepsi-Cola has dropped to third in the cola wars. However, it is the No. 1 snack brand and a very solid No. 2 in the broader beverage space. In packaged food, it holds its own against larger peers. In other words, it is a well-run and diversified food company. Investors who like diversified businesses will probably prefer PepsiCo based on this fact alone.\n\nThat said, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are Dividend Kings, which speaks to the strength of their underlying businesses. Coca-Cola's dividend streak is a little longer, but a company simply can't increase its dividend for 50+ years without having a good business plan that gets executed well year in and year out. These two consumer staples companies stand toe-to-toe as businesses, with the exception of diversification.\n\nCoca-Cola is doing better right now\n\nThat said, every company that exists for long enough will go through both good periods and bad periods. Right now, PepsiCo is facing some business weakness while Coca-Cola is executing better. Investors are aware of the dichotomy and buy and sell accordingly. If you look at the chart below, it almost seems like the two companies switched places. But short-term business gyrations aren't what long-term investors should be worried about. The bigger question is whether or not the company, be it Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, is still well run.\n\nThe answer is that both of these consumer staples giants remain well run, but Coca-Cola is just doing a little better right now. The problem with PepsiCo is really a relative one since it was able to push through large price hikes when inflation took hold following the coronavirus pandemic. That boost is now over and it \"only\" grew organic sales 2% and core earnings 9% in 2024. It is calling for similar performance in 2025, with low-single-digit sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth. That's actually not bad in the consumer staples sector, which is known for being a slow and steady performer.\n\nBased on that news, however, investors have punished the stock, which is down around 20% from its peak in 2023. The drop has pushed PepsiCo's yield up toward the highest levels in the company's history. And its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are below their five-year averages. This is a well-run company that looks like it has been placed on the sale rack.\n\nBy comparison, Coca-Cola's stock has rallied in recent months. Its dividend yield is nowhere near the historical highs for the stock. And the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are now both above their five-year averages. Prior to the rally, Coca-Cola was more compellingly priced, but now it looks a little expensive. That makes PepsiCo look all the more attractive, given their direct competition in the beverage sector.\n\nThink long term and buy PepsiCo over Coca-Cola\n\nNone of this is meant to suggest that Coca-Cola is a bad company. In fact, it is a very good company. It just isn't as compellingly valued as PepsiCo, an equally good company, is right now. The reason has more to do with the myopic vision of Wall Street, which focuses too much on the short term. If you think in decades, particularly if you are an income investor, PepsiCo and its historically high 3.5% yield look even more attractive following Coca-Cola's price rally.",

            "content": "by Danielle Oster , February 10, 2025\n\nCoca-Cola launched a nostalgia-stoking campaign for its newest flavor.\n\nThe company launched a \u201cWe All Scream\u201d campaign to introduce its new Coca-Cola Orange Cream and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Orange Cream to a wider audience as it rolls out across retailers in the U.S. and Canada. Coca-Cola previously announced the new flavor late last month, including on its social media channels.\n\nThe real marketing push for the new flavor kicked off this week, though. At the center of the campaign is an ad leaning into the flavor\u2019s associations with the classic ice cream bar. Running in 30-second and 15-second iterations, the spot opens on a giant can of the Orange Cream flavor fitted atop an ice cream truck, and the nostalgic sound of an ice cream truck jingle. A stampede of grown adults chases the truck down for a taste of the new flavor, which proves so popular the truck soon runs out. As a Coca-Cola truck pulls up with reinforcements, it concludes with the tagline, \u201cWe all scream for Orange Cream.\u201d\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe ad debuts today and will run nationally on linear and OTT TV, as well as online video and social media. It will be further supported digital and social media, radio advertising, OOH, experiential and sampling activations.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s new flavor arrives on the heels of rival Pepsi\u2019s Wild Cherry & Cream launch. It also follows Coca-Cola deciding last September to discontinueits Coca-Cola Spiced flavor after introducing it as a \u201cpermanent flavor\u201d early last year.\n\nThe company is not positioning the new Orange Cream flavor as a permanent addition to its roster. According to a brand spokesperson, it is \u201cplanned to be in-market until Q1 2026,\u201d with \u201cflexibility\u201d to evolve that timeline.",

            "content": "RU\n\nOver 11,000 Western \u0441ompanies are still in Russia\n\nDonald Trump has been busy of late, resuming official contact with Vladimr Putin and kicking up a scandal with Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. The American president\u2019s actions have only further fueled discussions about the possibility of lifting sanctions, and several Western brands are showing increasing interest in returning to Russia. Russian media fueled speculation that Inditex \u2014 the Spanish fashion giant behind Zara, Bershka, Pull & Bear, and Stradivarius \u2014 was planning a comeback. The report about Inditex was later debunked, but South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motors appears more serious about resuming business, while Renault is also considering a return. Samsung, which suspended direct shipments, has already ramped up its advertising budget to promote smartphones in Russia.\n\nThe financial impact on Western companies that exited Russia varies, but for some, foregone revenues are counted in tens of billions of dollars. Russian officials claim that American businesses that exited the country have lost $300 billion over three years of war, while European companies lost an estimated \u20ac100 billion in just 18 months, according to the Financial Times. Some companies, however, chose to stay and avoid such losses. The Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, for example, continues to profit in Russia through its subsidiary \u201cMulton Partners,\u201d which produces \u201cDobry Cola\u201d (lit. \u201cKind Cola\u201d) while retaining trademarks for Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta \u2014 brands it officially withdrew from the market.\n\nThe number of foreign-owned companies in Russia dropped from 29,000 in March 2021 to 19,000 by March 2024, according to a Kommersant report citing Kontur.Fokus research. However, The Insider\u2019s analysis of SPARK-Interfax data suggests that as of early 2025, 14,200 companies in Russia had owners from Western nations, or 11,600 when excluding Cyprus-based parent companies (detailed methodology below).\n\nHow the data was calculated\n\nWestern-owned companies were defined as those with parent firms or direct ownership from EU nations, the European Economic Area, the UK, Switzerland, the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan. By early 2025, Russia had 14,200 registered companies linked to these countries.\n\nThis figure includes entities like Rosneft \u2014 a Russian company in which BP controls a 19.75% stake via BP Russian Investments Ltd (UK) \u2014 as well as Russian firms whose parent companies are registered in Cyprus. Due to Cyprus\u2019s longtime status as an offshore haven, where distinguishing genuine foreign owners from Russian oligarchs is difficult, The Insider excluded all Cyprus-based firms from its analysis.\n\nSince financial reports for 2024 have not yet been published for most companies as of March 2025, The Insider analyzed 2023 data using the average exchange rate of 85.163 rubles per U.S. dollar.\n\nOver 1 trillion rubles in net profits\n\nThe total revenue of Western-owned (excluding Cyprus) companies in Russia amounted to 17.3 trillion rubles ($203 billion) in 2023, down from 23.6 trillion rubles in 2021, the last full year before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The analysis includes only companies that filed financial reports, covering about 80% of the total.\n\nTotal profits for these firms totaled 1.23 trillion rubles ($14.4 billion), with over half of this sum generated by two quasi-foreign companies \u2014 Rosneft and Russneft, the latter 31.28% owned by Swiss-based Rambero Holding AG.\n\nSectors where profits surged in 2023 compared to pre-war 2021 include pharmaceuticals, wholesale trade, machinery and industrial equipment, food production, construction materials, cosmetics and household chemicals, software development, hospitality (restaurants and hotels), and construction.\n\nPlenty of individual companies benefited from this boom. For example, Swiss logistics firm InterRail Holding (\u00ab\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b \u0425\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433\u00bb) tripled its revenue (from 1 billion to 3 billion rubles) after a dip in 2021, while French-owned cheese producer Bongrain Europa Vostok (\u00ab\u0411\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0440\u044d\u043d \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u00bb) saw growth of 100%. The revenue of German industrial equipment supplier AscoBloc Debag Rus (\u00ab\u0410\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0414\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0433 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u00bb) increased by a factor of 5.5.\n\nPart of this growth resulted from foreign competitors exiting Russia, allowing those that stayed to fill gaps in the market. For instance, in the banking sector, Austria\u2019s Raiffeisenbank was one of the few large financial firms still processing transactions in dollars and euros, allowing it to hike fees and generate over half of Raiffeisen Group\u2019s global banking profits. Despite pressure from the European Central Bank (ECB) to exit Russia, Raiffeisenbank is dragging its feet, pledging only to reduce its Russian loan portfolio by 65% by 2026.\n\nSmall and microbusinesses, particularly those involved in trade, saw explosive revenue growth \u2014 sometimes tenfold. Many of these firms likely played a role in rebuilding supply chains disrupted by sanctions.\n\nAs Andrei Yakovlev, an associate researcher at Harvard's Davis Center, explains: \u201cTo bypass sanctions, Russia heavily relies on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for foreign trade. Large corporations are easier to monitor, but there are tens of thousands of SMEs, making oversight nearly impossible. This has fueled the rapid rise of certain small businesses, particularly those involved in importing critical components for the defense sector and beyond. These intermediaries profit from the risk they assume, but identifying those facilitating sanctions evasion for military purposes is challenging.\u201d\n\nHalf a trillion rubles for the Kremlin\u2019s war chest\n\nBy remaining in Russia, Western-owned businesses are not only profiting from the war but also helping fund Russia\u2019s military budget. The Insider estimates that their total tax contributions in 2023 reached approximately 500 billion rubles ($4.85 billion).\n\nFor context, Russia\u2019s total non-oil-and-gas tax revenues in 2023 were 20 trillion rubles. The corporate income tax alone from these companies directly contributed at least 111 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) to the Russian war budget.",

            "content": "WPP, no stranger to financial strains as of late, is facing another major headache. Though it\u2019s not decided yet, one of its biggest spending advertisers \u2014 Coca-Cola \u2014 is considering a new partner for its biggest market in North America, according to three sources with knowledge of the account.\n\nIf Coca-Cola does opt for a change, Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth $620 million in the U.S., according to Comvergence data \u2014 but likely closer to $700 million including Canada, according to those sources.\n\nEven if the account were to change, WPP isn\u2019t being shut out entirely. It remains Coca-Cola\u2019s global marketing partner under the OpenX model, which includes media and creative. And while the media account in North America is in flux, those same sources say the region\u2019s creative business is expected to stay put.\n\nAll of the involved parties \u2014 Coca-Cola, WPP/GroupM, Publicis and MediaSense, which is said to be helping Coca-Cola with its decision \u2014 declined comment for this story.\n\nStill, according to one agency exec at another holding company, Publicis has been \u201cheavily prospecting\u201d Coca-Cola to win the business from WPP, which has endured some punishing losses over the last year, undergone an organizational shakeup at its media buying arm GroupM and tougher competition from rival holdcos.\n\nThe source said Publicis is most likely offering to reduce Coca-Cola\u2019s cost for services.\n\nLosing Coca-Cola would clearly add to those woes for WPP, but it would be mitigated to some degree by the fact that it has scooped up lucrative media accounts in North America including Johnson & Johnson\u2019s U.S. and Canadian media in December.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s shift comes at a crucial point in WPP\u2019s history. It reported like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs, an indicator of organic agency growth, decline 1% year-on-year. That drop was steeper than analysts expected, and made worse by a murky outlook for the year. So much so that WPP\u2019s share price tumbled to a four-year low. One saving grace was GroupM, which did grow 2.7% in revenue in 2024, including 2.4% in Q4.\n\nWPP CEO Mark Read has placed his faith in GroupM\u2019s new leadership under global CEO Brian Lesser, who replaced Christian Juhl last summer. And at least one observer sees results heading in the right direction.\n\n\u201cI think that [GroupM is] in the middle of a surge \u2014 they\u2019re in the middle of a comeback, with new leadership [in Lesser] and new structure that\u2019s centralized in a way that the prior GroupM leadership was either not interested in or willing to centralize,\u201d said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester in a recent story. \u201cSo I think that GroupM is going to be able to deliver for WPP, but only over time.\u201d",

Place nominations before Jan. 31.\n\nThe Coca-Cola company has selected incumbent WPP and Publicis Groupe as finalists in a closed door review of its U.S. media business, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to ADWEEK.\n\nWPP has held the account since 2021, when it won The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s global business and launched a bespoke team called Open X to service the roughly $4 billion account. Publicis was the runner up in that review.\n\nThe win gave Open X the beverage giant\u2019s portfolio in more than 200 countries and territories across its media, creative, and production agencies.\n\nDentsu was also brought on board at the time as a \u201ccomplementary\u201d media partner to offer \u201cdifferentiated capabilities\u201d at a local level within a few select markets in Asia. The Coca-Cola Company also set up an \u201copen-source strategic roster\u201d that at the time it said would account for one-third of all marketing work and includes Publicis and IPG agencies.\n\nWPP and Publicis declined comment on the ongoing review.\n\nThe source with knowledge of the review said the majority of WPP\u2019s business with The Coca-Cola Company sits within creative and production. COMvergence pegs Coca-Cola\u2019s 2024 U.S. media spend at $785 million, up from $610 million in 2023.\n\nStill, the loss comes at a critical time for WPP, which missed analyst expectations in its latest earnings report at the end of Feb., when it forecasted a revenue decline of up to 2% for 2025. At the time, CEO Mark Read told ADWEEK he was betting on a turnaround at media network GroupM to boost the holding company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nAccording to its Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, The Coca-Cola Company spent $5.15 billion on advertising globally in 2024, up from $5 billion in 2023 and $4.32 billion in 2022.\n\nCoca-Cola reported net revenue of $47.1 billion in 2024, up 3% from the previous year, and it expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% in 2025.\n\nDuring a February earnings call with analysts, Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO James Quincey said the company has seen \u201ctangible results\u201d from its marketing efforts, with retail sales of the Coca-Cola brand increasing $40 billion over the past three years. He noted the company plans to pour more money into the business moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe are going to invest from the marketing all the way down,\u201d he said.",

EssenceMediacom handled the media planning and buying.\n\nAfter a year-long pitch, WPP won the account and the relationship was described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d in its breadth and depth by Coca-Cola in a press release, as well as for the industry \u201cgiven its geographical scale and reach.\u201d\n\nWPP Open X manages creative, media, data and marketing technology across Coca-Cola\u2019s entire portfolio of brands and its global ventures, including Costa and Innocent. The unit is led by CEO Laurent Ezekiel, chief communications and marketing officer Julianna Richter, global chief strategy officer Chris Binns and chief creative officer Andrew Keller.\n\nTheir brief was to change The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s marketing from a majority analog output to 60% digital and incorporate more experiential work, as well as creating global consistency while localizing creative to each market.\n\nThe first year saw Coca-Cola transfer all of its media, creative, social and production into WPP, while the second year added commerce, data and technology influencer marketing and live experience.\n\nDentsu was selected as a complementary media partner in selected markets. Agencies from within Publicis Groupe and IPG were selected to be part of the \"strategic roster,\" which was expected to account for one-third of all marketing work.\n\nIn 2023, WPP assembled a global leadership team from within Grey to lead the account, pulling in talent from across Grey\u2019s global network to work on different briefs.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s brands include Fanta, Sprite and Costa Coffee.",

Ten of those laptops were presented to the Florida Keys Children\u2019s Shelter.\n\nWith a local office on Big Pine Key, Coke Florida initially reached out to Monroe County Commissioner Holly Raschein regarding community organizations in need of technological resources. Raschein was quick to mention the children\u2019s shelter located on Plantation Key in Islamorada.\n\n\u201cI was really excited when Coke Florida reached out to me for input. I\u2019m delighted this partnership worked out,\u201d Raschein said.\n\nA 19-bed home for kids ages 10 to 18, the shelter provides a safe place for local youth and teens. As Coke Florida representatives saw during a tour, the shelter is more like a dormitory where kids can go outside and play basketball or stay inside and watch some movies or video games. There are also spots to sit and do homework.\n\nBen Kemmer, children\u2019s shelter CEO, welcomes Coca-Cola Florida employees. The company recently donated laptops to the shelter.\n\nThe shelter features a full-time counselor and a full-time chef. Rooms are artfully decorated thanks to the likes of Wyland, Pasta Pantaleo and Stacie Krupa. One wall in the hall depicts a Keys bridge outlooking the ocean. Among the vehicles on the road is a Coca-Cola truck.\n\nWhether kids stay a day or several years, the shelter provides a home with caring people who listen.\n\nUpon grabbing an ice-cold Coca-Cola product, the kids took seats and proceeded to their favorite websites, like Tik Tok. Coke Florida representatives took a few minutes to quiz the kids about Coca-Cola; one question had students looking up how many beverages are in the Coca-Cola Company. One student found the answer to be more than 3,500 beverages, from sodas and juices to water, coffees and teas.\n\nPercy L. Wells II, spokesman for Coke Florida, said initiatives such as the laptop donations are helping people and communities reach their full potential.\n\n\u201cWhether it be through the creation of new learning opportunities for an elementary school student or helping an adult in their job search, Coke Florida has stepped in to help foster these opportunities,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Buffett\u2019s value investing concepts remain intact even as markets shift. He draws attention to the company\u2019s growing stakes in five significant Japanese trading firms, which represents an exceptional but purposeful venture into international stocks. He mentioned that after reviewing the financial records, they were surprised by how undervalued the stocks appeared. Despite some of these equities declining by as much as 24% over the past year, he regarded these downturns as investment opportunities rather than reasons for concern. He also emphasized that their holdings in these five companies were intended to be long-term investments.\n\nBuffett\u2019s longtime belief that equities, which represent ownership in successful companies, are still the best way to build wealth over the long run is reflected in this position. He cautions against turning to cash or bonds, particularly in inflationary times when bond returns lag behind price increases and the currency depreciates.\n\n\u201cDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett made it clear in his 2025 shareholder letter that Berkshire is not abandoning stocks, even though some analysts claim that the company has a record $334 billion in cash that it is reserving. Buffett tells shareholders,\n\nWarren Buffett wagered $1 million in 2007 that the broader market index fund would outperform a group of hedge funds over ten years. Buffett\u2019s preferred Vanguard Index Fund Admiral Shares produced average yearly returns of 7.1%, despite the 2008 financial crisis, compared to the average of the hedge funds of 2.2%. While hedge funds only reached $121,000 by 2016, a $100,000 investment in Vanguard grew to $185,000. The primary issue was fees, with hedge funds\u2019 2% management fees and 20% profit share reducing earnings compared to index funds\u2019 0.03% fees. Buffett\u2019s straightforward approach, supported by inexpensive investing, far outpaced pricey active management.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the most successful investors the world has known. Additionally, he is arguably one of the strongest supporters of long-term investing. Buffett uses his hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway , to invest in solid businesses, and he frequently keeps such stocks for years or even decades.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other Warren Buffett Stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBuffett\u2019s conviction that patient investors will eventually be rewarded by undervalued companies with solid fundamentals is seen in Japanese investments. He commends these businesses for their prudent capital management, shareholder-friendly practices, and fair executive pay. Buffett\u2019s strategy highlights a key idea in value investing: if the underlying company is favorable, short-term price volatility doesn\u2019t matter. Buffett has shown throughout his career that he does not hesitate to look for bargains, even if they are located outside of the United States.\n\nThe route to success continues to be apparent for investors who want to follow in Buffett\u2019s footsteps: own up to your mistakes, stick with profitable assets like equities, and patiently invest where value is present despite short-term noise.\n\n10 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Warren Buffett\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds in Q4 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock\u2019s revenue growth (year-over-year) as a tiebreaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nRevenue Growth Rate (year-over-year): 2.86%\n\nOne of the Best Warren Buffett Stocks, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), a long-time Buffett favorite, has increased its cash dividend to investors for an impressive 63 consecutive years. A common misconception among investors is that it is only a soda business. However, its beverage empire extends well beyond the pop brand that bears its name. These days, the company\u2019s diversified product line includes bottled milk, water, coffee, tea, juice, and even alcoholic beverages. These products are marketed under popular names such as Smartwater, Fairlife, Costa Coffee, Fuze, Minute Maid, and Simply.\n\nThe key to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\u2019s success is its ability to quickly scale its revenue by developing or acquiring a new brand and incorporating it into its extensive global marketing strategy. The distribution dynamo can then reinvest its profits in new product development or other acquisitions, or it can distribute dividends to shareholders.\n\nFor over thirty years, one of Buffett\u2019s main holdings has been The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). In the years to come, Berkshire\u2019s $28 billion investment in the beverage giant will likely grow substantially because there is still a lot of room for expansion in both the domestic and foreign markets.\n\nThe beverage titan generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the most recent quarter, demonstrating outstanding cash flow management. Its profitability was further proven by its strong adjusted operating margin of 30.7%.\n\nOverall KO ranks 9th on our list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A mosaic also highlighted the benefits of sustainability.\n\nWith millions flooding the streets each year during the celebration, this initiative was a vital first step in countering a major issue that has affected the city for years while offering a way to celebrate sustainability during the holiday.\n\nThis is not Coca-Cola's first effort to improve sustainability either. After coming under fire earlier this year for U-turning on a plastic reduction pledge, the company is making more moves toward reaffirming its commitment to sustainability in its packaging and marketing.\n\nFor consumers, supporting eco-friendly initiatives by mainstream brands can let these companies know that there is money to be made while being kinder to the planet.\n\n\"The city stepping up to the plate is huge, and I think it says a lot about their commitment to the conversation,\" one local nonprofit director in New Orleans told NOLA.com.\n\nAnna Nguyen, the external affairs manager for New Orleans' Office of Resilience & Sustainability, told the publication, \"We want to make this an accessible, everyday practice for everyone.\"\n\n\"That is awesome! I love that it's simple enough that kids could help too!\" said a commenter on a Recycle Dat!

Existing investors AtOne Ventures, Better Ventures, SOSV, and Climate Capital also participated.\n\nThe capital injection will help North Carolina-based Avalo to deploy its rapid evolution platform to bring low-input resilient crops to market, starting with cotton and sugarcane that can grow with less nitrogen fertilizer and less water.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to be supporting Avalo\u2019s expansion into the sugar category. Ingredients represent one of the hardest to abate emissions areas in our value chain and by tackling the problem at its source, Avalo has the potential to create more sustainable crops \u2013 reducing our scope 3 emissions and adding value to growers and other stakeholders across the value chain.\u201d Nicola Tongue, CCEP Ventures\n\nClimate resilient sugarcane\n\nThe partnership with CCEP will focus on sugarcane, a crop heavily reliant on water and fertilizer with limited growing regions, Avalo chief marketing officer Nick Schwanz told AgFunderNews. Complex genetics and lengthy breeding cycles in turn have made it difficult to improve through traditional breeding, he added.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, runoff from nitrogen fertilizer is killing the Great Barrier Reef and Australia\u2019s $2 billion dollar sugarcane industry is facing considerable headwinds. While drought and pest pressure continue to increase, the sugar being grown has remained largely unchanged for 15 years. This is where Avalo comes in. Not only could evolved sugar varieties [that can thrive with less water and synthetic fertilizer] future proof this at-risk industry for farmers and producers, they will also prevent further damage to critically endangered ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schwanz, bringing a new sugarcane variety to market might typically take 12+ years. \u201cAvalo could make it possible in just 5-6 years.\u201d\n\nInterpretable artificial intelligence\n\nAvalo\u2019s core technology\u2014Gene Discovery by Informationless Perturbation (GDIP)\u2014draws upon Professor Cynthia Rudin\u2019s work in interpretable artificial intelligence to more rapidly identify the genes responsible for specific traits in crops, said CEO Brendan Collins, who cofounded Avalo with Dr. Mariano Alvarez in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think the larger blow up of AI has really muddied the waters. But one thing I really want to emphasize is the math that we are using is brand new. It was basically invented in 2018, whereas the math that goes into large language models was basically invented in the 1940s, we just didn\u2019t have the computing power to pull it off until more recently. But what we are doing is bleeding edge on machine learning theory and AI and interpretability.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI do think AI is going to have meaningful impact across agriculture, including the large language models, and things like computer vision for precision agriculture. But in genetics, there is not a huge amount of historical data to power those LLMs in a meaningful way, especially in crops beyond maize and soy. And that\u2019s why we think our version of AI and ML is extremely valuable as we can make the most of the sparse and limited data that there is.\u201d\n\nSearching through a \u2018sea of biological noise\u2019\n\nAccording to Alvarez, at the core of Avalo\u2019s GDIP tech is \u201ca way to identify important genetic information in a big sea of biological noise.\u201d\n\nThis has two key applications, he said. \u201cThe first is identifying the genes that are responsible for a trait, and that could be disease resistance, heat resistance, or value-added traits for the downstream supply chain. The second is that it allows us to create models that are much more predictive of plant performance than we would have been able to create otherwise, using much less information.\u201d\n\nIt quickly became apparent, he said, that \u201cusing that predictive component would allow us to run a breeding program, a genomic selection program, at much lower cost with much higher efficiency.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the main approach to connect genes with traits is the GWAS, or genome wide association study, he said. By scanning the plant genome for markers that consistently appear in plants with a desired trait, breeders can pinpoint regions likely responsible for that trait, and use that data to guide breeding decisions.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically going gene by gene or allele by allele, and saying, \u2018Is this allele associated with this trait of interest?\u2019\u201d said Alvarez. \u201cAnd then you do that 100,000 times or 500,000 times or a million times. If you have a trait caused by a single allele, you can get a very clear and accurate picture of that trait.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, he said, is that most of the traits we care about in agriculture are not single gene traits. \u201cThey\u2019re polygenic traits, which may have hundreds or thousands of genes underlying them, and in that situation, it\u2019s very difficult to determine which genes are important because they\u2019re all working together and interacting.\n\n\u201cOur model, rather than looking allele by allele through the genome, uses a machine learning model to look at the entire genome all at once, all at the same time. Rather than asking, \u2018Is this allele associated with this trait?\u2019 it asks, \u2018Is this more associated with the trait than all of the other alleles that I\u2019m looking at?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd is this conditionally more important, rather than just individually important? And that allows us to develop a much better baseline for how the genome is working and more accurately assess which places in the genome might play an outsized role compared to everything else.\u201d\n\nDramatically speeding up traditional breeding\n\nAccording to Alvarez, \u201cWith GWAS, maybe 15% or 20% of the things you identify are truly causal of the trait you\u2019re looking at. Our model is greater than 90% accurate.\u201d To test this, he said, \u201cGreater than 90% of the things that we find when we knock them [the offending genes] out in a plant are changing our trait of interest.\u201d\n\nAt base, he claimed, \u201cThe things that we find are then much more likely to be validated in a practical setting.\u201d\n\nCollins added: \u201cTraits such as drought resilience and nitrogen efficiency can be driven by more than 1,000 alleles across the genome. By being able, with really high fidelity, to hone in on these allows us to take advantage of all the natural diversity that has been collected and in seed banks globally.\u201d\n\nThe business model\n\nSo once the genes of interest have been identified, what happens next?\n\nAccording to Alvarez, Avalo\u2019s initial focus is using its predictive models to accelerate traditional breeding programs, although he noted that the approach could also inform gene editing applications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trait dependent. If you\u2019re looking at pests, they\u2019re usually exploiting a couple mechanisms within a plant, so maybe it\u2019s only a couple genes you would need to edit to increase pest resistance. But there\u2019s not a single drought gene or one yield gene. So with current gene editing technology, even if you could make the number of edits needed to make to make a substantial impact on those traits, you\u2019re going to change so much else about the plant itself.\u201d\n\nThe business model will vary depending on the project, meanwhile, said Collins. \u201cIn the sugarcane model, we are developing low nitrogen, low water sugarcane for Coca Cola to reduce their scope three emissions. That allows us to go to farmers and say we can contract grow with you to get this commodity out to this big CPG and you just need to follow this agronomy recipe and use our seeds.\n\n\u201cThat gives us evidence to go to investors and say, we need this amount of money to develop this crop. We have this offtake guaranteed. And then by reducing the inputs that have to go into the field, we can increase sustainability and farmer profitability and get some margin for ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn this scenario, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re basically doing toll-based manufacturing. We\u2019re giving farmers seed at a discounted rate, helping them with agronomy to grow our seed in their environments, and then harvesting with the farmer and selling the sugar at the post farm gate into the commodity supply chain, so we\u2019re sharing the profits from their sugar, rather than selling farmers sugarcane seeds.\u201d\n\nNext steps in CCEP sugarcane partnership\n\nAs for CCEP, said Collins, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to crack this in a year, and this is a multiyear project, but it can be faster than it was before, and way less expensive.\u201d\n\nSugarcane, he noted, is a tropical crop. \u201cSo by being able to change its water tolerances, we can also change the regions it\u2019s grown in and put it into lower impact environments [that don\u2019t contribute to deforestation for example].\u201d\n\nAvalo\u2019s goal is to have its \u201cfirst machine learning models trained this year so we can start making recommendations at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year,\u201d said Alvarez. \u201cWe really want to make an impact in the supply chain in the next three to five years.\u201d\n\nBroccoli, rice, rubber, cotton\u2026\n\nOther areas of focus beyond sugar are staple crops such as cotton, rubber, and rice, said Collins. \u201cTexas is by far the largest cotton growing state in the United States and they have experienced unbelievable droughts the last couple years, but the industry has been breeding varieties that perform in high irrigation and high nitrogen environments.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting the exact opposite to create low-nitrogen use cotton that can be completely rain fed, but still have premium fiber characteristics, and our progress so far has been pretty awesome. We are going to be on 2,000 acres this year. We do have a partner for cotton but we can\u2019t announce it yet.\u201d\n\nAvalo is also working with partners to create a US source of rubber production through the latex produced in the roots of particular species of dandelion, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to think about rubber crops being grown in Ohio, but we\u2019re hoping to release a variety in the next year or two.\u201d\n\nOther projects include fast-growing broccoli, enabling farmers to get six, rather than four harvests a year from an indoor facility. Aside from the obvious economic benefits of more harvests per year, growers can also stop using pesticides as the crop grows too rapidly for pests to gain traction, said Collins.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pest life cycle that is shorter than 45 days. We were able to get a crop that was harvestable in 37 days.\u201d\n\nFundraising\n\nAsked how challenging it has been to raise money in the current environment, Collins said: \u201cPeople are generically skeptical of agtech right now, so they are looking for market signals from corporates [that there is commercial interest in their tech]. So having CCEP on board gave a strong market signal.\u201d\n\nMichael Lavin, managing partner at Germin8 Ventures, which co-led Avalo\u2019s Series A round, told us: \u201cAgriculture is a national security issue inextricably linked with America\u2019s ability to be food secure, economically productive throughout the supply chain, healthy and competitive internationally.\n\n\u201cWith a powerful AI capable of harnessing the causal genes for breeding complex traits on the fastest timelines\u2014reducing what is normally accomplished over decades to just a short few years or less\u2014Avalo is liberating the most needed genes that already exist in the plant. This will help commercialize varieties which break barriers on the farm and are purpose-designed for society\u2019s most pressing commercial needs, at the pace of business.\n\n\u201cWhile Avalo\u2019s AI yields an asymmetric advantage, make no mistake, this is a market-maker and product-first enterprise leveraging an unmatched ability to empower and transform supply chains from farm to manufacturer.\u201d",

It also owns Red Classic Transportation, one the largest transportation providers in the United States, moving freight and providing fleet maintenance for Coca-Cola Consolidated and some of today\u2019s most recognized brands, it shares.\n\nThe Coca-Cola bottler also is known for its sustainability commitments. Coca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s commitment to sustainability started with its long-standing partner Charlotte Motor Speedway identifying opportunities for recycling diversion and to encourage patrons of the Coca-Cola 600 to recycle aluminum and plastic bottles. This led the company to expand efforts across the city and its territory.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated works with customers such as Clemson University, Spectrum Center, Nissan Stadium, Geodis Park and most recently Rupp Arena, to educate consumers about recycling benefits, hosting collection events and programs throughout their territory and support in-venue closed loop systems to recycle plastic bottles and aluminum cans.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Helene this past fall, Coca-Cola Consolidated Teammates participated in various volunteer relief efforts, including company-organized packing events as well as having a dedicated response team of trained volunteers offering assistance in the hardest hit areas.\n\nImage courtesy of Coca-Cola Consolidated\n\n\n\n\n\nThis past fall, Coca-Cola Consolidated and its teammates responded to the devastating impact caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina and neighboring states by providing food and water, hygiene kits and baby essentials to help with cleanup, along with financial support.\n\nAdditionally, Coca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s dedicated response team of trained volunteers assisted in the hardest hit areas by removing downed trees, clearing dangerous debris, setting up food pantries, and providing hot meals for its impacted team members, residents, and hungry volunteers.\n\nTeammates across its 14-state territory also participated in various volunteer relief efforts, including eight company-organized packing events. These packing events resulted in the creation of nearly 6,000 hygiene and care kits, which were distributed by Convoy of Hope, a faith-based, humanitarian-relief nonprofit.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated makes, sells and distributes trademark beverages of The Coca-Cola Company as well as its partner companies, for a portfolio totaling more than 300 brands and flavors.

Yet, even with such a robust portfolio, Coca-Cola Consolidated will be expanding its offerings to partners and consumers even more.\n\n\u201cThere are so many innovative products that have added value to our business,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cBut to name just a few \u2015 Coca-Cola Orange Cream (also in zero sugar) offers a slightly different twist on the Coca-Cola trademark. We have just recently launched Topo Chico Mineral Water, which enables us to expand our participation in the premium sparkling water category. And our friends at Monster Energy continue to produce winning innovation with their Monster Ultra portfolio with the recent launches of Monster Ultra Vice Guava and Monster Ultra Blue Hawaiian \u2015 also in zero sugar.\u201d\n\nHolmes explains that in the year to come the company has high performance expectations for its sparkling soft drinks but also calls attention that its portfolio strategy is to provide its partners a diverse array of products that allows the company to appeal to a plethora of consumer demographics and choices.\n\nCoca-Cola Coca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s manufacturing facilities, and distribution, and warehouse centers are equipped with the tools to keep evolving to meet the needs of its consumers and customers.\n\nImage courtesy of Coca-Cola Consolidated\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing is more iconic than a Coca-Cola glass bottle, so continued growth in glass remains a key priority,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cOur mini portfolio, consisting of both mini cans and mini bottles, continues to resonate with shoppers while expanding households, and we\u2019ve seen an uptick in our value package portfolio in products such as 1.25-liter bottles and six-pack sparkling flavors.\u201d\n\nAs an industry, more than 60% of beverages are zero sugar and the Coca-Cola System has recently invested in Topo Chico. From diet, zero sugar and water options, this expansion has allowed Coca-Cola Consolidated to provide its customers and consumers with even more choices.\n\n\u201cOur zero-sugar portfolio is No. 1 in the industry, and we have continued growth expectations for both existing products and new introductions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also expect growth in the large categories of energy and sports drinks, and our protein products continue to accelerate at a fast rate.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated also recognizes that today\u2019s beverage manufacturing and distribution continues to evolve, and it remains committed to crafting the programs and strategies that serve its partners and their specific needs.\n\n\u201cWe work hard to develop channel-specific commercial strategies that meet our customers\u2019 needs,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cWe focus on providing products that turn customer inventory investments into profit to run their businesses.\u201d\n\nPositioned for success\n\nTo support its partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s manufacturing facilities, and distribution, and warehouse centers are equipped with the tools to keep evolving to meet the needs of its consumers and customers.\n\nFor instance, the bottler has adopted warehouse automation through the use of the Vertique system.\n\n\u201cThe state-of-the-art Vertique system is a semi-automated solution that improves warehouse productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and working conditions,\u201d Holmes says. \u201c[It is] known as the \u2018distribution system of the future.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe company also has invested in their teammates through modernizing tools to support their work. Through systems like Vertique, the company has modernized technology to allow for teammates to be more productive and efficient, the company says.

Fairfax Media reported that a pathologist, Dr. Dan Mornin, testified at an inquest Thursday that she probably suffered from hypokalemia, or low potassium, which he thinks was caused by her excessive consumption of Coke and overall poor nutrition.\n\nSymptoms of hypokalemia can include abnormal heart rhythms, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\nMornin said that toxic levels of caffeine, a stimulant found in Coke, also may have contributed to her death, according to Fairfax.\n\nHarris' partner, Chris Hodgkinson, testified that Harris drank between 8 and 10 liters (2.1 and 2.6 gallons) of regular Coke every day.\n\n\"The first thing she would do in the morning was to have a drink of Coke beside her bed and the last thing she would do at night was have a drink of Coke,\" Hodgkinson said in a deposition. \"She was addicted to Coke.\"\n\nHodgkinson also said Harris ate little and smoked about 30 cigarettes a day. In the months before her death, he said, Harris experienced blood pressure problems and lacked energy.\n\nHe said that on the morning of her death, Harris helped get her children ready for school before slumping against a wall. He called emergency services and tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but couldn't revive her.\n\nAnother pathologist, Dr. Martin Sage, said in a deposition that \"it is certainly well demonstrated that excessive long or short term cola ingestion can be dramatically symptomatic, and there are strong hypothetical grounds for this becoming fatal in individual cases.\"\n\nInquests such as this are sometimes held for unusual or unexplained deaths in New Zealand, and can help shape future health policies. With the evidence in the case now complete, the coroner's office will compile and issue a final report into the death.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Lisa Te Morenga, a nutritionist at the University of Otago, said excessive consumption of any type of liquid in a cool climate would be likely to play havoc with the body's natural systems and balance.\n\nKaren Thompson, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Oceania, said in a statement that its products are safe.\n\n\"We concur with the information shared by the coroner's office that the grossly excessive ingestion of any food product, including water, over a short period of time with the inadequate consumption of essential nutrients, and the failure to seek appropriate medical intervention when needed, can be dramatically symptomatic.\"",

This honor places Derek in an esteemed group of future leaders, each receiving a $20,000 college scholarship.\n\nDerek is part of the 37th class of Coca-Cola Scholars, a program that celebrates high school seniors who demonstrate exceptional leadership, academic achievement, and a commitment to community service. From a pool of over 105,000 applicants, Derek is one of less than 0.14% of students selected for this highly competitive scholarship.\n\nAs a Coca-Cola Scholar, Derek has the privilege of celebrating a teacher who, in his opinion, has greatly impacted his vision of education as a Coca-Cola Educator of Distinction. AP Biology and Premedical Anatomy & Physiology teacher at Syosset High School, Carisa Steinberg, wrote his letter of recommendation and played a pivotal role in the application process.\n\n\u201cDerek is one of the most capable, intelligent, and respectful students that I have ever taught in my 25 years in education,\u201d said Carisa Steinberg. \u201cHis goals have always been lofty\u2014goals that many people would never envision. Yet, despite a myriad of obstacles, which would indubitably have stymied most other students, Derek views hindrances as opportunities to learn, be creative, and persist.\u201d\n\nSince Derek\u2019s sophomore year, Ms. Steinberg has been mentoring Derek in leading Syosset\u2019s Global Health Club and the NGO he co-founded, Statice Health International. Over two years, they\u2019ve raised over $10,000 for Gift of Life International to fund pediatric heart surgeries in developing countries and expanded Statice to a community of more than 3,400 students committed to advancing global health equity.\n\nIn addition to the $20,000 scholarship, Derek will attend the Coca-Cola Scholars Weekend in Atlanta this April, where he will participate in the Leadership Development Institute.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Scholars Program is the largest corporate-sponsored, achievement-based scholarship program in the United States. Each year, the program recognizes young individuals who are poised to make significant contributions to their communities and the world. The Foundation has awarded over $87 million in scholarships since its inception and, with this latest class, will continue to support the next generation of leaders.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola Co. brand Fairlife's ultrafiltered milk in Tiskilwa, Illinois. - Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhen James Quincey became CEO of Coca-Cola in 2017, soda had broadly been in decline over its health effects. The beverage giant was embarking on an effort to diversify its reach beyond the sugary drink.\n\nA key move? Ditching the carbonation and sticking to the basics: cow milk.\n\nLaunched in 2012, Fairlife \u2014 originally founded as a joint venture between Coca-Cola and wholesale dairy producer Select Milk Producers \u2014 used whimsical, minimalistic packaging that fits with the influx of niche almond, protein and even pistachio milks, outperforming large-container beverages in the dairy aisle.\n\nIn 2020, Coca-Cola fully acquired Fairlife for an initial $980 million \u2014 an acquisition that has far exceeded the soda giant\u2019s expectations due in part to social media popularity in the health and wellness space. While Americans face higher food prices and a pullback in their spending, they\u2019re still drawn to Fairlife\u2019s ultra-filtered system that draws out lactose and sugar but doubles the protein.\n\nIn 2022, Coca-Cola announced that Fairlife\u2019s sales surpassed $1 billion.\n\nThe success is driven by Fairlife\u2019s Core Power protein shake brand, which remains a popular staple at many grocery stores and does not have many direct market-leading competitors.\n\nBut in its latest earnings call last week, Coca-Cola projected some moderation of Fairlife\u2019s growth in 2025 while it builds a facility in New York and carbonated beverages still make up the overwhelming majority of sales for Coca-Cola (its competitor, Pepsi, on the other hand, leans on its Frito-Lay snack brand). And when compared to Coca-Cola\u2019s other big acquisition in the non-soda space \u2014 Costa Coffee in 2018 \u2014 Fairlife has far outpaced it.\n\n\u201cThe expectations were never for Fairlife to be this successful, I think even for Coke,\u201d said Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst for finance firm Jeffries.\n\nThe acquisition was structured so there would be an earn-out \u2014 meaning the amount paid will ultimately be based on the milk brand\u2019s success. In deals like this, the buyer could pay less than buying outright if they\u2019re not sure a product will be successful, Gajrawala said.\n\nThe total payment for the acquisition is now looking to be $6.2 billion, plus the $980 million Coke initially paid, according to Coca-Cola\u2019s latest earnings report. That would make it among Coke\u2019s priciest acquisitions to date.\n\n\u201cDairy has been tricky for Coke to get into,\u201d Gajrawala said. \u201cNothing will ever be as important as a Coke trademark, but this is a nice contributor to growth.\u201d\n\nCashing in on wellness\n\nThe North American market has shown it will invest in health, whether it\u2019s Vital Farms\u2019 free-range eggs or Fairlife\u2019s protein-dense milk. Coca-Cola entered the right category at the right time, Citi analyst Filippo Falorni told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou had a more health-conscious consumer in the United States, and particularly with a bigger focus on protein intake over the last couple of years,\u201d Falorni said.\n\nProtein shakes are a $6 billion market, according to Beverage Digest, a global non-alcoholic beverage industry trade publication.\n\nGrocery items in the middle-priced range are often what Americans decide to stop buying, Gajrawala said. Consumers are either looking for the lowest-priced product or are willing to pay a lot more for something that\u2019s differentiated.\n\nFairlife, with its successful branding, has managed to pull off the latter, Gajrawala said. And it also benefits from Coca-Cola\u2019s behemoth distribution system, which Falorni said is arguably the best in the world.\n\nRisks to growth\n\nTikTok users frequently post themselves drinking Core Power before a workout or making a healthier morning iced coffee using Fairlife\u2019s milk.\n\nBut just as quickly as items go viral on social media, they can also fall out of trend, especially in the health and wellness space.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, Fairlife and Coca-Cola agreed to a $21 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit over allegations of inhumane treatment of its cows. The lawsuit claimed consumers were falsely charged a premium because Fairlife promoted well-treated cows.\n\nLast year, Fairlife broke ground on a massive production facility in New York state, but Coca-Cola \u201cis going to look for more categories\u201d to expand its offerings, Falorni said.\n\nCoca-Cola is \u201cvery focused on Fairlife because it\u2019s going very nicely. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to stop there in terms of the portfolio diversification,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Coca-Cola\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.69b US$12.4b US$13.1b US$14.0b US$14.7b US$15.3b US$15.9b US$16.4b US$16.9b US$17.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 4.12% Est @ 3.71% Est @ 3.42% Est @ 3.22% Est @ 3.08% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$3.5k US$11.0k US$10.9k US$11.0k US$10.9k US$10.7k US$10.4k US$10.1k US$9.9k US$9.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$98b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.",

            "content": "The beverage giant remains a sound, evergreen investment.\n\nCoca-Cola's (KO -0.70%) stock rallied about 33% over the past five years, even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the markets. That wasn't surprising, since the beverage giant is often considered an evergreen investment that's well-insulated from economic downturns.\n\nThat's also probably why Warren Buffett has kept Coca-Cola in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio since 1988, and why it's currently the conglomerate's fourth-largest holding. So will Coca-Cola continue to generate steady returns over the next five years?\n\nLet's review its business model, growth rates, and valuations to decide.\n\nWhat happened to Coca-Cola over the past five years?\n\nCoca-Cola might initially seem like a risky investment because soda consumption rates have declined over the past few decades. However, it offset that pressure by acquiring and developing more brands of fruit juices, teas, bottled water, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages in select markets. It also refreshed its flagship sodas with new flavors, healthier versions, and smaller serving sizes to attract new customers.\n\nIn 2020, Coca-Cola's organic sales and comparable earnings per share (EPS) declined as its adjusted free cash flow (FCF) barely grew. That slowdown was largely caused by the pandemic, which throttled its sales to restaurants as more diners stayed at home. It only partly offset that pressure with its stronger retail sales at supermarkets and other retailers.\n\nMetric 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Organic Sales Growth (9%) 16% 16% 12% 12% Adjusted FCF Growth 3% 30% (15%) 2% 11% Comparable EPS Growth (8%) 19% 7% 8% 7%\n\nCoca-Cola's organic sales and comparable EPS bounced back over the following four years as the pandemic headwinds dissipated. Its adjusted FCF dipped in 2022 as it dealt with higher-than-expected taxes, lapped some working capital benefits in 2021, paid out higher incentives, and increased its inventories to hedge against volatile commodity prices. However, its adjusted FCF grew again in 2023 and 2024 as those costs declined and it raised its prices to counter inflation.\n\nWhat will happen to Coca-Cola over the next five years?\n\nFor 2025, Coca-Cola expects its organic sales to grow 5% to 6% as its comparable EPS rises 2% to 3%. At $71 per share, Coca-Cola's stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times the midpoint of that comparable EPS forecast. However, it expects its near-term earnings growth to be throttled by the currency headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, it expects its comparable EPS to rise 8% to 10% this year. It expects its adjusted FCF to dip 12% to $9.5 billion this year as it makes a big tax payment (its final one related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) and ramps up some of its working capital initiatives.\n\nIf interest rates stabilize and decline, the U.S. dollar should soften against other currencies over the next few years. If that happens, and Coca-Cola expands its comparable EPS at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% from the midpoint of its 2025 outlook through 2030, that figure could rise to $3.77 per share by the final year. Assuming it's still trading at 24 times forward earnings, its stock price could potentially rise 27% to roughly $90.48 by the beginning of 2030.\n\nCoca-Cola is also a Dividend King that has raised its dividend annually for 63 consecutive years. It currently pays a forward yield of 2.9%, which might not seem too impressive compared to the 10-year Treasury's 4.3% yield. But its healthy trailing payout ratio of 79% indicates it has plenty of room for future hikes over the next five years.\n\nIt's still an evergreen dividend stock\n\nCoca-Cola's stock won't skyrocket through 2030, but it will remain a reliable evergreen stock for conservative income investors. So if you're looking for a safe stock to buy, hold, and forget in this choppy market, Coca-Cola still checks all the right boxes.",

(It could be all the ice cream floats I made with Orange Fanta as a kid.)\n\nThese days I continue to love it whether it\u2019s in the form of ice cream (remember those classic orange cream push-up pops?), no-bake dream bars, or an Orange Julius. The bright-and-creamy combo always hits. So when I saw that Coca-Cola released an Orange Cream soda (in a Super Bowl commercial), I was eager to give it a try.\n\nCredit: Ali Domrongchai Credit: Ali Domrongchai\n\nWhat You Should Know About Coca-Cola Orange Cream\n\nCoco-Cola\u2019s Orange Cream launch is a twist on the nearly 90-year-old classic (first coined by Popsicle). It has a similar aburn-y color as a classic Coke, with an orange hue, and doesn\u2019t contain any fruit juice or cream. Instead, it gets its vanilla, creamy-orange flavors from a plethora of natural flavors (although, natural flavors can still include chemicals).\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream Soda, 12 Pack\n\nTarget\n\n$7.99\n\nBuy Now\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Orange Cream Cokes officially hit stores on February 10 and are available in both original and sugar-free varieties in 12-packs of 12-ounce cans, 10-pack mini 7.5-ounce cans, and 20-ounce bottles at retailers nationwide, like Target and Walmart.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if this release is part of the permanent lineup or limited-edition. I know for sure that it\u2019ll be around for all of 2025, according to a representative from the brand.\n\nMy Honest Review of Coca-cola Orange Cream\n\nBecause I am such a big orange-cream fan, I was a bit hesitant about this soda, given that it doesn\u2019t contain any orange juice or cream at all. How would I get creamy vanilla notes without any cream? But after my first sip, I was completely (and pleasantly) surprised.\n\nCredit: Ali Domrongchai Credit: Ali Domrongchai\n\nThe iconic brand totally nailed the vanilla-orange flavors. Really! The soda is, of course, bubbly, and still manages to be smooth. I don\u2019t know how Coke did it, but someone on the R&D team deserves a raise. It\u2019s like a can of Vanilla Coca-Cola with a bit of orange flavoring (that gives it a zesty punch!). It\u2019s delicious!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t try the sugar-free version, but my friend did a few weeks ago and is a big fan (TL;DR: It\u2019s near-identical to the original, with a slight aftertaste from the aspartame that other sugar-free drinks tend to have).\n\nI\u2019ll absolutely keep sipping on cans of the Coca-Cola Orange Cream throughout the year. In fact, this might be a bit presumptuous, but I think it\u2019s a contender for the drink of the summer!\n\n\n\nBuy: Coca-Cola Orange Cream, $7.99 for 12 (12-ounce) cans at Target\n\n\n\nHave you tried the new Coca-Cola Orange Cream?

            "content": "Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) rose 12.1% in February 2025, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The soft drink giant published a tasty fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 11, followed by a crowd-pleasing dividend increase on the 20th. The earnings event provided most of the fuel for last month's price gains. Investors would have been more surprised if Coke didn't boost its quarterly payouts for the first time in forever.\n\nCoca-Cola's recipe for Q4 success\n\nQ4 sales rose 6.4% year over year to $11.5 billion. Your average analyst would have settled for $10.7 billion.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nCoca-Cola also reports a unique metric called organic revenues. This figure is not related to the purchase of health-focused beverages by consumers but to core business sales, backing out the effects of currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions, and divestitures. Currency trends and higher ingredient costs constituted modest headwinds in Q4. On the other hand, a large-scale refranchising of bottling operations gave Coca-Cola a revenue boost. Without these puts and takes, organic sales rose 14% year over year.\n\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings rose 12% to $0.55 per share. Here, the analyst consensus stopped at $0.52.\n\nThe company generated $3.2 billion of free cash flows in this quarter and paid out 64% of these cash profits as dividend checks. Calendar quirks result in two dividend payouts falling in Coca-Cola's Q4 with no dividend expenses in Q1, but it's easy enough to do the math to disregard this effect.\n\nOn that note, Coca-Cola boosted its next quarterly dividend payout from $0.485 to $0.51 per share. Payable on April 1 (right after closing the books for Q1), the new full-year payout works out to $2.04 per share. The unbroken streak of annual dividend increases started in 1962.\n\nCoca-Cola investors have come to expect these reliable dividend bumps and would be sorely disappointed if they stopped coming. Master investors Warren Buffett's portfolio collected $704 million of Coca-Cola dividends in 2022, and the payouts keep growing.\n\nNo alarms and no surprises\n\nSo Coca-Cola's business is faring well as usual, more than making up for currency effects with a powerful product gallery and a world-class distribution network. The company is currently expanding its cold drink equipment by 250,000 net new stores and almost 600,000 new beverage coolers. Management sees this expansion as a key business advantage, setting Coca-Cola apart from global and local rivals with less sophisticated bottling and distribution systems.\n\nIf you're interested in adding some Coke stock to your portfolio, the shares are neither expensive nor cheap. Coca-Cola stock trades in a Goldilocks zone of 28 times trailing earnings and 6.5 times sales. The stock may not be a bargain bin deal, but you can lock in that juicy 2.9% dividend yield at a reasonable share price.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Dr. Adrienne Booth Johnson talk about helping in Africa\n\nFULL INTERVIEW: Rev. Dr. Adrienne Booth Johnson talk about helping in Africa\n\nClimbing the corporate ladder wasn't an easy feat for Dr. Johnson. As a single mom in her teens, she had every excuse to give up, but she chose to persevere through adversity.\n\n\"I never let go of my dreams. I knew that someday I was going to be somebody. I knew someday I was going to help somebody,\" said Dr. Johnson.\n\nDr. Johnson wore many hats throughout her early life - wife, mom, corporate executive, and champion of women.\n\nThat's right, in the midst of her already hectic life, she told me she felt called to more, so she jumped on a plane to Africa. During her time over there, she discovered there was a common need among all of the villages she visited- women are in desperate need of sanitary products.\n\n\"I find out where the village is and go meet with the chief of the village or queen mother and talk to people and just find out what they need,\" she says. \"And that's how I found out they need sanitary pads.\"\n\nRather than just giving these women sanitary pads, Dr. Johnson came up with a better idea- she founded WO YE BRA, a non-profit that creates women empowerment programs. The main focus of the programs is teaching women a skill, like sewing, and then teaching them how to leverage universal business practices like marketing, sales, customer relations, and financial literacy.\n\nThe first thing these women learned was how to sew sanitary pads.\n\n\"We give away sanitary pads, so you'll have some, but we also give away sewing machines, fabric\u2026 but most importantly, we teach them and empower them,\" said Dr. Johnson.\n\nIt doesn't stop with WO YE BRA. Dr. Johnson enlisted the help of a girls club at Cass Tech called Great Girls. They cut the fabric for the sanitary pads, and then Dr. Johnson takes it over to Ghana for the girls over there to sew together.\n\n\"I bought fabric, and the girls at Cass Tech cut out the fabric for the sanitary pad, and I took it to Ghana. So I thought about it and said Well, wait a minute\u2026 wouldn't it be great if the girls at Cass Tech saw the girls they actually gave the pads to\u2026 and so I did a Zoom!\" she says.\n\nDr. Johnson was able to connect the girls from Cass Tech with their peers in Ghana. Some of the girls from Cass Tech told me it made the world feel a lot smaller and made their hard work worth it.\n\nDr. Johnson told me she's thrilled to see girls here in Detroit and across the world empowered by hard work, and she hopes she can be an inspiration to other women that no matter the circumstances you're facing now, it doesn't have to be the end of your story.\n\nWhere Your Voice Matters",

This is the case when reviewing the Dividend Aristocrats, a select group of 69 companies in the S&P 500 Index with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n\nWe have created a free Excel list of all 69 Dividend Aristocrats and relevant financial metrics such as P/E ratios and dividend payout ratios.\n\nYou can download the full list by clicking on the link below:\n\nDisclaimer: Sure Dividend is not affiliated with S&P Global in any way.

None of the information in this article or spreadsheet is official data from S&P Global. Consult S&P Global for official information.\n\nWe review all 69 Dividend Aristocrats each year. The 2025 Dividend Aristocrats In Focus series continues with a review of beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company (KO).\n\nNot only is Coca-Cola a Dividend Aristocrat, but it is also a Dividend King. The Dividend Kings have increased their dividends for 50+ consecutive years. You can see all the Dividend Kings here.\n\nRelated: Dogs of the Dow: The Highest Yielding Dow Jones 30 stocks.\n\nIn addition, it has been diversifying away from sparkling beverages in recent years and those efforts have paid off. This article will examine Coca-Cola\u2019s investment prospects in detail.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nCoca-Cola is the world\u2019s largest beverage company, owning or licensing more than 500 unique non-alcoholic brands and 200 master brands.\n\nSince its founding in 1886, the company has expanded to more than 200 countries worldwide. It currently has a market capitalization of more than $300 billion, making it a mega-cap stock.\n\nIts brands account for about 2 billion servings of beverages worldwide every day, producing more than $47 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe sparkling beverage portfolio includes the flagship Coca-Cola brand, as well as other soda brands like Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and more.\n\nThe still beverage portfolio includes water, juices, coffee drinks, and ready-to-drink teas, such as Dasani, Minute Maid, Vitamin Water, and Honest Tea.\n\nSource: Investor Relations\n\nCoca-Cola delivered strong Q4 and full-year 2024 results, with unit case volume up 2% for the quarter and 1% for the year. Net revenues rose 6% in Q4 and 3% annually, while organic revenue grew 14% and 12%, respectively. Operating income increased 19% in Q4 but fell 12% for the year due to one-time charges. Quarterly EPS rose 12% to $0.51, while full-year EPS held at $2.46.\n\nThe company gained market share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sector, expanding its retail presence with 250,000 new outlets and 600,000 new coolers. Returnable glass bottles drove 1.6 billion unit cases, outpacing total volume growth. Sparkling soft drinks rose 2%, led by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, while other beverage segments saw mixed performance.\n\nCash flow from operations was $6.8 billion, down 41% due to a $6 billion IRS tax deposit, with free cash flow at $4.7 billion. Excluding the deposit, free cash flow rose 11% to $10.8 billion. Coca-Cola remains focused on leveraging its scale and distribution network to drive growth in 2025.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nTo return to growth, Coca-Cola has invested heavily outside of soda, in areas like juices, coffee, teas, dairy, and water, to appeal to changing consumer preferences.\n\nDue to the success of its growth initiatives, we continue to see Coca-Cola as having a favorable long-term growth outlook.\n\nOne reason we like the stock is that it competes in an industry that continues to grow globally in excess of the rate of broad economic growth. This leads to strong overall growth in the industry, which Coca-Cola has certainly been capitalizing on in recent years.\n\nIn addition, the ready-to-drink category is sold through highly diversified channels and continues to have mid-single-digit projected growth rates, both for Coca-Cola and the industry.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nThis is particularly true for still beverages like tea, coffee, and water. Coca-Cola\u2019s years-old strategy to diversify away from sparkling beverages is due to this and it is undoubtedly bearing fruit.\n\nCoca-Cola also continues to acquire brands in order to grow, including its acquisition of Costa, a coffee brand based in the UK.\n\nCoca-Cola is doing what it takes to secure its future. In the relatively short time Coca-Cola has owned the coffee brand, it has expanded its offerings, including combining Coca-Cola and coffee in ready-to-drink packages.\n\nConsidering all of this, in addition to the company\u2019s buyback program and productivity improvement efforts, we see total earnings-per-share growth of 7% annually over the next five years.\n\nCompetitive Advantages & Recession Performance\n\nCoca-Cola enjoys two distinct competitive advantages: its strong brand and global scale.\n\nIn addition, Coca-Cola has an unparalleled distribution network. It has the largest beverage distribution system in the world. A new entrant would be hard pressed to recreate this distribution system, even with billions of dollars to invest.\n\nThese advantages allow Coca-Cola to remain highly profitable, even during recessions. The company held up very well during the Great Recession:\n\n2007 earnings-per-share of $1.29\n\n2008 earnings-per-share of $1.51 (17% increase)\n\n2009 earnings-per-share of $1.47 (3% decline)\n\n2010 earnings-per-share of $1.75 (19% increase)\n\nNot only did Coca-Cola survive the Great Recession, but it thrived. Earnings-per-share grew by 36% from 2007 to 2010, which shows the durability and strength of Coca-Cola\u2019s business model.\n\nThe company\u2019s dividend also appears very safe, even after 60 years of consecutive increases. We would expect Coca-Cola to perform well during any future recessions.\n\nValuation & Expected Returns\n\nWe expect Coca-Cola to generate adjusted EPS of $2.95 for 2025. Based on this, Coca-Cola stock trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.8. This is higher than our fair value estimate of 23 times earnings, which means the stock is somewhat under-valued.\n\nAn expanding P/E multiple could decrease annual returns by -0.6% over the next five years.\n\nThe stock will also generate positive returns through future earnings-per-share growth (estimated at 7%) and the 2.8% dividend yield. Combined, we expect total annualized returns of 9.2% through 2030.\n\nOverall, we expect Coca-Cola stock to generate solid shareholder returns at the current share price, and we rate it a hold.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCoca-Cola has made great strides repositioning its portfolio to meet changing consumer tastes. It has built a large portfolio of juices, coffees, and teas, to cater to a more health-conscious consumer.\n\nDiversifying away from sparkling beverages requires more work, but we see solid growth prospects looking ahead.\n\nWe rate the stock a hold, but it remains a strong choice for income investors due to its above-average dividend yield and long history of annual dividend increases.\n\nThese qualities make Coca-Cola a time-tested Dividend Aristocrat, and a blue-chip stock.\n\nAdditionally, the following Sure Dividend databases contain the most reliable dividend growers in our investment universe:\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for stocks with unique dividend characteristics, consider the following Sure Dividend databases:\n\nThe Complete List of Monthly Dividend Stocks: stocks that pay dividends each month, for 12 payments over the year.\n\nThe Blue Chip Stocks List: this database contains stocks that qualify as either Dividend Achievers, Dividend Aristocrats, or Dividend Kings.\n\nThe major domestic stock market indices are another solid resource for finding investment ideas.

            "content": "According to data from Abrdn, it was noted that between December 2002 and December 2022, companies that either increased or initiated dividends achieved a compounded return of 10.68%. In contrast, firms that reduced or discontinued their dividends saw a significantly lower return of 2.70%. In addition, it was highlighted that companies not paying dividends also lagged behind dividend growers, generating a return of 9.25% over the same timeframe.\n\nDividends are a key component of the investment market, with nearly 80% of companies in the broader market distributing payments to shareholders. However, maintaining steady dividend increases is a difficult achievement. Only about 13% of companies in the index qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs The Coca-Cola Company (KO) the Best Sugar Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage company. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 17%. The company has demonstrated its operational resilience through solid organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and consistent EPS gains, even in a challenging market. Despite industry headwinds, including concerns over GLP-1 weight loss drugs, tariffs, currency fluctuations, and inflation, the company has successfully navigated these challenges, reinforcing its standing as a leading player in the sector.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) reported $11.5 billion in revenue, marking a 6.5% year-over-year increase. Organic revenue grew by 14%, driven by a 9% rise in price/mix and a 5% uptick in concentrate sales. Throughout the year, Coca-Cola expanded its market share across its beverage portfolio, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar performing particularly well, posting a 13% increase in unit volume during the quarter. The company\u2019s innovative marketing efforts have played a key role in its success, contributing to roughly $40 billion in retail sales growth for its flagship brand over the past three years.\n\nIn the latest quarter, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) maintained strong cash flow, generating $2.9 billion from operations and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. It also reported a solid adjusted operating margin of 30.7%, highlighting its profitability. With an impressive track record of raising dividends for over 62 consecutive years, KO is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of February 27.\n\nOverall KO ranks 7th on our list of the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

SGU.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Novo Nordisk, Coca-Cola & Wells Fargo\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novo Nordisk A/S, The Coca-Cola Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., as well as a micro-cap stock Star Group, L.P. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company\u2019s failure to meet the weight-loss target with CagriSema caused a huge setback. Intense rivalry in the obesity sector also threatens its market share. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market remain a woe.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Novo Nordisk beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Its diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\n\n\nIt has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments to ramp up production. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. Novo Nordisk is also pursuing other indications like liver fibrosis and MASH for semaglutide.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+19.2% vs. +6.6%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In fourth-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement.\n\n\n\nResults benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. Coca-Cola's all-weather strategy, combining marketing, innovation and revenue growth management, supports its vision of a total beverage company and is expected to drive revenue growth in 2025.\n\n\n\nIt has provided an optimistic view for 2025. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Wells Fargo have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+42.2% vs. +25%). The company\u2019s efforts to strengthen risk management and compliance infrastructure continue to be the mainstay of its operational strategy, as seen by the resolution of ten regulatory consent orders since 2019.\n\n\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s progress on efficiency initiatives, such as branch and footprint reduction, will support expense reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to support its financials.\n\n\n\nYet, its loan growth is expected to be limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators\u2019 demands regarding operational risk management. This, along with lower origination, is expected to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term. Yet, its decent liquidity position will keep the capital distribution move sustainable in the long term.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)\n\n\n\nStar Group\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+26.6% vs. -44.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $451.79 million have seen first-quarter net income surged $19.9 million year over year to $32.9 million, driven by a $24.3 million favorable derivative movement, offsetting revenue declines and higher taxes.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA rose $2.8 million to $51.9 million, supported by acquisitions and margin expansion. Home heating oil and propane volumes grew 2.8% to 82.4 million gallons due to colder weather and acquisitions. Service and installation revenues rose 11.4% year over year to $88.6 million, enhancing stability.\n\n\n\nHowever, revenues fell 7.6% to $488.1 million as lower selling prices offset volume gains. The base business volume declined 4.7%, signaling organic weakness. Customer attrition hit 4.3%, with lower gross gains. Operating expenses rose 5.3% due to acquisitions, pressuring margins. Regulatory risks, pricing pressure and competition are challenging, while management remains cautious about distributions.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Star Group here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "The great thing about motorsports is that you\u2019ll never hear all of the stories. I love racing in almost every form and have been privileged enough to meet some of the all-time greats, and yet every time I\u2019m in a room with racers there\u2019s always something new to learn. For instance, I thought I knew a lot about the famous Porsche Coca-Cola livery, but I didn\u2019t know why it came to exist in the first place.\n\nIs the Coca-Cola paint scheme the most iconic livery in American sports car racing? It\u2019s up there, certainly, along with the red-white-and-blue Bob Hall Datsuns and the IMSA Toyota colors. If you\u2019re less of a racing fan, the Apple-sponsored Porsche 935 is also a big deal. I definitely believe Bobby Akin when he says in this latest episode of \u201cMy Porsche Story\u201d that it\u2019s the most photographed IMSA car of the era.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know anything about racing to get excited about the Coca-Cola swish and that instantly recognizable bright \u201cCoke Red\u201d color. The Domino\u2019s Pizza squares make it even more unforgettable. Years of advertising will generate a Pavlovian response in even the most media-phobic among us.\n\nI\u2019d always assumed that the reason this car existed was simply that Coca-Cola decided to sponsor a race car as that\u2019s usually what happens. The reality is a little more interesting, though.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs Akin explains, his dad Bob Akin had started out in vintage racing before deciding to buy a Porsche 911 RSR and try his hand at Daytona. He did well enough that he attempted more races, including Le Mans, and his natural talent led him quickly into the ranks of the professionals.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just his talent that led to the Coca-Cola partnerships, as his son Bobby Akin explains:\n\n\u201cDaytona International Raceway, built by the France Family, really came to fruition because of several partners. One of those partners was a guy named Chapman Root. The Root family owned the Coca-Cola bottling franchise for most of the South. Somebody at NASCAR decided it would be a great idea to sell the sponsorship rights to the Daytona Speedway to Pepsi. Champan Root was not happy. The 24-Hour was the first race to happen at Daytona under the Pepsi sponsorship. Root wanted a car on the front row that first race to be covered in Coca-Cola Red. And that\u2019s how it began. My dad got a phone call one day and [Root] said \u201cBob Akin, I want to sponsor your race car.\u201d\n\nThat car was a Porsche 935 and it did its job. Technically, the deal was over, but Akin thought the Porsche looked great and having Coca-Cola\u2019s name on it would help him get more sponsored. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with Coca-Cola?\n\n\u201cFive or six races in we\u2019re at Road Atlanta and this guy walks up to my dad and says \u2018Hi, are you the team owner?\u2019 and my dad says \u2018Yes\u2019 and he says \u201cWell, I work for Coa-Cola, and you can\u2019t just use our brand on your car without permission. But we like it! Come see us on Monday after the Atlanta race and we\u2019ll work something out.\u2019 And they did, and that sponsorship went on, I think, for 12 years.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in this video about the Porsche 962 that is the most recognizable version of this livery. Bob Akin, unfortunately, died after a bad crash testing out a vintage race car at Road Atlanta in 2002, which is why Bobby is sharing the story.\n\nAs a funny footnote to all of this, back when I worked in video production at TangentVector we were tasked with making a video about the first modern use of Coca-Cola on a Porsche race car, which features a literal head-nod to the #5 Porsche 962:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more history about Bob and the car in the My Porsche story so please enjoy. And if you like that, check out the other ones.\n\nTop photo: Porsche",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmerican consumers don\u2019t need to fret about President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on aluminum raising the price of their can of soda.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States that would go into effect March 12, worrying some soda drinkers that another staple will take more out of their wallet.\n\nBut shortly after the executive order, beverage companies began assessing what the tariffs could mean for their industry \u2014 and the results weren\u2019t too concerning.\n\nCoca-Cola CEO James Quincey suggested the company could move away from using aluminum and increase production of other packaging materials to ensure affordability and meet consumer demand.\n\n\u201cIf aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on (plastic) bottles,\u201d Quincey said in the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on February 11.\n\nThe tariffs will likely have almost no impact on consumer prices, according to Adam S. Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cCorporations have more than sufficient profit margins to absorb small price increases to a small input to production,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2023, data showed the Coca-Cola Company packaged almost 50% of its drinks in plastic bottles, 25% in aluminum cans, and the remaining 25% in glass bottles and other packaging. Data from Keurig DrPepper showed they packaged 27% of their drinks in plastic bottles, 13% in aluminum cans and 8% in glass.\n\nQuincey also made clear that while tariffs on aluminum will likely result in an extra cost, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on beverage corporations the size of Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system. It\u2019s not insignificant, but it\u2019s not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar US business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost. It will have to be managed. It would be better not to have it relative to the business, but we are going to manage our way through.\u201d\n\nA can costs a little bit less than 4 cents to produce, according to Hersh. \u201cIf we put a 25% tariff on that, it would raise the cost of the can to 5 cents,\u201d he said, adding that it would increase the production cost of a six-pack by 6 cents.\n\nInvestors largely agree aluminum tariffs won\u2019t result in significant cost hikes as share prices of beverage corporations have been relatively stable since they were announced, according to Hersh.\n\nBottlers drive packaging decisions\n\nMost beverage corporations outsource packaging to bottlers, and it is the bottlers who purchase raw aluminum and ultimately decide on pricing and strategy, says Filippo Falorni, a beverage analyst at Citi.\n\nCoca-Cola sells its concentrate to bottlers, who mix it with water and package it on production lines that are interchangeable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to change production lines from cans to bottles,\u201d Falorni said.\n\nCoca-Cola products at a grocery store in Miami Beach, Florida, in May 2022. Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nIncreasing the use of plastic packaging instead of aluminum is primarily a cost-mitigation strategy, given the ease of switching production lines \u2014 and not necessarily because of prohibitively high aluminum prices, he said.\n\nBut switching to other kinds of packaging might be more complicated for smaller beverage companies and ones that package in-house, as CNN previously reported.\n\nMoving away from aluminum cans can be \u201ca colossal decision,\u201d and it \u201cnormally takes a period of years to make a transition like that successfully,\u201d said William Pietersen, a professor at Columbia Business School and former CEO of Lever Foods, Seagram USA and Tropicana.\n\nSince Trump announced the new tariffs, aluminum prices have climbed over 4%, which Hersh called \u201crelatively stable.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users (CAMMU) said 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum could directly harm domestic manufacturers.\n\n\u201cRe-imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from our allies and without a workable exclusion process puts U.S. manufacturers directly in harm\u2019s way,\u201d according to a statement from CAMMU.\n\n\u201cForeign customers are shifting their supply chains away from U.S. producers. Once removed, especially for smaller, family-owned businesses, it is difficult to regain that lost business,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nIn 2024, the United States imported about 47% of the aluminum consumed domestically, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nDifferent strategies\n\nBut when combining the tariffs from Trump\u2019s first term, the price of aluminum traded on the market and the domestic production of aluminum have seen a real impact in recent years, Falorni said.\n\nWithin the beverage industry, companies adapt to price hikes in different ways.\n\nCompanies like Coca-Cola, with only 25% of their revenue coming from the United States, can offset rising costs by leveraging earnings from other markets.\n\nThis flexibility makes the company less vulnerable to aluminum tariffs than companies like Keurig Dr Pepper, which relies heavily on the US market and is more exposed to domestic price fluctuations, Falorni said.\n\nWhile about a quarter of Coca-Cola products come in aluminum cans, consumers are also accustomed to plastic and glass bottles.\n\nEnergy drinks like Monster and seltzers like White-Claw are predominantly sold in cans, with few viable alternatives. For these brands, shifting to other materials could hurt demand, leaving them with little choice but to pass higher costs on to consumers, according to Falorni.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nWhile switching to plastic and glass packaging would have a minor financial impact on soft-drink companies like Coca-Cola, it could be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the environment, according to Judith Enck, the president of Beyond Plastics and a former regional administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cAny significant shift toward more plastic bottles is a huge environmental problem,\u201d Enck told CNN.\n\nRefillable glass containers are the most sustainable packaging option for beverage companies, followed by aluminum cans (because they can be easily recycled) and then single-use glass bottles. Plastic is one of the least sustainable, as about 16,000 chemicals are used to produce plastics, according to Enck.\n\nCoca-Cola bottles are the world\u2019s No. 1 source of plastic pollution. In December, the company announced a drastic reduction of its packaging sustainability goals.\n\nBeverage corporations likely won\u2019t feel much blowback from the Trump administration should they choose less sustainable packaging.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is sending a very clear message that they do not prioritize environmental protection,\u201d Enck said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think big companies feel any pressure to change.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.",

In addition to its namesake brand, Coca-Cola also owns a wide range of other soft drink products, ranging from soda to iced tea to energy drinks, and it even branched out into restaurants for the first time with its 2019 acquisition of the Costa Coffee chain.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nCoca-Cola is known as a recession-proof dividend stock that's capable of delivering steady growth over the long term, and its latest earnings report indicated that its reputation remains intact.\n\nUnit case volume rose 2% year over year in the quarter, driving revenue up 6%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 12%, benefiting from limited edition flavors and price hikes.\n\nThe report was strong enough for one Wall Street analyst to take notice and upgrade their rating on the stock.\n\nErste Group upgrades Coca-Cola\n\nErste Group upgraded Coca-Cola from hold to buy. Analyst Stephan Lingnau noted that Coke's profitability is higher than that of its competitors, based on metrics like operating margin and return on equity. He's also bullish on the impact of new products like probiotic lemonades, which he believes will help drive the company's revenue growth.\n\nIs Coca-Cola a buy?\n\nThere's no question that Coca-Cola is executing well, and the company seems to have put earlier concerns about stalling growth behind it. The stock has climbed about 17% in the past year and is less than 5% shy of its all-time high as of this writing.\n\nThat also means Coca-Cola stock is expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29. Its upside potential might seem limited here, but this is a Dividend King that offers a 2.9% yield. And it's likely to remain the leader in the beverage industry for another generation.\n\nStocks like that tend to trade at a premium. For investors seeking a stable, generous dividend, Coca-Cola looks like a good bet.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nSALFIT, West Bank -- Order a Coke to wash down some hummus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank these days and chances are the waiter will shake his head disapprovingly -- or worse, mutter \"shame, shame\" in Arabic -- before suggesting the popular local alternative: a can of Chat Cola.\n\nChat Cola -- its red tin and sweeping white script bearing remarkable resemblance to the iconic American soft drink's logo -- has seen its products explode in popularity across the occupied West Bank in the past year as Palestinian consumers, angry at America's steadfast support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, protest with their pocketbooks.\n\n\"No one wants to be caught drinking Coke,\" said Mad Asaad, 21, a worker at the bakery-cafe chain Croissant House in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which stopped selling Coke after the war erupted. \"Everyone drinks Chat now. It's sending a message.\"\n\nSince Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.\n\nHere in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf -- or pull them altogether.\n\n\"When people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\" Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \"I'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\"\n\nWith the \"buy local\" movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023.\n\nWhile the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola's market share.\n\n\"Chat used to be a specialty product, but from what we've seen, it dominates the market,\" said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks.\n\nBut workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi.\n\nHe declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"It's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,\" Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. \"After Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased earlier last month as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region.\n\nWith orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad.\n\nHired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation.\n\n\"We had to take advantage of the opportunity,\" he said of the company's new \"Palestinian taste\" logo and national flag-hued merchandise.\n\nIn its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.\n\nAt the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer's sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\n\"Quality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\" said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \"If it's not good quality, the boycott won't stick.\"\n\nChat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke's -- just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.\n\nIn 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law.\n\nIn the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \"family size\" packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility.\n\nStill, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective -- to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands -- only exacerbates the conflict.\n\n\"BDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don't help to bring people together,\" said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. \"The kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.\"\n\nWhile Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel -- sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait -- it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more.\n\nDeliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola's West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax -- half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.\n\nFor nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAmong the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next door for a can of Coke.\n\n\"It's very frustrating,\" said Asaad, the worker. \"We want to be self-sufficient. But we're not.\"\n\nFahed Arar, general manager of the Chat Cola Company poses next to an advertisement billboard with the companies brands and reads \"the Palestinian taste,\" in the Palestinian company's bottling plant, in the West Bank city of Salfit, Feb. 13, 2025.

            "content": "The story goes that Atlanta pharmacist John Stith Pemberton was the first person to invent anything like Coca-Cola, which he began to sell in 1886. Although Coke has a closely guarded recipe, it was actually inspired by another drink. Le vin Mariani (Mariani wine) was created by Angelo Mariani in Corsica in 1863. A health tonic that contained wine, cocaine, brandy, and sugar, it had fans around the globe, including A-listers like Queen Victoria, Mark Twain, and even Pope Leo XIII, who served as a sort of celebrity endorser of the drink. You could say that Mariani wine was nearly as popular in its time as Coca-Cola is today! But its success faded, and by the mid-1960's the original product was no longer sold.\n\nFamous as Mariani wine once was, it's hard to find any physical traces of it that predate the invention of Coca-Cola. A bottle in the National Museum of American History's collection, for instance, only dates to 1914. Then, in 2014, someone found a bottle in Corsica that dates to 1880, six years before Coke was invented. The bottle's contents were analyzed by the CNRS, a respected national scientific organization in France, which found that the formula was close to Coca-Cola. Further evidence that Pemberton was inspired by Mariani Wine is that his first soda company was called Pemberton's French Coca Wine.\n\nThe (re)discovery that Coca-Cola was inspired by Mariani Wine (which has re-branded as Coca Mariani) caused shockwaves in the French press, but far less of a commotion in the U.S. Still, many websites (including the National Museum of American History) and sources from both countries now acknowledge the connection. That said, Mariani Wine isn't currently mentioned on Coca Cola's official website.",

The following companies may not outperform other growth stocks, but as a shareholder, you can feel confident knowing that tens of millions of people are consuming their products year-round. And the high margins they generate from sales fund generous dividend payments to their shareholders.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's leading beverage company. Every day, the people of the world consume more than 2.2 billion servings of its products. With dozens of different brands, the company generates healthy margins that have fueled growing dividend payments for many years and will continue to do so.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nCoca-Cola has been around since 1886, so it has a long track record showing it can navigate through varying economic conditions, including periods of high inflation or weak consumer spending. It's not a high-growth business at this point -- its revenue has only grown by about 6% over the last decade. Still, the stock can deliver returns close to the market averages over time.\n\nThe non-alcoholic beverage market is worth $1.6 trillion, according to Statista. Coke has a strong distribution network that positions it well to capture opportunities in emerging markets. The company also benefits from its large portfolio of brands across the water (Dasani), tea (Fuze), coffee (Costa), and energy drink (Powerade) categories, so it can serve a wide range of consumer preferences.\n\nCoca-Cola still sees areas where it can drive higher sales through impulse purchases. Coke products are available in 33 million outlets worldwide, which speaks to the brand's ubiquity. It added nearly 600,000 coolers to its system last year, where management sees cold consumption as one of the biggest opportunities to grow sales.\n\nThe stock is up 14% year to date, but its dividend yield of 2.7% suggests investors are still getting solid value that should set up solid long-term total returns.\n\n2. McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's(NYSE: MCD) is another strong brand that has delivered solid returns for decades to investors. It has more than 43,000 locations worldwide, with local managers footing the bills for expenses through the company's franchise model. This provides the company with high margins and powers dividend growth for shareholders.\n\nWeak consumer spending trends made 2024 a challenging year for the fast-food giant. Global comparable sales fell 0.1%, but McDonald's focus on offering more value to customers is helping the brand stay competitive in a crowded quick-service restaurant industry. The company is on track to grow its restaurant base to 50,000 by 2027, which should lead to higher sales and earnings.\n\nMcDonald's has had success with its digital ordering experience. It is aiming to grow its 90-day active customer base from 170 million to 250 million over the next three years. McDonald's generated $30 billion in systemwide sales from members of its loyalty program last year -- 23% of total sales. By 2027, the company hopes to grow that figure to $45 billion.\n\nIt's a lot easier to produce solid financial results when you have hundreds of millions of customers making repeat purchases. Over the last year, McDonald's generated $8.2 billion of net income on $25.9 billion of revenue. That revenue was generated from a small base of company-operated stores, plus fees from franchise owners. The company paid $4.8 billion of that net income in dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe stock offers an above-average dividend yield of 2.2% and trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 -- a discount to the S&P 500's average P/E of 30. Investing in McDonald's won't make you rich overnight, but you can expect the stock to deliver solid returns on par with the S&P 500 over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Coca-Cola HBC AG ( ) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Coca-Cola HBC's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2024 Coca-Cola HBC had \u20ac3.73b of debt, an increase on \u20ac3.21b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of \u20ac2.43b, its net debt is less, at about \u20ac1.29b.\n\nHow Healthy Is Coca-Cola HBC's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Coca-Cola HBC had liabilities of \u20ac3.91b falling due within a year, and liabilities of \u20ac3.44b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of \u20ac2.43b as well as receivables valued at \u20ac1.25b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling \u20ac3.67b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Coca-Cola HBC is worth a massive \u20ac14.8b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nCoca-Cola HBC's net debt is only 0.82 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 70.1 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Also positive, Coca-Cola HBC grew its EBIT by 23% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Coca-Cola HBC can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Coca-Cola HBC produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 75% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nCoca-Cola HBC's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Coca-Cola HBC's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. We'd be very excited to see if Coca-Cola HBC insiders have been snapping up shares.

In addition to its namesake brand, Coca-Cola also owns a wide range of other soft drink products, ranging from soda to iced tea to energy drinks, and it even branched out into restaurants for the first time with its 2019 acquisition of the Costa Coffee chain.\n\nCoca-Cola is known as a recession-proof dividend stock that's capable of delivering steady growth over the long term, and its latest earnings report indicated that its reputation remains intact.\n\nUnit case volume rose 2% year over year in the quarter, driving revenue up 6%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 12%, benefiting from limited edition flavors and price hikes.\n\nThe report was strong enough for one Wall Street analyst to take notice and upgrade their rating on the stock.\n\nErste Group upgrades Coca-Cola\n\nErste Group upgraded Coca-Cola from hold to buy. Analyst Stephan Lingnau noted that Coke's profitability is higher than that of its competitors, based on metrics like operating margin and return on equity. He's also bullish on the impact of new products like probiotic lemonades, which he believes will help drive the company's revenue growth.\n\nIs Coca-Cola a buy?\n\nThere's no question that Coca-Cola is executing well, and the company seems to have put earlier concerns about stalling growth behind it. The stock has climbed about 17% in the past year and is less than 5% shy of its all-time high as of this writing.\n\nThat also means Coca-Cola stock is expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29. Its upside potential might seem limited here, but this is a Dividend King that offers a 2.9% yield. And it's likely to remain the leader in the beverage industry for another generation.\n\nStocks like that tend to trade at a premium.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, on Thursday, shared his thoughts on the market\u2019s volatility following President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements and provided insights into which sectors and stocks could weather the impact of these new trade policies.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Thoughts on 8 Stocks As He Discussed Market Froth and Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 10 Stocks\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is out there fighting inflation every day except not the way we want him to do it. He\u2019s fighting inflation, not in the mall, not in the supermarket, but in the stock market.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump is attempting to reduce prices in the market by gradually bringing down stock values, noting that if the current trend continues, we may eventually see stock prices return to pre-COVID levels.\n\nCramer also identified stocks he believes could be relatively insulated from the negative effects of these tariffs. He emphasized that these are the companies whose values are not directly impacted by the primary reason many stocks are struggling, tariffs. The protected stocks, according to Cramer, can maintain their worth even if additional tariffs are imposed on other countries. Cramer\u2019s list was aimed at those seeking stability in an uncertain market environment, where the next country to be hit with tariffs remains unclear. He went on to say:\n\n\u201cStarting with tech first. Nothing that can be sold to China has a chance to get out of this thing unscathed. Nothing that has parts made in Taiwan can hold its value. Nothing that\u2019s crafted in China can stay up. If we can\u2019t be sure where the next tariff is gonna land, we can\u2019t own these stocks until they go lower and then we can.\u201d\n\nTurning to the transportation sector, Cramer was blunt in his assessment. He pointed out that transportation stocks are closely tied to global commerce, which in turn is directly affected by tariffs. With tariffs raising the cost of goods, Cramer argued, global trade will slow, which will negatively impact businesses across the board. He highlighted the general economic principle that raising prices leads to reduced sales, making the transportation sector vulnerable to these market shifts. When it came to the auto industry, Cramer described the situation as a tough one.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio.\n\nCouch Potato investing is the concept of having a portfolio of assets that operate almost entirely on autopilot. This portfolio is intended to withstand shifting market circumstances without needing investors to make major modifications to their asset allocation or objectives. In 1991, Scott Burns came up with the idea, seeking to construct the simplest investment strategy possible: a 50/50 combination of equities and bonds using only two funds. Burns claims that this makes it possibly the most accessible portfolio available, stating that anyone who \u201ccan divide by 2\u201d can understand it.\n\nBarclays calculated the weighted average returns of hedge fund portfolios by investor type, which ranged from 10% to 11%. Based on performance, a conventional 60/40 portfolio model would have comfortably outperformed these gains. According to the Lazy Portfolio ETF, a 60% stock/40% bond strategy incorporating the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Total Bond Market Index Fund would have returned little less than 15% in 2024. Even after 5 years, including 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell in value, the 60/40 method has an average return of 8%. In essence, couch potato investing is a more conservative version of the 60/40 method. More importantly, its dependability shines through in difficult circumstances. For example, between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 sank 43.1%, whereas the couch potato portfolio declined just 6.3%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, one possible downside of the couch potato portfolio is that it tends to underperform during notable market upswings. Portfolios with a larger allocation to equities can better capitalize on bullish markets, resulting in higher returns than the more conservative couch potato strategy. This disparity is especially prominent when the proportion of shares in a portfolio exceeds the couch potato approach\u2019s balanced 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds. However, Burns recommends that investors evaluate this strategy comprehensively.\n\n\u201cYour 35-year portfolio, for instance, was worth $884,481 at the end of 2021 and declined $155,601 during 2022. That\u2019s a loss greater than the original $100,000 value. But so what? The portfolio is way larger than expected or needed. The good news here is that the historical evidence shows, once again, that we can get through some pretty hard times if we keep our investments simple and cheap.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nAlthough couch potato investing discourages individual stock trading in favor of index investment, we chose to examine the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and identified some of its best holdings for this list. These equities were then filtered down further based on many parameters, including the hedge fund sentiment around them, a history of stable dividend payments, and well-established businesses.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a multinational beverage company that sells in over 200 countries. The corporation manufactures, develops, and distributes a wide range of nonalcoholic beverages, and has progressed far beyond soda and pop. Coca-Cola\u2019s brands include Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite, and others.\n\nIn Q4 2024, the company recorded revenues of $11.5 billion, a 6.5% increase over the previous year. Organic revenue also increased by 14%, thanks to a 9% jump in price/mix and a 5% increase in concentrate sales. In addition, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) generated decent cash flow, with $2.9 billion in operations and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. It also maintained a respectable adjusted operating margin of 30.7%, indicating strong profitability.\n\nOn February 26, Erste Group analysts raised Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) from Hold to Buy, highlighting the beverage giant\u2019s strong profitability and positive future prospects. The company expects organic sales growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year, building on its strong market position. This predicted rise is due in part to the launch of new goods, such as probiotic lemonades, which are expected to drive sales growth throughout the year.\n\nOverall, KO ranks 7th on our list of best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio.

It's sending a message.\"\n\nSince Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.\n\nHere in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf -- or pull them altogether.\n\n\"When people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\" Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \"I'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\"\n\nWith the \"buy local\" movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023.\n\nWhile the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola's market share.\n\n\"Chat used to be a specialty product, but from what we've seen, it dominates the market,\" said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks.\n\nBut workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi.\n\nHe declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"It's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,\" Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. \"After Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased earlier last month as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region.\n\nWith orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad.\n\nHired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation.\n\n\"We had to take advantage of the opportunity,\" he said of the company's new \"Palestinian taste\" logo and national flag-hued merchandise.\n\nIn its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.\n\nAt the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer's sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\n\"Quality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\" said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \"If it's not good quality, the boycott won't stick.\"\n\nChat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke's -- just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.\n\nIn 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law.\n\nIn the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \"family size\" packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility.\n\nStill, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective -- to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands -- only exacerbates the conflict.\n\n\"BDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don't help to bring people together,\" said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. \"The kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.\"\n\nWhile Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel -- sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait -- it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more.\n\nDeliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola's West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax -- half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.\n\nFor nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAmong the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next door for a can of Coke.\n\n\"It's very frustrating,\" said Asaad, the worker. \"We want to be self-sufficient. But we're not.\"\n\nFahed Arar, general manager of the Chat Cola Company poses next to an advertisement billboard with the companies brands and reads \"the Palestinian taste,\" in the Palestinian company's bottling plant, in the West Bank city of Salfit, Feb. 13, 2025.

            "content": "For my fellow Diet Coke devotees, chances are you\u2019ve probably found yourself diving into the world of viral DC trends at least once. Maybe you\u2019ve dared to sip the infamous Protein Diet Coke (a blend of a protein shake and Diet Coke) or tested Tom Hanks' far more sophisticated concoction of Diet Coke and Champagne. Both, I have to say, are delicious.\n\nBut the latest Diet Coke experiment? Well, it\u2019s a little more...briny.\n\nDua Lipa's Spicy Diet Coke Trend\n\nThe latest viral Diet Coke trend comes courtesy of pop star Dua Lipa, who unknowingly set the internet ablaze with a drink she mixed up at a restaurant in Austin, Texas, during the ACL Music Festival. Her concoction: a Diet Coke mixed with pickled jalape\u00f1o juice and dill pickle juice.\n\nThe trend quickly picked up, and soon we saw all sorts of stars, from Hoda Kotb to Gordon Ramsay trying it out for themselves online, each time followed by mixed reviews.\n\nAs a Diet Coke enthusiast\u2014and someone who unapologetically snacks on pickles straight from the jar while standing in my kitchen\u2014I knew I had to try this immediately. But, before diving into the taste test, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge a universal truth among Diet Coke fans: not all Diet Cokes are created equal.\n\nAt the very top of the pyramid is the extra-chilled can of Diet Coke that has been marinating in the fridge for at least a week\u2014we're talking excruciatingly cold. I will also give honorable mention to the glass bottle, so long as it\u2019s been properly chilled. Coming in second place is the Diet Coke fountain drink. It needs to come out of the faucet so crispy that it practically sparkles out of my plastic cup. Ice to liquid ratio is also important here; the ice should complement the drink, not overpower it. Finishing in third place is a plastic bottle of Diet Coke\u2014a last resort only consumed in the most desperate of times.\n\nFor this experiment, I had to give Dua\u2019s mix a fair shot, which meant reaching for the elite option: a can of Diet Coke that had been patiently chilling in my fridge for three weeks. Off to a promising start.\n\nThe viral video doesn\u2019t reveal exact measurements (she pours the juices straight from deli containers), so I did my best to approximate:\n\n1 ice-cold can of Diet Coke\n\nA splash of pickled jalape\u00f1o juice\n\nA splash of dill pickle juice\n\nAllrecipes\n\nSpicy Diet Coke Isn\u2019t Anything Like I Thought It Would Be\n\nI\u2019ll be honest\u2014it wasn\u2019t love at first sip.\n\nI typically prefer my Diet Coke with a lime garnish, so this was a wild departure from my usual order First impressions: The heat from the jalape\u00f1o juice is instant and lingers at the back of the throat for longer than expected. It\u2019s spicy in a way that sneaks up on you, and even minutes later, I could still feel my tongue on fire.\n\nThat said, the jalape\u00f1o juice cuts through the soda\u2019s sweetness in a way that\u2019s oddly pleasant. The pickle juice adds a tangy, briny punch, and the sodium delivers a convincing (if false) sense of hydration. Dare I say this could actually revive me on the morning after a night out? Gatorade Zero Glacier Freeze, your days might be numbered.\n\nOne last notable observation: The combination of Diet Coke\u2019s signature fizz and the added juices creates a layer of foam that takes a few minutes to settle, which creates a minor inconvenience for sipping.\n\nDua Lipa, you might be onto something here\u2014might being the key word. While this spicy-salty-sweet creation was a unique experience, I won\u2019t be swapping out my usual lime garnish anytime soon. But if you\u2019re feeling adventurous and in need of a bold, briny wake-up call, it\u2019s worth a sip. At the very least, it\u2019s proof that Diet Coke\u2019s devoted fanbase will never stop experimenting.\n\n",

            "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the Coca-Cola HBC AG (LON:CCH) share price is 113% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. In more good news, the share price has risen 20% in thirty days. We note that Coca-Cola HBC reported its financial results recently; luckily, you can catch up on the latest revenue and profit numbers in our company report.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Coca-Cola HBC\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nCoca-Cola HBC was able to grow its EPS at 15% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 29% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nLSE:CCH Earnings Per Share Growth March 1st 2025\n\nWe know that Coca-Cola HBC has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Coca-Cola HBC, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Coca-Cola HBC has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 40% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola HBC better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company has signed a five-year lease for this location, with a monthly rent of approximately \u20b935 lakh. This move signifies Tesla's commitment to entering the Indian market, with plans for a second showroom in Delhi's Aerocity also underway.\n\n2)New sports drink in town\n\nCoca-Cola is expanding its presence in India's sports drink market with two notable initiatives. First, the company is introducing its global sports drink brand, BodyArmorLyte, this summer. BodyArmorLyte is a coconut water-based hydration beverage rich in electrolytes.\n\nAdditionally, Coca-Cola is extending its indigenous brand, Limca, into the hydrating sports drink category. This marks the first brand extension for Limca, aiming to leverage its existing market presence to cater to consumers seeking hydration solutions.\n\n3)Leo x Rolex\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has officially become a brand ambassador for Rolex, aligning his environmental advocacy with the luxury watchmaker's diverse initiatives. The partnership was subtly revealed in a recent Rolex commercial and is highlighted on the brand's website, where DiCaprio is described as a \"Hollywood icon and climate champion.\"\n\nThis collaboration follows DiCaprio's longstanding appreciation for Rolex timepieces, including his recent appearance wearing a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona ref. 116509 \"Racing\" at a Los Angeles Lakers game.\n\nShare The Advertiser's Almanac\n\nMARKETING TERM OF THE WEEK - CAC\n\nCAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is basically how much money a business spends to get a new customer. Imagine you start a lemonade stand. If you spend \u20b9100 on ads, free samples, and posters to attract 10 customers, your CAC is \u20b910 per customer. The goal is to keep CAC low while getting lots of customers.\n\nA good CAC depends on the business. If a company makes \u20b9500 from a customer and spends \u20b950 to acquire them, that\u2019s great! But if they spend \u20b9500 to get a customer who only pays \u20b9400, they\u2019re losing money.\n\nMARKETING CAMPAIGN OF THE WEEK\n\nThis Coca-Cola ad is smartly tapping into the excitement of an India vs. Pakistan cricket match, one of the most intense rivalries in sports. The message is simple: halftime isn't just a break\u2014it\u2019s \"Coke Time.\" By linking their product to a key moment in the game, Coca-Cola encourages fans to grab a Coke and make halftime more enjoyable. It\u2019s a classic example of moment marketing, using a big cultural event to drive engagement and sales.\n\nShare The Advertiser's Almanac\n\nMARKETING QUESTION OF THE WEEK",

The findings were made public on Feb. 26 as part of a lawsuit filed in California district court alleging Fairlife also polluted nearby waterways.\n\nARM\u2019s six-month investigation revealed abuse from employees, including top managers, with animals being hit, dragged, whipped, shot, shoved, force-fed and chained at Rainbow Valley and Butterfield Dairy farms in Buckeye, Arizona.\n\nIn a statement, Fairlife said the dairy offering has \u201czero tolerance for animal abuse,\u201d adding that supplier United Dairymen of Arizona \u201chas suspended delivery of milk from these facilities\" to all of its customers. The brand added it operates as a milk processor and does not own farms or cows, though it requires its suppliers to follow \u201cstringent\u201d animal welfare standards.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Arizona investigation is the latest animal abuse allegation to hit Coca-Cola\u2019s fast-growing milk brand.\n\nIn 2023, ARM alleged that Fairlife was continuing to source milk from two Indiana dairy farms \u2014 Windy Ridge Dairy and Windy Too Dairy \u2014 where cows were subjected to animal abuse.\n\nThe Indiana farms were previously exposed for similar acts of animal cruelty by ARM in 2019. Coca-Cola and other parties agreed to pay $21 million to settle lawsuits in 2022 for falsely advertising their Fairlife ultra-filtered milk came from humanely treated cows.\n\n\u201cWhile Fairlife admits to failures in oversight, we have little faith that anything will change in the long run,\" ARM founder Richard Couto, said of the investigation in Arizona. \"This isn\u2019t an isolated issue \u2013 it\u2019s systemic, and Fairlife\u2019s response is just another attempt to cover up the truth.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012, Fairlife has surpassed $1 billion in annual retail sales. Coca-Cola, which initially owned a minority position in Fairlife through a joint venture with Select Milk Producers, acquired the remaining stake in 2020.\n\nKnown for its ultra-filtered milk made with 50% more protein and half as much sugar as regular milk, Fairlife has been a blockbuster brand for Coca-Cola. James Quincey, the company\u2019s CEO, said in December that Fairlife has \u201cgood profitability\u201d and \u201ctremendous growth prospects.\u201d Coca-Cola is expected to open later this year a $650 million facility in New York that will serve as Fairlife's flagship Northeast location.\n\nIn its annual stewardship report released last April, Fairlife said it has invested, along with its suppliers, nearly $30 million in its animal welfare program. It also noted that its supplier farms \u201cundergo regular, third-party audits, ensuring the highest levels of animal care and the highest quality products.\u201d\n\nUnited Dairymen of Arizona said in a statement that each of its farm members participate in a national animal welfare initiative and that the group itself provides dairy employees with skills and knowledge on the proper way to treat animals.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked and saddened by the behavior depicted in the recently released videos,\u201d UDA said, noting it is looking into the circumstances shown in the videos. \u201cThere is no place within our cooperative, or in our society, for mistreatment of animals.\u201d\n\nSo far, the prior allegations haven\u2019t hurt Fairlife. In 2024, it was the leading white milk brand in the U.S. based on sales growth of about 28%, according to data from Statista.",

With a market cap of $304.5 billion , Coca-Cola is renowned for its extensive portfolio of iconic brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta, which cater to a diverse global audience.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as \u201cmega-cap stocks,\u201d Coca-Cola firmly holds its place in this elite category. As consumer preferences evolve, Coca-Cola\u2019s ability to innovate, whether through new product offerings, sustainable initiatives, or strategic marketing - ensures its continued relevance.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nKO stock is trading 3.6% below its 52-week high of $73.53 , achieved recently on Sept. 4. Shares of Coca-Cola have gained 10% over the past three months, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index\u2019s ( $SPX ) 2.3 % decline during the same time frame.\n\nHowever, over the longer term, KO is up 13.8% on a YTD basis, and the stock has soared 17.5% over the past 52 weeks. By contrast, the SPX is down marginally in 2025 and has surged 15.4% over the past year.\n\nTo confirm the bullish price trend, KO has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving average since early February.\n\nOn Feb. 11, KO surged over 4% following its strong Q4 earnings results . The company\u2019s revenue climbed 5.4% year over year to $11.54 billion, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.55, beating projections by 6.4%, while adjusted EBITDA reached $3.27 billion with a 28.3% margin, exceeding forecasts by 11.7%. Operating margin improved to 23.5% from 20.8% a year ago, and free cash flow margin jumped to 27.3% from 16.6%.\n\nTo emphasize the stock\u2019s outperformance this year, Coca-Cola\u2019s top rival, PepsiCo Inc ( PEP ), is underperforming \u2013 not just KO but the broader market. PEP stock declined 9.6% over the past 52 weeks and dipped marginally on a YTD basis.\n\nAnalysts hold a strongly optimistic view of the KO stock\u2019s potential. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cStrong Buy\u201d from 22 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $76.05 is a premium of 7.3% to current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rashmi Kumari did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Eakin Howard/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most famous elements at Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, is getting some work done ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, scaffolding was visible around the Coca-Cola bottle \u2014 the part-slide, part-art installation, part-advertisement structure that sits above the left field bleachers. Anyone in the surrounding Mission Bay neighborhood with a view into the park could see the evidence of construction.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nScaffolding is visible around the giant Coca-Cola bottle at Oracle Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants, on Feb. 27, 2025. Courtesy photo\n\nWhen SFGATE asked what was happening with the iconic 80-foot-long advertisement, Giants spokesperson Shana Daum replied in an email that the Coke bottle will be getting \u201cFresh paint and some new features\u201d but declined to say specifically what those new features were, teasing that the Giants will officially announce the changes at their annual media open house event in mid-March. The new features to the bottle are coming one year after the Giants updated their in-stadium lighting system.\n\nThe container\u2019s silhouette was made up of long tubes of green lights, with Coke\u2019s iconic red stripe and white signature on the middle of the bottle also made up of colored lights. But over 25 years, those lights have clearly experienced wear and tear, with portions of the lights going out at various points over the past decade. Photos show the red lights in the middle of the installation in particular being off toward the end of the 2024 season.\n\nThe Big Soda icon wasn\u2019t always beloved, as some city residents vociferously objected to the giant corporate advertisement. The slides inside the bottle have also been a headache for the Giants at times: The team has been the subject of several lawsuits over injuries people suffered on the slide, from both fans and employees.",

So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$70.87. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nIn the last year Coca-Cola insiders didn't buy any company stock.

While we wait, check out this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of Coca-Cola\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$2.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold Coca-Cola shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

The company now aims to use 35-40% recycled materials by 2035, down from its original target of 50% by 2030.\n\nWhy is this plastic increase troubling?\n\nAluminum cans, though pricier, can be recycled repeatedly with minimal waste. Plastic bottles create lasting problems \u2014 they break down into tiny pieces that end up in our food, water, and air.\n\nThe timing makes this move more concerning. President Trump just canceled a federal program to replace plastic straws with paper ones, reversing President Biden's work to tackle what he called a plastic pollution \"crisis.\"\n\nThe U.S. gets about half its aluminum from other nations, according to United States Geological Survey data cited by the BBC. Unlike in 2018, when some manufacturers got special passes to skip the metal tax, Trump says no one gets a break this time, per the BBC.\n\nWhat can we do about plastic waste?\n\nSmall changes add up. Carrying reusable water bottles and coffee cups cuts plastic waste quickly. Shopping at stores with bulk bins lets you skip disposable containers. Supporting companies that use sustainable packaging sends a message that consumers want better choices.\n\nCities and states keep pushing for change, too. Many have banned single-use plastics or started deposit programs that reward recycling. These local moves often spark bigger shifts in how companies package their products.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

It\u2019s about creating experiences, shaping perception, and influencing how people interact with the world.\n\nThis means designers can\u2019t just think, How do we make this look better? Instead, they have to ask:\n\nWhat message are we communicating?\n\nHow does this design fit into the cultural landscape?\n\nWhat emotions, behaviours, or associations are we trying to create?\n\nI like to tell my students in my Canva Camp Program that designers are communicators\u2014culture creators\u2026because you should constantly be thinking about the message you sending across, how you would like your audience to perceive it and how it should shape their world. I say this a lot but when I watched a video by The Huddle where The Belonwus gave context into their brand identity for Onboard Global, those words of mine came alive.\n\nMcCracken illustrates this with an incredible example: Coca-Cola and Santa Claus.\n\nHow Coca-Cola Owns Santa Claus (and What That Means for Branding)\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that the Santa Claus we all know today\u2014rosy-cheeked, dressed in red and white, warm and jolly\u2014is largely a Coca-Cola invention. In the 1930s, Coca-Cola launched a series of holiday advertisements featuring Santa as this joyful, grandfatherly figure. Over time, this version of Santa became the dominant image across pop culture, solidifying Coca-Cola\u2019s association with happiness, generosity, and holiday cheer.\n\nThink about how bold that is. A brand didn\u2019t just market a product; it shaped a cultural icon. They didn\u2019t just sell soda; they sold an entire worldview\u2014one that was optimistic, warm, and familiar.\n\nThis is what McCracken means when he says branding is bigger than we often think. Designers and marketers are not just making things look good; they are shaping the narratives people believe in, the symbols they recognize, and the emotions they attach to things.\n\nThe Science Behind Design: Beyond Looks\n\nThen there\u2019s the Coca-Cola\u2019s vending machines. The company didn\u2019t just design a machine to dispense soda. They thought deeply about how people interact with the machine, how it feels to use it, and what the experience communicates. This is the shift I\u2019m starting to appreciate more\u2014design isn\u2019t just about how something looks; it\u2019s about how it works.\n\nGreat design and branding don\u2019t happen in isolation. They happen when designers go beyond their artistic vision and start seeing branding as a tool to shape perception, culture, and even behaviour.\n\nWhat is the Fuss About?\n\nI used to focus on design as a creative act. Now, I see it as a science, a psychology, and a cultural force. The best branding isn\u2019t just about creating something visually striking\u2014it\u2019s about embedding meaning into every choice, from the colours and fonts to the messaging and experience.\n\nThis realization has changed how I approach branding in my work. Now, I don\u2019t just ask, Does this look good? I ask:\n\nWhat does this design mean in a broader context?\n\nHow does it influence the way people perceive this brand?\n\nIs this just decoration, or is it solving a deeper problem?\n\nIf this is something you\u2019ve thought about (or are just now starting to), I\u2019d love to hear your perspective.\n\nTill next time,\n\nDammy Rachael!",

            "content": "Coca-Cola, the company ranked as the \"top global plastic polluter\" for six years straight, might sell more drinks in plastic bottles \u2014 a direct response to new taxes on metal imports, reported the BBC.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nThe beverage company's CEO, James Quincey, told investors it'll lean harder on plastic packaging if aluminum prices rise under the United States' new 25% tax on metal imports.\n\n\"If one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminium cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles.\"\n\nThis shift comes right after Coca-Cola reduced its recycling goals. The company now aims to use 35-40% recycled materials by 2035, down from its original target of 50% by 2030.\n\nWhy is this plastic increase troubling?\n\nAluminum cans, though pricier, can be recycled repeatedly with minimal waste. Plastic bottles create lasting problems \u2014 they break down into tiny pieces that end up in our food, water, and air.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing makes this move more concerning. President Trump just canceled a federal program to replace plastic straws with paper ones, reversing President Biden's work to tackle what he called a plastic pollution \"crisis.\"\n\nThe U.S. gets about half its aluminum from other nations, according to United States Geological Survey data cited by the BBC. Unlike in 2018, when some manufacturers got special passes to skip the metal tax, Trump says no one gets a break this time, per the BBC.\n\nWhat can we do about plastic waste?\n\nSmall changes add up. Carrying reusable water bottles and coffee cups cuts plastic waste quickly. Shopping at stores with bulk bins lets you skip disposable containers. Supporting companies that use sustainable packaging sends a message that consumers want better choices.\n\nCities and states keep pushing for change, too. Many have banned single-use plastics or started deposit programs that reward recycling. These local moves often spark bigger shifts in how companies package their products.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Since its creation in 1892 in the United States, the company has been able to adapt to changes in consumption habits. Over the years, it has innovated with new product lines, such as sugar-free versions, energy drinks, and healthier options.\n\n| Pexels\n\nAware of the constant transformation in consumption, Coca-Cola has now decided to take another step forward with a new proposal that combines flavor and wellness. The company has announced the launch of Simply Pop, a drink that joins the growing sector of functional beverages. This new product will be available in U.S. supermarkets starting in late February, including popular stores like Amazon Fresh.\n\nA Beverage With Health Benefits\n\nFunctional beverages have gained great popularity in recent years. More and more consumers are looking for options that, in addition to being refreshing, provide benefits to their well-being. Following this trend, Simply Pop will include six grams of fiber, as well as vitamin C and zinc, key ingredients for strengthening the immune system.\n\nCoca-Cola has decided to present this new line with a variety of flavors aimed at pleasing all tastes: strawberry, pineapple-mango, fruit punch, lime, and citrus punch. These new products will be made with natural fruit juice and will be promoted as a prebiotic option for gut health care.\n\nAn Expanding Market and Strong Competition\n\nThe rise of functional beverages has been remarkable in recent years. Emerging brands like Poppi and Olipop have gained ground with their alternative sodas, creating a billion-dollar market in constant growth. According to estimates, in 2023 this sector reached a value of 234 billion dollars and is expected to approach 437 billion by 2034.\n\nCoca-Cola, a leader in the beverage industry, doesn't want to be left out of this trend. Thus, it has decided to bet on Simply Pop, an alternative that combines the characteristic flavor of its products with ingredients that provide health benefits. With this new proposal, the American company seeks to stay at the forefront and offer consumers an innovative option without losing its essence.",

            "content": "For more than 60 years, Coca-Cola (KO -0.52%) has been an ultra-reliable dividend stock that raised its payout every year, no matter what the economy was doing.\n\nCoke's consistency can be attributed to its business model, which is focused on non-alcoholic beverages, a highly efficient global supply chain, partnerships with bottling plants worldwide, and excellent marketing.\n\nEven with those advantages, Coke has failed to increase its sales or earnings at a fast rate over the last decade. And it's unlikely Coke will strike gold with a breakthrough beverage that kicks its growth rate into a new gear. Therefore, investors want to ensure they don't overpay for Coke stock, which may be a concern given it is up 11.7% over the last month (at the time of this writing).\n\nHere's what's fueling the rapid rise in the stock price and whether Coke is a dividend stock worth buying now.\n\nOvercoming demand challenges\n\nCoke's fourth-quarter results were excellent -- fueling the recent rise in the stock price.\n\nCoke's unit case volume (a key metric for measuring demand) grew 2% in the quarter thanks to strong results in China, Brazil, and the U.S. The recovery in China and an overall uptick in unit case volume are likely driving the stock's recent rise.\n\nIn the prior quarter, Coke's unit case volume declined -- a red flag that demand was softening for a company that had been doing a masterful job navigating higher costs and consumer demand trends. Coke proceeded to fall 9.1% in October of last year.\n\nThe big swings in Coke's stock price in recent months showcase the importance of demand trends. When Coke is getting bogged down by broader industry trends, investors may be less willing to pay a premium price for the dividend stock. But when Coke is flexing its brand power and overcoming industry challenges, it can be viewed as an industry leader and fetch a higher valuation.\n\nFor the full year, Coke was able to grow organic revenue by 12% -- largely thanks to price increases and a change in favorable mix as consumers gravitated toward higher-margin products. Most impressive is Coke's ability to overcome extreme currency impacts due to a strong U.S. dollar.\n\nIn Latin America -- Coke's fastest-growing region -- unit case volumes increased by 3% in 2024. Pricing and mix were up 21%. But currency headwinds were 14% worse than in 2023, so reported net revenue was up 11%. Generating double-digit sales growth despite a massive currency impact is a testament to the strength of Coke's global exposure in burgeoning markets like Latin America.\n\nIn sum, Coke was able to generate a slight uptick in unit case volume in 2024 and more than offset currency headwinds with pricing power.\n\nCoke's ace in the hole\n\nCoke's size gives it inherent advantages, such as financial muscle, supply chain, distribution, marketing, etc. But what really separates Coke from its competition is brand development.\n\nCoke has an impeccable track record of organically developing brands and making effective mergers and acquisitions (M&A). On the earnings call, Coke went into detail about its M&A platform, discussing how it has created $15 billion brands organically but has also bought 12 small brands and developed them into $1 billion-plus brands while only acquiring three brands that were over $1 billion.\n\nCoke doesn't just dominate soda, it is also the No. 1 player in water based on 2024 retail value (Dasani, Smart Water, Vitamin Water, Topo Chico, etc.), the No. 1 sports drink brand (Powerade, BodyArmor, Aquarius), and the No. 1 global player in juice (Minute Maid, Simply, Maaza).\n\nCoke has several success stories across non-alcoholic beverage categories. For example, Coke took the retail value of Fairlife from $10 million in 2014 to $4 billion in 2024. Fairlife's drink lineup of protein shakes, mike shakes, and meal replacement options with high protein and low sugar adds diversification to Coke's existing portfolio.\n\nCoke wants to ensure it is well positioned to attract health-conscious consumers. In 2024, trademark Coca-Cola grew just 2% worldwide, but Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew 9%. The future of Coke's growth is much more dependent on its newer brands and other flavors of existing brands rather than its flagship product.\n\nIn sum, Coke has done an exceptional job of recognizing the need to diversify beyond trademark Coca-Cola into other non-alcoholic beverage categories and then take those products to new heights using its global network.\n\nCoke remains a good value\n\nFor 2025 Coke expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a currency headwind of 3% to 4%, currency-neutral earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 8% to 10%, and comparable EPS growth of 2% to 3% due to a whopping 6% to 7% currency headwind. Based on comparable EPS of $2.88 in 2024, that would give Coke $2.95 in comparable EPS in 2025, good for a 23.7 forward price-to-earnings ratio based on Coke's stock price of around $70 at the time of this writing.\n\nDespite the rapid run-up in Coke's stock price over the last month, the valuation remains reasonable because Coke was so beaten down in the last quarter of 2024. In fact, if you zoom out, Coke's stock price is up around 17% in the last five years compared to a monster gain in the S&P 500.\n\nCoke has paid and raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years -- making it a Dividend King. Dividend Kings are companies that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 years.\n\nCoke currently yields 2.8%, which is better than the average stock in the consumer staples sector and much higher than the S&P 500. For context, the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF, which mirrors the performance of the sector, yields 2.3%. And the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF yields 1.2%. All told, Coke remains a solid source of passive income at a fair valuation.\n\nA foundational dividend stock to build a passive income portfolio around\n\nCoke is the perfect dividend stock for risk-averse investors. The company continues to expand its beverage lineup beyond flagship Coca-Cola, giving it pricing power and diversification even during a challenging period in the business cycle.\n\nNormally, a big increase in Coke stock in a short period would cause concern that its valuation is getting overextended. However, given the context of Coke's earlier quarterly prints and years of its stock price going practically nowhere, the run-up doesn't damage Coke's investment thesis.\n\nInvestors aren't getting the bargain bin price for Coke stock anymore, but it's still a great buy now.",

            "content": "The Petaluma Reusable Cup Project from the NextGen Consortium, led by Closed Loop Partners' Center for the Circular Economy, was the first citywide program in the U.S. to offer reusable to-go cups at no cost to customers.\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the NextGen Consortium, led by Closed Loop Partners' Center for the Circular Economy, with partners including Starbucks, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Yum! Brands and other global businesses released groundbreaking results from the Petaluma Reusable Cup Project, the first initiative to catalyze reuse across an entire U.S. city.\n\nThe report, Making Reuse an Everyday Reality: Insights and Impact from the Petaluma Reusable Cup Project, reveals a major milestone for the reuse movement: enough of the project's purple cups were successfully returned for the reuse system to produce environmental benefits when compared with a single-use alternative. Delivering a positive environmental outcome on this scale is particularly significant because the program was designed to automatically serve every customer ordering a to-go beverage with a reusable cup, across a citywide network.\n\nThis unprecedented collaboration in Petaluma set out to address accessibility and inclusivity challenges that typically restrict the ability of reuse programs to deliver impact. Throughout the duration of the three-month project, 30 businesses in Petaluma\u2013\u2013from national brands to local restaurants\u2013\u2013switched out single-use cups for reusable alternatives in unison, at no cost to the customer. Local consumers responded, returning cups from day one, with returns climbing rapidly in the first few weeks and over 220,000 cups returned throughout the program.\n\nThe Petaluma Reusable Cup Project was launched at a critical time, amidst growing regulatory, consumer and climate pressures on single-use packaging waste. Advancing reuse has been a focus for the NextGen Consortium, as identifying alternatives to single-use packaging becomes a top priority for brands and cities seeking to reduce waste. In the U.S., 50 billion single-use cups are purchased and disposed of each year, and many of these materials are wasted in landfills.\n\n\"The best part was that this project got the whole community involved. Deep public-private partnerships, including commerce and non-profits collaborating, demonstrated that it is possible to launch an inclusive and accessible reuse system that supported our residents. People got into it, and it was the talk of the town,\" said Mayor Kevin McDonnell of the City of Petaluma. \"We are thrilled to be a part of this important work to scale reuse systems that keep our communities clean and support positive environmental outcomes.\"\n\n\"The Petaluma Reusable Cup Project demonstrated an ambitious, innovative vision of reuse as an everyday reality, paving the way for the Consortium to scale reuse in California and other markets,\" said Carolina Lobel, Senior Director at the Center for the Circular Economy at Closed Loop Partners. \"Together, we can scale the solutions that have been proven to work and solve the current open challenges identified in the Petaluma project.\"\n\nThe Petaluma Reusable Cup Project builds on over half a decade of work to advance reuse by Closed Loop Partners' Center for the Circular Economy. While there is still work ahead to increase return rates, given variability across participating businesses, the groundbreaking results achieved mark an important milestone in catalyzing and scaling reuse systems. The Consortium invites brands, retailers, cities and innovators from all sectors to join upcoming reuse activations in cities across the U.S.\u2013\u2013making critical strides to building a waste-free world.\n\nTo learn more about the Petaluma Reusable Cup Project, visit https://returnmycup.com/.\n\nAbout the NextGen Consortium\n\nThe NextGen Consortium is a multi-year consortium that addresses single-use foodservice packaging waste by advancing the design, commercialization and recovery of foodservice packaging alternatives. The NextGen Consortium is managed by Closed Loop Partners' Center for the Circular Economy. Starbucks and McDonald's are the founding partners of the Consortium, with The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo as sector lead partners. Peet's Coffee, with its parent company JDE Peet's, Wendy's, Yum!

            "content": "Together, the big three make up a whopping 87.9% of the US sports drinks category, powering over the landscape. Their influence is wide-reaching: and with the might and muscle of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, they have the resources to boost NPD and innovation and explore the potential of the category.\n\nData provided by Euromonitor helps us assess how the top players are competing on the US sports drink market field.\n\nGatorade (PepsiCo): Market share: 61.6%\n\nGatorade takes, by far, the largest share of the US sports drink market. It\u2019s been a consistent winner for PepsiCo for many years, with continued growth in the market.\n\nThe brand has a legacy of some 50 years: presenting itself as \u2018the most scientifically researched and game-tested way to replace electrolytes lost in sweat\u2019.\n\nYet the brand has also moved with the times: such as with the brand\u2019s organic launch in 2016, the debut of Gatorade Zero in 2018, outreach into new categories such as protein bars, and innovations such as a smart cap to give athletes direct hydration feedback on their personal smart cap vessels.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this push into personalization that\u2019s been particularly successful for the brand in recent years.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big step for the brand? Expanding to more consumers and more consumption occasions.\n\nThat\u2019s seen with a emphasis on hydration powders: a format that\u2019s catching on across the sports and hydration powders \u2013 and where Gatorade naturally wants to take the lead. It launched Hydration Boosters last year in the US.\n\n\u201cWe have invested in an infrastructure for powders and mixing that allows us to create much more complex solutions in sachets and tablets and we\u2019re going to invest massively behind that business,\u201d said PepsiCo chairman and Ramon L Laguarta, presenting at CAGNY this month.\n\n\u201cIt is now a $1 billion business in the US, our Gatorade and Propel Powders. This will be a driver of growth for us. We can provide much more functionality in every sachet. Clearly there is a lot of value, I think, in providing convenience and making sure that we can take our hydration with us throughout the day.\u201d\n\nGatorade has also launched an electrolyte-infused water, an energy drink with Fast Twitch, and rapid rehydration product Gatorlyte.\n\nPowerade (Coca-Cola). Market share: 14.5%\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s big bet, meanwhile, is Powerade. The drink uses its ION4 electrolyte system to replenish four key electrolytes lost in sweat: sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.\n\nIn 2023, the brand had a revamp: debuting an all-new formula (now claiming 50% more electrolytes than comparative sports drinks \u2013 a key attribute pulled out on label) and new look packaging.\n\nIt was an early innovator in the powerful sugar-free category (Powerade Zero has been on shelves since 2008 \u2013 far longer than Gatorade Zero) and boasts other innovations in the sports drinks category such as Powerade Ultra (with shelf-stable creatine, branched chain amino acids) and Powerade Power Waters.\n\nAnd the brand has taken its marketing in a unique direction: focusing on supporting athlete\u2019s mental health as well as their physical health (notably with \u2018The Vault\u2019, a creative spot that takes views on an emotional journey with US superstar gymnast Simone Biles, as part of the \u2018Pause is Power\u2019 platform).\n\nBodyarmor (Coca-Cola): Market share 11.8%\n\nCoca-Cola is also focusing on up-and-coming sports drink BodyArmor. The brand was created in 2011 by Mike Repole and Lance Collins (basketball star Kobe Bryant joined the brand in 2013 and the #3 shareholder and served on the company\u2019s board until his death in 2020), and counts Naomi Osaka, Megan Rapinoe, Mike Trout and Dustin Johnson among \u2018Team BodyArmor\u2019.\n\nBodyArmor\u2019s entry into the category in 2011 was one that immediately challenged what had been a two-horse race between Gatorade and Powerade: with its position as a premium sports drink with no artificial colors or flavors, and containing potassium and other electrolytes, vitamins and coconut water.\n\nAfter years of courting Dr Pepper Snapple, BodyArmor took a sharp swerve away and instead teamed up with Coca-Cola.\n\nCoca-Cola took a 15% minority stake in BodyArmor in 2018, tucking it into its Venturing and Emerging Brands (VEB) unit as it eyed up the potential of the brand and premium side of the sports drinks category to complement the more mainstream, affordable Powerade proposition. In 2021, it acquired the remaining 85% of BodyArmor for $5.6bn.\n\nBodyAmor has built up a portfolio that includes BODYARMOR LYTE (no added sugar), BODYARMOR SportWater (pH 9+) and BODYARMOR Flash I.V. (rapid rehydration).\n\nBodyarmor\u2019s point of difference continues to be its better-for-you positioning, Sabrina Niland, VP of Innovation & Strategy told us.\n\n\u201cBodyarmor was created as a better alternative to traditional old school sports drinks, focusing on potassium-packed electrolytes instead of sodium\u2026 delivering superior hydration, using no artificial ingredients, and tasting great,\u201d said Niland.\n\nAnd as a younger brand \u2013 yet one with all the resources of Coca-Cola to push it forward - the company is keen to keep that clearly in focus.\n\n\u201c2024 was a critical year for us,\u201d said Niland. \u201cWe went back to the fundamentals, cementing our core business with the right assortment and layering on consumer driven innovation to drive growth for Bodyarmor. We\u2019ve set the stage for a strong 2025, we\u2019ll build our assortment with the right innovation in the most important segments, and we\u2019ll talk to the consumer in a modernized way that we know will resonate.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs.

            "content": "By Gillian Crist\n\nPage Editor\n\nCoca-Cola and Dr Pepper have both expanded their flavor offerings, with Coca-Cola introducing a new orange cream soda and Dr Pepper launching a raspberry-flavored variety.\n\nI work in receiving at a grocery store, so oftentimes, I am one of the first to see the new products we get shipped in. I usually don\u2019t like the new soda flavors, like the Oreo Coke monstrosity, but I decided to give these flavors a try. I heard mixed reactions about the Dr Pepper Blackberry flavor, with some loving it, and others comparing it to cough syrup. Nonetheless, I went ahead and bought a cold bottle and split it among some of my coworkers.\n\nWe were all slightly apprehensive. Out of the five coworkers who tried the drink, three disliked it, while a coworker and myself found it tolerable. I didn\u2019t think it was bad, but I would not choose this drink over a regular Dr Pepper. The blackberry was very strong and sweet and tasted like Pez candy. I don\u2019t think it was bad, but it was definitely too sweet for me to finish.\n\nMy other coworkers, however, described it as carbonated Robitussin and cardboard. Another coworker added ice to the soda and said it made it taste much better, which I can understand. It\u2019s definitely a sweet enough flavor to need the extra cold temperature.\n\nOverall, I think this drink was disappointing after the coconut cream flavor that was temporarily released in the summer. I think it is better than the strawberries and cream flavor, though. In terms of the orange cream Coca-Cola, I do have to say, I\u2019m not a big fan of oranges, but I like artificial orange flavors. I honestly really liked the orange, even though I\u2019m not a huge fan of regular Coke. I do think you need to drink it right after purchasing, though, as it didn\u2019t take long to start tasting flat, even when it was obviously carbonated.\n\nThe orange flavor is definitely very strong and noticeable. It felt very \u201cseparate\u201d from its original drink; as if I were drinking orange cream syrup and Coke syrup separately and I thought the flavor combo was a bit off-putting. Ultimately, the combination, to my surprise, worked really well for me. It has a similar flavor profile to the orange vanilla Coca-Cola that was discontinued a few years ago. I think both of these drinks would benefit from having a bit more of a muted base.\n\nAs of now, the Dr Pepper Blackberry soda is not set to be discontinued anytime soon. However, the Coca-Cola orange cream soda is only available until early 2026.",

            "content": "The yield may not be sky-high, but what this stock lacks in raw firepower it more than makes up for in consistent reliability.\n\nLooking for reliable dividend income? You'd be hard-pressed to find a better all-around option than The Coca-Cola Company (KO -0.52%). While you can find higher yields than its forward-looking dividend yield of 2.8%, with 63 consecutive years of annual payout growth under its belt, the beverage giant's dividend pedigree is second to none. Some investors use its reliably rising dividend to pay their ever-rising recurring bills.\n\nSo, how much Coca-Cola stock would be needed to, say, generate $4,000 worth of dividends per year (which is about how much the average household spends per year on utilities, gas, water, phone, and cable TV, by the way, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nIt's not a company that needs much of an introduction. The organization's flagship product is, of course, its namesake cola. The Coca-Cola Company, however, also owns other beverage brands like Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, Gold Peak tea, and Dasani water, just to name a few. This diverse lineup means it's got something to sell to nearly all consumers, catering to their continually changing preferences. That's one of the key reasons it's been able to afford over six decades of reliable yearly payout growth.\n\nTo this end, with its most recent dividend increase to $0.51 per share, you would need 1,961 shares of Coca-Cola to pocket $1,000 in quarterly dividend income from this well-known consumer goods name, or $4,000 per year. That's roughly $140,000 worth of the beverage stock at its present price.\n\nStart small and let dividend reinvestment do the work\n\nThat's no small amount of money for average investors. But, it may be more attainable than you think. The key is growing the position by reinvesting Coca-Cola's dividend payments in more shares of the company until you need these dividends in cash. A modest $12,500 investment in this stock 30 years ago would be worth $141,000 today, for perspective, had you reinvested its dividends along the way.\n\nAlthough past performance is no guarantee of future results, this performance does point to what's possible.",

Those who commit to holding their investments for extended periods are typically the ones who reap the greatest benefits. A major factor behind the success of this approach is the power of compounding. By reinvesting dividends\u2014using those payouts to purchase additional shares\u2014investors can enhance the growth of their portfolios. Rather than taking the dividends as cash, reinvesting them allows for a steady increase in share ownership, amplifying potential returns. Over time, this method has proven to be highly effective. In fact, a report from Hartford Funds highlights that since 1960, reinvested dividends and compounding have accounted for 69% of the broader market\u2019s total return.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Dividend Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOver the years, analysts have closely monitored the impact of dividend reinvestment and have expressed favorable opinions about its benefits. Steven Greiner, Managing Director of Schwab Equity Ratings at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, supports this approach. He shares the following insight:\n\n\u201cReinvesting dividends is nearly effortless. Once you set it up\u2014which generally involves simply ticking a box\u2014there\u2019s nothing more to do but sit back and let compounding work its magic. Be aware, however, that companies can reduce or stop paying dividends.\u201d\n\nSteven Greiner\u2019s final point touches on a key concern for dividend investors\u2014the risk of a company suddenly cutting or suspending its dividend payments. No investor wants to be caught in that situation. While many tend to measure success primarily by stock price appreciation, a deeper analysis offers a broader perspective. A study of major global indexes over a 25-year period, ending in March 2018, found that reinvested dividends contributed nearly 3% in additional growth, as reported by Forbes. This underscores the vital role that dividends play in enhancing investment returns beyond just price gains. It serves as a strong reminder that evaluating an investment solely based on stock price movements may offer an incomplete picture. By incorporating dividend reinvestment into the assessment, investors gain a more comprehensive and accurate view of overall performance.\n\nA separate analysis from T. Rowe Price found that over the three decades leading up to 2022, reinvested dividends played a crucial role in market returns, contributing a notable 42.5% to overall gains. The report also emphasized that dividend reinvestment had an even greater impact on a select group of high-performing companies\u2014those that consistently increase their dividends at a rate exceeding the broader market. This effect becomes more powerful over time, as reinvesting a steadily growing dividend further accelerates long-term investment returns.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola Zero - \u2018Coca-Cola Sin Azucar\u2019 - has been growing steadily in Mexico; as well as across Latin America, where in FY2024 the brand saw double-digit growth.\n\nAnd with the beverage coming off a low base, Coca-Cola Femsa sees big opportunity to accelerate expansion in 2025 and beyond.\n\nSugary problems\n\nMexico is one of the highest consumers of sugary beverages globally. A sugar tax, introduced in 2014, has helped take Mexico off the top spot as far as per capita consumption goes, but it remains a high consumer.\n\nObesity is the leading public health concern in Mexico and has been on the rise for at least three decades. Over this time, the Mexican diet has shifted from mainly fresh and unprocessed foods to ultra-processed products high in sugar, salt and fat.\n\nAnd sugary drinks make up 70% of the total added sugar in the diet.\n\nCoca-Cola Zero (also known as Coca-Cola No Sugar in some markets) is one of Coca-Cola\u2019s zero-calorie variants, a carbonated beverage \u2018with high quality, great taste, zero calories, no sugar and low in sodium\u2019.\n\nCoca-Cola Zero is designed to have a taste as closely-aligned as possible to traditional sugar-sweetened Coca-Cola (in contrast to Diet Coke, which is designed to have a \u2018lighter taste\u2019). So that sets it up as a strong contender to traditional Coca-Cola.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola Zero has been highly successful in markets such as the US and UK, the consumer base is very different in Mexico. That means Coca-Cola Femsa has traditionally struggled to translate Coca-Cola Zero\u2019s success over to Mexico.\n\nBut that\u2019s now starting to change, with the bottler highlighting growth for the brand in the country.\n\nA key change Coca-Cola Femsa has made is to scrap complicated pricing architecture for Coca-Cola Zero and make the pricing message simpler for consumers.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u2018what the Coke Company does like no other \u2013 the campaigns, the influencers\u2019, says Ian Craig, CEO.\n\nAnd that\u2019s building the necessary momentum needed for strong growth. Headquartered in Mexico City, Coca-Cola Femsa has already seen a similar trajectory in Brazil and Argentina: countries that started with a small following for sugar-free versions but has seen that grow considerably.\n\nIn FY2024, Coca-Cola Femsa saw double-digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero over its regions of Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala, Colombia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Venezuela.\n\nThat follows on from 15% growth in 2023, showing a strong trajectory for the brand. And Coca-Cola Zero Sugar volumes have surged almost 60% from a 2019 baseline.\n\nBuilding on 2023 momentum In Brazil, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar emerged as the 'preferred choice' among consumers, achieving 91 million-unit cases in 2023, a 28.4% annual growth. In Mexico, Coca\u2011Cola Zero Sugar achieved 9.1% volume growth year over year. Argentina, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have the largest mix of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in their sparkling beverage portfolio, with the mix continuing to grow in 2023, setting the benchmark for the company. Coca-Cola's followed on this trajectory in 2024: and wants to expand it further in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what happens in countries like Brazil, once you get the ball rolling\u2026 and it\u2019s looking pretty good,\u201d said Craig.\n\nIn 2025, the brand will use a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 asset \u2013 yet to be revealed \u2013 and focus on a strong soccer platform.\n\n\u201cOverall, I have no doubt that Coke Zero is going to be a very pleasant result for this year in Mexico,\u201d said Craig.\n\nAnother asset driving Coca-Cola Zero forward is Juntos+, Coca-Cola Femsa\u2019s B2B omnichannel platform, with its advanced AI capabilities. Juntos+ now reaches 1.3 million active users across Latin America, with more than 1.1 million users engaged in our Juntos+ Premia loyalty plan.\n\n\u201cBacked by advanced AI models, this tool enhances our salesforce capabilities, improving key coverages and salesforce effectiveness at the point of sale,\u201d said Craig. \u201cDuring the [latest] quarter, we moved from pilot phase to a large scale rollout. Now, more than 40% of our salesforce in Brazil is using Juntos+ Advisor. Its initial results are already exceeding expectations, improving location accuracy and providing our salesforce with real-time information during visits. Moreover, our AI-driven guided missions have resulted in increased SKUs per store and digital revenue per month.\u201d",

Its original Coca-Cola was touted as a medicine for conditions like headaches and nervous system disruptions, but that's about as far as the company has ventured into the health and wellness market \u2014 until now.\n\nThe brand recently unveiled Simply Pop: a lineup of prebiotic soda boasting no-added sugar and a base of fruit juice derived from concentrate. While the concept of a \"prebiotic soda,\" which supposedly feeds your gut with a hearty mix of fiber, may seem a bit odd, Coca-Cola is far from the first brand to venture into this category. Olipop, another popular prebiotic soda brand, offers the same benefits, and so does the \"Shark Tank\" success story Poppi soda. So, inevitably, Coca-Cola did some tinkering and came up with its own variation of prebiotic soda, which currently includes five flavors: strawberry, pineapple mango, fruit punch, lime, and citrus punch. I sampled its newly introduced line of Simply Pop beverages to decide if they were worth stocking up on and to see if Coca-Cola is better off sticking to its tried-and-true flavors rather than venturing into the world of health drinks.\n\nSome recommendations are based on firsthand impressions of promotional materials and products provided by the manufacturer.",

It\u2019s sending a message.\u201d\n\nSince Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.\n\nHere in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf \u2014 or pull them altogether.\n\n\u201cWhen people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\u201d Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\u201d\n\nFahed Arar, general manager of the Chat Cola Company poses next to an advertisement billboard with the companies brands and reads \u201cthe Palestinian taste,\u201d in the Palestinian company\u2019s bottling plant, in the West Bank city of Salfit, Feb. 13, 2025.

It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.\n\nAt the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer\u2019s sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cQuality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\u201d said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \u201cIf it\u2019s not good quality, the boycott won\u2019t stick.\u201d\n\nChat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke\u2019s \u2014 just like its packaging. That\u2019s the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat\u2019s lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.\n\nIn 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke\u2019s designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn\u2019t violate copyright law.\n\nIn the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \u201cfamily size\u201d packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel\u2019s predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi\u2019s thorough inspection of the facility.\n\nPallets of branded aluminum cans at the production line in the Palestinian Chat Cola bottling plant, in the West Bank city of Salfit, Feb. 13, 2025.

The general manager, Arar, said his company\u2019s success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.\n\nFor nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat\u2019s aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAmong the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next-door for a can of Coke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d said Asaad, the worker. \u201cWe want to be self-sufficient.

Popular brands like Poppi and Olipop tout healthier alternatives to regular soft drinks with their \u201cprebiotic sodas.\u201d But after Poppi\u2019s recent drama with a controversial influencer marketing stunt and a lawsuit that accused the brand of being not as healthy as it seemed, you might be skeptical of the healthy soda space and eager for a refresh. Enter Simply Pop, Coca-Cola\u2019s latest release. I recently had the chance to give this fizzy new product a try\u2014keep scrolling to read my honest review!\n\nSimply Pop: Coca-Cola\u2019s refreshing entry into prebiotic soda\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nFrom the Simply brand, known for its juices and lemonades, comes Simply Pop, which Coca-Cola describes on its website as its \u201cfirst-ever prebiotic soda made with real fruit juice, no added sugar and prebiotic fiber to support gut health, along with Vitamin C and Zinc to support immune function.\u201d\n\nThe drink comes in five tasty flavors: Strawberry, Pineapple Mango, Fruit Punch, Lime or Citrus Punch, all available in 12 oz. slim cans featuring images of the fruits that define each flavor.\n\nPriced at $2.49 per can, Simply Pop will be available in select retail locations and online nationwide through Amazon Fresh starting in late February.\n\nSimply Pop review: Is Coca-Cola\u2019s new prebiotic soda worth trying?\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nFrom kombucha and non-alcoholic spritzers to iced tea and refreshing theater sodas, I\u2019m not just a fan of fun drinks\u2014I\u2019d say I\u2019m something of a connoisseur. So when I had the offer to attend a product preview of Simply Pop, hosted by The Coca-Cola Company, I jumped at the chance.\n\nAlthough I have a lifelong love of fizzy drinks, I\u2019ve never been particularly impressed by the prebiotic sodas that have been getting a lot of buzz in recent years.\n\nBoth Olipop and Poppi have left a bad taste in my mouth\u2014literally. The lingering flavor of these drinks has always made me feel like a regular soda would be more worth it in the long run\u2014gut-healthy benefits aside.\n\nMy distaste is probably due to the expectation of tasting the nostalgic flavors of cola, root beer, or cream soda when you crack open a can. Instead, the lackluster imitations often leave you wanting more\u2014or perhaps less of whatever that was.\n\nWhat intrigued me about Simply Pop, even before trying it, was that the five flavors in the product line aren\u2019t soda imitations. Instead, they offer simple, fruity flavors that don\u2019t set you up for disappointment but rather leave your taste buds excited for a refreshing experience.\n\nFood Why Poppi\u2019s $25K Influencer Vending Machine Stunt Didn\u2019t Go as Planned If there\u2019s one thing the internet loves, it\u2019s a good brand scandal. And this week\u2019s drama? Brought to you by Poppi, the trendy prebiotic soda brand that accidentally turned a Super Bowl campaign into a PR disaster. Poppi is currently in, shall we say, fizzy water after sending custom vending machines to a handful of [\u2026]\n\nDespite my excitement, I still went into my first sip with skepticism.\n\nFor my first flavor, I kept it simple with lime\u2014easy to get right and one of my personal favorites in any drink.\n\nRight from the start, Simply\u2019s use of 25-30% real fruit juice was noticeable, with the lime flavor coming through as fresh and crisp. The texture was smooth, despite the bubbles and there was no odd aftertaste from sweeteners.\n\nFeeling encouraged, I moved on to test the remaining four flavors and with each one, I was equally satisfied. I was especially impressed by Pineapple Mango\u2014it was transportively tropical. While it didn\u2019t exactly make me feel like I was on a beach, that sip definitely had me craving the feeling of being on one.\n\nDare I say trying Simply Pop might have been my gateway to becoming a prebiotic soda advocate? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go that far, but I will say my tasting experience has left me hopeful for the future of \u201chealthy sodas.\u201d\n\nRather than promising the world to soft drink lovers, Simply Pop focuses on offering a drink that\u2019s uniquely refreshing and tasty\u2014and I think that\u2019s the way to win over new fans, myself included.",

This economically competitive plan intends to boost the country's GDP by 4 to 5% while improving quality of life and protecting natural resources.\n\n\"We started running solar energy [at the] plant last year in 2024, and as of now at Stage 1, it covers 18% of total energy consumed by the plant,\" Coca-Cola Al Ahlia VP of Supply Chain Lola Kurbanova said in a video for Gulf Coca-Cola Beverages, adding that Stage 2 will boost clean-energy production by another 5% and later possibly another 7%.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola has come under scrutiny for some of its business practices, including its use of artificial intelligence \u2014 which requires massive amounts of energy and can take jobs away from creative workers \u2014 it has also received praise for other initiatives, like its plan to reduce plastic waste in Asia. In the UAE, the adoption of solar is a win on multiple levels.\n\n\"This is a great example of how innovative clean-energy solutions can drive both environmental and business outcomes,\" said Emerge General Manager Michel Abi Saab, pointing to how solar is a low-cost form of energy that reduces electricity costs.\n\nThe Al Ain plant distributes Coca-Cola to the seven emirates of the UAE, Oman, and other Gulf countries, according to the Al Ahlia Group. Coca-Cola Al Ahlia CEO Banu Karakullukcu Cetin suggested solar initiatives could be coming to other facilities soon.\n\n\"We are eager to initiate similar projects at our different facilities in the region,\" she said in a statement for Gulf Coca-Cola Beverages.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Coca-Cola Launches New Orange Cream Soda Flavor A nostalgic blend of orange and cream set to hit shelves next month\n\nCoca-Cola is set to refresh the soda market with the launch of its new Orange Cream flavor, scheduled to hit shelves on February 10 across the U.S. and Canada. This latest addition adds to Coca-Cola's lineup of inventive flavors, following nostalgic inspirations like strawberry and Oreo.\n\nAccording to Coca-Cola, the Orange Cream flavor is far more than just another carbonated drink; it's rooted in cultural nostalgia. The company noted, \"Orange Cream is a cultural force. It\u2019s been around since 1905 but has seen a renaissance, with interest growing incrementally over the last 10 years. This flavor was crafted in response to consumer demand for the iconic and nostalgic taste of orange cream.\" Many consumers might recall the delightful taste of orange creamsicles from summertime ice cream trucks, making this new flavor strike a significant chord.\n\nThe introduction of Coca-Cola Orange Cream is backed by bold marketing initiatives. Coca-Cola has launched its \u201cWe All Scream\u201d campaign to promote the flavor, positioning it as part of the larger nostalgia trend among flavors. A playful advertisement features the new Orange Cream soda stacked on top of an ice cream truck, accompanied by the familiar jingle of ice cream trucks from childhood. The ad highlights the excitement surrounding the product, depicting excited adults running toward the truck, only for it to run out due to overwhelming popularity. To wrap up, the ad ends with the catchy tagline, \u201cWe all scream for Orange Cream.\u201d\n\nThis advertisement is just one piece of Coca-Cola's comprehensive marketing strategy, set to roll out across various platforms. The campaign will be visible on national TV, online videos, social media, and through experiential marketing formats like sampling events. Coca-Cola aims to penetrate both the hearts and taste buds of consumers through this multi-faceted approach.\n\nInterestingly, this launch coincides with Pepsi\u2019s recent debut of its Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, marking heightened competition between the two soda giants. Coca-Cola's new flavor also follows its decision to discontinue the Coca-Cola Spiced flavor after just one year on the market. Despite the excitement, the Orange Cream drink is not classified as a permanent offering. A brand spokesperson clarified, \"planned to be in-market until Q1 2026,\" but noted there is \"flexibility\" to adjust this timeline based on consumer response.\n\nMarketing executive Sue Lynne Cha elaborated on the vision behind the new flavor: \"Coca-Cola Orange Cream intends to reconnect consumers with a beloved flavor tradition. By blending our iconic Coca-Cola formula with refreshing orange and smooth creamy vanilla flavors, we are introducing an all-new beverage.\" This innovation seeks to offer consumers a unique experience by merging nostalgia with Coca-Cola's signature taste.\n\nThe launch of Orange Cream marks yet another exciting chapter for Coca-Cola, continuing its legacy of innovative flavors aimed at evoking warm memories and reimagining iconic tastes. The anticipation mounts as consumers await February 10 to discover if this blend lives up to its nostalgic promise.",

(The Associated Press) - PepsiCo confirmed Friday that it\u2019s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.\n\nLaguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company\u2019s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.\n\nSince President Donald Trump returned to the White House last month, U.S. government agencies, companies and schools have rushed to reevaluate policies and programs they adopted with the goal of reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nTrump ended DEI programs within the federal government and has warned schools to end DEI programs or risk losing federal money.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s rollback came as Coca-Cola reaffirmed support for its DEI efforts.\n\nIn its annual report, Atlanta-based Coke warned that its business could be negatively affected if it is unable to attract employees that reflect its broad range of customers.\n\n\u201cFailure to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion \u2026 could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success,\u201d the company said.\n\nCoca-Cola has set a goal of having women in 50% of its senior leadership roles by 2030. Coke has also said that it wants race and ethnicity representation that reflects national census data at all levels of the company in the U.S.\n\nRobby Starbuck, a conservative activist who targets corporate DEI programs, applauded PepsiCo\u2019s actions on Friday. In a post on X, Starbuck said Coca-Cola \u201cshould be very nervous about continuing with their woke policies.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo joins a long list of companies that have reigned in diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory and before that, a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nCopyright 2025 WANF.

            "content": "What to know about the trendy sodas that tout gut-health benefits. (Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Poppi)\n\nGut health is having quite the moment. People are increasingly turning to prebiotic sodas, marketed as healthy fizzy drinks with gut-boosting benefits. Leading the movement are brands Poppi and Olipop, whose popularity is rapidly growing. Both were ranked among the top 10 fastest-growing brands of 2024, and Olipop just announced that its value reached $1.85 billion.\n\nAs competition has heated up between Poppi and Olipop\u2014with Olipop going on the offensive over Poppi\u2019s over-the-top attempt to appeal to TikTok influencers in the lead-up to the Super Bowl\u2014the two brands have a new competitor: Coca-Cola\u2019s Simply Pop.\n\nThe soda giant has been paying attention to the rising interest in prebiotic sodas and has created a new line of sodas with a mix of fruit juices and prebiotic fiber under its Simply juice brand.\n\nBut as popular as these sodas have become, are they actually healthy?\n\nHere\u2019s how prebiotic sodas stack up against the Sprites and Pepsis of the world\u2014and against their own claims.\n\nWhat prebiotic sodas claim\n\nPoppi, Olipop, and Simply Pop are all \u201cprebiotic\u201d sodas, meaning they theoretically feed the good bacteria in your gut with the fiber they contain (as opposed to kombucha, which contains probiotics, which are themselves beneficial bacteria).\n\nNewcomer Simply Pop has hopped on the gut-friendly marketing bandwagon, with the Coca-Cola website claiming that the sodas \u201c\u200b\u200bsupport gut health\u201d from the six grams of fiber derived from soluble corn fiber. Each 12-ounce can has 10 grams of sugar\u2014twice the amount of competitor Poppi. The brand also says that the drink has vitamin C and zinc to \u201csupport immune health.\u201d\n\nPoppi markets its soda with the invitation for consumers to get \u201call the soda feels with 5g sugar, ingredients you can love and prebiotics.\u201d Poppi contains about two to three grams of fiber per can (about 10% of recommended daily fiber intake) in the form of organic agave inulin, five grams of sugar\u201434 grams of sugar fewer than a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola\u2014along with other ingredients like apple cider vinegar, stevia, and apple juice.\n\nPoppi\u2019s previous health claims\u2014the cans used to say \u201cbe gut healthy\u201d\u2014led to a class-action lawsuit last year, where one woman sued the company after buying the drinks for their advertised gut health benefits, only to learn that those are negligible from its couple grams of prebiotic agave inulin fiber.\n\nThe other prebiotic soda giant, Olipop, calls itself \u201ca new kind of soda\u201d that \u201csupports digestive health.\u201d Its website describes the product as \u201ca leading research-backed functional beverage that actually tastes good while supporting your gut microbiome, and digestive health.\u201d\n\nTo back up its gut-health claims, Olipop has its own proprietary blend\u2014called \u201cOLISmart\u201d\u2014of cassava root fiber, chicory root inulin, jerusalem artichoke inulin, nopal cactus, marshmallow root, calendula flower, and kudzu root. It boasts the lowest sugar of the three prebiotic sodas\u2014four grams of sugar\u2014and the highest fiber amount at nine grams, which is almost a third of your recommended daily fiber intake.\n\nBut are prebiotic sodas healthy?\n\nThe answer is twofold, says NYU Professor of Nutrition and registered dietitian Lisa Young.\n\n\u201cIf you want to have something that has a little bit less sugar than soda, by all means it\u2019s fine,\u201d Young tells Fortune. \u201cBut it\u2019s highly unlikely that it\u2019s going to do a whole lot for your gut.\u201d\n\nWhile Young is skeptical of prebiotic sodas\u2019 gut health claims, she does think they offer a better soda alternative. \"They\u2019re healthier because they have less sugar,\u201d she says, comparing them to conventional sugar-packed sodas. Young also thinks they are a better alternative than diet sodas made with controversial artificial sweeteners like aspartame, which became classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d in July 2023 by the World Health Organization.\n\nBut what bothers her is that the health claims are largely tied to the idea of being gut-friendly\u2014meaning they are supposed to boost the health of your gut microbiome, which has been connected to improved mental health and lower colorectal cancer risk, among other key health benefits.\n\nFirst, Young doesn\u2019t think the sodas have enough fiber to support your gut\u2014especially Poppi, which has two to three grams of fiber per can, which is only about 10% of the daily recommended fiber intake based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines. Poppi\u2019s can also notes on the nutrition label that it is \u201cnot a significant source of fiber.\u201d\n\nOlipop and Poppi did not respond to requests for comment on this article.\n\nPoppi\u2019s health claims and low fiber content even led to a class-action lawsuit last year, where one woman sued the company after buying the drinks for their advertised gut health benefits, only to learn that those are negligible from only a couple grams of prebiotic agave inulin fiber.\n\nOlipop, on the other hand, has a much higher fiber content\u2014nine grams per can, which is nearly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake.\n\nEven so, Young says that the sodas\u2019 sources of fiber are not the best way to get your fiber or its benefits. Because the fiber comes in an extracted form\u2014like chicory root fiber or cassava root fiber\u2014you\u2019re not getting all of the nutritional benefits that come from high-fiber, whole foods like fruits and vegetables, she says.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about gut health, you\u2019re talking about adding a wide variety of fruits and vegetables\u201d containing prebiotics that support the bacteria in your gut, Young says.\n\n\u201cHaving a sparkling soda that has some apple cider vinegar and some chicory root fiber and then putting a claim on it\u2014it\u2019s really defeating the purpose,\u201d she adds. As a dietitian, she says, she would much rather see people looking to improve their gut health drink water, eat an apple or a sweet potato (which naturally contain prebiotics), and consume probiotic-rich fermented foods like yogurt or kimchi.\n\nYoung also warns that chicory root fiber\u2014found in Olipop\u2014can actually irritate some people\u2019s stomachs, especially those with irritable bowel syndrome or who need to adhere to a low-FODMAP diet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to have it once in a while, but don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to be any healthier by having it,\u201d Young says. \u201cThere are actual foods to really improve your gut health.\u201d Those include probiotic-rich fermented foods, like kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kimchi, and prebiotic-rich, fiber-packed foods like whole grains, leafy greens, and soybeans.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

With Barrilitos, every snack or meal becomes a delightful experience, perfect for celebrating life's special moments.\"\n\nThere is one caveat, though.\n\nFor now, this is only planned to be a regional relaunch in California, southern Nevada, Oklahoma, and Texas. But who knows, maybe if we all make enough noise, we can get it throughout the U.S. too. Coca-Cola also noted that it's important to remind everyone that each bottle is produced and imported from Mexico, just in case you didn't think you were getting the real deal.\n\n",

            "content": "This Warren Buffett favorite has a place in a diversified portfolio.\n\nAlmost two months into 2025, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.40%) is holding on to its gains from last year, but the index hasn't moved much higher; it's up just 4% so far this year. Valuations are higher than average, and that could signal some necessity for a correction.\n\nBut many companies are reporting solid performance, like Coca-Cola (KO -0.50%). After struggling with high inflation and higher costs, it demonstrated strong results in the 2024 fourth quarter. Here are three reasons to buy it right now.\n\n1. Coca-Cola has pricing power\n\nCoca-Cola is the largest beverage company in the world, and fans drink its popular products in 200 countries. Its namesake brand is one of the most recognized in the world, and people who love it are willing to pay a premium for it. That's called pricing power.\n\nThere's been some struggle as inflation makes everything more expensive, and Coca-Cola has had to balance absorbing and passing along higher costs. It has experimented with several ways to do this, with concepts including smaller packages and returnable glass bottles.\n\nThe glass bottle initiative has become an important effort in recruiting new customers to its brand, keeping costs lower while maintaining premium packaging.\n\nRevenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter year over year and 3% for the full year, even though unit case volume increased 2% and 1% respectively. Organic revenue, which leaves out factors like acquisitions and foreign exchange, was up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year.\n\nPrice/mix, which tracks how much growth came from pricing, was up 9% year over year in the quarter, with 8 percentage points coming from pricing action. Management sees that trend continuing into 2025, with pricing adding more to revenue than in a regular year, but ultimately moderating as inflation does.\n\n2. It's incredibly profitable\n\nCoca-Cola has been at this for more than a century -- it's been around since 1886. It has a well-established formula for creating and marketing beverages and turning sales into profits.\n\nFor example, part of this strategy is acquiring new brands that already have a following, and as it integrates the brand into its distribution system, it can sell it to more people more efficiently.\n\nPricing power becomes even more important when there's inflationary pressure, and pricing actions do more than increase sales. Successful price increases that don't curb demand allow the company to cover increasing costs while still making a profit. Earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% year over year in the fourth quarter to $0.51, and for the full year, they declined slightly to $2.46.\n\nIn general, management charts its growth with comparable metrics, which take out one-time charges and the like. Comparable EPS also increased 12% to $0.55, while for the full year it increased 7% to $2.88. That beat the average Wall Street consensus of $0.52 for the quarter and $2.85 for the full year.\n\nMinus a tax-related decrease, Coca-Cola generated $10.8 billion in free cash flow. This is how it can pay for its storied dividend and keep investors happy, as I'll point out next.\n\n3. Two words: the dividend\n\nEven when Coca-Cola isn't at its best, it provides an excellent benefit for investors in its almost unbeatable dividend. The company is a Dividend King, and it's paid and raised its dividend annually for the past 62 years. There are only eight other companies on the market that have a longer track record.\n\nNot all Dividend Kings have a high yield, since their value is in their reliability. But Coca-Cola's dividend averages around 3%. At today's share price, that yields 2.8% because the stock is up 11% this year, beating the market. That's still more than double the S&P 500 average.\n\nCoca-Cola isn't a growth stock, and even though it's beating the market right now, investors shouldn't expect long-term market outperformance. It's an excellent choice for a safe stock or a dividend stock for a well-diversified portfolio, and its recent results underscore its long-term investing thesis as a solid, reliable company you can hold forever.",

As a result, the pair believed that the Club World Cup should have been included in their existing deals, which run until 2030.\n\nIt is unclear whether Coca-Cola\u2019s newly announced sponsorship of the Club World Cup is an expansion of its existing partnership with Fifa or a standalone deal for the tournament, which is taking place in the US in June and July.\n\nWhen asked for clarification, Fifa referred SportsPro back to its official statement, which said that Coca-Cola would be \u2018continuing its partnership by activating the Fifa Club World Cup 2025\u2019. Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs part of the deal, Coca-Cola will run fan engagement activities in US cities and around the world, while its portfolio of drinks will also be available to players and fans in attendance.\n\n\u201cSports partnerships like the one we have with Fifa are an important growth driver for our company, brands and global system, and the Fifa Club World Cup will be a significant moment to bring the world together through the power of sport,\u201d said Brad Ross, vice president of global sports and entertainment marketing and partnerships at Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cFootball fans are among the most passionate in the world, and we\u2019re honoured to be part of these moments by refreshing fans and athletes with our portfolio of beverages and providing them with innovative experiences.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola is the latest company to sign up for the Club World Cup, which is also being sponsored by beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, Chinese consumer electronics brand Hisense, and Bank of America, all of which have preexisting relationships with Fifa.\n\nThe governing body had initially struggled to generate commercial interest in the tournament, which is being broadcast globally by DAZN as part of a US$1 billion deal. The Athletic previously reported that Fifa had been seeking up to ten sponsors for the competition, with each paying more than US$100 million.\n\n\u201cThe Coca-Cola Company has been involved in stadium advertising at every Fifa World Cup since 1950 and has provided many memorable experiences in global football over the decades,\u201d added Fifa chief business officer Romy Gai.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have such an important and a longstanding partner on board as we usher in a new era in global club football with the Fifa Club World Cup. This will be an exciting, inclusive and a truly global tournament that will ultimately further the development of the club game while delivering value to our partners.\u201d\n\nThe Club World Cup gets underway on 14th June and will feature 32 teams, including 12 European sides, six South American clubs, five from the Concacaf region, one from Oceania and four representatives each from Africa and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\n\nSportsPro New York 2025 will tackle challenges and uncover opportunities in the largest sports media market in the world.

KO has warned that revising its diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies could negatively affect the beverage giant\u2019s business.\n\nThe warning comes in light of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order mandating federal contractors to comply with the ban on DEI programs, making it a crucial factor for companies operating in government-funded settings.\n\nCoca-cola emphasized the importance of hiring a diverse and skilled workforce that mirrors the broad consumer base it serves globally.\n\nAs competition for employees increases, the soft-drink maker acknowledged that not being able to recruit essential talent, particularly individuals with expertise in artificial intelligence, digital marketing, and analytics, could impact its business.\n\n\u201cIf we are unable to attract or retain specialized talent or top talent with diverse perspectives, experiences and backgrounds that reflect the broad range of consumers and markets we serve around the world, our business could be negatively affected,\u201d the company\u2019s filing has this statement under its risk factors.\n\nThe company noted that its success relies on its capacity to sustain a workforce that embodies a range of diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\nAlso Read: Walmart Q4 Earnings Shine, But Soft FY26 Outlook Disappoints Street\n\nAlso, increasing competition, elevated compensation demands, and a constrained labor market create substantial challenges.\n\nAdditionally, shifts in laws and policies may further complicate the recruitment of specialized talent. Coca-Cola cautioned that losing seasoned employees could diminish its competitive advantage and deplete valuable institutional knowledge.\n\nPresident Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum, applying universally without exceptions.\n\nIn response, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told investors during last week\u2019s earnings call, \u201cIf aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET bottles.\u201d\n\nWhile he recognized that packaging costs are only a fraction of the company\u2019s total expenses, he emphasized that the increase in aluminum prices remains a significant concern.\n\nRecently, Coca-Cola reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 6% year-on-year to $11.5 billion and an adjusted EPS of $0.55, both above the consensus estimate.\n\nThe revenue increase included a 5% climb in concentrate sales and a 9% growth in price/mix.\n\nPrice Action: KO shares are trading higher by 0.51% at $70.40 at the last check Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage via Shutterstock.",

As popular options like Poppi and Olipop have claimed shelf space at more than just health-food stores, there\u2019ve been grabby commercials (\u201cWhat if there were a better soda?\u201d) and news of soaring billion-dollar valuations. Now, the wave of prebiotic drinks has grown so big, it\u2019s swept up an OG soda giant too: In a move that says \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em,\u201d Coca-Cola just launched its very own fiber bevvy, Simply Pop, within its juice line Simply. And it\u2019s rolling out in five flavors\u2014strawberry, pineapple mango, fruit punch, lime, and citrus punch\u2014starting this month in certain markets and expanding nationwide through 2025.\n\nLike other prebiotic sodas on the market, Coke\u2019s new Simply Pop contains an added boost of soluble fiber, or a type of fiber that dissolves in water (as opposed to insoluble fiber, BTW, which remains intact in liquid). All fibers generally aren\u2019t digested well in your small intestine and slide through to your large intestine relatively unscathed, which can help keep you regular. But soluble fiber gets its unique claim to gut-health fame for what happens next: It turns into a gel that can serve as a prebiotic, or fuel for the positive gut bugs (a.k.a. probiotics) in your colon, which can support a thriving bacterial community, or microbiome. And a healthy gut is related to better health more broadly, both on the physical and mental fronts, Samantha Cassetty, MS, RD, a NYC-based registered dietitian, tells SELF.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder these prebiotic drinks have become a magnet for gut-health aficionados. But how much of these benefits can you really expect from sipping on the occasional beverage? And do they really stack up to the perks of just\u2026eating more fiber the regular way? Read on to learn what experts say prebiotic sodas can\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014do for you, and how they recommend you work them into your life, if you choose to do so.\n\nPrebiotic options are generally healthier than classic sodas.\n\nWhen you opt for a prebiotic bevvy, you\u2019re getting at least some of that beneficial prebiotic fiber, versus none in a regular soda\u2014which is definitely worth something when you consider that most people don\u2019t consume enough fiber.\n\nAs Cassetty points out, only about 5% of Americans are hitting the daily recommended intake, which ranges from 25 to 38 grams (depending on age and sex). There isn\u2019t a guideline for prebiotic fiber, in particular, but the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics suggests a target of five grams per day (most of the fiber we get from foods is insoluble, or not prebiotic). For reference, Simply Pop clocks in at six grams per can, and Olipop packs nine grams, both of which surpass that guideline; Poppi, by contrast, contains two to three grams per can\u2014a quantity low enough that a lawsuit was brought against the brand last year alleging that its gut-health claims were misleading.",

Lebanon Daily News\n\nABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages is building a new sales and distribution center in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe $100 million, 240,000-square-foot facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2026.\n\nABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages is planning to build a state-of-the-art sales and distribution center in South Lebanon Township.\n\nThe Lebanon Valley Economic Development Cooperation sold 50.8 acres of land in the Lebanon Valley Business Park to ABARTA Coca-Cola for the new facility. LVEDC President and CEO Susan Eberly said she is pleased that they selected Lebanon County for their new facility.\n\n\"We have been working diligently to ensure a nice transition,\" she said in an email. \"ABARTA will break ground this summer with expectations of being fully operational by the end of 2026.\"\n\nABARTA and its subsidiary, ACCB Harrisburg RE, LLC, will invest over $100 million into the 240,000-square-foot facility. Officials said the goal of the new facility is to significantly expand ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages operations and capabilities, providing a much larger and more technologically advanced space than any of ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages\u2019 existing centers.\n\n\"We are thrilled to begin this next chapter for ABARTA Coca-Cola,\" Charlie Bitzer, Executive Chair of ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages, said in a release. \"This facility will not only enhance our operations here in Harrisburg, but it will also play a critical role in supporting our entire territory, helping us continue to provide excellent service to our communities.\"\n\nACCB Harrisburg has partnered with BW Design Group for strategic network planning and construction services. Officials said new facility will feature the latest automated technology, including Vertique, a cutting-edge case-picking and pallet-building system.\n\nThe current Harrisburg facility distributes 6.7 million cases of product per year and serves 17 counties. ABARTA Coca-Cola is the exclusive distributor of Coca-Cola beverages throughout most of Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh, Erie, Johnstown, Altoona, Harrisburg, Mt. Pocono, the Lehigh Valley, and parts of West Virginia and Ohio.\n\nOfficials said the new sales and distribution center will allow ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages to grow, improve efficiencies, and create competitive advantages across its entire service territory.\n\n\u201cOur business has always been rooted in family, service and community,\u201d said Jim Dinderman, Chief Operating Officer of ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages, \u201cby expanding our footprint and putting down roots in Harrisburg this project showcases our optimism and commitment to our customers and our market.\u201d\n\nResidents looking for more information about ABARTA Coca-Cola Beverages and their expansion plans can visit the company's website at abartacocacola.com.\n\nMatthew Toth is a reporter for the Lebanon Daily News.

The less sugary soda alternatives are designed to boost gut health.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola is stepping into the emerging prebiotic soda market with its own line of soda alternatives.\n\nAccording to The Coca-Cola Company, Simply Pop will come in five flavors and will be available in some markets by the end of February. Here\u2019s what to know.\n\nWhat is Simply Pop?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nSimply is a new line of prebiotic sodas from The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nRELATED: Trader Joe's recalls its Organic Acai Bowls over potential plastic contamination\n\nThey\u2019re made with 6 grams of prebiotic fiber designed to support gut health and Vitamin C and Zinc to support immune function.\n\nAccording to Coca-Cola, there\u2019s no added sugar and each can contains 25-30% real fruit juice from concentrate. They come in five flavors \u2014 Strawberry, Pineapple Mango, Fruit Punch, Lime and Citrus Punch.\n\nWhat is prebiotic soda?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nPrebiotic sodas are typically lower sugar soda alternatives that claim to boost gut health with added fiber. Probiotic products are made up of healthy bacteria to help with gut health, but prebiotic sodas contain fiber that humans can't digest. They\u2019re designed to help the microbiome, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nPrebiotic sodas contain the plant-based fiber inulin, which is an ingredient in certain fruits, vegetables and grains. The inulin in fiber-enhanced drinks typically comes from agave or chicory root.\n\nAs a soluble fiber, inulin dissolves in water, so you don\u2019t feel or taste it in the soda. You can also buy inulin supplements in tablet, gummy and powder forms.\n\nRELATED: This breakfast food might prevent colon cancer\n\nPrebiotic sodas are among the frenzy of functional beverages \u2013 drinks designed to do more than just taste good or hydrate. What started in the late 1980s with caffeine- and vitamin-laced energy drinks like Red Bull has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry. Hundreds of brands are vying for consumers\u2019 attention with increasingly exotic ingredients and wellness-focused marketing.\n\nRELATED: Millions of granola bars recalled due to 'potential presence of metal': FDA\n\nIn the U.S., sales of functional beverages jumped 54% to $9.2 billion between March 2020 and March 2024, according to NielsenIQ. That was faster than the 43% growth for the non-alcoholic beverage market overall. Functional beverages now make up about 10% of the total U.S. non-alcoholic beverage market.\n\nWhen will Simply Pop be available?\n\nWhat's next:\n\nSimply Pop will be available later this month at retailers in select regions and online nationwide via Amazon Fresh. The brand will expand to additional markets nationwide throughout the year, according to Coca-Cola.",

Notably, the company has seen success with milk and protein shakes.\n\nSimply, which first started as an orange juice brand, has expanded into other fruit juices, mocktail mixes, canned cocktails and now sodas. Using the Simply name was based on consumer feedback and adoration for the 21-year-old brand.\n\nCoca-Cola is likely hoping the recognizable \"Simply\" brand will help the new soda quickly establish itself, against Poppi and Olipop, the two prebiotic-packed soda startups that have attracted a loyal fandom in their few short years of existence.\n\n\"After watching from the sidelines, Coke clearly has determined that the gut soda segment has legs,\" Duane Stanford, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, told CNN. \"The Simply brand is a smart way to get into a fast-growing and premium soda segment that is attractive to young consumers and resonates on social media.\"\n\nAlthough the functional beverage space trails in sales compared to regular sodas, it's growing at a faster pace. The category is projected to generate $2 billion in sales by 2029, according to Coca-Cola's research.\n\n\"There's a role that functional beverages are playing in people's lives,\" Coca-Cola's Kerr said. \"It's giving people more chances and to try different things at different times throughout the day.\"\n\nOlipop is probably the biggest beneficiary of the wellness trend, with the soda brand announcing a $1.85 billion valuation last week. And for the first time since its 2018 launch, the brand turned a profit with last year's sales surpassing $400 million - double compared to the year prior.\n\nSimply Pop is launching with five flavors: lime, pineapple mango, fruit punch, citrus punch, and strawberry. They will be available by the case on Amazon and sold in 12-ounce cans for $2.49 each at national grocery stores.\n\nAlthough Coca-Cola has a bigger retail footprint, marketing budget and distribution powers, the 133-year-old brand's entrance into the space isn't scaring Olipop CEO Ben Goodwin.\n\n\"It's a massive honor that the largest soda brand in the world has decided that the category I invented, and the Olipop team has brought to life, is a great place for them to seek growth,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            "content": "Coca-Cola is launching a prebiotic soda brand called Simply Pop, taking on upstarts Olipop and Poppi.\n\nStarting in late February, consumers on the West Coast and in the Southeast will be able to try Coke's iteration of the trendy drink.\n\nSoda consumption has broadly fallen in the U.S. over the last two decades, hurt by health concerns and an increase in alternatives on the market, from cold brew to energy drinks to water. But in the last five years, sodas containing prebiotics have taken off, thanks to industry newcomers Olipop and Poppi.\n\nOlipop recently raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.85 billion, the company announced Wednesday. And Poppi made its second straight Super Bowl appearance in this year's game, shelling out up to $8 million to reach the game's record audience.\n\nDigestive health soft drinks have grown from a $197 million category in the U.S. in 2020 to one of roughly $440 million in 2024, according to Euromonitor International data. Still, it's a fraction of the overall soda market, which is worth billions of dollars.\n\nSimply Pop's first product lineup leans fruity, in a nod to Coke's Simply juice brand. Flavors include pineapple mango, lime, strawberry, fruit punch and citrus punch.\n\n\"We went out and really listened to consumers. They love this space, they're really looking for stuff that tastes good, and that's something we know how to deliver on at Simply and at Coke,\" said Becca Kerr, CEO of Coke's North American nutrition unit, which includes its Simply and Fairlife brands.\n\nSimply Pop drinks have no added sugar and contain 25% to 30% real fruit juice, the company said. They also contain vitamin C and zinc, which can boost the immune system.\n\nThey also have six grams of prebiotic fiber \u2014 triple Poppi's fiber content but less than Olipop's nine grams.\n\nPrebiotics have taken off thanks to claims that they can boost \"gut health\" by helping beneficial bacteria grow in the gut. Their health benefits haven't been conclusively proven.\n\n\"We do see that there tends to be an appetite for these type of products with younger consumers, like millennial and Gen Z,\" Kerr said. \"We see an interest in these types of products from multicultural consumers.\"\n\nBut health claims can prompt pushback. Poppi is in settlement talks over a lawsuit filed in late May that challenges the company's marketing, arguing that Poppi's products are not as healthy for the gut as advertised.\n\nCoke has had the prebiotic soda category on its radar for several years, according to Kerr. Olipop CEO and co-founder Ben Goodwin told CNBC in 2023 that both Coke and PepsiCo had already approached the company about a potential sale. Pepsi is reported to be planning its own prebiotic soda launch in 2025.\n\nWhile it's a newcomer to the segment, Coke has some obvious advantages: more than 100 years dominating the soda category, marketing and distribution muscle, and $47 billion in revenue in 2024 \u2014 compared with the more than $400 million in sales that Olipop netted in 2024.\n\nStill, Coke has failed before when trying to chase a drink trend. It pulled its Coke Spiced flavor off the shelves in 2024 just months after declaring it a permanent addition. And in 2023, it slashed distribution of its Aha sparkling water brand after the product failed to take off with consumers.",

According to Harvard Health, prebiotics are ingredients found in certain foods \"that your intestines can't fully digest,\" like starches, oligosaccharides, inulin, and pectin, which are often found in high-fiber foods. They typically work together with probiotics, which are living microorganisms that \"maintain or improve the balance of good to bad bacteria in your digestive system.\" Those are often found in foods like yogurt and kimchi. The jury is still out on how much prebiotics can really do for you, but Harvard Health did note that some studies show it can \"improve intestinal absorption of dietary calcium better blood sugar control,\" along with helping your immune system function and even reduce your risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nSimply Pop Prebiotic Soda Flavors Strawberry\n\nPineapple Mango\n\nFruit Punch\n\nLime\n\nCitrus Punch\n\nHowever, you don't necessarily need to drink your prebiotics. You can also find prebiotics in foods like garlic, asparagus, and wheat bread. In fact, according to a 2023 study by San Jos\u00e9 State University, people should consume about five grams of prebiotics daily, which they can achieve by eating half of a small (four-ounce) onion.\n\nThe only thing Coca-Cola may want to be mindful of is ensuring it's actually delivering all the health benefits it promises. In 2024, the prebiotic soda company Poppi faced a class action lawsuit claiming the soda lacks any meaningful gut health benefits.\n\n\"[Poppi's] success is largely owed to its ability to preserve the flavor and sweetness of traditional sodas while claiming to be 'gut healthy' due to its inclusion of 'prebiotics' \u2014 a specific type of dietary fiber commonly found in food like bananas and whole grains,\" the complaint read. \"However, Defendant\u2019s Poppi soda only contains two grams of prebiotic fiber, an amount too low to cause meaningful gut health benefits for the consumer from just one can. Accordingly, a consumer would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits from its prebiotic fiber. However, even if a consumer were to do this, Poppi\u2019s high sugar content would offset most, if not all, of these purported gut health benefits.\"\n\nStill, the beverage industry has turned the tiny prebiotic into a booming business, with the prebiotic soda company Olipop hitting a $1.85 billion valuation in 2025. According to data by Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at about $262.2 million in 2024 and is set to hit $545.5 million by 2034, making it a pretty sound investment for brands like Coke.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nCoca-Cola is jumping in on the trend of prebiotic sodas with a new drink: Simply Pop.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company announced the beverage on Monday, creating new competition for popular soda alternatives like Poppi and Olipop. Simply Pop will roll out in five flavors this month: strawberry, lime, pineapple mango, fruit punch, and citrus punch.\n\nCoca-Cola noted on its website that this is the \u201cfirst-ever prebiotic soda made with real fruit juice.\u201d Similarly to all prebiotic sodas, Simply Pop aims to \u201csupport gut health,\u201d meaning there\u2019s prebiotic fiber in it and no added sugars. The drink also has Vitamin C and Zinc to support immune function.\n\nCEO of Coca-Cola\u2019s nutrition unit, Becca Kerr, said Simply Pop came amid the rising popularity of prebiotic sodas.\n\n\u201cWe saw the prebiotic soda space really emerging as an area of interest for consumers, and we were paying really close attention to it,\u201d Kerr told CNN. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a space that is a great consumer fit and also offers a lot of growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kerr, creating Simply Pop is part of Coca-Cola\u2019s aim to become a \u201ctotal beverage company,\u201d beyond its usual drinks.\n\nSimply Pop will be released in five different flavors ( The Coca-Cola Company )\n\nAlong with the new prebiotic soda, Simply has created a range of sweet beverages. The brand, founded in 2001, famously makes Simply juices, like orange, limeades, and lemonade. Simply also makes smoothies and mixes for making cocktails.\n\nPrebiotic sodas have become immensely popular in recent years, offering classic flavors like cola and lemon-lime but with a fraction of the sugar and other supposed health benefits.\n\nHowever, Poppi was recently accused of misleading customers with its claim of \u201cgut health benefits.\u201d In a lawsuit filed against the brand last year, plaintiff Kristin Cobbs said Poppi contains just \u201ctwo grams of prebiotic fiber, an amount too low to cause meaningful gut health benefits for the consumer from just one can.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also alleged that the specific type of prebiotic used in Poppi, the dietary fiber agave inulin, can cause \u201cadverse health results\u201d and cited studies on consuming agave inulin. One study claimed that the prebiotic \u201ccan lead to inflammation and even liver damage at doses as small as 10 to 30 grams per day over a three-week period.\u201d Another stated that taking as little as 2.5 grams of prebiotic supplements, including agave inulin, can lead to a build-up of gas, causing abdominal discomfort.\n\nEarlier this month, Poppi\u2019s co-founder, Allison Ellsworth, hit back at the criticism the brand faced for sending influencers full-sized vending machines with cans of the prebiotic soda in them. Since the machines were sent to influencers ahead of the Super Bowl, fans questioned why something so extravagant and expensive was only shared with wealthy influencers and not the general public.\n\n\u201cThis vending machine campaign was put in place to bring awareness to the biggest soda moment of the year, the Super Bowl,\u201d Ellsworth said in a TikTok video posted on Poppi\u2019s account. \u201cWe planned to share Poppi across the U.S. with creatives hosting Super Bowl parties for their friends and families.\u201d\n\nShe continued to explain that Poppi would be bringing the vending machines to marketing events, community pop-ups, and giveaways which Ellsworth claimed was always the company\u2019s intention.\n\n\u201cWe hear you. So help us nominate your friends, your family, your favorite teacher\u2019s lounge, your sorority, your fraternity, whatever it is, wherever you guys want Poppi to show up, and let's get Poppi to the masses because, at the end of the day, we're a brand trying to revolutionize soda for the next generation,\u201d she said.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola is set to launch its new prebiotic soda brand, Simply Pop, in a bid to capture a share of the rapidly growing market for health-oriented beverages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis move positions the beverage giant against established players like Olipop, SunSip and Poppi, who have successfully carved out niches in the prebiotic soda segment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoda consumption in the US has declined significantly over the past two decades, driven by increasing health awareness and the rise of alt-beverages, like cold brews, energy drinks and flavoured waters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the prebiotic soda category has seen a surge in popularity, with sales projected to grow from $197 million in 2020 to approximately $440 million in 2024, according to Euromonitor International data. Despite this growth, prebiotic sodas still represent a small fraction of the overall soda market, which is valued in the billions.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting later this month, Simply Pop will be available to consumers on the West Coast and in the Southeast on the US. The initial product line-up features fruity flavours such as pineapple mango, lime, strawberry, fruit punch and citrus punch, reflecting Coca-Cola's existing Simply juice brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new beverages are touted as having no added sugar and containing 25% to 30% real fruit juice, alongside added vitamin C and zinc. Each serving also includes 6g of prebiotic fibre, which is higher than Poppi's offerings but lower than Olipop's 9g.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrebiotics, which are believed to support gut health, have gained traction among consumers, particularly younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola's entry into the prebiotic soda market comes at a time when competitors are also expanding their offerings. Olipop recently secured $50 million in funding, raising its valuation to $1.85 billion, while Poppi made headlines for its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement. Both brands have successfully marketed their products as healthier alternatives to traditional sodas, appealing to a health-conscious consumer base.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the health claims associated with prebiotic beverages have not been without controversy. Poppi is currently in settlement discussions regarding a lawsuit that challenges the health benefits of its products, indicating that regulatory scrutiny may be a concern for the entire category.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola's extensive experience in the beverage industry, coupled with its significant marketing and distribution capabilities, positions it favorably against smaller competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company reported revenues of $47 billion in 2024, dwarfing Olipop's estimated sales of over $400 million. Nevertheless, Coca-Cola's previous attempts to capitalize on emerging trends have met with mixed results, such as the discontinuation of its Coke Spiced flavour shortly after its launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n#CocaCola #prebioticsoda #softdrinks #US #newproducts #flavours #trends",

The two companies have been ranked as the world's top plastic polluters for five consecutive years, and Coca-Cola has taken the number one spot for six years, according to global environmental group Break Free From Plastic.\n\nPepsiCo produces approximately 2.5 million metric tons of plastic and Coca-Cola produces approximately 3.224 million metric tons of plastic annually, according to Break Free from Plastic.\n\nA European Union consumer protection group and environmental organizations filed a legal complaint against Coca-Cola, Nestle, and Danone last November, accusing them of being misleading when representing packaging as 100% recycled or 100% recyclable.\n\nThe LA lawsuit said Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have employed \u201cdisinformation campaigns\u201d for consumers to purchase single-use plastic, believing them to be recyclable and less harmful to the environment.\n\nIt alleged that both companies promised to create a \u201ccircular economy\u201d for its bottles, in which plastic bottles can be recycled and reused an endless number of times, while in reality plastic bottles can only be recycled once, if at all.\n\nThe American Beverage Association, which PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are a part of, denied the lawsuit\u2019s accusations about their plastic bottle recycling labels.\n\n\u201cThe allegation that our packaging is not and will not be recycled is simply not true,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesperson William Dermody said in a statement.\n\nDermody said California had a 71% bottle recycling rate in 2023, one of the highest in the country, and that their bottles are \u201cdesigned to be recycled and remade and can include up to 100% recycled plastic.\u201d\n\nIn 2022 alone, an estimated 121,324 to 179,656 tons of plastic waste leaked into the land and ocean in California, and plastics make up seven of the top 10 litter products found on beaches, the lawsuit states.\n\nA big part of the problem is microplastics.\n\nPlastics that have leaked into the environment eventually disintegrate into tiny pieces of plastic measuring five millimeters or less. They can affect soil and plant growth, marine and fish life, and are nearly impossible to remove from the environment, the lawsuit states.\n\nSome Australian researchers, on behalf of the World Wildlife Fund, calculated in 2019 that many people each week consume roughly 5 grams of plastic from common food and beverages, and microplastics have been found in body tissues and organs. Though research is still limited overall, there are growing concerns that microplastics in the body could potentially be linked to heart disease, Alzheimer's and dementia, and other problems.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking a court order to stop the companies\u2019 \u201cunfair and deceptive business practices\u201d as well as restitution for consumers and civil penalties of up to $2,500 per violation.\n\nIn February 2020, environmental nonprofit Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit in California asking for damages and an order for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle USA, Procter & Gamble and six other companies to clean up the plastic waste they should be held responsible for.\n\nNew York state also sued PepsiCo last November for its role in creating the plastic waste that littering the Buffalo River, which empties into Lake Erie and supplies the city of Buffalo\u2019s drinking water. A judge dismissed the case Thursday, stating in a court filing that there was no \u201cfailure to warn\u201d the public on plastic-related dangers and that there was no cause of action to punish the companies for the actions of a third party \u2014 people who litter.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca\u2011Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend-paying beverage stocks to buy.\n\nThe American consumer staples industry is currently dealing with an evolving landscape, with a key shift being the heightened influence of health considerations on consumer behavior. Health and wellness are now common themes of interest among the younger generation of consumers and the prevalence of weight-loss drugs has also led to a change in consumer\u2019s eating habits, including both reducing appetite and altering the kind of foods and drinks they want.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nMany industry players have realized that they\u2019ll need to evolve and keep up with their consumers in order to achieve success. A great example is how an increasing number of beverage companies are now working to deliver more with their products, with one prominent trend being better-for-you (BFY) drinks. These are beverages that go beyond the scope of mere hydration and provide a solid benefit, such as supporting energy, gut health, cognition, immunity etc. However, in order for it to sell, a drink also needs to taste good, which presents a challenge in itself since the modern consumer is also wary of high sugar levels and artificial sweeteners. As a result, many industry players are now experimenting with natural sweeteners like allulose, stevia, and monk fruit alongside advanced sweetness modulation technologies.\n\nAnother major beverage category that is rapidly evolving with shifting consumer trends is that of alcohol. The rising importance of health and wellness has led to an increasing number of younger people drinking less alcohol, with many giving it up altogether. As a result, nearly every major alcohol company has come up with no- and low-alcohol versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don\u2019t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US.\n\nA recent looming threat for the American beverage industry has emerged in the form of tariffs. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum being imported into the US, eliminating previous country exceptions and exemptions. The blanket tariffs, set to go into effect next month, will have serious consequences for the beverage industry since nearly 75% of all new beverage launches in North America now appear in aluminum cans, according to supplier Crown. An increase in input costs will inevitably lead to a rise in prices for end consumers, causing serious problems for some beverage categories that are already struggling, such as craft beer. A short-term solution could be resorting to alternative packaging materials, such as glass or plastic, but that will undoubtedly come with its ecological concerns and ramifications. Or perhaps, this packaging problem could be a blessing in disguise and lead to some much-needed creative destruction and forever change the industry, since the drinks aisle has always been a hot spot in terms of innovation.",

Meanwhile, the broader industry has returned 4%, the Consumer Staples sector has risen 1% and the S&P 500 index has inched up 0.7% in the same period.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola's stock performance also reflects outperformance compared with its close competitors, including PepsiCo Inc. PEP, which has lost 0.7% in the same period. Also, KO shares have outpaced Monster Beverage MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s KDP gain of 3% and 2.4%, respectively.\n\n\n\nAt the current price of $68.87, the KO stock trades at a 6.3% discount from its 52-week high of $73.53. This indicates that the stock has further upside potential.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Stock Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKO trades above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating robust upward momentum and price stability.

In the fourth quarter, the company reported year-over-year revenue and earnings growth, beating estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) rose 12% year over year, whereas net sales advanced 6%. Organic revenues grew 14% from the prior-year quarter, whereas comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rallied 23% year over year.\n\n\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nKO\u2019s top and bottom lines benefited from continued business momentum, aided by improved pricing across markets. The top line gained from revenue growth across all operating segments, except for Bottling Investments. An improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales also contributed to revenue growth.\n\n\n\nIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales moved up 5% year over year, and the price/mix improved 9%. The price/mix benefited from higher pricing in the markets facing intense inflation, which contributed 4 points to the improvement. Also, pricing actions across the marketplace and a favorable mix contributed to the rest of the increase. In the quarter, concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of the unit case volume, which grew 2%, mainly driven by two additional days and the timing of concentrate shipments.\n\nKO\u2019s Upbeat Forward Outlook\n\nManagement\u2019s guidance for 2025 depicts optimism. The company anticipates organic revenue growth of 5-6%. Comparable currency-neutral EPS for 2025 is expected to increase 8-10% year over year. The company anticipates comparable EPS growth of 2-3% for 2025 from the $2.88 reported in 2024.\n\nUpward Estimate Trajectory of Coca-Cola\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO\u2019s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) increased 0.7% in the last seven days. The consensus estimate for 2026 EPS rose 0.9% in the past seven days. The upward revision in earnings estimates indicates analysts\u2019 confidence in the stock.\n\n\n\nFor 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO\u2019s sales and EPS implies 2% and 2.8% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus mark for 2026 sales and earnings suggests 5% and 8% year-over-year growth, respectively.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChallenges Facing KO\n\nCoca-Cola remains vulnerable to macroeconomic disruptions. These include low consumer confidence in China, geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East, and high inflation in Argentina, all of which could affect revenues.\n\n\n\nManagement notes that inflation is beginning to stabilize in developed markets, but many developing and emerging markets still face significant inflationary pressures, leading to higher prices. Also, currency fluctuations might pose challenges in certain regions.\n\n\n\nBased on the current rates and including the impacts of hedged positions, the company expects currency headwinds to impact 2025 revenues by 3-4%. Additionally, acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes are expected to slightly impact revenues in 2025. Comparable EPS growth is expected to include currency headwinds of 6-7%, and a marginal impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\n\n\nFor first-quarter 2025, comparable revenues are expected to include a 3-4% currency headwind, and a 2-3% negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable EPS is estimated to include a 5-6% currency headwind, and a 2-3% negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Premium Valuation\n\nKO commands a high valuation, reflecting its strong market positioning, brand power and long-term growth potential compared with other non-alcoholic beverage companies. We believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola trades at a significant premium to industry peers with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23.05X. The current valuation is below its five-year median of 26.61X and has surpassed the broader industry\u2019s multiple of 18.25X.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to deliver on its promise of offering something for everyone to drink, with a focus on innovation and digital expansion, is crucial. While success in these areas can strengthen its market leadership, failure can pose serious challenges for this soft drink giant. At this moment, its current valuation seems unwarranted. KO has a Value Score of F.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould You Buy KO Stock?\n\nCoca-Cola looks well-poised for long-term growth, driven by its innovation, marketing and digital initiatives. KO\u2019s strong market position and focus on meeting consumer preferences are significant strengths. While the stock\u2019s overvaluation can be linked to the company's long-term growth potential, supported by strong profitability and global expansion, exposure to macroeconomic challenges and persistent inflationary pressures remain concerning.\n\n\n\nMaintaining a position in the Coca-Cola stock appears to be a prudent choice at this time. While the company remains a compelling option for long-term investors, its ability to navigate current challenges will be key. Prospective investors should carefully assess its valuation, but for existing shareholders, retaining this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is a sensible decision.

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nWhen James Quincey became CEO of Coca-Cola in 2017, soda had broadly been in decline over its health effects. The beverage giant was embarking on an effort to diversify its reach beyond the sugary drink.\n\nA key move? Ditching the carbonation and sticking to the basics: cow milk.\n\nLaunched in 2012, Fairlife \u2014 originally founded as a joint venture between Coca-Cola and wholesale dairy producer Select Milk Producers \u2014 used whimsical, minimalistic packaging that fits with the influx of niche almond, protein and even pistachio milks, outperforming large-container beverages in the dairy aisle.\n\nIn 2020, Coca-Cola fully acquired Fairlife for an initial $980 million \u2014 an acquisition that has far exceeded the soda giant\u2019s expectations due in part to social media popularity in the health and wellness space. While Americans face higher food prices and a pullback in their spending, they\u2019re still drawn to Fairlife\u2019s ultra-filtered system that draws out lactose and sugar but doubles the protein.\n\nIn 2022, Coca-Cola announced that Fairlife\u2019s sales surpassed $1 billion.\n\nThe success is driven by Fairlife\u2019s Core Power protein shake brand, which remains a popular staple at many grocery stores and does not have many direct market-leading competitors.\n\nBut in its latest earnings call last week, Coca-Cola projected some moderation of Fairlife\u2019s growth in 2025 while it builds a facility in New York and carbonated beverages still make up the overwhelming majority of sales for Coca-Cola (its competitor, Pepsi, on the other hand, leans on its Frito-Lay snack brand). And when compared to Coca-Cola\u2019s other big acquisition in the non-soda space \u2014 Costa Coffee in 2018 \u2014 Fairlife has far outpaced it.\n\n\u201cThe expectations were never for Fairlife to be this successful, I think even for Coke,\u201d said Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst for finance firm Jeffries.\n\nThe acquisition was structured so there would be an earn-out \u2014 meaning the amount paid will ultimately be based on the milk brand\u2019s success. In deals like this, the buyer could pay less than buying outright if they\u2019re not sure a product will be successful, Gajrawala said.\n\nThe total payment for the acquisition is now looking to be $6.2 billion, plus the $980 million Coke initially paid, according to Coca-Cola\u2019s latest earnings report. That would make it among Coke\u2019s priciest acquisitions to date.\n\n\u201cDairy has been tricky for Coke to get into,\u201d Gajrawala said. \u201cNothing will ever be as important as a Coke trademark, but this is a nice contributor to growth.\u201d\n\nCashing in on wellness\n\nThe North American market has shown it will invest in health, whether it\u2019s Vital Farms\u2019 free-range eggs or Fairlife\u2019s protein-dense milk. Coca-Cola entered the right category at the right time, Citi analyst Filippo Falorni told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou had a more health-conscious consumer in the United States, and particularly with a bigger focus on protein intake over the last couple of years,\u201d Falorni said.\n\nProtein shakes are a $6 billion market, according to Beverage Digest, a global non-alcoholic beverage industry trade publication.\n\nGrocery items in the middle-priced range are often what Americans decide to stop buying, Gajrawala said. Consumers are either looking for the lowest-priced product or are willing to pay a lot more for something that\u2019s differentiated.\n\nFairlife, with its successful branding, has managed to pull off the latter, Gajrawala said. And it also benefits from Coca-Cola\u2019s behemoth distribution system, which Falorni said is arguably the best in the world.\n\nRisks to growth\n\nTikTok users frequently post themselves drinking Core Power before a workout or making a healthier morning iced coffee using Fairlife\u2019s milk.\n\nBut just as quickly as items go viral on social media, they can also fall out of trend, especially in the health and wellness space.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, Fairlife and Coca-Cola agreed to a $21 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit over allegations of inhumane treatment of its cows. The lawsuit claimed consumers were falsely charged a premium because Fairlife promoted well-treated cows.\n\nLast year, Fairlife broke ground on a massive production facility in New York state, but Coca-Cola \u201cis going to look for more categories\u201d to expand its offerings, Falorni said.\n\nCoca-Cola is \u201cvery focused on Fairlife because it\u2019s going very nicely. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to stop there in terms of the portfolio diversification,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "While Coca-Cola (KO -0.60%) has been putting up solid organic revenue growth the past few years, its stock has largely been range bound. In fact, its stock price is up only about 15% over the past five years, as of this writing. However, the stock got a bit of a boost following its fourth-quarter earnings report and is now up around 10% year to date.\n\nLet's take a close look at the company's Q4 results and guidance to see if the stock may finally break out of its trading range.\n\nPricing power powers results\n\nPricing power was once again behind Coca-Cola's solid results, with some modest case volume growth thrown in. For the quarter, the company's organic revenue -- which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency movements -- jumped 14%.\n\nIts revenue was driven by a 9% jump in price and customers buying a more expensive product mix, with approximately 4% of the increase coming from markets experiencing intense price inflation. Meanwhile, unit case volumes rose by 2%, led by gains in the U.S., China, and Brazil. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was a standout, with unit volumes growing 13% in the quarter. Overall concentrate sales rose by 5%\n\nGeographically, prices/mix in North America climbed by 11%, with unit volumes up 1%. The company called out its namesake Coca-Cola brand, protein shake, and ultra-filtered milk brand Fairlife, and limited time offerings such as Sprite winter spiced cranberry for the solid performance.\n\nPrices/mix in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) rose by 11%, with unit volumes flat. Latin America saw price/mix soar 23%, but more than half of that was due to the impact of inflationary pricing in Argentina. Unit case volumes in the region rose 2%. Asia Pacific saw price/mix decline 5% due to an unfavorable product mix (meaning customers were being more price-conscious and, hence, bought the cheaper products from among Coca Cola's offerings). However, unit volumes still jumped 6%.\n\nOverall revenue in Q4 rose 6% to $11.54 billion, which easily topped the $10.68 billion consensus compiled by LSEG (formerly Refinitiv). Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 12% to $0.55, topping the $0.52 consensus.\n\nRegion Price/Mix Growth Case Volume Growth Concentrate Sales Growth Organic Revenue Growth Revenue Growth North America 11% 1% 4% 15% 16% EMEA 11% 0% 6% 17% 6% Latin America 23% 2% 3% 25% 10% Asia Pacific -5% 6% 8% 1% 9% Overall 9% 2% 5% 14% 6%\n\nCoca-Cola said that it saw market-share gains across its beverage portfolio in 2024. It called out strong gains in sparkling soft drinks, value-added dairy (Fairlife), and tea.\n\nLooking ahead, Coca-Cola forecast organic revenue to grow by 5% to 6% in 2025. However, it is expecting a 3% to 4% currency headwind. It is looking for adjusted EPS to increase by 2% to 3%, or 8% to 10% excluding currency impacts. It is expecting to generate $9.5 billion in free cash flow. For the first quarter, it noted that it will see headwinds from both currency and divestitures, as well as the quarter having two fewer days.\n\nOverall, the company is expecting price to once again lead the way in driving growth in 2025, with some volume gains. It is looking for some of the intense inflation it has seen in some regions to moderate. Meanwhile, it will continue to focus on marketing and innovation to help drive results.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nCoca-Cola has consistency shown its strong pricing power, which comes from being one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Decades of marketing have helped create brand equity that is extremely valuable and difficult to duplicate. Meanwhile, while overall volume growth remains modest, the company continues to gain share in key categories. The combination of pricing power and modest volume growth should continue to power its earnings.\n\nAt the same time, the company is seeing strong growth in certain areas. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has been a nice winner, while Fairlife has been one of the company's strongest growers in the U.S. Fairlife's ultra-filtered milk has been a huge success, as the filtering process increases its protein while reducing sugar and eliminating lactose. It's become popular in both fitness circles as well as with people taking GLP-1 weight loss drugs who are encouraged to consume more protein.\n\nThe company does face some potential tariff headwinds, with a 25% increase on aluminum set to impact its costs in materials. However, the company does have some flexibility with packaging and can transition more to plastic bottling.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just above 23 times. That's a level similar to the slightly lower mark it has traded at in recent years.\n\nCoca-Cola is doing a good job of adjusting to changing taste preferences, while its global brand equity is undeniable. It has some potential growth opportunities with emerging brands like Fairlife, as well as with its recent ventures into partnerships with alcohol producers. Meanwhile, I'd like to see the company get into the \"better-for-you\" category and compete against or buy a brand like Olipop or Poppi, as this is another strong area of growth.\n\nWhile the stock has been range bound for a while, it should be able to start to grow out of that range at its current valuation and growth profile. As such, investors with a long view can consider adding the stock here.",

While the potential contamination does not seem to pose a serious threat to public health, it makes it even harder to trust big corporations with our safety.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nCoca-Cola recently detected abnormally high levels of chlorate in bottles and cans from its production plant in Belgium, according to a report from The Associated Press. Now, soft drinks from that plant are being pulled from shelves in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. Coca-Cola also contacted officials in Great Britain, France, and Germany, as they may have received contaminated products.\n\nThe contamination has been tracked to a single water treatment container at the production plant in Belgium. This is good news, as it provides a clear way to track potentially contaminated products and pull them as quickly as possible.\n\nDo you worry about how much food you throw away? Definitely Sometimes Not really Never Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhy is this contamination important?\n\nThe chlorate detected in these products comes from disinfectants used in water treatment. In high enough levels, it can cause vomiting, serious illness, or thyroid issues in children.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, the levels of chlorate detected in these Coca-Cola products are not high enough to pose a serious threat to public health.\n\n\"You have to have consumed so many different bottles of it to possibly see an effect,\" said Philippe Jorens, a poisons and critical care professor at Belgium's Antwerp University Hospital.\n\nRegardless of how safe or unsafe such contamination is, it should be a red alert to consumers all over. So many of us are used to having no idea where or how our products are made and what they're made with. While the incident should not be taken as a cause for panic, it nonetheless highlights the danger of blindly trusting giant companies to keep us safe.\n\nWhat's being done about contaminated products?\n\nCoca-Cola is far from the only company issuing recalls for contaminated products. East West Tea Co. recently recalled nearly 900,000 tea bags containing higher-than-usual levels of pesticides. According to MasterControl, recalls have risen 115% since 2018.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpting for less processed and locally sourced products is one way to avoid these dangerous products. Another great option is to grow your own food. Beyond that, remaining aware of recalls and of company safety reputations can help ensure that your food and drink are safe.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n",

( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 45% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola Consolidated, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola Consolidated?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola Consolidated. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola Consolidated's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola Consolidated. The Coca-Cola Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 6.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. J. Harrison, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Coca-Cola Consolidated\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$2.3b stake in this US$12b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 22% of Coca-Cola Consolidated stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola Consolidated better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other forever stocks.\n\nState of The Market in The Wake of The CPI Report\n\nThe first month of 2025 was an interesting one, with inflation rising faster than expected, giving another motivation for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged. The consumer price index, a comprehensive measure of expenses in goods and services throughout the US economy, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% for January, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the CPI increased 0.4%, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 3.3%, higher than the projections of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. According to Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, the report spells the end of the Fed's rate-cutting cycles:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018wait and see\u2019 Fed is going to be waiting longer than anticipated after a red-hot January CPI inflation report. This report puts the final nail in the coffin for the rate cut cycle, which we believe is over.\u201d\n\nIn addition, policymakers are also keeping a watch on the White House in the wake of President Donald Trump's advocacy for high tariffs, which might boost prices and make it more difficult for the Fed to reach its goal. Speaking on this, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the following:\n\n\u201cThere is no getting away from the fact that this is a hot report and with the sense that potential tariffs run upside risk for inflation the market is understandably of the view the Federal Reserve is going to find it challenging to justify rate cuts in the near future,\u201d\n\nWhile the consumer price index release is a widely cited inflation gauge, it isn't the principal metric the Federal Reserve uses. Rather, the Fed's preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish later this month, although it also monitors the CPI and other comparable pricing indices. In his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee on February 12, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the Fed's increased emphasis on the PCE measure but acknowledged that \"we're not quite there yet\" on inflation, despite the \"great progress\" that has been done so far.\n\nIn such a macroeconomic environment, the notion of acquiring the best \u201cforever stocks\u201d might appear challenging. That said, although investors may gravitate toward riskier options with bigger potential returns, it is crucial to recognize that long-term stock investments have their worth and importance.",

Is that all driven by operating profit?\n\nA: Ed Walker, CFO: We've increased the guidance to at least EUR1.7 billion due to increased confidence in our business's ability to generate operating profit growth and convert it into free cash flow. We are maintaining flexibility due to over EUR1 billion of planned CapEx investment to unlock growth across our markets.\n\nQ: How did the Philippines and Indonesia perform, and what are your expectations for these markets?\n\nA: Damian Gammell, CEO: The Philippines had a great year with record volumes, and we expect high single-digit growth in line with our midterm guidance.

We are expanding into new markets like Indonesia and the Philippines and have a strong pipeline of innovation with Monster, which will help maintain growth.\n\nQ: How do you plan to support the away-from-home channel in Europe given the current consumer backdrop?\n\nA: Damian Gammell, CEO: We plan to support the away-from-home channel with brand innovation, moderated pricing, increased cooler investments, and digital-led campaigns to drive in-store incidents and traffic. We are also winning new business in this area, which supports our growth ambitions.\n\nQ: Can you discuss your pricing and promotional strategy in Europe?\n\nA: Damian Gammell, CEO: We aim to price in line with CPI while using data analytics to optimize promotional investments. We focus on making promotions more efficient and relevant, without increasing overall investment, to drive growth and maintain price relevance.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

            "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC ( ) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2024 Coca-Cola Europacific Partners had debt of \u20ac11.5b, up from \u20ac10.8b in one year. However, it also had \u20ac1.71b in cash, and so its net debt is \u20ac9.78b.\n\nHow Healthy Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners had liabilities of \u20ac8.15b due within a year, and liabilities of \u20ac14.0b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of \u20ac1.71b and \u20ac2.71b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by \u20ac17.7b.\n\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners has a very large market capitalization of \u20ac37.1b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners's net debt is 3.0 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. But its EBIT was about 12.5 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. Notably Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year. We would prefer to see some earnings growth, because that always helps diminish debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Coca-Cola Europacific Partners can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 97% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners can handle its debt fairly comfortably. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

            "content": "I absolutely cannot pass up a new Coca-Cola flavor. I originally heard about Coca-Cola Orange Cream in December, and I couldn\u2019t wait to sip this nostalgic drink. I\u2019m a fan of all things that mix orange and vanilla\u2014creamsicles and Orange Julius drinks, you name it. And I\u2019m definitely a soda savant\u2014I\u2019ve sipped my way through everything from the new Dr Pepper Blackberry to the Coke that was supposed to taste like space.\n\nSo of course, I had to get my hands on Coca-Cola Orange Cream, in both regular and zero-sugar versions.\n\nYou might be thinking: Have I had orange Coke before? You have! Coke used to offer a slightly different version, Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla. A representative for Coca-Cola told me Coca-Cola Orange Cream is meant to offer a \u201csmoother, creamier taste profile\u201d than the original orange-flavored Coke variety.\n\nOrange Cream Coke Review\n\nGael Cooper for Taste of Home\n\nI don\u2019t always say this, but Coke absolutely nailed its description. Coca-Cola Orange Cream is smooth, sweet and yes, creamy. The vanilla and orange flavors almost melt into the cola, and the resulting drink is a swirl of sweetness. It\u2019s like if you blended the exact right amount of Fanta and cream soda into a Coke.\n\nNow, that\u2019s easy praise to give for a full-sugar soft drink. I\u2019ve been wondering if it\u2019s impossible for soft-drink companies to produce a zero-sugar drink that didn\u2019t have an astringent, harsh chemical flavor and bitter aftertaste. But Coke seems to have cracked the zero-sugar code.\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream Zero Sugar is almost as good as the full-sugar version. I could tell them apart, but only barely, as the zero-sugar version boasted the same smooth deliciousness as its big brother and very little aftertaste. If you want a refreshing orange-cream cola without the calories, you\u2019re in luck.\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream Release Date\n\nYou can pick yourself a bushel of this fabulous flavor right now. Coca-Cola Orange Cream and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Orange Cream hit store shelves on February 10. I asked whether the rep from Coca-Cola whether this was a seasonal flavor and I was told it should be around for all of 2025.\n\nYou can buy it in 12-packs of 12-ounce cans, 10-pack mini cans of the full sugar version and in 20-ounce bottles at major retailers in the U.S. and Canada.",

The company is likely to disclose any changes in forthcoming filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the person said.\n\nAsked earlier this week whether the company is changing its DEI policies, Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said the company is \u201cfocused on having the best talent around the world,\u201d but he added it will \u201cof course, follow any change in regulations at the national level.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo, also a federal contractor that sells food and beverages to government-funded facilities, will comply with the order, said a person familiar with the matter who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. In its annual filing with the SEC last week, the company removed references to \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d and its \u201cdiverse workforce.\u201d\n\nCompanies from all industries are reacting to Trump\u2019s directives to dismantle DEI initiatives. Trump has ordered the heads of government agencies to find ways to end \u201cillegal DEI discrimination and preferences\u201d in the private sector and identify as many as nine private institutions for potential investigations.\n\nChanges could represent a sharp pivot for both companies. On its website, Coca-Cola says that DEI is \u201cat the heart of our values and our growth strategy and play an important part in our company\u2019s success.\u201d It lists goals such as having women hold 50% of senior leadership roles by 2030 and having its US workforce reflect \u201cnational census data at all levels.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo has aimed to achieve gender parity for management positions while increasing Black and Hispanic representation in management to 10% by 2025, according to its website. In 2020, the company said it was investing $570 million in Black and Hispanic communities to increase representation in its partnerships and supply chains. That program is set to end this year.\n\nPhoto: Photographer: Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.",

Versions of the claim also circulated widely on Instagram and on Threads.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim originated on a satirical account. There is no credible evidence Swift's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris had any effect on her relationship with the soft drink company.\n\nClaim originated on satirical Facebook account\n\nAfter months of speculation, Swift endorsed Harris in the 2024 presidential race shortly after the vice president\u2019s Sept. 10 debate against former President Donald Trump. The music superstar\u2019s announcement was followed by a spike in traffic to a voter-registration website and backlash from the former president.\n\nFact check: No, Chiefs CEO didn't ban Taylor Swift from games\n\nBut contrary to the claim in the Facebook post, it did not lead Coca-Cola to terminate its sponsorship deal with the pop star. While that claim originated on an account that shares satirical content and identifies it that way, the Facebook post presents it as an authentic development.\n\nThe claim was first shared in a Sept. 14 Facebook post from the account SpaceX Fanclub, which is part of the SpaceXMania network of satirical websites. The account states in its intro section that it shares satirical content and that \u201cnothing on this page is real.\u201d The post\u2019s caption identifies it as satire, and its image contains two watermarks indicating that. A longer article linked in the comments published Sept. 14 by Esspots, another website in that network, also carries a satire label.\n\nThe Sept. 16 post links to an article that is worded similarly to the one published by Esspots. But two AI-detection websites found the vast majority of the article was AI-generated, with ZeroGPT and QuillBot both determining AI was behind over 90% of it.\n\nThe Sept. 16 Facebook post is an example of what could be called \"stolen satire,\" where claims written as satire and presented that way originally are reposted in a way that makes them appear to be legitimate news. As a result, readers of the second-generation post are misled, as was the case here.\n\nSwift entered into an endorsement deal with Coca-Cola in January 2013 to promote Diet Coke, and the pop star produced a series of commercials for the beverage in the mid-2010s. There is nothing on the company's website about ending the relationship with Swift. A Coca-Cola spokesperson declined to provide an on-the-record comment. USA TODAY reached out to Tree Paine, Swift\u2019s publicist, but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nSwift endorsed President Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 election. In 2018, she endorsed former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, in his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat won by Republican Marsha Blackburn.\n\nMisinformation about Swift\u2019s political activism is not uncommon. USA TODAY previously debunked false claims that the pop star was photographed wearing an anti-Trump T-shirt or holding pro-Trump banners inside a stadium's luxury box or on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to several social media users who shared the claim but did not immediately receive any responses.\n\nPolitiFact also debunked the claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

            "content": "Coca-Cola is one of the most popular soft drinks in the world. Well-known for its iconic red branding, this fan favorite has been gracing the shelves of stores since 1886. While it comes from humble beginnings in Atlanta, Georgia Coca-Cola has become a global soft drink sensation; their plethora of products has made a tremendous profit. According to company reports, they made $215 million in just the first quarter of 2024. While the numbers certainly support Coca-Cola\u2019s success, some consumers are starting to question the moral compass of the globally influential brand.\n\nAlong with countless other popular companies, Coca-Cola is being put in the hot seat. With the ongoing ban on DEI on the federal level, many companies are choosing to follow suit. Some are sticking with inclusive initiatives but overall those seemingly anti-DEI are getting the most attention. These companies are either altogether getting rid of their diversity initiatives or making significant changes to company policy in favor of the Trump administration\u2019s ban. Although many people are die-hard fans of their beverages, some consumers are considering turning away from the brand based on Coca-Cola\u2019s DEI standpoint.\n\nWhat Is Coca-Cola\u2019s Stance On DEI?\n\nMuch of the buzz online has been about where Coca-Cola\u2019s loyalty lies: consumerism or the customer. Although they have a standard corporate website page about their general DEI outlook, they are not restating their commitments. The company already has ongoing boycotts being staged concerning other ethical issues. Namely, some consumers are avoiding the company for its financial and organizational investment in what they deem to be unethical causes, like ties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So, on top of the public backlash for donations to far-right organizations, Coca-Cola has to deal with DEI concerns. The big problem is that executives have been pretty quiet about the matter, leading the public to believe the worst.\n\nDespite the widespread uproar surrounding the subject of DEI, the company has yet to release a public statement. Many people are assuming they do not plan to release a statement unless majorly pressured since the silence has gone on so long. Additionally, a large majority of the public backlash comes from the Latino community. In the wake of Trump\u2019s commitment to carry out the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants ever, people are keeping an eye on the company\u2019s involvement with him. Coca-Cola\u2019s substantial brand presence in Mexico in particular has consumer\u2019s side-eyeing them. Mexico\u2019s per capita consumption of Coca-Cola\u2019s beverages is the highest in the world; knowing this, a boycott will surely make a difference eventually.\n\nThe Coke Vs. Pepsi Debate Is Back\n\nThere have even been reports on the company\u2019s contributions to political movements. In 2024, Coca-Cola donated $50,000 to Make America Great Again Inc. which turns out to be linked to Trump\u2019s campaign. Over the year the company donated a total of $110,660 to candidates in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Technically, according to Open Secrets, Republicans received more funds. This was followed by the company\u2019s gift to Trump upon his inauguration. The CEO of the Coca-Cola Company personally delivered a commemorative inauguration Coke bottle to the new president. It became the first ever customized presidential commemorative Coke bottle since the company changed it to Diet, which is a favorite of POTUS\u2019.\n\nOn top of that, there have been rumors about the company firing or reporting immigrant workers to ICE. These allegations have yet to be confirmed or denied but consumers are not happy with the company\u2019s lack of clarification. There are a significant number of people who are either switching to Pepsi or not drinking Coke anymore. Online there is a running joke that \u201cPepsi has always been better\u201d due to Coca-Cola\u2019s antics. Time will only tell what impacts this might have on the company\u2019s profits and brand reputation.",

Coke beefed it in that department.\n\nInstead, both the classic and zero sugar varieties mostly taste like Vanilla Coke. That\u2019s not a bad thing, mind you. Vanilla Coke is delicious. I was just hoping for something with more of a creamsicle vibe.\n\nI picked up some orange-ish vibes in the syrupy sugar rush. But those notes were in the flavor I normally associated with normal Coke.\n\nDid Coca-Cola always kinda have an orange vibe to it? I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever really paid attention.\n\nIt\u2019s like going back to your hometown and learning that your old gym teacher has a really stupid tattoo on their back. Maybe it\u2019s new. Maybe it\u2019s been there the whole time. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about my gym teacher\u2019s back tattoos or the flavor profile of Coke.\n\nThat changes now. Well, the cola part, at least.\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream | Review\n\nAfter trying this soda, I went down a cola-tinged rabbit hole.\n\nWhat exactly is the flavor of cola? Does it involve orange?\n\nI felt dumb for even asking. But there I went, typing \u201cWhat is cola flavor?\u201d into Google. I was surprised to see that yes, cola does incorporate orange.\n\nWhat is cola flavor? It\u2019s a mix of citrus oils and spices. The long answer is a bit more complicated.\n\nThe special sauce of Coca-Cola is known as \u201cMerchandise 7x\u201a\u201d the signature flavor formula. It\u2019s the modern mechanism for creating the concoction first brewed by pharmacist John Pemberton in the 1880s.\n\nThe best source I\u2019ve found on the matter is from \u201cThis American Life.\u201d In 2011, the podcast reported that it had found the original Coca-Cola recipe, which has been a famously guarded secret for decades.\n\nThat republished recipe includes the following ingredients: orange oil, lemon oil and neroli oil (which comes from bitter orange trees). That\u2019s in addition to the lime juice that\u2019s incorporated into the final syrup.\n\nA historian from Cola-Cola denied that the podcast had cracked the code, but did admit that the basic ingredients of Coca-Cola are part of the public record these days.\n\nThe point of this story is that, if Coca-Cola really wanted to make an \u201cOrange Cream\u201d spinoff, they really shouldn\u2019t have wimped out on the flavor.\n\nWhat does it taste like?\n\nThere are two varieties available, classic and zero sugar:\n\nOrange Cream Coca-Cola - The primary flavors here are the usual spiced soda rush of the cola and a vaguely medicinal buzz of vanilla.\n\nI stand by my analysis that this mostly tastes like Vanilla Coke.\n\nIf you really zero in and try to pick it out, you can maybe make out a little bit of candied orange flavor in the background.\n\nBut at no point does it taste like \u201corange cream\u201d or \u201ccreamsicle.\u201d\n\nOrange Cream Coca-Cola Zero Sugar - Of the two varieties, this one leans a little bit more in the orange direction. The aspartame has a cleaner sweetness than the sugar, which opens things up for the other flavors to ring out a little bit more.\n\nThere are vibes of the classic Coke flavor and a little background hum of candied orange. But for the most part, you get a lot of Coke and vanilla.\n\nSo is it any good?\n\nYup. It still tastes like Vanilla Coke, which is great.\n\nIf you\u2019re not into the vanilla variety, this might rub you the wrong way. If that\u2019s the case, just stick with classic Coke.\n\n---\n\nWant more \u201cI Ate It\u201d food coverage?

Shape-shifting packaging.\n\nSpeaking to Wall Street analysts Tuesday, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the beverage company might adjust its packaging mix in response to rising costs. In particular, this could mean deemphasizing aluminum cans and using more plastic.\n\n\u201cIf one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\u201d he said during the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cSo for example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET bottles, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump this week announced 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports that will take effect March 12. U.S. can manufacturers worry that, without exemptions, this will raise their costs, and consumers will ultimately pay more for canned goods too. Trump last week also planned various tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nStill, Quincey tried to put the cost impact and Coca-Cola\u2019s ability to mitigate it into perspective.\n\n\u201cI think we are in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system. It is not insignificant, but it is not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar U.S. business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be better not to have it ... but we are going to manage our way through.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s exposure to aluminum and steel is a little more than a quarter of the company\u2019s packaging mix, as of 2023. Meanwhile, if Coca-Cola moved more product into plastic, it would expand a substrate that already accounted for nearly half of its packaging.\n\nIn Coca-Cola\u2019s earnings release on Tuesday, the company also highlighted the growing role of \u201caffordable and premium\u201d returnable glass bottles in its portfolio in international markets. Coca-Cola reported that in 2024 it added 1.6 billion \u201cunit cases\u201d in that format to total company volumes \u2014 the growth rate for RGBs outpaced total company volume growth.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the company launched a universal returnable glass bottle in Latin America, aimed at further reducing input costs, increasing collectability and expanding beverage offerings,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThe universal bottle has quickly expanded to markets around the world, including Germany, South Africa and Vietnam, with more opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already a key away-from-home offering in Western Europe, the company said. And in emerging markets, RGBs help Coca-Cola \u201crecruit consumers and develop the commercial beverage industry,\u201d it said.",

(February 10, 2025)\u2014In response to Coca-Cola\u2019s statement that it will shift to using more plastic bottles instead of aluminum if the latest wave of tariffs from President Donald Trump take effect, Lisa Ramsden, Greenpeace USA\u2019s senior plastics campaigner said: \u201cCoca-Cola\u2019s decision to double down on plastics in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs is a reckless step backward in the fight against plastic pollution. Instead of investing in real solutions like refill and reuse they are choosing to pump more toxic plastic into our communities and the environment. Coca-Cola is already the world\u2019s biggest plastic polluter, and this would ensure they remain number one for years to come.\n\n\u201cWhat Quincey fails to mention is that PET plastic bottles contain harmful chemicals linked to cancer, hormone disruption, obesity, early puberty in children, reproductive health problems and declining fertility. This move would lock consumers into a future of rising health risks and medical costs\u2013at a time when Americans are already struggling with economic and health burdens. As long as corporations like Coca-Cola keep increasing our exposure to dangerous chemicals, making America healthy again will remain an unfulfilled promise.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola has already been increasing the amount of plastic it uses every year and currently produces more than 130 billion plastic bottles every year.

I don't think that's where you want to be in terms of critical supply chains that are essential for the defense of North America.\"\n\nHOW TRUMP'S TARIFFS CLOSED THE LOOPHOLE USED BY CHINESE RETAILERS\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order, \"Adjusting Imports of Steel into The United States,\" states that the goal of the tariff is to increase U.S. aluminum production. Upon signing the order, the president said the nation needs aluminum to be made in America, and \"not in foreign lands.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"President Trump is taking action to protect America\u2019s critical steel and aluminum industries, which have been harmed by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity,\" the White House wrote in a fact sheet on the president\u2019s proclamation.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a one-month delay in proposed tariffs. This led to an agreement from Trudeau to increase security along the U.S.-Canada border, something President Trump discussed in his campaign. The order delaying the tariffs noted that President Trump could implement them before the agreed upon date if Canada failed to take \"sufficient steps\" to alleviate the flow of illegal migrants and illicit drugs.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola may package more drinks in plastic as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff on aluminum, the company\u2019s CEO said. Asked during a Tuesday earnings call about the impact of Trump\u2019s 25 percent import tax on aluminum entering the country, James Quincey said that when it comes to \u201censuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand,\u201d Coca-Cola has other package offerings \u201cthat will allow us to compete in the affordability space.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET bottles,\u201d Quincey said, referring to polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic commonly used in single-use plastic bottles and food packaging.\n\nCoca-Cola accounted for 11 percent of branded plastic pollution in the world, according to a study published in April, and is one of the world\u2019s top contributors to plastic pollution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December, the company abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, announcing that it had revised its climate goals to focus more heavily on the use of recycled materials instead of reducing virgin and single-use plastic \u2014 a move criticized not just for the potential impact on the environment and oceans bogged down by plastic pollution, but also for global health as more research emerges on the effects of microplastics on the human body.\n\n\u201cAny increase in Coca-Cola\u2019s plastic bottle use will directly harm the environment \u2014 as well as the health of their customers,\u201d said Emma Priestland, the global corporate campaigns coordinator for the advocacy group Break Free From Plastic, in an emailed statement.\n\nStudies have linked microplastics to colon cancer, lung cancer and some reproductive problems, as well as to increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Scientists have found microplastics and nanoplastics in the liver, placenta, blood, testicles and even the brain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPriestland said if the company was concerned about offsetting the cost of the aluminum tariff, executives should look toward investing more in reusable glass bottles instead of plastic.\n\n\u201cCoca-Cola operates successful reusable packaging systems around the world \u2014 this is what they should be doubling down on, not expanding plastic use,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders, signed Monday, impose 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum in an attempt to promote greater domestic steel industry production and employment.\n\nHe imposed similar import taxes on steel and aluminum during his first term, but later amended them to permit continuing shipments from major U.S. allies such as Canada and Mexico and imposed quotas on some other countries. Announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Tuesday, Trump said they would be enforced \u201cwithout exceptions or exemptions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough experts warn that both consumers and U.S. manufacturers will probably bear the effect of the steel tariffs \u2014 a 2018 analysis of steel tariffs during Trump\u2019s first term, published by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that while it created jobs, it also hurt a variety of U.S. buyers \u2014 Quincey sought to assuage investors Tuesday on the overall impact it will have on Coca-Cola\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAn 25 percent increase in price is \u201cnot insignificant, but it\u2019s not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar U.S. business,\u201d he said.",

The beverage giant's share price ended the session up 4.7% in a day of trading that saw the S&P 500's (^GSPC -1.51%) level wind up approximately in line with yesterday's close.\n\nCoca-Cola reported its fourth quarter results before the market opened this morning and posted results that beat the average Wall Street targets. The company recorded non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 on sales of roughly $11.5 billion in the quarter, topping the average analyst estimate's call for per-share earnings of $0.52 on sales of $11.42 billion.\n\nCoca-Cola stock rises after posting strong results across the board\n\nCoca-Cola's revenue increased 6.5% year over year in the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased 12% compared to the prior-year period. Meanwhile, currency adjusted operating income increased 22% compared to Q4 in the previous year.\n\nCoke's better-than-expected performance in the quarter was driven primarily by pricing increases and strong performance in key geographic segments. While total case volume for the period was just 2% year over year, organic revenue increased 14% and blew by the average Wall Street target's call for growth of roughly 7%.\n\nThe company said that it had achieved broad-based market share gains in key product categories and continued to notch margin improvements. It was a strong quarter for the beverage leader, and management also issued encouraging guidance for 2025.\n\nWhat's next for Coca-Cola?\n\nFor this year, Coca-Cola is guiding for adjusted organic revenue to increase between 5% and 6%. While that target range is significantly below what the company posted in Q4, the performance last quarter was unexpectedly strong. With inflation expected to moderate this year, the company is guiding for lower revenue growth -- and the target range still looks very solid.\n\nWith expectations that adjusted earnings per share will increase between 8% and 10%, management's profit outlook was even more encouraging. Meanwhile, adjusted free cash flow (FCF) is projected to come in at approximately $9.5 billion -- marking a big improvement over the $4.7 billion in FCF it posted last year.\n\nWith today's gains, the stock is now trading at roughly 23 times this year's expected earnings. That valuation might not look particularly cheap, given the company's projected rate of earnings growth, but investors are getting an industry leader that pays a reliable dividend with Coca-Cola stock.",

It would be better not to have it relative to the U.S. business, but we are going to manage our way through.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump hiked his 10% tariff on aluminum imports to 25% on Monday.\n\nThe tariffs put a note of uncertainty into what was otherwise a better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings report from the Atlanta beverage giant.\n\nCoca-Cola reported unit case volumes up 2% in the October-December period, reversing a 1% decline in the third quarter. Wall Street had expected Coke\u2019s unit case volumes to be up less than 1%, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nCoke\u2019s revenue rose 6% to $11.5 billion. That was also better than the $10.68 billion analysts were expecting.\n\nQuincey said limited-time offerings like Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry, Fanta Beetlejuice and Oreo-flavored Coke helped drive sales in the fourth quarter, and more innovation is coming this year. This week, Coca-Cola Orange Cream is going on sale in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nCoke also saw improving sales in markets where it has been struggling, including China and the Middle East.

Water, coffee, tea and sports drink volumes were all up 2%, the company said Tuesday. Volumes for juice, dairy and plant-based drinks fell 1%.\n\nCoke hiked prices 9% in the quarter, partly due to intense inflation in markets like Argentina. Prices also rose because Coke sold a higher mix of premium beverages like Fairlife milk and Topo Chico sparkling water.\n\nQuincey said some lower-income consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe cut back on spending last year and may continue to pull back this year. But broadly, global demand was robust, he said.\n\n\u201cI think the the overall consumer environment is pretty stable in the sense that there\u2019s good economic growth on a broad-based view around the world,\u201d Quincey said.\n\nCoke has also tried to make its drinks more affordable by offering smaller pack sizes and refillable bottles.\n\nCoke\u2019s net income rose 11% to $2.2 billion for the October-December period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share. That also beat analysts\u2019 forecasts of 52 cents.\n\nFor 2025, Coke said it expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%.

Revenue came in at $11.5 billion, compared to expectations of $10.67 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.55, compared to expectations of $0.52. That was largely driven by higher price/mix, which grew 9%, while unit case volume increased 2%.\n\nCEO James Quincey said the company continues \"to lead through dynamic external environments\" with \"global scale\" and \"local-market expertise\" that allows it to \"capture the vast opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\n\"It's only a handful of these consumer staple companies that are actually delivering the kind of growth that you would expect, or growth in line with their targets,\" Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance prior to earnings. The company strikes \"a decent balance between volume growth and price.\"\n\nFor the full year, organic revenue grew 12%, as higher prices helped counter headwinds like more cautious consumers, less favorable commodity costs, and more challenging trends in international markets.\n\n\"We believe [Coca-Cola's] ability to deliver strong positive mid-single digit organic revenue growth in an environment where many global staples peers are likely to deliver positive low-single digit growth (and in some cases are struggling to hit their algorithm) continues to stand out,\" UBS analyst Peter Grom said in a note prior to earnings.\n\nIn 2025, the company expects to deliver organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, as well as adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 3%.\n\nShares of the beverage giant are up 7% in the past year, compared to a 16% drop for PepsiCo. It still trails behind the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 20% gain.\n\nHere's what Coca-Cola reported in the fourth quarter, compared to what Wall Street expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nRevenue: $11.5 billion versus $10.67 billion\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $0.55 versus $0.52\n\nPrice/mix growth: 9% versus 6.71%\n\nUnit case volume growth: +2% versus -0.21%\n\nSpillane said previously if the Latin America market ends the year \"better than the last couple of quarters ... that would be a good sign for 2025.\"\n\nFor Q4, the region's net revenue grew 3%, while price/mix and unit case volume were up 23% and 2%, respectively, led by the growth of Coca-Cola drinks in the region.\n\nIn North America, unit case volume grew 1%, driven by \"growth in sparkling flavors, juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and Trademark Coca-Cola.\" Price/mix for the region also grew 12%, \"driven by pricing actions in the marketplace and favorable mix,\" the company said.",

            "content": "How tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could impact Americans\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.\n\nCoca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the company imports aluminum for its cans from Canada, and is looking for ways to mitigate any price increases that new tariffs could bring. Mr. Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum.\n\nQuincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.\n\n\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"\n\nQuincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.\n\n\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"\n\nCoke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.\n\n\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump's aim in announcing the tariffs is to protect U.S. manufacturing. \"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands. We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.\n\nAluminum is generally more recyclable, and less expensive than plastic. Coke has come under fire for its single-use plastic production, and late last year cut its sustainability goals. The beverage giant is now aiming to use 35% to 40% recycled material in packaging by 2035, revised down from an earlier goal of 50%.",

Concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments. Operating margin: For the quarter, operating margin was 23.5% versus 21.0% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 24.0% versus 23.1% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 21.2% versus 24.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 30.0% versus 29.1% in the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin performance included items impacting comparability, as well as currency headwinds. Full year operating margin included a charge of $3.1 billion related to the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the acquisition of fairlife, LLC (\u201cfairlife\u201d) in 2020. For both the quarter and the full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by higher input costs, higher operating expenses and currency headwinds.\n\nFor the quarter, operating margin was 23.5% versus 21.0% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 24.0% versus 23.1% in the prior year.

Cash flow: For the full year, cash flow from operations and free cash flow (non-GAAP) were $6.8 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Both decreased versus the prior year, primarily due to a $6.0 billion deposit made to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) related to ongoing tax litigation (\u201cIRS tax litigation deposit\u201d). Free cash flow excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit (non-GAAP) was $10.8 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion versus the prior year, largely due to strong business performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by higher other tax payments and higher capital expenditures.\n\nCompany Updates\n\nOffering a brand portfolio across compelling package offerings: The company, in close alignment with its bottling partners, continues to exemplify leadership in revenue growth management (\u201cRGM\u201d) by offering relevant global and local brands in a variety of packages at the right price points to meet consumer needs. Returnable glass bottles offer a unique competitive advantage, having an expansive footprint for the company across more than 110 countries and, in 2024, added 1.6 billion unit cases to total company volume performance, with a growth rate that outpaced total company volume growth. Returnable glass bottles are important to the company\u2019s RGM capabilities, serving as both an affordable and premium package that can be tailored to local market needs. In developed markets across Western Europe, the bottle is a key premium package in away-from-home channels. In certain developing and emerging markets, returnable glass bottles are an affordable offering that enables the company to recruit consumers and develop the commercial beverage industry. In 2018, the company launched a universal returnable glass bottle in Latin America, aimed at further reducing input costs, increasing collectability and expanding beverage offerings. The universal bottle has quickly expanded to markets around the world, including Germany, South Africa and Vietnam, with more opportunities ahead.\n\nThe company, in close alignment with its bottling partners, continues to exemplify leadership in revenue growth management (\u201cRGM\u201d) by offering relevant global and local brands in a variety of packages at the right price points to meet consumer needs.

Stepping up key execution levers to drive recruitment: The company\u2019s global franchise system is increasing outlet coverage and accelerating the placement of cold-drink equipment across local markets to drive consumer recruitment and long-term balanced revenue growth. In 2024, the Coca-Cola system increased availability by adding more than 250,000 net new outlets and nearly 600,000 new coolers. Increasing cold-drink equipment is critical to drive transactions and expand the consumer base, as coolers are one of the strongest enablers for transaction growth, especially in traditional trade channels where approximately 90% of NARTD beverages are served cold. These actions contributed to the company growing volume and gaining value share for both the quarter and the full year.\n\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2024\n\nRevenues and Volume\n\nPercent Change Concentrate\n\nSales1 Price/Mix Currency\n\nImpact Acquisitions,\n\nDivestitures\n\nand Structural\n\nChanges, Net Reported Net\n\nRevenues Organic\n\nRevenues2 Unit Case\n\nVolume3 Consolidated 5 9 (3) (5) 6 14 2 Europe, Middle East & Africa 6 11 (11) 0 6 17 0 Latin America 3 23 (15) 0 10 25 2 North America 4 12 0 0 16 15 1 Asia Pacific 6 (5) 8 0 9 1 6 Global Ventures4 10 (7) 2 0 5 3 3 Bottling Investments 4 2 0 (30) (23) 7 (26)\n\nOperating Income and EPS\n\nPercent Change Reported\n\nOperating\n\nIncome Items Impacting\n\nComparability Currency Impact Comparable\n\nCurrency Neutral\n\nOperating\n\nIncome2 Consolidated 19 11 (14) 22 Europe, Middle East & Africa 2 7 (20) 14 Latin America 24 1 (24) 46 North America 29 3 0 26 Asia Pacific 24 35 (5) (6) Global Ventures 14 4 1 9 Bottling Investments 8 7 4 (3) Percent Change Reported EPS Items Impacting\n\nComparability Currency Impact Comparable\n\nCurrency Neutral\n\nEPS2 Consolidated 12 (1) (11) 23\n\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. 1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. 2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

This includes the impact of several countries enacting the global minimum tax regulations and does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\n\nThe company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10%.\n\nThe company expects comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 2% to 3%, versus $2.88 in 2024.\n\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 6% to 7% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a slight headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow excluding the fairlife contingent consideration payment (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.5 billion. This consists of cash flow from operations excluding the fairlife contingent consideration payment (non-GAAP) of approximately $11.7 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion.\n\nFirst Quarter 2025 Considerations\n\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 2% to 3% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 5% to 6% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 2% to 3% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\nThe first quarter has two fewer days compared to first quarter 2024.\n\nNotes\n\nAll references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n\n\u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n\n\u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n\nFirst quarter 2024 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2023, and fourth quarter 2024 financial results were impacted by two additional days as compared to fourth quarter 2023. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2024 operating results today, Feb. 11, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section. An audio replay in downloadable digital format and a transcript of the call will be available on the website within 24 hours following the call. Further, the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the website includes certain supplemental information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP, which may be used during the call when discussing financial results.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nCoca-Cola today (Feb. 10) launched a new campaign, \u201cWe All Scream for Orange Cream,\u201d in support of its new Orange Cream flavor, per details shared with Marketing Dive.\n\nA 30-second spot, set to Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cFantasy,\u201d shows an entire neighborhood chasing after an ice cream truck that is serving the new flavor. Ads will run across linear TV, over-the-top video, online video and social with support via sampling, out-of-home, radio and experiential.\n\nThe ad was created with agency Cartwright with production by Anonymous Content. The launch of the Orange Cream flavor was informed by consumer demand and growing interest in the Creamsicle flavor profile.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCoca-Cola is using childhood nostalgia, a frequent theme of its advertising (and ads from other major marketers), to boost its new Orange Cream and Zero Sugar Orange Cream flavors. The campaign uses the image of an old-school ice cream truck to serve up memories of the flavor pairing, which dates back to at least the creation of the Creamsicle in 1905.\n\n\u201cWe All Scream for Orange Cream\u201d features a buoyant 1995 pop hit in the form of Carey\u2019s \u201cFantasy,\u201d which plays as the diverse members of a suburban neighborhood chase down an ice cream truck that is serving up the new soda. In a twist present in the 30-second spot but not the 15-second one, the crowd is disappointed when the driver runs out of soda but is relieved when a Coke delivery truck arrives.\n\nThe ice cream truck shares the soda can\u2019s orange and red gradient, a tweak made to the classic Coke iconography for the new flavor. Creamsicle as a flavor has seen a \u201crenaissance\u201d in interest over the last 10 years, the brand said, citing Google Trends data.\n\nOrange Cream, first announced late last month, replaces a short-lived Spiced flavor that was discontinued last year. The new addition to the portfolio comes as Coca-Cola has spent the last few years focused on its high-concept Creations platform, which has included \u201cspace-flavored\u201d Starlight and \u201cfuturistic-flavored\u201d Y3000, among others.\n\nCoca-Cola recently relied on the same nostalgic feelings in its \u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d portfolio campaign, which centered on a six-minute short film that showed how the marketer\u2019s brands have evolved over the last 50 years. \u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d and \u201cWe All Scream for Orange Cream\u201d also follow a holiday campaign that drew praise \u2014 and controversy \u2014 for its use of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nCoca-Cola in Q3 2025 saw non-GAAP organic revenues grow 9% thanks to a 10% growth in price/mix and a 2% decline in concentrate sales. The company will announce its Q4 2024 earnings on Feb. 11.\n\n\u201cOur marketing and innovation agenda emphasizes a culture of acting boldly, learning and not being afraid to fail, and scaling successes. Sometimes our innovations don't hit the mark as evidenced by Coca-Cola Spiced, which we've discontinued,\u201d said James Quincey, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, on an earnings call.",

            "content": "Drinking soda is an inherently nostalgic experience. Most legacy brands have been around for generations, which means your first soda experience dates back to childhood. Classic flavors are iconic enough in their own right, but that doesn\u2019t stop brands from infusing even more familiar flavors.\n\nJust this year, Pepsi dropped a Shirley Temple-esque Cherries and Cream cola. Dr Pepper released a Blackberry version that evokes the blue raspberry flavor of our childhoods. And now Coca-Cola is throwing their hat in the ring with a super nostalgic spin on their classic recipe: Orange Cream.\n\nThe ice cream truck-inspired flavor combo experienced a bit of a renaissance last year. So it\u2019s no surprise that Coca-Cola hopped on the bandwagon, with a flavor they describe as having \u201crefreshing orange and smooth, creamy vanilla flavors.\u201d\n\nWe love Coca-Cola and we love Orange Creamsicles, but do we love them together? Our team tasted the brand new soda to share our unfiltered thoughts with you. So if you\u2019re curious about how Orange Cream Coca-Cola tastes, read on.\n\nOne sniff of this flavor brings a massive wave of orange aroma. But when you take a sip, the citrus flavor falls a little flat. \u201cI\u2019m smelling way more orange than I\u2019m actually tasting,\u201d says Food Editor Taylor Ann Spencer. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m disappointed or fine with that.\u201d\n\nThe orange that is present definitely plays a supporting role, imparting a slight tinge of candy-esque sweetness. Don\u2019t expect a zesty or fresh flavor here\u2014the orange tastes pretty far removed from the actual fruit, just like it is with the ice cream truck treat.\n\nThe creamy vanilla, however, is far more prominent and adds an extra layer of decadence to the original recipe. It tastes more like a cream soda with a whisper of citrus than an actual Orange Creamsicle. We definitely don't hate it, but its lack of resemblance to the inspiration is just a little disappointing.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s also worth noting that Orange Cream Coca-Cola tastes sweeter than the classic version. The sweetness was enough to deter some of our editors from committing to an entire can. But if you already gravitate towards cream soda-style flavors, you\u2019d probably feel differently.\n\nOrange Cream Coca-Cola definitely doesn't hold a candle to the original recipe, but it's a fun spin on an iconic soda and it's worth trying at least once. Also available in a zero sugar version, the new flavor is officially hitting shelves starting today at most national retailers in U.S. and Canada, as well as online at coca-cola.com.",

But is it successful? We conducted a short test.\n\nAfter Trinity \u2013 the 1945 nuclear weapons test \u2013 bystanders would tell tales of indescribable colors that didn\u2019t exist in nature. It was something one had to experience to understand, a true shared event.\n\nDrinking Coca-Cola Orange Cream \u2013 a cacophony of indefinable sensations that are neither orange-flavored nor creamy \u2013 isn\u2019t much different. It\u2019s impossible to convey the sensation a flat yet inexplicably effervescent cola brings. How does one even start to explain a wax that doesn\u2019t coat the tongue until after the last sip? I\u2019ve never imbibed Orange Essential Oil, but I imagine it\u2019s not a million miles away from Orange Cream. I\u2019ll leave it to braver researchers to confirm or deny.\n\nExplaining the unexplainable is impossible, but the short of it is that Coke Orange Cream is not my thing. I\u2019m sure the comparison to nuclear weapons gave that away.\n\nStill, I can\u2019t help but admire Coca-Cola\u2019s chutzpah. Taking such a big swing is admirable, and I\u2019m a proponent of any and all weird experiments. Orange Cream may not be for me, but I\u2019m kind of glad it exists \u2013 which is more than I can say about nuclear bombs.\n\nThis is not the first time Coca-Cola has jumped in with both feet. Many may remember New Coke, the beverage that made Bill Cosby end his relationship with the Coca-Cola Company because (and I quote) \u201cit had hurt [my] credibility.\u201d\n\nThere have been rumblings about the Digest being dumped in people\u2019s Junk folders.

            "content": "Cantinela Imposes Ban On Coca-Cola And Corona Sales Local authorities prohibit popular beverages amid confusion and speculation about legality and motives.\n\nA recent ban on the sale and purchase of Coca-Cola and Corona products has sparked controversy and confusion within the community of Cantinela, located in the municipality of Ixmiquilpan, Hidalgo. The announcement, disseminated via social media, has caught the attention of residents and local business owners alike, raising eyebrows over the legality and reasons behind such drastic measures.\n\nThe official notice, attributed to the \"Delegaci\u00f3n Cantinela 2025,\" clearly states, \"A toda la ciudadan\u00eda de Cantinela se les informa que queda estrictamente prohibida la venta y compra de productos de la marca Coca-Cola y Corona en cualquier establecimiento de Cantinela. De lo contrario, ser\u00e1n acreedores a una multa m\u00ednima de 5,000 pesos, tanto vendedor como comprador.\" This effectively means anyone caught selling or purchasing these items may face fines starting at 5,000 pesos.\n\nDespite the vivid nature of the announcement, the underlying reasons for this ban remain shrouded in mystery. There has been no official clarification on whether this prohibition has any legal foundation. Observers are questioning why such action has been taken, especially since it seems to be isolated to Cantinela and does not appear to have precedent within Hidalgo or other regions.\n\nInterestingly, the timing of this ban coincides with broader movements across Latin America, where communities have initiated boycotts against brands like Coca-Cola. These actions have often stemmed from allegations of the company's complicity with U.S. immigration authorities taken against undocumented migrants. Nevertheless, there is currently no substantiated evidence connecting the boycott movements experienced elsewhere to the local shortfall of sales for Coca-Cola and Corona.\n\nRumors are circulating among residents of Cantinela, one of which speculates about potential agreements between local authorities and competing beverage brands. Some suggest the ban may be connected to efforts encouraging the sale of alternative products, though no concrete information has been disclosed to validate these theories.\n\nThe community of Cantinela is now left grappling with the mixed message of the ban. Business owners, particularly those reliant on selling these popular beverages, face significant economic repercussions. Local shoppers too will find their choices significantly more limited due to this abrupt policy shift.\n\nResidents have begun discussing the potential impacts, wondering about the economic viability of such restrictions and whether they might lead to broader repercussions if enforced. Many locals who regularly consume Coca-Cola and Corona have expressed their displeasure and confusion over the ban, voicing concerns about the financial burden the fines could impose.\n\nAt this juncture, it\u2019s not clear whether this prohibition is something residents view as justifiable or simply another example of arbitrary authority. With many centers of commerce staking their claim on the availability of these beverages, local sentiment could quicken the pace of conversations surrounding the ban.\n\nThe situation continues to evolve, and as community members demand more transparency from local leaders, officials might be pressed to explain the reasoning behind this controversial prohibition. Without clarity, residents and businesses might be left to ponder the limits imposed upon them without formal answers.\n\nWhether the ban remains effective or is overturned under pressure from the public remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly marks a significant moment for Cantinela residents. The next steps taken by local authorities will likely hold sway over both the local economy and community dynamics moving forward.",

Credit: Photo by Tyler Kaufman/Getty Images\n\nThe Super Bowl is more than just a game that shows the matchup between the best team on the AFC and the best team on the NFC \u2014 it's also the one night a year any of us ever watch commercials anymore. Since the 1970s, the Super Bowl has become a huge night for advertisers, with Coca-Cola, Apple, and Google all spending loads of money and getting huge responses in return.\n\nThis year, some companies put their ads online ahead of the game while some are waiting for the element of surprise to take them viral. Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, told the Associated Press that this year, advertisers are avoiding controversy more than every \u2014 particularly after the 2024 presidential election. Now, there are fewer creative risks, the outlet reported.\n\n\"That\u2019s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn\u2019t the advertising you notice or remember.\"\n\nMashable Top Stories Stay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.

            "content": "Worried about turning over your data and outsourcing your thinking to the world\u2019s biggest companies?\n\nStop fretting \u2014 AI will just be a cheerful pal that will prepare you for job interviews, tell you fun factoids, take your creativity to new heights and reduce the awkwardness of family gatherings, all while getting you a little closer to your humanity.\n\nSo went the message \u2014 sometimes subtextual, sometimes explicit \u2014 as tech companies made one of their biggest pushes ever during the Super Bowl on Sunday.\n\nGoogle led the charge with its AI-fueled ads for Gemini, Pixel and Workspace products, particularly trying to yank the heartstrings with a spot about a job interviewee recalling how raising his daughter helped him hone muscles for whatever nebulous corporate job he sought. Never mind that the AI didn\u2019t really do much for the main character that your 12-year-old cousin couldn\u2019t (\u201ctry rephrasing your answer to sound more confident,\u201d was about the sum of it). You felt good watching it. And AI, as expressed here, is all about making you feel good.\n\nThe ads came in a long tradition of what might be called the Super Bowl\u2019s tech-normalization movement, in which frontiers foreign or fraught are made safe by companies introducing them to us at our most guard-down moment: while we snack on chips hanging with friends. From using a Mac in 1984 to shopping online in 2000 to investing in crypto in 2022, our screens on this day are filled with what Silicon Valley wants us to embrace next.\n\nIn 2025 that something is AI, and the message came in emotional packaging that emphasized the utility while downplaying the hazards. It was, to be generous, a mixed bag.\n\nGoogle quickly fell into hot water with a regional ad buy that might be called Gouda-Gate. The company first included in an online drop and then edited out for the game itself a fact a Wisconsin cheesemaker solicited from Gemini about gouda accounting for at least 50 percent of all cheese consumption. The real number is, of course, much lower, prompting the change.\n\nThe mess somehow became worse when Google\u2019s president of cloud applications, Jerry Dischler, dug in and said the fact \u201cwas not a hallucination,\u201d writing that \u201cGemini is grounded in the Web \u2014 and users can always check the results and references. In this case, multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat.\u201d Which would be a little like a restaurant saying, yes our food has E. coli, but don\u2019t worry, our suppliers have assured us that it doesn\u2019t.\n\nA self-own was embedded within the ad too; Google seemed to be boasting that its ideal customers are people unable to write or think for themselves.\n\nAt least you could understand the small-business appeal with that spot. A Gemini ad in which a nervous boyfriend asked AI for football terms before arriving at his girlfriend\u2019s family Super Bowl party made him sound like such a poseur even a child wondered what the hell he was doing.\n\nThe ad was an even more striking example of a self-own; where a human-centered search might have required some critical thought and genuine understanding of the game, AI-fed answers just make us all sound like hollow parrots. The spot also backfired by turning its prototypical customer into a yahoo. \u201cHow many innings are in a football game?,\u201d he asked the system, a question totally normal people walk around asking.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the casual execution, though. The spots represent a particular urgency for Google, which badly needs Gemini and these talkable assistants to take hold. Traditional search has become something younger people don\u2019t like and digital advertisers like less, putting the $300 billion business up for grabs. Gemini is its solution.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, buying its first Super Bowl spot, picked up a bigger anvil, putting AI in the context of the entirety of human history. In a series of graphics that owed just a little too much to a 1980s Print Shop aesthetic, the 60-second commercial went from fire and the wheel to space exploration\u2026but then it too looped back to the everyday-helper use cases of asking for a raise or identifying birds. The spot seemed caught between the poles of the epic and prosaic. But more problematic was what happened off-screen.\n\nOpenAI and agency Accenture Song actually used the former\u2019s video tool Sora to create the ad \u2014 presumably making the spot\u2019s own case \u2014 but only in the early stages, bringing in human designers to fully develop it later. Clearly the handoff was meant to show the company\u2019s recognition of the value of flesh-and-blood creativity. But like the Gemini football ad, it also caught the firm in its own contradiction \u2014 a commercial arguing for what the machines could do inadvertently ended up showing how much the humans can do better.\n\nBy casting OpenAI in terms of its help factor \u2014 \u201cwhat do you want to create next,\u201d the closing voice-over asked \u2014 the ad at least furthered chief executive Sam Altman\u2019s bid to bring this form of intelligence into our daily work lives. (\u201cWe believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies,\u201d he wrote last month, even as many AI experts are less sure.)\n\nAnd Meta offered a slightly more achievable example of how this new tech might work, with spots for its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses bringing in two Chrisses (Pratt and Hemsworth) and later Kris Jenner to show how the smart-shades could be used as one gazes upon art in a museum \u2014 AI as portable city guide. But the leap there is more quantitative than qualitative \u2014 a jump in form function more than anything new the glasses are actually giving you \u2014 and also conveniently ignores the privacy concerns that come when an everyday accessory in a potentially always-on recording device. There was nothing to be concerned about here, the ad suggested, just a guide hovering over your face to provide info and a comedic foil.\n\nEven the ads that had us worrying about AI told us not to worry about AI. Kenya Barris\u2019s Coca-Cola spot, excerpted from his much longer Coca-Cola short, volleyed back to the fears of a new machine intelligence with the recurring theme of \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be alright,\u201d presumably because\u2026.Coke products have always been here, some kind of consistency myth that holds up only if you don\u2019t think about it for more than two seconds. Making the ad even more awkward is that Coke itself has of course been pilloried for using AI to drain human creativity from its marketing, a fact that either didn\u2019t bother executives here or, worse, helped turn the ad into a patronizing rebuttal of the critics to just chill out and have a soft drink.\n\nThe Super Bowl tech genre has become so established it has even provoked a counter-movement. Three years ago, at the height of Metaverse-mania, Matthew McConaughey came in and argued for more humanist concerns in a Salesforce ad. \u201cWhile the others look to the Metaverse and Mars, let\u2019s stay here and restore ours,\u201d he memorably said.\n\nIn a sign of how complete the AI takeover has become, McConaughey and Salesforce were back this year \u2014 but arguing for the transformative power of the tech via the company\u2019s Agentforce product.\n\n\u201cWhat AI is meant to be,\u201d a pair of spots (teaming McConaughey with his old True Detective co-star Woody Harrelson) touted, while suggesting AI would have helped him get a better table and food order. A head-scratching use case, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThis commercial makes zero logical sense, and it angers me,\u201d said one YouTube commenter. \u201cYou also can look at the weather. The dining staff aren\u2019t going to put someone outside in the rain. When ordering, YOU tell them what YOU want, not them guessing. Did you get chatGPT to write this garbage?\u201d\n\nAn eerie AI re-creation of the professional high points of Jimmy Johnson during the pre-game show \u2014 complete with generative video of the football mainstay walking on a field as a younger man \u2014 underscored how gaining acceptance for the technology will be much harder than just campaigning for it. The segment produced polarized reactions on social media, and while some appreciated the whimsy, the strong backlash showed that audiences aren\u2019t necessarily ready to dive into video outside of traditional film, appealingly easy (and cheap) as it might be for networks to produce.\n\nSo where will all this lead? Historically, the spots have brought checkered results. The 1984 ad (directed by Ridley Scott) persuasively offered Apple as an alternative to IBM and paved the way to a personal-tech global-leadership spot it continues to hold today. The online-shopping bid led to most of those companies going belly-up not long after (remember Pets.com? Me neither), though the 300 million people who use Amazon owe a little debt to the mindset-shift that began that day.\n\nAnd the crypto ad from Larry David was one of the best-received of 2022 (\u201cit\u2019s too far!\u201d) but it was for FTX, and by the next Super Bowl Sam Bankman-Fried had been arrested.\n\nWhen it comes to AI there\u2019s no doubt the tech will be part of our lives, but at what human cost and with what social backlash remains to be seen. The jury is still very much out on how this 2025 class of ads will age. Don\u2019t be surprised if next year brings more on-air pleas to restore what\u2019s ours. McConaughey, please stand by.",

            "content": "Dividends are a strategy that requires patience, with rewards unfolding over time. For instance, if you had invested a dollar in the broader market in 1927 and didn\u2019t reinvest any dividends, it would now be worth $243. However, if dividends had been reinvested, that same dollar would have grown to $3,737. The good news is that you don't need to wait a century to see the growth potential of dividend stocks, as the near-term outlook is positive. A report from AGF Investments notes that global monetary easing in the latter half of 2024 has driven bond yields lower, making them less appealing compared to dividend-paying stocks. Moreover, companies that distribute higher dividends tend to have more financial leverage, and with lower bond yields, they can better manage their interest expenses, enhancing their financial performance and supporting continued dividend growth.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind as the AI boom and growing interest in tech stocks shifted investor focus elsewhere. The Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, underperformed relative to the broader market. However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of dividend stocks. This confidence is driven by the substantial cash reserves many US companies hold, which provide a strong foundation for sustaining or increasing dividend payouts. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reports that large-cap US companies collectively hold over $2.4 trillion in cash, creating significant opportunities to start or enhance dividends.\n\nAlmost all of the companies in the index distribute dividends to their shareholders, with some having stronger dividend records than others. While there is a lot of focus on AI-driven capital gains, it's important to keep in mind that dividends have consistently been a key component of total returns. Over the long term, their importance grows. From 1987 to the end of 2023, about 55% of market returns have been generated from reinvested dividends.\n\nThe Dow is a highly recognized and influential stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges, representing a wide range of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by nearly 16%, and it has delivered a return of over 5% since the start of 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChris Senyek, Chief Investment Strategist at Wolfe Research, offers an alternative approach to investing in dividend stocks. While most investors focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek recommends also considering companies that are starting to pay dividends or those that have recently cut their payouts. A new dividend often signals that management is confident in its ability to sustain earnings and cash flow, while also appealing to a broader group of investors.\n\nSenyek also pointed out that stocks of companies that reduce their dividends typically underperform before the cut, align with the broader market afterward, and then start to outperform about six months later. The strategy is to identify companies that might be at risk of cutting their dividends and reassess those that have already made cuts in recent months. To predict potential dividend cuts, Senyek looks for companies with high dividend yields, significant debt, and high payout ratios. For companies that might begin paying dividends, he focuses on those with strong free cash flow yields, active share buybacks, and manageable debt levels. With this in mind, we will now take a look at some of the best Dow dividend stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we examined the companies within the Dow Jones index and identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders. From that group, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of February 6. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Coca-Cola Company (KO) the Best FMCG Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nUpside Potential as of February 6: 13.11%\n\nAn American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks seventh on our list of the best dividend stocks according to analysts. The company's greatest competitive edge lies in its globally recognized brand, which reinforces its market dominance. By consistently delivering a familiar and trusted product, the company has built strong brand loyalty that many competitors aim to achieve. This loyalty allows for strategic pricing adjustments without significantly impacting demand. Although unit sales declined by 1% in the latest quarter, the company effectively countered this with well-executed pricing strategies, demonstrating the strength of its customer base. This adaptability supports Coca-Cola's long-term stability and continued success.\n\nAs a dominant player in its industry, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) maintains strong profitability, with operating margins consistently surpassing 20%, reflecting its efficiency and financial strength. Investors face minimal financial risk, as the company continues to generate solid earnings even in challenging economic conditions. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached nearly $12 billion, surpassing analysts\u2019 forecasts by $290 million. The company also demonstrated robust cash flow, reporting $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. In addition, it posted an impressive adjusted operating margin of 30.7%, highlighting its strong profitability.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been grabbing the attention of income investors because of its long streak of dividend growth, spanning over 62 years. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $0.485 per share for a dividend yield of 3.07%, as of February 6.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 69 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), up from 68 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is roughly $35 billion. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall KO ranks 7th on our list of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "We\u2019ve seen some unforgettable Super Bowl ads over the years but Ridley Scott\u2019s iconic commercial was a gamechanger.\n\nAs the most-watched sporting event on the planet, drawing a television audience of hundreds of millions, the Super Bowl is the perfect platform for top brands to promote and showcase their products.\n\nWhich is why many listed companies are willing to splash out millions of dollars to secure a spot in the broadcast. Advertising space is at a premium and hugely expensive. The price of a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LIX is an eye-watering $8 million - up a million dollars from last year.\n\nCommercials have been an integral part of the Super Bowl experience since televisions became more affordable for US households in the 1960s.\n\nMany have become iconic for the way they tap into the mood of the moment, for their cinematic qualities, special effects or just for making people laugh.\n\n41 years ago today, the @Raiders etched their name in Super Bowl history! \ud83c\udfc6 On January 22, 1984, the Silver & Black dominated Washington, 38-9, in Super Bowl XVIII, setting a record for the most points scored by an AFC team in a Super Bowl\u2014a record that stood untouched until the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/d3srClcPwU \u2014 Pro Football Hall of Fame (@ProFootballHOF) January 22, 2025\n\nArguably the most iconic Super Bowl ad of all was Apple\u2019s famous 1984 commercial shown during a timeout in the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII between the Redskins and the Raiders on 22 January 1984.\n\nIt was one of 19 ads shown during the game, and one of four promoting the latest advancements in home computers in the new digital age.\n\nSteve Hayden was hired to write the copy, Brent Thomas as art director and Alien and Blade Runner director Sir Ridley Scott was in charge of bringing it all together.\n\nThe ad was a nod to George Orwell\u2018s 1949 novel - a peek into a dystopian, Big Brother future with citizens trampled under a totalitarianism regime, mass surveillance and repression.\n\nApple\u2019s iconic 1984 Super Bowl ad\n\nApple\u2019s ad ran for one minute featured a \u201cBig Brother\u201d figure addressing a large crowd of subjects all dressed in the same clothes from a giant video screen in a stark, gray conference room. \u201cToday we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives,\u201d he exclaims.\n\nThe ad then quickly cuts to a blonde athlete sprinting with a hammer being chased by a group of storm troopers.\n\n\u201cWe have created for the first time in all history a garden of pure ideology,\u201d continues the public announcement. \u201cWhere each worker may bloom, secure from the pests of any contradictory true thoughts\u201d.\n\nThe female hammer thrower reaches the conference hall with the storm troopers in close pursuit. She launches her hammer just in time, smashing the video screen, just as the announcer proclaims, \u201cWe shall prevail!\u201d leaving onlookers in stunned silence.\n\nThe camera pans through an open-mouthed crowd as the punch line is delivered: \u201cOn January 24th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like \u20191984\u2018\u201d.\n\nWhile it might seem tame now, at the time Apple\u2019s ad was revolutionary - unlike anything seen before, and marked a before and after in Super Bowl advertising as it raised the bar considerably.\n\nIt also somehow captured the zeitgeist of a dark time in history - the Cold War, arms race, concern about the future and nuclear war while showing how different the world actually was compared to Orwell\u2019s predictions.\n\n\u201cWe were all so scared about 1984, so it tapped into that brilliantly,\u201d sports marketing expert David Stubley told CNN. \u201cEveryone thought the world was going to come to an end in 1984, if you\u2019d read George Orwell\u2019s book. And so to have this take on that whole scariness and confront it in such a brilliant way, I think it really caught people\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nFor Apple the ad could not have been a bigger success - the company reportedly sold 72,000 computers in the 100 days after the game - 50 percent more than it had projected. That alone brought in $150 million - five times the estimated $300,000 budget to make the ad.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

            "content": "Dutta Corp and Coca Cola were victorious on the opening day of the prestigious The Gauntlet of Polo, with the first leg of the series, the CV Whitney Cup beginning on Saturday February 8, at the National Polo Center, in Wellington, Florida.\n\nIn the first match, Dutta Corp displayed an outstanding team play to defeat Brookshire Polo 16-10. Dutta Corp sealed the final result in an extraordinary fifth chukka, when they outscored their contenders 5-1, led by Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda del R\u00edo, who produced eight goals, the same number as Brookshire Polo\u2019s Jeta Castagnola. Up next, Coca Cola, under the command of their top scorer, Juli\u00e1n de Lusarreta, dominated the match and the scoreboard to earn an impressive 17-13 win over La Dolfina Tamera, with Adolfo Cambiaso within the lineup.\n\nOriginally known as the U.S. Handicap, the C.V. Whitney Cup was established in 1979, and first competed for on handicap in conjunction with the U.S. Open Polo Championship. In 1988, the tournament was renamed for C.V. (Cornelius Vanderbilt \u201cSonny\u201d) Whitney, an avid polo player and three-time winner of the U.S. Open (1928, 1937, 1938) and son of 10-goal Hall of Famer Harry Payne Whitney. Inducted into the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame in 2022, Whitney left a lasting mark in polo. Rising to a 6-goal handicap during his playing career that spanned the \u201cgolden era\u201d of polo, Whitney was a formidable factor in all major USPA tournaments.\n\nThe CV Whitney Cup will continue as follows:\n\n\n\nSunday February 9\n\n\n\n1pm: Global Port vs. Park Place\n\n\n\nMonday February 10\n\n\n\n1pm: La Fe Eastern Way vs. BTA\n\n\n\n4pm: Clearwater vs. Pilot\n\n(Palm Beach times)\n\nThe Gauntlet of Polo will resume with the USPA Gold Cup, and will come to an end on April 20, with the much anticipated championship match of the US Open.\n\nCV Whitney Cup \u2013 Teams & Fixture\n\nCover photo by Agustina Fonda\n\n2025 THE GAUNTLET OF POLO \u2013 TEAMS\n\nBTA: Ignacio Viana 7, Kelly Beal 0, Steve Kruger 5, Tom\u00e1s Panelo 10.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nConsumer Staples Outlook For 2025\n\nConsumer staples refer to essential daily-use products such as packaged food, toothpaste, and dish detergent. These products often run out quickly off the supermarket shelves and are considered \u201cdefensive\u201d because consumers continue to purchase these necessities even during economic downturns. Moreover, consumer staple companies are mostly mature dividend payers.\n\nOn December 10, 2024, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager shared his outlook for the sector in a report published on Fidelity Investments. The consumer staples sector had a positive year but lagged behind the broader market due to investors favoring higher-growth stocks. The high interest rates and concerns about GLP-1 weight-loss drugs affecting food consumption also impacted performance negatively. However, despite these challenges, the sector still posted strong absolute gains. Compared to the S&P 500 index the consumer staple sector gained 16.7% on a year-to-date basis as of December 9, whereas the S&P 500 index gained 26.9% during the same time.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks to Buy Right Now and 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In.\n\nBen Shuleva from Fidelity Investments anticipates a return to normalcy for the consumer staples sector in 2025. He suggests this based on a broadly stable economic environment with healthy employment and steady real wage growth. In addition, the Fed is expected to begin cutting interest rates, which could boost dividend-paying stocks. Lastly, consumer spending has remained strong and is expected to remain resilient in 2025, thereby indicating positive sales growth for the sector. Shuleva anticipates that these factors will lead the sector to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, there could be a few uncertainties that could hamper the growth trajectory. The new presidential administration may introduce changes in tariff policies, which could affect certain consumer staples products. Although most consumer staples are manufactured domestically, so the direct impact of tariffs might be limited. Moreover, a strengthening US dollar can negatively affect consumer staples companies with international operations by reducing their foreign earnings when converted back into dollars. Shuleva emphasizes focusing on core fundamentals when investing in consumer staple companies, such as those operating in favorable market structures and maintaining strong underlying growth profiles.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo complete the list of the 12 best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. We selected pure-play Fast-Moving Consumer Goods-producing companies from the holdings of these two ETFs and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them at the close of the third quarter. The number of hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter 2024 database.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the most recognized brands internationally. It operates as a prominent multinational beverage company. Its competitive edge lies in its strong brand recognition which has made its products to become a home staple not only in the United States but throughout the globe. This branding power driven by consistent products has led to strong customer loyalty, allowing the company to implement strategic pricing adjustments without significantly impacting demand. Therefore, despite experiencing a 1% decline in unit sales in the fiscal third quarter of 2024, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) effectively countered this with well-executed pricing strategies.\n\nOn February 4, Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $72. The company\u2019s Q3 exceeded analyst expectations by $290 million and reported a revenue of $12 billion. Moreover, it also demonstrated robust cash flow performance with $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also offers a quarterly dividend of $0.485 per share, contributing to an annual dividend of $1.94 per share and yielding approximately 3%, making it an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nOverall, KO ranks 2nd on our list of best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

That\u2019s one of the underlying ideas in Coca-Cola\u2019s latest portfolio campaign, which demonstrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same, especially when Coca-Cola products are involved.\n\n\u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d was created by Coca-Cola in collaboration with WPP Open X, Majority, Prettybird, UTA and CMC Forecast. At the heart of the campaign is a 6-minute short film directed by \u201cBlack-ish\u201d creator Kenya Barris that checks in on the ad\u2019s eponymous family-operated corner store for a series of vignettes that begin in 1975 and end in 2025. The period-specific scenes showcase Coca-Cola\u2019s soft drink portfolio, including discontinued products (RIP Tab).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that there\u2019s not a storied history of portfolio marketing,\u201d said Omid Farhang, CEO and founder of agency Majority. \u201cEspecially with a company like Coke that houses so many iconic brands, where each product isn\u2019t just a brand: each product has its own brand strategy and its own cultural meaning.\u201d\n\nTo serve each brand and nod to changes in technology, culture and advertising, Coca-Cola settled on a treatment created by Majority about a multi-generation store that has stood the test of time no matter what\u2019s happening in the world.\n\n\u201cWe come into this every year with an idea based on business needs and desires of what we want to drive with the program, but then I really appreciate the flexibility and the freedom we've been given by our CMO and others to go do what\u2019s fun,\u201d said Alex Ames, senior creative director for Coca-Cola.\n\nTime traveling\n\nThe story in \u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d begins with Charles (Omari Hardwick of \u201cPower\u201d) and his wife securing some real estate from a yuppie (Nelson Franklin of \u201cBlack-ish\u201d). They sell soda to teens who are arguing about checkbooks and whether or not computers are going to take over; Charles thinks they\u2019ll be all right. But soon the \u201cHilltop\u201d ad gives way to the hip-hop \u201880s, the yuppie has a brick phone and a New Coke and Charles is joined by his daughter Erykah behind the counter; Mom has passed on.\n\nWhen the time jumps again, it\u2019s 1995. The world is black-and-white, save for the Coke products and the Grant Hill Sprite ad on the TV. Jazz plays as Erykah (Lauren London of \u201cATL\u201d) flirts with LaDarius (Lionel Boyce of \u201cThe Bear\u201d). By 2005, Erykah is expecting and LaDarius helps some teen girls mix sodas. Then it\u2019s 2015 (or \u201c2015-ish\u201d), and Barris and real-life family members Rainbow, Kass and Bronx shop in the store, which is under renovations.\n\nBy 2025, Westside\u2019s Finest is now a little grocery store. Two teens (the same actors from the 1975-set vignette) argue about credit cards and whether or not AI is going to take over. Erykah looks at a picture of her father and says, \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be all right.\u201d The film then cuts to a montage of the store and its Los Angeles community, full of dominoes players, skateboarders and parking lot conversations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very ambitious story about the passage of time,\u201d Farhang said. \u201cIt\u2019s a level of ambition that very few brands in the world could take on but, but ultimately, a story that Coke and only Coke could tell.\u201d\n\nTrust the magic\n\nWhile meticulously researched alongside Coke\u2019s archivist, the ad is foremost a product of shared vision and collaborative spirit between the brand, its agency partners and Barris himself. Not only did the filmmaker cast himself and his family to bring the real-life \u201cBlack-ish\u201d to life, but he pushed for the double dolly shot in the 1995 vignette (amping up the homage to Spike Lee) and the references to cult crime film \u201cBelly\u201d in the blacklit section of the 2005 vignette, which trades a clubland heist for a wild soda fountain creation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if the brand is trying to over-commercialize the message, just as it doesn't work if the agency or artists are trying to make the brand subsidize their art,\u201d Farhang said. \u201cThe trust can only flourish if everybody is aligned on the meaningful, ownable role of the brand at the center.\u201d\n\nTrust is required to add those deep-cut cultural references that make the work more authentic, memorable and engaging. It is also needed to allow for the on-set inspiration that comes from working with a creator like Barris.\n\n\u201cAs marketers, we so often get a script, shoot the boards and move on, and we don\u2019t leave ourselves open to the magic of a Kenya Barris, which, to me, is insane,\u201d said Ames. \u201cIn marketing, we too often lock ourselves up to that on-set magic.\u201d\n\nStill learning lessons\n\nThis is Coca-Cola\u2019s second portfolio effort following last year\u2019s \u201cNew Guy,\u201d which was also created with Majority. The similarly family focused ad was directed by Christopher Storer, who brought some cast, crew and flavor from his Hulu hit \u201cThe Bear\u201d to the world of Coke.\n\n\u201cIt was so great coming into year two, having improved the model. The brief was taking what we learned last year and trying not to over complicate it,\u201d Ames said.\n\nThe \u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d film and various cutdowns will run on linear TV, streaming platforms, paid digital and social, out-of-home and in-store extensions until late February. And while it played as a 60-second spot during the Grammy Awards, Coca-Cola is still figuring out the rest of the media plan.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we haven\u2019t launched a lot of 6-minute films as a company,\u201d Ames said. \u201cEven though this is out there in paid media right now, we\u2019re working through other potential ways that this thing could come out once we see the reception to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWestside\u2019s Finest\u201d comes during a particularly contentious moment, with a strong multicultural focus and perspective on AI \u2014 two issues that have gotten Coca-Cola into hot water. Along with staying committed to diversity, equity and inclusion at a corporate level, the brand plans to keep breaking barriers in advertising as it has throughout the years.\n\n\u201cAs the story says, whether we\u2019re using computers, AI, robots, whatever, we want to tell great, relatable human stories, regardless of who\u2019s telling those stories,\u201d Ames said. \u201cRegardless of what is going on in the world writ large, we\u2019re all going to be all right.\u201d",

            "content": "Everyone loves a bargain, especially on Wall Street. But just because a company's stock is cheap doesn't mean it is worth owning.\n\nThis is what you need to keep in the back of your mind as you compare Kraft Heinz (KHC -0.18%) to Coca-Cola (KO -0.53%). Both companies have seen stock declines over the past year, but one is facing much larger problems than the other. Here's the stock you should probably pick out of this pair, and it isn't the one with the biggest price decline.\n\nThe backdrop Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola face today\n\nConsumer staples companies that make food products, which is basically what both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola offer, are dealing with a shifting landscape. This is a material issue among investors, who seem to fear that the future will be more bleak than the past.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is a new class of weight loss drug that has proven to be very effective. In fact, the drugs started out as diabetes drugs, but the weight loss benefit was so impressive that they are now offered for just weight loss. The interesting thing is that the drugs appear to change a person's eating habits, including both reducing appetite and altering the foods a patient wants to eat (usually shifting their tastes in a healthier direction). Some view them as weight loss miracle drugs. Wall Street has decided that the future for packaged food companies may not be as positive as it was in years past, due to this.\n\nSocial and political shifts are adding to that uncertainty. There appears to be a heightened focus on health, with a particular suspicion aimed at packaged food makers. After years of making high-density, high-calorie foods that drive people to, perhaps, eat more than they should, companies like Kraft Foods and Coca-Cola, among many others, appear to be drawing criticism. Simply put, packaged food makers are viewed as a major part of the obesity and health problems facing the world today.\n\nThese are some of the big reasons why Coca-Cola's stock has fallen around 13% from its 52-week high. Kraft Heinz is off by nearly 25%. However, the stock declines have pushed the dividend yields of these two companies into attractive territories. Dividend King Coca-Cola's yield is roughly 3% while Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is 5.3%. The average consumer staples stock is currently yielding roughly about 2.8%.\n\nThere's an opportunity here, but tread carefully\n\nMiracle weight loss drugs have a habit of not being miracles for long. History suggests there's a good chance that this new class of drugs won't change the world as is now expected. Food companies aren't going to sit around and do nothing in the face of shifts in consumer buying habits, anyway. So both Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz will change as needed to keep their businesses going. But there's a big difference between these two companies.\n\nCoca-Cola's business model has worked well for decades (as highlighted by the over 60 years' worth of annual dividend increases with which it has rewarded investors). Nothing material has changed on that front. The beverage giant remains a company with the size, distribution network, and financial strength to retain its industry-leading position via internal changes and through acquisitions that expand its reach.\n\nThat said, the company's yield is attractive, though only about middle-of-the-road historically speaking, and its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios hint at a stock that's reasonably priced, if not a little cheap. Investors who buy Coca-Cola today, despite the fear around the stock, are getting a fair to slightly cheap price for a very well-run company.\n\nThat same assessment can't be made of food maker Kraft Heinz. The yield is higher than that of Coca-Cola, and most traditional valuation metrics hint that Kraft Heinz is trading cheaply, but the company isn't executing well. In fact, the company is trying to reposition itself after the merger of Kraft and Heinz failed to play out as expected. The merger's original goal was to cut costs, but that isn't really a long-term plan. After a management shakeup, the food maker is now looking to focus on its most important brands while shifting resources away from less important brands.\n\nKraft Heinz will probably eventually work through this directional change. But it isn't going particularly smoothly right now, which has investors downbeat on the stock. Given that the brands Kraft Heinz is \"focused\" on saw a 4.5% decline in organic sales in the third quarter of 2024, the negative mood seems reasonable.\n\nExecuting on the new business approach seems like it could be a multi-year affair. Aggressive investors who don't mind turnaround stories might find Kraft Heinz of interest, but most will probably be better off waiting for more signs of progress on that turnaround before stepping aboard.\n\nA fair price for a great company\n\nThe match-up here is really a cheap price for a company struggling to find a workable business model, versus a fair price for a historically well-run company with a strong business model. Given that both have above-industry-average yields, it seems like a more prudent plan to err on the side of caution. That means Coca-Cola will win out over Kraft Heinz for most investors.",

However, it had a positive start to 2025 and is expected to continue gaining strength, with experts predicting that the stock price could rise above $170 this year. Considering the relatively low valuation and the company\u2019s strong fundamentals, KO appears to be a good long-term investment.\n\nQ4 Estimates\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report is slated for release on Tuesday, February 11, at 6:55 am ET. Market watchers, in general, expect the company to continue the trend observed in the previous quarter. Their consensus forecast for adjusted earnings is $0.52 per share, which represents a 6% increase from the year-ago quarter when the company earned $0.49 per share. Meanwhile, Q4 revenue is expected to decline 2.3% year-over-year to $10.7 billion.\n\nIn the third quarter, earnings rose to $0.77 per share, excluding special items, from $0.74 per share a year earlier and topped expectations. That is despite a 1% decrease in September-quarter revenues to $11.85 billion. The top line beat estimates. Organic revenues increased 9% year-over-year. Net income attributable to shareowners, on an unadjusted basis, declined to $2.85 billion or $0.66 per share in Q3 from $3.09 billion or $0.71 per share in the year-ago period.\n\nSales Trend\n\nNorth America continues to be Coca-Cola\u2019s biggest market, with strong sales momentum in the region often offsetting weakness in other markets. Recent improvements in the US economy and the rebound in consumer confidence bode well for the business. Recently, the company launched a new segment called ready-to-drink cocktail \u2014 a mix of Coke and alcohol \u2014 as it keeps innovating its portfolio.\n\nFrom Coca-Cola\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cDespite weakness in China and a couple of markets in Southeast Asia, we grew organic revenue and comparable operating income. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained value share, led by the Philippines and Australia.

Australia prioritized affordability initiatives across our sparkling portfolio and successfully activated the Olympic Games with POWERADE.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s stock has lost about 7% in the past six months.

Yet studies show they make up about 58% of the average American diet.\n\nWhat's being done about it?\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to hold companies accountable for their marketing practices and could lead to changes in how they advertise their products. If successful, companies might need to modify their marketing or add warning labels to ultra-processed foods.\n\nYou can take control by choosing whole, minimally processed foods when possible.

For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $10.7 billion, implying a 1.5% decline from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta, GA-based company has been reporting steady earnings outcomes, as evident from its positive top and bottom-line surprise trends in the trailing seven quarters. KO delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.9%, on average. On the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, the company registered an earnings surprise of 4.1%. Given its positive record, the question is, can KO maintain the momentum?\n\nEarnings Whispers for KO\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is exactly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.35%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nKey Trends in Focus Ahead of KO's Q4 Earnings Release\n\nCoca-Cola has shown resilience, supported by positive business trends, such as a robust brand portfolio, investments and revenue growth in its segments. This growth has been driven by improved pricing/mix and volume increases.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter, KO\u2019s price/mix is expected to have benefited from growth in pricing and a favorable mix. The pricing gains are expected to have been driven by intense pricing in the markets facing strong inflation and normal pricing actions. The benefits from a favorable mix in several developed markets are likely to have aided Coca-Cola's performance.\n\n\n\nOn the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, management was optimistic about the company\u2019s powerful portfolio, supported by its system's unique capabilities. Given this underlying strength and strong year-to-date performance, Coca-Cola is confident about delivering at the high end of its previous organic revenue growth guidance for 2024. KO anticipates organic revenue growth of 10% for 2024 compared with the 9-10% rise mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\nComparable currency-neutral EPS is expected to have increased 14-15%, with comparable EPS likely to grow 5-6% year over year for 2024.\n\n\n\nWe anticipate favorable price/mix trends to have fueled the company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance. Our model forecasts a 5.9% year-over-year increase in organic revenues for the fourth quarter, driven by a 6.8% rise in price/mix, offset by a 1% decline in concentrate sales.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from innovations and increased digital investments. E-commerce has surged, with growth rates doubling in many countries. Coca-Cola has accelerated investments in digital capabilities, enhancing consumer connections and piloting digital initiatives to capture online demand, likely boosting fourth-quarter sales.",

            "content": "Since 1886, Coca-Cola has been bringing iconic beverages to consumers. Among the many things you may not have known about Coca-Cola is that Its earliest beverages were designed as an alternative to morphine. The brand has come a long way since then, with an impressive catalog of creative and innovative beverages that is about to get a makeover with a new product that fans have been clamoring for \u2014 Coca-Cola Orange Cream.\n\nOrange cream beverages have existed since 1905, but are seeing something of a resurgence over the past several years, with market trends indicating more consumers interested in this nostalgic flavor. The folks at Coca-Cola saw this, heard what the people wanted, and have delivered.\n\nThe new Coca-Cola Orange Cream will be available starting on February 10 at retailers nationwide, across Canada, and online, in both regular and zero sugar varieties to accommodate the needs of every palate. Prices may vary by location, but will be comparable to other Coca-Cola products.\n\nSince we here at Daily Meal are no strangers to Coca-Cola, having previously ranked and reviewed many of the best flavors this brand has to offer, we wanted to get a sneak peak (or sip) of this new fizzy beverage. The kind people at Coca-Cola obliged and sent me a couple of cans to sample before it goes on sale to the general public. Read on for the full scoop.\n\nSome recommendations are based on first-hand impressions of promotional materials and products provided by the manufacturer/distributor/etc.",

Coca-Cola and Pepsi actually do taste different, and there's been much debate among consumers about which one tastes better. The discussion really started to heat up in 1975 when Pepsi launched its Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign. It peaked during the Cola Wars of the 1980s as the two brands battled it out. Now, Pepsi has announced the return of this challenge, this time focusing on its newer Zero Sugar formula.\n\nPepsi's new Zero Sugar formula officially arrived in 2023, and as always, consumers have disputed whether or not it tastes better than Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Following a national taste test between the two, Pepsi is ready to celebrate its victory with a new Pepsi Challenge, exactly 50 years after its first. February 6-9, 2025, the event will take place in the \"Chips and Sips Quarter\" of New Orleans, giving fans the opportunity to conduct a blind taste test of Pepsi Zero Sugar and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy and hold.\n\nIn recent years, many investors have shifted their focus from dividend-paying stocks to high-growth secular-themed stocks that typically don\u2019t offer dividends. However, history shows that investors shouldn\u2019t overlook dividends. According to estimates by AGF Investments, the long-term case for dividend-paying equities is strong: if a dollar was invested in the broader market Index in 1927 without reinvesting dividends, it would be worth $243 today. In contrast, that same dollar with dividends reinvested would be worth $3,737.\n\nBecause of this earnings and income potential, income investors often turn to dividend stocks when the market shifts. While these stocks may not be keeping pace with the broader market, analysts remain optimistic about their future prospects. A report from J.P. Morgan indicated that global equities are approaching a notable period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a long-term increase in dividend momentum. Over the past 20 years, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts predict this growth will accelerate to 7.6%. The main factor driving this increased growth is the low starting point of payout ratios (dividends as a proportion of earnings). During the Covid pandemic in 2020, many companies cut their dividends, leading to a 12% drop in global dividends, which was a steeper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This was a rational response to an uncertain environment with unpredictable effects and duration.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds\n\nHowever, equity markets rebounded strongly as global earnings soared, primarily driven by Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Since dividends are typically determined by conservative boards and management, they tend to lag behind earnings during significant earnings surges. As a result, dividend payout ratios are now near their lowest levels in 25 years, meaning companies are paying out less compared to historical averages. Simply returning to a more typical payout level could contribute an additional 2% annual growth over the next five years. This isn\u2019t just a theoretical scenario\u2014global dividend growth has already started to exceed earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters, as reported by J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhile recent market gains have largely been driven by a small group of non-dividend-paying companies, this is starting to shift. In 2024, many big tech companies initiated their dividend policies, highlighting the importance of returning capital to shareholders and positioning dividends as a complement to share buybacks. The report highlighted that although the dividend yields from these tech giants are initially modest, the total amount they are committing to dividends is significant\u2014$17 billion collectively over the next year. More importantly, these actions send a strong signal to the market.\n\nIncome-focused investors have increasingly turned their attention to dividend income, making it a more prominent part of personal earnings. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that dividend income has risen from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, demonstrating its growing importance as an income source. The report further highlighted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for over a third of total equity returns, with the rest coming from capital gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned through various credible sources, including Business Insider, Forbes, Morningstar, and Barron\u2019s, and identified their consensus picks from their recent articles. Next, we sorted these companies based on the number of hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database that owned stakes in these companies, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

This loyalty gives the company the flexibility to adjust its pricing.

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Coca-Cola (KO) standing at $62.67, reflecting a -1.07% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.72%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.35%.\n\nShares of the world's largest beverage maker witnessed a gain of 4.18% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Consumer Staples sector with its gain of 0.43% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.02%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Coca-Cola in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on February 11, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.51, showcasing a 4.08% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $10.69 billion, reflecting a 1.48% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.46% lower. Coca-Cola presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Coca-Cola is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.53. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 17.92.\n\nAlso, we should mention that KO has a PEG ratio of 3.55. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Beverages - Soft drinks industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.27.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 166, placing it within the bottom 34% of over 250 industries.",

It will be sold in regular and zero sugar varieties.\n\nAtlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said it developed the soda, which mixes cola with orange and vanilla flavors, in response to growing consumer demand for the comforting, nostalgic flavor.\n\nOrange cream \u2014 first introduced with the Creamsicle ice cream bar in 1937 \u2014 has enjoyed a recent renaissance. Olipop, a probiotic soda, introduced an orange cream flavor in 2021. Carvel reintroduced its Orange Dreamy Creamy ice cream last year for the first time since 1972.

Coke added hints of coconut, strawberry and even Oreos to the drinks.\n\nThe company introduced raspberry-flavored Coca-Cola Spiced last February, saying the offering would be a permanent addition to its lineup.

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Coca-Cola (KO) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 11, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $10.69 billion, down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coca-Cola?\n\nFor Coca-Cola, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.35%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Coca-Cola will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coca-Cola would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering a surprise of +4.05%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nCoca-Cola appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nShould You Invest in CocaCola Company (The) (KO)?\n\nBefore you invest in CocaCola Company (The) (KO), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. ( ) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nWhat Is Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings had JP\u00a5114.8b of debt at September 2024, down from JP\u00a5155.8b a year prior. However, it does have JP\u00a584.5b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about JP\u00a530.4b.\n\nHow Strong Is Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings had liabilities of JP\u00a5155.5b due within a year, and liabilities of JP\u00a5179.4b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of JP\u00a584.5b as well as receivables valued at JP\u00a5126.8b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling JP\u00a5123.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nCoca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings has a market capitalization of JP\u00a5428.6b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nCoca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings's net debt is only 0.52 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 18.5 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Even more impressive was the fact that Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings grew its EBIT by 622% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last two years, Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.\n\nOur View\n\nCoca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So the balance sheet looks pretty healthy, to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

            "content": "The Coca-Cola Company is one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands. Founded in 1886, the company today is vastly different from its creator's original intent. The original formula was invented by John Stith Pemberton as a health drink, energy boost, and patent medicine following his time in the Civil War. The name is derived from two of the original ingredients coca leaves and kola nuts, although those ingredients are not used today, and was intended to be sold in pharmacies.\n\nPemberton sold his formula and brand in 1889 to Asa Griggs Candler who then embarked on a nationwide advertising campaign. By 1895 Coca-Cola was being sold in every state in the union and it wouldn\u2019t be long before the beverage was being enjoyed worldwide. By 1889 the company was operating under a franchised distribution system that is still in effect today.\n\nToday, the Coca-Cola Company primarily makes syrups that are shipped to bottler/distributors who command exclusive territories. The Coca-Cola Company retains ownership of the largest US bottler, Coca-Cola Refreshments but there are many others around the world. Coca-Cola Femsa, of which The Coca-Cola Company owns 28%, is located in Mexico and is the world\u2019s largest bottler of Coca-Cola\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and operates as a beverage company worldwide with sales in over 200 countries. The company manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages and has expanded well beyond soda and pop. After years of expansion and acquisitions, The Coca-Cola Company is represented in verticals from sparkling soft drinks to flavored water, enhanced water, sports beverages, juice, dairy, tea, and coffee. Brands under the Coca-Cola umbrella include Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Gold Peak, Minute Maid, Simply, BODYARMOR, FUZE TEA, and Powerade brands.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company first went public in 1919 and it began paying a dividend in 1920. The company has raised its dividend every year since 1962 making it a Dividend King. To put the company\u2019s growth and scale into perspective, one share of KO purchased at the IPO price of $40 was worth nearly $10 million in 2012 and the stock price has nearly doubled since then. Underwriters of the original IPO received $100,000 worth of shares in compensation for the deal and were able to sell it for $2 billion at that time. The Coca-Cola Company is also a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding its position from 1932 to 1935 and from 1987 to the present.",

Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a chemist and doctor who worked in the antebellum Georgia, was originally looking for an alternative analgesic to the opiate he'd become dependent on after his war injury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original formula included coca leaves and kola nuts, both of which contain stimulants. Cocaine, made from the leaves of the coca plant, has become an infamous prohibited substance \u2014 but way back in the 19th century it was known as a valuable medicine, especially for certain kinds of pain. (The kola nuts, on the other hand, contain caffeine).\n\nCoca-Cola's popularity was also boosted by adults switching to nonalcoholic beverages during prohibition (the term soft \"soft drink,\" coined then, means nonalcoholic).\n\nAnd so, a soft drink was born: Originally sold as a concentrate that would be diluted with sparkling water at drug store soda fountains, Coca-Cola was both soothing and tasty.",

The company that offers its namesake drink, as well as more than 200 others, has a presence in a jaw-dropping 200 countries and territories. It's so popular that 1.9 billion servings of Coca-Cola products are consumed every 24 hours.\n\nThe business has steadily built wealth for shareholders over many decades. But if you invest $5,000 in this leading beverage stock right now, will you become a millionaire one day?\n\nTop qualities\n\nCoca-Cola's brand is arguably its most valuable asset. There are numerous non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages that people can choose from. But this one has stood the test of time, thanks not only to its consistent offering, but its marketing prowess, which has resonated strongly with people.\n\nThis supports the company's pricing power. Asking customers to pay 5% more for their favorite drink probably won't result in changing consumption patterns.\n\nAnd given that these are small, repeat purchases, Coca-Cola benefits from durable demand. In other words, sales aren't that affected by the whims of the broader economic backdrop. That can't be said about a lot of companies out there, where higher interest rates or unemployment could spark financial turmoil.\n\nThese attractive characteristics have resulted in tremendous profitability for the business. Coca-Cola usually turns 21% of every dollar of revenue into free cash flow. That bottom-line performance has allowed the company to raise its dividend for 62 straight years, with 2025 likely adding another year to that phenomenal streak.\n\nWhere's the growth?\n\nCoca-Cola is a very mature enterprise. It doesn't operate at the cutting edge of some powerful secular trend, like streaming entertainment, cloud computing, or digital payments, for example. Its business is boring, since not a lot of things are changing.\n\nThat's discouraging for growth-minded investors. Coca-Cola's 2023 revenue of $45.8 billion was just 118% higher than exactly 20 years before. This translates to a weak 4% compound annual growth rate. That's definitely not turning any heads among the investment community.\n\nAs I noted above, Cola-Cola is already ubiquitous. Yes, management can acquire other brands, like it did with Costa in 2018, to expand its portfolio. But unless there's a surprising jump in the global population, the company's revenue growth isn't going to outpace the increase in world gross domestic product. It also doesn't help that consumption of soft drinks per person in the U.S. is trending lower. That backdrop doesn't bode well for Coca-Cola's ability to expand at a notable clip.\n\nFor dividend lovers\n\nCoca-Cola is a household name with one of the world's most recognizable brands. What's more, the business remains a top Warren Buffett stock, with Berkshire Hathaway owning 9.3% of the outstanding shares. That's certainly a vote of confidence highlighting the company's quality.\n\nBut if you're looking to buy the stock, it's important to understand the track record. In the past three decades, Coca-Cola has generated a total return of 905%. For comparison's sake, the S&P 500 produced a total return of 2,150% during that time.\n\nWhen you consider the muted growth prospects mentioned earlier, it's reasonable to expect this underperformance to continue indefinitely. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, which is in line with the trailing five-year average, also doesn't add upside.\n\nLet's say you invest $5,000 in the stock today. In order for you to become a millionaire in 50 years, shares would need to generate a total return of 19,900%, translating to an annualized gain of 11.2%. I just don't see this as a probable outcome.\n\nTherefore, I think Coca-Cola only makes sense for dividend investors who desire receiving a steady stream of income from the businesses that they own.",

This ends their ten-year deal with PepsiCo that began in 2013.\n\nCEO Ron Vachris shared the news during the yearly shareholder meeting. Soon, customers will see Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, and Sprite back at food court fountains.\n\nThe popular $1.50 hot dog and soda combo will keep its price tag. This deal hasn\u2019t changed since the store first opened.\n\nThe switch back to Coca-Cola feels familiar for the retail giant. Coke was their go-to drink partner for years before PepsiCo stepped in back in 2013.\n\nCustomer complaints about drink quality drove the change. For years, people weren\u2019t happy with how their sodas tasted after the switch to Pepsi.\n\nShoppers have been getting frustrated with the current drink machines. Members are hoping new equipment will make getting drinks easier when the change happens.\n\nThe switch will roll out across U.S. stores throughout the summer. Each location\u2019s timing depends on when their current drink contract runs out.\n\nCostco\u2019s regular shoppers are split on the news. While Coke lovers are excited, Pepsi fans aren\u2019t happy about losing their drink options.\n\nThis move puts a familiar drink back in food courts across the country. Coca-Cola served up drinks at Costco for many years before PepsiCo took over.\n\nAnd that famous hot dog combo? Still $1.50.

While the idea was far-fetched, as Coca-Cola was the king of soft drinks for decades prior, it actually worked; the campaign's commercial showcased impressive results that leaned in Pepsi's favor, and this had obviously shaken The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nThis challenge, along with the nerve-wracking statistics that Pepsi was on the road to pull ahead of Coke to become America's favorite soft drink (including the former's superior sales in grocery stores and supermarkets), was enough to scare Coke into making a drastic decision. In 1985, Coca-Cola made the extremely controversial announcement that it was changing Coke's formula.

            "content": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC ( ) shareholders have enjoyed a 54% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 40% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 21% in the last year, including dividends.\n\nAfter a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver half a decade, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 9% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nWe know that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' financial health with this free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners the TSR over the last 5 years was 79%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola Europacific Partners better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "content": "The Coca-Cola Company is one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands. Founded in 1886, the company today is vastly different from its creator's original intent. The original formula was invented by John Stith Pemberton as a health drink, energy boost, and patent medicine following his time in the Civil War. The name is derived from two of the original ingredients coca leaves and kola nuts, although those ingredients are not used today, and was intended to be sold in pharmacies.\n\nPemberton sold his formula and brand in 1889 to Asa Griggs Candler who then embarked on a nationwide advertising campaign. By 1895 Coca-Cola was being sold in every state in the union and it wouldn\u2019t be long before the beverage was being enjoyed worldwide. By 1889 the company was operating under a franchised distribution system that is still in effect today.\n\nToday, the Coca-Cola Company primarily makes syrups that are shipped to bottler/distributors who command exclusive territories. The Coca-Cola Company retains ownership of the largest US bottler, Coca-Cola Refreshments but there are many others around the world. Coca-Cola Femsa, of which The Coca-Cola Company owns 28%, is located in Mexico and is the world\u2019s largest bottler of Coca-Cola\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and operates as a beverage company worldwide with sales in over 200 countries. The company manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages and has expanded well beyond soda and pop. After years of expansion and acquisitions, The Coca-Cola Company is represented in verticals from sparkling soft drinks to flavored water, enhanced water, sports beverages, juice, dairy, tea, and coffee. Brands under the Coca-Cola umbrella include Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Gold Peak, Minute Maid, Simply, BODYARMOR, FUZE TEA, and Powerade brands.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company first went public in 1919 and it began paying a dividend in 1920. The company has raised its dividend every year since 1962 making it a Dividend King. To put the company\u2019s growth and scale into perspective, one share of KO purchased at the IPO price of $40 was worth nearly $10 million in 2012 and the stock price has nearly doubled since then. Underwriters of the original IPO received $100,000 worth of shares in compensation for the deal and were able to sell it for $2 billion at that time. The Coca-Cola Company is also a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding its position from 1932 to 1935 and from 1987 to the present.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola Launches Water Sustainability Initiatives In Mexico From artificial wetlands to clean water access programs, Coca-Cola Mexico demonstrates commitment to communities.\n\nCoca-Cola Mexico has embarked on significant water sustainability initiatives, demonstrating its commitment to addressing environmental challenges and ensuring access to clean water for communities. Marking the observation of World Wetlands Day this February 2, 2025, the company, in collaboration with Arca Continental and Grupo Rica, has made noteworthy advancements aimed at enhancing water management and accessibility.\n\nOne of the standout projects is the development of artificial wetlands funded by Arca Continental, which invested 80 million pesos for wastewater treatment solutions across Mexico. These wetlands, established with the assistance of Pronatura Mexico and Pronatura Noroeste, are located at two key sites: Cihuatl\u00e1n, Jalisco, and the Mexicali Valley, Baja California. They function by treating wastewater through natural filtration systems, utilizing biofilters of sand and gravel along with specially chosen plants to eliminate contaminants effectively.\n\nThe wetland located in Cihuatl\u00e1n benefits over 18,000 individuals annually. It not only aids the treatment of wastewater but also contributes to the local ecosystem by helping restore nearby lagoons and enhancing biodiversity. The facility also supports a 780-square-meter agroforestry nursery, which residents utilize to cultivate ornamental plants, fostering economic benefits for the area's inhabitants. With the ability to treat around 34 liters per second, this system yields over 1 billion liters of treated water annually.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mexicali Valley wetland operates under similar principles, aimed at managing approximately 900 million liters of water each year, achieving about 75% efficiency in contaminant reduction. The systems have the capacity to adapt and grow, projecting future treatment rates of up to 70 liters per second, ensuring effective operations.\n\nBoth artificial wetlands represent low-energy, low-maintenance solutions, avoiding chemical treatment methods by leveraging natural processes for water management. This initiative celebrates the synergy between public, private, and civil organizations focused on environmental conservation, as highlighted by Arca Continental's statement emphasizing the transformative power of such collaborations.\n\nComplementing these initiatives, Coca-Cola Mexico has also launched the \"Escuelas con Agua\" program. Collaboratively developed with Grupo Rica, this project seeks to guarantee access to clean water in schools across the states of Morelos and Hidalgo. During the launch at the Margarita Maza de Ju\u00e1rez school, various stakeholders recognized the significance of ensuring water access to educational facilities, as articulated by Governor Margarita Gonz\u00e1lez Saravia, who noted, \"El acceso al agua en las escuelas es fundamental para el bienestar y desarrollo de la ni\u00f1ez.\"\n\nThe initiative has already installed 32 rainwater harvesting systems across multiple schools, benefiting more than 13,000 students. Patricio Caso Prado, Director of Public Affairs, Communication, and Sustainability at Coca-Cola Mexico, emphasized the broader impact this initiative has on students\u2019 academic and social development, alongside promoting responsible water usage habits.\n\nGrupo Rica's director, Miguel Guizado Aguirre, reaffirmed the company's commitment to sustainability, announcing their goal to return 100% of the water utilized during processes by 2030. This strong pledge aligns with the overall vision of fostering educational growth and environmental stewardship within communities.\n\nThe combined initiatives from Coca-Cola Mexico showcase its dedication to sustainable water practices and highlight the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration for societal benefit. They not only address immediate needs for clean water but also contribute to long-term ecological and economic sustainability, transforming lives and empowering communities.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:",

            "content": "Valued at a market cap of $270.7 billion, The Coca-Cola Company (KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages, spanning from sodas to energy drinks. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company is making investments in healthier alternatives like coffee, sparkling water, and sports drinks through its Coca-Cola Energy, Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, Powerade Ultra, and Powerade Power Water brands.\n\nThis beverage giant's shares have lagged behind the broader market over the past 52 weeks. KO has gained 6.9% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has soared 23.3%. Moreover, over the past six months, the stock is down 5.4%, compared to SPX\u2019s 11.7% rise.\n\nZooming in further, Coca-Cola has also lagged behind the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLP) 8.5% gain over the past 52 weeks and 2.2% return on a six-month basis.\n\nOn Jan. 28, shares of KO plunged 2.4% as the company had to recall some of its soft drinks in Europe after higher-than-normal levels of a chemical called chlorate were detected in bottles and cans at a production plant in Belgium. Batches of other companies like Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea were also recalled.\n\nMoreover, rising internal costs and softer consumer spending are affecting Coca-Cola\u2019s performance. Additional challenges, including a lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County, accusing the company of contributing to plastic pollution and engaging in deceptive business practices, have further contributed to its underperformance over the past year.\n\nOn Oct. 23, shares of KO plunged 2.1% after its Q3 earnings release despite delivering better-than-expected Q3 adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share and revenues of nearly $11.9 billion. The bottom line grew 5% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues declined 1% year-over-year. Due to a slowdown in China, Mexico, and Turkey, global unit volume declined by 1%, which overshadowed an improved price/mix in the quarter. Nonetheless, the management expressed confidence in the long-term strategy, emphasizing investments in brand growth and operational efficiency.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect Coca-Cola\u2019s EPS to grow nearly 6% year over year to $2.85. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the Wall Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 22 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d which is based on 18 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and three \u201cHold\u201d ratings.\n\nThis configuration is significantly more bullish than three months ago, with 15 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 30, Jefferies analysts upgraded Coca-Cola\u2019s rating to \u201cBuy\u201d and raised its price target to $75, noting the company\u2019s robust fundamentals and anticipated cash flow increase. This price target indicates a 17.1% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $72.73 represents a 13.5% upside from KO\u2019s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $85 suggests an upside potential of 32.7%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The company recalled drinks from UK cafes, restaurants, and supermarkets with production codes from 328 GE to 338 GE that were bottled from the contaminated batch on Wednesday.\n\nThe affected products were tall cans of regular Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke and Sprite Zero stocked in cafes and restaurants, as well as supermarket six-packs of Appletiser.\n\nThe decision follows similar measures in Luxembourg, Belgium, and The Netherlands on Monday. At the time, Coca-Cola had \u201calerted the authorities\u201d in the UK after discovering contaminated products had been shipped to Britain which they claimed had already been sold. The company recalled products from the UK on Wednesday \u201cfollowing ongoing dialogue with the UK Food Standards Agency\u201d.\n\nChlorate is a byproduct formed when chlorine-based disinfectants are used to treat water in food production. Although there is no maximum EU or UK legal level of chlorate in food and drink, the World Health Organization advises it should not exceed 0.7 mg/L. Taken in excess, chlorate can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea, and can be harmful to the thyroid.\n\nCoca-Cola has not confirmed the amount of chlorate in the contaminated batch, but the UK Food Standards Agency has said the \u201cfood safety concerns from these products is low\u201d after completing a risk assessment.\n\nCoca-Cola has confirmed that the \u201cmajority\u201d of their products, \u201cincluding standard cans, and all glass and plastic bottles sold in the UK are not impacted\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, Coca-Cola said: \u201cThe quality and safety of our products is our top priority and we\u2019re sorry that on this occasion, a small number of our products have not met our high standards, and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.\u201d\n\nTina Potter, head of incidents at the UK Food Standards Agency, said: \u201cBased on our risk assessment, the food safety concern from these products is low, especially when consumed only occasionally. However, adverse health effects cannot be ruled out for consumers with pre-existing medical conditions who are sensitive to chlorate.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola has been approached for comment.",

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nEarnings have risen firmly for Coca-Cola Consolidated recently, which is pleasing to see. It might be that many expect the respectable earnings performance to beat most other companies over the coming period, which has increased investors\u2019 willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\n\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Coca-Cola Consolidated's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 20% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 139% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nWeighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 15% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Coca-Cola Consolidated is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong growth to continue and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nWe've established that Coca-Cola Consolidated maintains its high P/E on the strength of its recent three-year growth being higher than the wider market forecast, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis.

            "content": "The state of Chiapas in the south of Mexico is home to the country\u2019s largest water reserves. Several factors, from geographic favorability, rainfall, and climactic conditions specific to the area, give the state semi-warm, tropical, temperate, and cold climates throughout the year. This ensures it receives the most water per capita in the region, providing about 30 percent of Mexico\u2019s water supply. But over the last few years, environmentalists and citizens alike say that it is because of corporate greed that the state is running into an serious drought. In the city of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, sitting in the highlands of Chiapas, citizens have more access to Coca-Cola than drinking water. The area is home to a FEMSA bottling plant, which makes Coca-Cola and other food products and soft drinks. Its prime location next to the Huitepec volcano basin, a readily available water source in Chiapas, gives it an advantage over the citizens of the region, as they have permits to extract over 300,000 gallons of water daily from the basin to make sodas.\n\nCurrently, the plant distributes most of Latin America\u2019s Coca-Cola. With only about one in three of Chiapas\u2019 citizens having access to water in their homes, communities are rallying for visibility as they fight Coca-Cola in their pursuit for improved conditions.\n\nA state that consumes more Coca-Cola than water\n\nWhile communities in Chiapas lobby against Coca-Cola and other multinationals taking over the state\u2019s water supply, the relationship between the region and this corporation runs deep. From religious ceremonies performed with the drink to the staggering consumption of Coca-Cola in the region, the drink has embedded itself into Mexican culture. In 2024, a report backed by El Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda de Mexico (Conacyt) showed citizens in Chiapas consume approximately 821.25 liters of Coca-Cola per year which amount to about 2.2 liters of coke per day.\n\nStay connected!

You are already subscribed to our newsletter\n\nThis number not only surpasses five times the national figures, but makes Chiapas the largest consumer of Coca-Cola on the planet. The study raised alarming questions regarding the region\u2019s dietary habits, as the drink has become almost fundamental in everyday life for Chiapans.\n\nA 2019 publication by the National Autonomous University of Mexico claims a high percentage of citizens have substituted water for highly caloric drinks like Coke, triggering an epidemic of diabetes in the region. In fact, diabetes is the second leading cause of death in Chiapas after heart disease. According to the New York Times, the mortality rate from diabetes in the region went up 30 percent between 2013 to 2016.\n\nMost of the citizens facing these issues are Mayans living in the highland regions of Chiapas, particularly those with reduced access to drinking water. \u201cTo understand the role of Coca Cola in Chiapas it is necessary to examine how the company operates and how this has affected the Highland Mayans,\u201d the report states. \u201cResearch conducted by Blanding found that based on total population in most countries, average yearly Coca Cola consumption was 100 cups (.25 liters); in the United States average yearly consumption was 100 liters, while in Mexico it was 150 liters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a consequence this dark drink added some 788 to 985 kcal to the \u2018normal\u2019 Mexican diet. This amount of sugar reduces caloric needs while also reducing the quantity of nutrients available. For the population as a whole this means a daily increase of 5113.7 kcal. This one statistic is enough to explain the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the highlands, where it has become the principal cause of death in the last 10 years,\u201d they added.\n\nAnother factor considered in the study is that drinking coke is synonymous with \u201chaving status\u201d at a social level. Another study by the Universidad Intercultural de Chiapas, claims the drink is considered \u201cposh\u201d among some in the region also supported this. The study states this \u201cstatus\u201d comes from the introduction of Coca-Cola to the region decades ago, where people with more money had more access to the drink. Still, with consumption figures such as these, the company is producing approximately 120, 000 liters of coke per day, further exacerbating water stress while profiting.\n\nDraining Chiapas water supply while profiting\n\nAmid the alarming consumption of Coca-Cola in Chiapas lies a greater interest for the company: profits. Currently, Coca-Cola holds permits to extract over 300,000 gallons of water (approximately 1.14) million litres from the Huitepec volcano basin daily.\n\nAn official 2010 report from Coca-Cola and the Nature Conservancy states the company requires 9.2 gallons of water to produce a half-liter of Coke, 7 gallons to raise sugar beets as sweetener, two gallons to manufacture plastic bottles, and 0.1 gallons for the basis of the product.\n\nThe extractions have caused even those living in the most central areas of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas to face water disruptions that can last weeks, Al Jazeera reports. Even worse, water pollution from fecal contamination has made tap water undrinkable, leaving citizens with limited resources, some even traveling for hours to find bottled sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, we can\u2019t bathe, we can\u2019t drink, we can\u2019t clean water,\u201d Silvia Perez Mendez told CBS This Morning. She is a local resident of San Cristobal who uses rainwater to supplement the lack of access in her town. Despite all this, the company continues profiting, as it has historically. According to the 2024 Coca-Cola FEMSA third quarter report, company revenue increased by 10.7 percent at 69,601 million Mexican Pesos or approximately 3.4 million dollars. Coca-Cola also owns 70 percent market share and sales of Mexican sodas.\n\nSince the company\u2019s establishment, it has barely paid the state or San Cristobal for its water consumption, which some account to its relation with three Mexican presidents: Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder\u00f3n. Fox was the president of the company in Mexico before his presidential election in 2000. Also, Jaime Jaquez, Coca-Cola Mexico\u2019s former general director was National Commissioner for Water during the Fox presidency, giving FEMSA-Coke a 20 year concession to extract water for free. Furthermore, during the presidency of Zedillo and Calder\u00f3n their State Secretaries were FEMSA-Coke employees.\n\nThe company also holds another advantage over citizens. With FEMSA leading over 20,000 convenience stories across Mexico, they provide small prizes for support. They also supply over 1,500 jobs in the area and claim they are working on restoring the resources they use.\n\nIn a sustainability report, the Coca-Cola company claimed that since 2015 they have returned over 100 percent of the water used in their finished products globally. Adding they \u201cseek to return 100 percent of the total water used in each of our more than 200 high-risk locations across the Coca-Cola system by 2035.\u201d\n\nStill, while the company promises to replenish the water it takes, citizens continue suffering and wondering if true change is coming. Since its installment in 1994, FEMSA has faced no resistance from Mexico\u2019s National Water Comission, which continues granting water permits to the factory as Chiapas faces the harsh realities of climate change.\n\nAn uncertain future while facing climate change\n\nMexico has been facing water shortages since 2011, when approximately 23 percent of the country faced exceptional conditions such as limited rainfall and intense droughts. Last year, they faced the second most concerning drought in its history with nearly 76 percent of the country facing water shortages, including central and southern Mexico.\n\nProjections predict that by 2025 severe drought will extend water shortages to 20 of its 32 states. Thankfully, not all is lost. Activists and non-profit organizations continue rallying for safe water access across Chiapas, infrastructure improvements, and the awareness of the effects of climate change.\n\nGroups like the We are Water foundation, Agua y Vida, and C\u00e1ntaro Azul are lobbying not only against the abuse from multinationals draining Mexico, but pushing for the development of water systems that can reach even the most remote areas of the country.\n\nIn 2016, C\u00e1ntaro Azul started collaborating with the Parque Natural Encuentro, a conservation area in western San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas in Chiapas to build \u201cLa Casa del Agua.\u201d This initiative, documented in the video below, is a space that inspires conscious community treatment of water, the environment in the area, and practical learning about the cycles of water and how to filter, disinfect, and drink it.\n\nOrganizations like Agua y Vida have also lobbied against Coca-Cola in the area, focusing on the imperative role of women in society and how they are heavily affected by both the consumption of Coca-Cola and lack of water access.\n\n\u201cFrom Agua y Vida: Mujeres, Derechos y Ambiente, we\u2019ve seen that due to sexual and gender divides from work, women are the main caretakers and administrators of water for domestic and personal use,\u201d the organization wrote in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are not recognized or valued as such. In rural and Indigenous contexts, this situation intensifies, seeing as water is almost nonexistent and women and girls must travel long distances, and travel hours in a day to find water for the entire family.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chiapas Paralelo, women in Chiapas walk approximately four to five kilometers (2.5 to 3.1 miles) per day to bring water to their homes from nearby rivers, towns, or wherever they can find bottled water in the region. In many instances, they don\u2019t have means to carry the water back, so they have to repeat the trip two or three times a day.\n\nWhile many of these women live in communities with water basins, droughts caused by watering plants like Coca-Cola\u2019s, compiled with water treatment issues making water unusable continue being the greatest problem. Agua y Vida shared an infographic demanding the removal of Coca-Cola from Chiapas, as well as other bottling plants that sell bottled water.\n\n\u201cPrivatization is one of the principal threats for water rights,\u201d the infographic reads. \u201cThe water bottling companies extract huge quantities of water from rivers and underwater water tables that are later sold as sodas and bottled water.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, the community is not staying silent. Cantaro Azul\u2019s 2024 \u201cChiapas for el Agua\u201d report, published in January 2025, details a strategy for returning water to Chiapas. The \u201cPlan de Justicia H\u00eddratica para Chiapas\u201d brings together the community and government to defend water as a human right, while also recognizing the historical damages suffered by affected communities. The plan hopes to guarantee clean water for everyone, without exception, through a sustainable water system.\n\n\u201cTo ensure water is valued as a benefit for the nation, we have to ensure this resource is used for the public good, preventing its hoarding and stewardship according to each territorial context,\u201d the report states. \u201cWater management should be public and communty-based.\u201d",

            "content": "Coca-Cola Issues Recall Over Chlorate Contamination Several products removed from shelves due to safety risks associated with elevated chlorate levels.\n\nCoca-Cola has recently initiated a recall of several of its products from United Kingdom shelves following concerns about potential chlorate contamination. Among the affected products are Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, Diet Coke, and Sprite Zero, all packaged primarily in tall cans. According to the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the recall is due to the discovery of elevated levels of chlorate, which poses what they classify as a \"low food safety risk\" for the general population but carries more significant potential health risks for sensitive groups.\n\nOn January 29, 2025, the FSA alerted consumers to the safety issue, advising them not to consume the recalled products and instead encouraging individuals who may have purchased them to reach out to Coca-Cola\u2019s customer service for guidance. Importantly, the recall does not affect standard dimension cans or any Coca-Cola products sold in glass or plastic bottles across the UK, focusing instead on tall cans.\n\nThe specific products associated with the recall include:\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola 330ml tall can (batch code: 0008912462, best before date: November 30, 2025)\n\n\n\nDiet Coke 330ml tall can (batch code: 0008913820, best before date: May 31, 2025)\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Zero 330ml tall can (batch code: 0008913954, best before date: May 31, 2025)\n\n\n\nSprite Zero 330ml tall can (batch code: 0008913247, best before date: June 30, 2025)\n\n\n\nAppletiser multipack (6x250ml, batch codes: 0008905850 and 0008908477; best before dates: November 30 and December 31, 2025)\n\n\n\nThe FSA has specified production codes for the recalled Appletiser and Coca-Cola products, stating they are limited primarily to imports sent to caf\u00e9s and restaurants, with distribution not extending far beyond these venues.\n\nThe risks associated with chlorate are particularly concerning for individuals with specific health vulnerabilities. According to the FSA, prolonged consumption of chlorate can lead to iodine deficiencies, potentially causing health problems such as goitre, and could hinder the body\u2019s ability to absorb oxygen, leading to severe health complications like kidney failure.\n\nA spokesperson from Coca-Cola Europacific Partners emphasized, \u201cAll affected cans can be identified by their production codes found on the base of the can. The majority of Coca-Cola products, including standard cans and all bottles, are unaffected by this issue.\u201d The spokesperson also noted their commitment to the quality and safety of their products, apologizing for the inconvenience caused to consumers.\n\nThis incident marks the latest food safety concern involving chlorate, which is regarded as harmful depending on concentration levels and duration of exposure. Chlorate often forms as a by-product of chlorine-based sanitizers, which are commonly used to purify water.\n\nThe FSA articulated the potential health concerns stating, \u201cThis product may contain elevated levels of chlorate. While this poses a low food safety concern when consumed occasionally, the adverse health effects cannot be dismissed, especially for sensitive populations such as young children or those with pre-existing health issues.\u201d Given the varying levels of risk depending on prior health conditions, consumers are advised to err on the side of caution.\n\nHealth risks posed by chlorate, especially its long-term impacts, have drawn attention from health authorities. The food agency outlined encouraging consumers to reassess their intake of certain beverages, particularly for individuals commonly at risk due to existing health conditions such as thyroid deficiencies or kidney ailments.\n\nThis precautionary recall follows previously alerted incidents involving Coca-Cola products distributed in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands due to similar contamination findings. Such instances serve to remind consumers of the importance of vigilance concerning food product safety, particularly with widely consumed items like soft drinks.\n\nThe FSA\u2019s warning is part of broader efforts to maintain consumer safety and trust, emphasizing the significance of regulatory compliance among food and beverage companies. These recalls often reflect the diligent monitoring of food safety standards, which aim to protect consumers from potential health risks.\n\nFor anyone who has purchased the affected Coca-Cola products, the company urges consumers to call their customer service team at 0800 227711. Coca-Cola is dedicated to facilitating refunds or replacements for products impacted by this recall.\n\nOverall, this situation has sparked discussions about product safety protocols and consumer awareness. Authorities like the FSA are pushing for transparency to help mitigate any potential health concerns stemming from similar product issues, emphasizing their commitment to public health and safety.\n\nThe recall reflects not only the importance of adhering to safety regulations but also the need for consumers to remain informed about what they are purchasing. Companies like Coca-Cola must prioritize consumer safety and act swiftly when safety standards are found to be compromised. This incident serves as both a cautionary tale and substantive discussion point on how the industry navigates food safety challenges.",

It is the flagship product of The Coca-Cola Company, which produces a variety of non-alcoholic beverages, including soft drinks, water, and energy drinks. Coca-Cola is known for its classic cola flavor, and the company has built a strong brand identity through consistent marketing, distribution, and innovation. Over the years, it has become one of the most valuable brands in the world, with products available in more than 200 countries.\n\nKey Differences From Competitors\n\nCoca-Cola stands out from competitors like Pepsi, Dr Pepper, and other soft drink brands due to its extensive global reach, strong brand loyalty, and diversified product offerings. Unlike some competitors that may focus on specific markets, Coca-Cola has a presence in almost every corner of the world. It also invests heavily in marketing campaigns, sponsorships, and partnerships, which contribute to its high level of consumer recognition. Coca-Cola\u2019s diverse product range, including Coca-Cola Zero, Diet Coke, and various flavored drinks, helps the company appeal to different consumer preferences.\n\nIn comparison, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola\u2019s main competitor, focuses more on snacks and beverages, including products like Lay\u2019s Chips and Gatorade. While Pepsi offers a similar cola drink, its product portfolio is broader in the food sector, which differentiates its business strategy from Coca-Cola\u2019s, which primarily focuses on beverages.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Region-Wise Consumption Rate in 2024\n\nThe consumption rate of Coca-Cola varies across different regions in 2024, reflecting both market preferences and economic factors:\n\nNorth America: Coca-Cola remains highly popular in the United States and Canada, where it holds a significant market share.

            "content": "Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) has recalled a small number of drinks over fears they may contain elevated levels of chlorate.\n\nAffected drinks include the six-pack of 250ml cans of Appletizer, 330ml cans of Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coke Zero, and 330ml cans of Sprite Zero.\n\nAfter consultation with relevant authorities, CCEP is recalling a small number of these drinks from Belgium, Luxembourg, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands.\n\nIn the UK, all affected cans have production codes from 328 GE to 338 GE on the base of the cans.\n\n\u201cNo other Coca-Cola products are affected by the issue. The quality and safety of our products is our top priority and we\u2019re sorry that on this occasion, a small number of our products have not met our high standards, and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused,\u201d said a spokesperson for CCEP.\n\nWhat is chlorate?\n\nChlorate is a chemical compound originating from chlorine disinfectants, widely used in food processing and water treatment, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nAccording to the UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Chlorate poses a low risk, especially when consumed only occasionally. However, it has the potential to negatively affect those who already have mild to moderate iodine deficiency, or who are sensitive to it.\n\nIt may also particularly affect young children or those with conditions such as kidney disease, thyroid deficiency, or blood conditions such as anaemia.\n\nLong term intake of chlorate has the potential to limit iodine uptake, which could lead to conditions such as goitre (swelling of the neck when the thyroid gland enlarges).\n\nA single high intake could limit the body\u2019s ability to absorb oxygen from the blood, in severe cases leading to kidney failure.\n\nIn the EU, the default maximum residue level (MRL) of chlorate is 0.01 mg/kg in all products.",

In L\u00fcneburg, where CCEP plans to spend \u20ac11m, the money will be used to complete the construction of the reusable glass production line installed last year, and build a new bottle sorting facility.\n\nMeanwhile, the company will spend \u20ac8m at the Dorsten facility to install a line for manufacturing concentrates for dispenser solutions in the foodservice industry.\n\nThis line is being relocated from Cologne following CCEP\u2019s decision to close its production and logistics facility later this year. When announced in October, the closure was expected to impact 289 out of the total 602 employees working there.\n\nThe new funding will also help to complete renovation in the Dorsten\u2019s syrups production room, which started last year.\n\nA significant portion of the investment \u2013 \u20ac42m \u2013 will also go towards reusable packaging, particularly to make new reusable bottles and crates.\n\nThe fresh funding represents a roughly 10% increase on investments in 2024. Over the past five years, CCEP said it has invested more than \u20ac600m into its German arm.\n\nJohn Galvin, the general manager of CCEP\u2019s Germany unit, said: \u201cIn order to be able to produce competitively in Germany in the future, we need significantly better framework conditions.\n\n\u201cThe urgently needed structural changes must be tackled quickly and decisively after the election.\u201d\n\nA federal election is due to take place in Germany on 23 February.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, CCEP allocated over \u20ac300m to reusable bottling in Germany.\n\nIn 2023, the group invested more than \u20ac40m to set up a new filling line at the L\u00fcneburg facility to enhance its reusable packaging capabilities.\n\nIn June that same year, CCEP reopened the returnable PET bottle lines at its facility in Bad Neuenahr to meet the demand for one litre of returnable PET bottles.\n\nCCEP \u2018s German arm handles the bottling, sales, and distribution of Coca-Cola Company products in Germany.

            "content": "Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) is a better buy today than Kraft Heinz (KHC -0.38%). But the real story is why this is the case. Answering that question not only helps to explain why you'll likely be better off buying the soda giant -- it also explains why some companies have business models that are just better than others.\n\nSure, Kraft Heinz could become a more attractive investment in time, which may interest turnaround investors. But the headwinds pushing Coca-Cola's shares lower right now are opening up a big opportunity for long-term dividend investors.\n\nIs Kraft Heinz's big yield enough?\n\nKraft Heinz is likely popping up on dividend investors' radar screens because it offers a lofty 5.4% dividend yield. To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 has a yield of 1.2%, and the average consumer staples company's yield is roughly 2.8%. If you like stocks that offer a lot of dividend income, Kraft Heinz has that covered.\n\nThe problem is that Kraft Heinz has been a bit of a mess, business-wise, since Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015. The original expectation was that management would cut costs to boost profitability. That's a fine short-term plan, but it's a rather lousy long-term plan, since you can only cut costs so far before you start hurting the business. After a management overhaul, the food maker is now focused on supporting its most important brands while it looks to move away from less desirable ones.\n\nThat's a better long-term plan, and it has worked wonders for consumer staples peers like Procter & Gamble and Unilever. But it hasn't yet helped Kraft Heinz turn the corner with its business. The brands that management has been focusing on have been performing worse than the ones it isn't focusing on. Given enough time, it's highly likely that Kraft Heinz will manage to muddle through this period and get back on track, given its strong stable of brands.\n\nBut until that point, it is a turnaround stock, and dividend increases are likely on hold. Only more aggressive investors will want to own this stock over Coca-Cola.\n\nCoca-Cola is down and looking attractive\n\nCoca-Cola is offering investors a dividend yield of 3.1% today. While that's below the yield you'd collect from Kraft Heinz, it is soundly above the consumer staples average. So dividend investors should still find it relatively attractive. On top of that, the dividend has been increased annually for 62 consecutive years (making the company a Dividend King), which is a record that Kraft Heinz can't come close to matching. The average dividend increase over the past decade was a steady 4% or so.\n\nThat may not sound exciting, but slow and steady growth and an attractive dividend yield is a pretty good combination for conservative income investors. The dividend record here is backed by a business that has executed very well over time. Even though Coca-Cola really just does one thing -- selling beverages -- it does it exceptionally well.\n\nThat remains true despite the roughly 15% pullback from the stock's 52-week high. The big reason for the stock drop is mostly big-picture in nature, related more to things like new weight-loss drugs and the potential for an increase in health consciousness (among both individuals and, perhaps, regulators).\n\nThis pullback has pushed the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios below their five-year averages. There's a compelling argument to be made that Coca-Cola is fairly priced to a little cheap right now. While the headwinds it faces are real, those same issues are also affecting Kraft Heinz. Only Kraft Heinz has other, internal demons to face as well.\n\nFocus on owning the best\n\nIf you are a long-term dividend investor, Coca-Cola's story is likely to be far more attractive than the turnaround theme surrounding Kraft Heinz. There's nothing wrong with buying Kraft Heinz. In time, it will probably get back on its feet again. But weak execution is a problem that has clearly left the company floundering. Only a small number of investors should buy a turnaround stock of this nature.\n\nThe outcome from buying an out-of-favor, but very well-run, company like Coca-Cola is more likely to end happily for long-term investors. The upside may not be as large (or the dividend), but the risk is much lower. Overall, Coca-Cola is likely the better option right now.",

Image: Coca-Cola\n\nWhat are chlorates?\n\nChlorates are salts of chloric acid \u2014 a compound containing chlorine and oxygen, also known as an oxoacid or oxyacid.\n\nThey can occur as a byproduct of chlorine-based disinfectants used in food and drink production, including agriculture. Such disinfectants may be used to sanitize water systems, but can leave chlorate residues in the products.\n\nSodium and potassium chlorates have been used in pesticides but are now prohibited in the European Union.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, sodium chlorate is permitted. A memorandum published in 2020 by the US Environmental Protection Agency stated \"there does not appear to be a concern at this time\" with regards to pesticides.\n\nHow dangerous is it to consume chlorates?\n\nThe Coca-Cola company said in its press statement \"[l]ow levels of chlorate are found in common foods and beverages\" and that \"i]ndependent expert analysis concludes that any associated risk to consumers is very low.\"\n\nHowever, in an oft-quoted study on the \"[r]isks for public health related to the presence of chlorate in food \" (2015), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated that chronic exposure to chlorate could cause the inhibition of iodine intake: \"Chronic exposures are of concern in particular in younger age groups with mild or moderate iodine deficiency.\"\n\nWhen the intake of iodine is inhibited in humans, it can cause temporary changes to thyroid hormone levels in high-risk groups. But the inhibition of iodine intake through chlorate is \"reversible,\" according to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).\n\nAfter assessing the results of laboratory tests on non-human animals, the EFSA estimated a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 3 \u00b5g (micrograms) chlorate/kg of body weight for humans.\n\nThe BfR says a \"one-time intake is regarded as non-critical\" for human health. However, we are unable to say whether a \"one-time intake\" is the same as one can or bottle in this instance, because Coca-Cola has not said how much chlorate was detected in cans or bottles.\n\nWhere else are chlorates found in food?\n\nThe BfR says chlorates have \"frequently\" been detected in deep-frozen vegetables, fruit juices, lettuce and herbs. It says chlorates may be found in these foods because of \"glazing\" techniques, the dilution of juice concentrates and the washing of vegetables with contaminated water.\n\nChlorate is also detected in drinking water. According to the EFSA, drinking water is the main source of chlorate in the diet, possibly contributing up to 60% of chronic chlorate exposure for infants.\n\nThe WHO has proposed a maximum of 0.7mg chlorate per liter for it to be safe to consume.\n\nEdited by: Fred Schwaller\n\nSelected sources:\n\nCoca-Cola product recall: Rappel de produits de Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Belgique 27/01/2025 https://www.coca-cola.com/content/dam/onexp/be/nl/media-2025/afsca_product_information_fr_ccep_final.pdf (in French)\n\nRappel de produits de Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners Belux https://www.coca-cola.com/be/fr/media-center/rappel-ccep (in French)\n\nRisks for public health related to the presence of chlorate in food, the European Food Safety Authority https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4135\n\nFAQs about chlorate in food, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment https://www.bfr.bund.de/en/frequently_asked_questions_about_chlorate_in_food-204084.html",

If we identify any unsafe food, we\u2019ll take action to ensure it is removed and alert consumers.\u201d\n\nChlorate can be found in chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment and food processing, and is found most often in drinking water, according to food safety information published by the European Commission.\n\nIn 2015, the European Food Safety Authority discovered chlorate levels were too high in drinking water, and could cause health problems including thyroid issues which affect iodine intake in young children.\n\nThe CCEO spokesperson said: \u201cIndependent expert analysis concluded that the likelihood of any associated risk of feeling temporarily unwell from consuming these products is very low.\u201d\n\nThey added the business \u201cconsiders the quality and safety of its products as its top priority\u201d.\n\nChlorate is no longer approved as a pesticide in the EU, with maximum residue level set at 0.01 mg/kg for all food products.\n\nIn 2020, the Commission amended the maximum residue level of chlorate for different food products, aside from those intended for infants and young children, which remain at 0.01mg/kg.\n\nTeas, coffees and herbal infusions for instance were set to a maximum of 0.05 mg/kg, while legume vegetables were set to 0.35 mg/kg.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCoca-Cola is launching an Orange Cream variety that contains the taste of its iconic cola infused with orange and creamy vanilla flavors. The beverage was developed in response to consumer demand for the nostalgic taste of orange cream.\n\nThe flavor offering, the first for the brand since it debuted the now discontinued Spiced last winter, is rolling out Feb. 10. Orange Cream also is available in zero sugar. Coca-Cola expects the product to remain on shelves until early 2026 but cautioned that could change depending on market trends and consumer preferences.\n\nAs consumer tastes shift, Coca-Cola has been moving aggressively to grow and maintain interest in its beverage platform. While the Atlanta-based company has expanded its reach in waters, teas and sports drinks, it has continued to innovate its soda portfolio through new flavors.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhen Coca-Cola phased out Spiced last year, the Atlanta-based beverage giant said the drink would be replaced by another offering in 2025.\n\nUnlike Spiced, which despite its name combined traditional Coke flavor with raspberry and \u201cspiced\u201d flavors, Orange Cream leaves little to the imagination about what it will taste like. Still, with consumers continuing to crave nostalgia, and orange cream a flavor that people can relate to, the launch should have little trouble connecting with consumers who desire new flavors and tastes.\n\nThe orange cream flavor has been around since 1905 but has seen a renaissance with interest growing \u201cincrementally\u201d over the last 10 years, Coca-Cola said, citing Google Trends data.\n\nA major part of Coca-Cola\u2019s recent innovation efforts has centered around its Creations platform which debuted in 2022 to highlight the company\u2019s signature beverage while drawing in younger consumers. Creations don\u2019t promote or reveal a flavor profile, such as orange cream, cola, cherry or vanilla, but rather a mood or experience. The extensions have proven successful in drawing consumers into the original Coca-Cola brand.\n\nThe strategy behind Orange Cream is likely similar. Coca-Cola is hoping that Orange Cream will increase consumption among existing users while attracting new drinkers who will later purchase other brands within the company\u2019s portfolio of teas, waters, sports drinks and juices.\n\nWith soft drink consumption slipping as consumers turn to other beverages, many of which are healthier, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper have little choice but to turn to new flavors that have proven to be effective in boosting sales.\n\nJust last week, PepsiCo announced it is combining cherry and creamy vanilla flavors to launch Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream. It\u2019s the first permanent launch for Pepsi since Mango debuted in 2021. Pepsi recently announced it was discontinuing the Mango offering.",

It will be sold in regular and zero sugar varieties.\n\nAtlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said Monday that it developed the soda, which mixes cola with orange and vanilla flavors, in response to growing consumer demand for the comforting, nostalgic flavor.\n\nOrange cream \u2014 first introduced with the Creamsicle ice cream bar in 1937 \u2013 has enjoyed a recent renaissance. Olipop, a probiotic soda, introduced an orange cream flavor in 2021. Carvel reintroduced its Orange Dreamy Creamy ice cream last year for the first time since 1972. Wendy\u2019s also debuted an Orange Dreamsicle Frosty last spring.\n\nCoca-Cola has been experimenting with new flavors to help keep customers engaged with its signature product. In 2022, it launched Coca-Cola Creations, a series of limited-edition Coke flavors in colorful cans and bottles. Coke added hints of coconut, strawberry and even Oreos to the drinks.\n\nThe company introduced raspberry-flavored Coca-Cola Spiced last February, saying the offering would be a permanent addition to its lineup. But the company abruptly pulled Coca-Cola Spiced off the market in September, saying it would be replaced with a new flavor this year.\n\nCoke said Coca-Cola Orange Cream won\u2019t be a permanent flavor but would remain on sale at least through the first quarter of 2026.\n\nIn an interview last year, Coca-Cola\u2019s North American marketing chief, Shakir Moin, said it used to take the company at least a year to develop a new product.

From last year\u2019s (short-lived) Spiced flavor to a K-pop-inspired creation and even an Oreo collab, Coca-Cola has been keeping fans on their toes with new and unexpected flavors.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve got confirmation on the first new Coca-Cola flavor of the year, and while it\u2019s technically brand-new, it feels like a nostalgic nod to a discontinued fan favorite.\n\nCoca-Cola Releases New Orange Cream Flavor\n\nCoca-Cola has officially announced its latest flavor: Orange Cream. It\u2019s everything we love about the classic Coke, infused with a refreshing orange and smooth, creamy vanilla taste. The new fruit-forward flavor is coming in both original and Zero Sugar varieties.\n\nCoca-Cola / Allrecipes\n\nIf the flavor sounds familiar, there\u2019s a good reason why. Back in 2019, Coca-Cola launched Orange Vanilla and Orange Vanilla Zero Sugar to its lineup. But much to fans\u2019 dismay, both varieties were quietly pulled from shelves in 2022, then disappeared from Freestyle machines just a few months ago.\n\nSo, this new orange-flavored variation couldn\u2019t be arriving at a better time. Fans of the original Orange Vanilla Coca-Cola are expecting it to serve as a worthy replacement. \u201cI loved Orange Vanilla, so hopefully this one lives up!\u201d one fan shared on Instagram. \u201cWhen they took away Orange Vanilla Coke, it broke my heart, but this should make up for it,\u201d added another.\n\nNow for the real question: what's the difference between Orange Vanilla and Orange Cream? Coca-Cola hasn\u2019t spilled the full details, but while some speculate marketing is the only differentiator, we\u2019d like to think the brand has something more interesting in store for its fans.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s also unclear whether the new addition will be permanent, but there is hope. After all, its predecessor was previously part of Coca-Cola\u2019s year-round lineup. If anything, the soda\u2019s summery flavor profile has us convinced it will at least stick around for the first half of the year.\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream and Orange Cream Zero Sugar are set to hit shelves beginning Feb. 10, so keep an eye out for any early arrivals in stores. With this sunny new soda flavor on the horizon, the winter months are already starting to feel a bit brighter.",

Olipop, a probiotic soda, introduced an orange cream flavor in 2021. Carvel reintroduced its Orange Dreamy Creamy ice cream last year for the first time since 1972.

Coke added hints of coconut, strawberry and even Oreos to the drinks.\n\nThe company introduced raspberry-flavored Coca-Cola Spiced last February, saying the offering would be a permanent addition to its lineup.

            "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated\n\nHow Fast Is Coca-Cola Consolidated Growing?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Coca-Cola Consolidated has grown EPS by 34% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Coca-Cola Consolidated maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 2.9% to US$6.8b. That's a real positive.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nNasdaqGS:COKE Earnings and Revenue History January 26th 2025\n\nWhile profitability drives the upside, prudent investors always check the balance sheet, too.\n\nAre Coca-Cola Consolidated Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Coca-Cola Consolidated, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$2.2b. That equates to 19% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Very encouraging.\n\nShould You Add Coca-Cola Consolidated To Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that Coca-Cola Consolidated has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Coca-Cola Consolidated by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.",

PEP with Coca-Cola Co KO as its food court beverage supplier, marking a significant shift in the retail giant\u2019s strategy and highlighting Coca-Cola\u2019s growing market momentum.\n\nWhat Happened: The change, announced by Costco CEO Ron Vachris at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting, will take effect this summer, returning Coca-Cola products to Costco\u2019s food courts after a decade-long absence.\n\n\"We will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\" Vachris said, according to CNN.\n\nThe move comes as Coca-Cola demonstrates strong growth potential, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nThe beverage contract, which includes fountain drinks, cups, and straws, has been held by PepsiCo since 2013. The switch back to Coca-Cola coincides with analysts\u2019 bullish outlook on the beverage maker.\n\nSee Also: Trump Is About To Make Americans Pay Even More For Coffee To Punish Colombia, Says AOC: He Is All About Making Inflation \u2018Worse\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery recently initiated coverage of Coca-Cola with an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating and a $74 price target, citing the company\u2019s strong position in North America and Latin America, which contribute approximately 70% of its operating income.\n\nThe transition aligns with Costco\u2019s commitment to maintaining its iconic $1.50 hot dog and soda combination, a loss-leader that sold approximately 150 million units last year. This pricing strategy, unchanged since 1985, remains central to Costco\u2019s customer value proposition, despite inflationary pressures affecting other food court items.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s return to Costco\u2019s food courts could further strengthen its market position. The company\u2019s significant exposure to emerging markets, where roughly 68% of the population doesn\u2019t consume commercial beverages, represents a growth opportunity of about 4.5 times its current consumer base, according to Piper Sandler\u2019s analysis.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola dipped its toes deep into the gaming world through a very unconventional tie-up with Xbox and came out with a series of custom Fanta Xbox controllers.\n\nThe vibrant energy of the signature aesthetic of Fanta finds a fusion with Xbox's iconic gaming hardware. The announcement was of great interest wherein the special design and exclusivity of this limited edition were also emphasized. The bold color schemes and playful details capture the fizziness of Fanta flavors while still being part of the recognizable Xbox design language.\n\nIn its promotional strategy, Coca-Cola added another intrigue to the mix; the controllers are unavailable for purchase through conventional retail. Instead, they are attached to a giveaway campaign focused on particular markets, so they are as elusive as they are eye-catching. The collaboration has buzzed fans around the globe, debating everything from the aesthetic appeal of the controllers to the distribution of the giveaway.\n\nLet's dig deeper into these custom Fanta Xbox controllers and see what makes them the talk of the gaming and branding communities\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe Fanta Xbox controllers boast bold, vibrant designs that signify the iconic aesthetic of Fanta. Each controller sports bright orange, lemon, exotic, fruit twist, grape, and lemon-elderflower tones, similar to Fanta's signature soda flavors. Designs are sleek with a glossy finish that enhances the visual appeal, and the Xbox logo is blended in. Additionally, the controllers' thumbsticks and buttons use the standard configuration of Xbox for functional purposes.\n\nOne unique feature is its Fanta-inspired accents, such as small bubble motifs on the grips, which are created to resemble carbonation. The design conveys a fun and refreshing appeal that the brand embodies.\n\nAvailability and Restrictions\n\nThese Fanta Xbox controllers are a limited-edition release; therefore, they will not be sold in stores. Coca-Cola managed to settle for an exclusive model of distribution. The fans will have to attend or win promotional events that the company is holding so that they can get one.\n\nThe campaign is still geo-restricted. This promotion is only available exclusively in regions like Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway. There\u2019s no information yet on whether it will be extended to other regions. Therefore, some people are disappointed, as they can't participate in this giveaway. Those who could participate can access more information on Coca-Cola's main website or platforms for promotions run by Xbox.\n\nOnline Reactions\n\nReactions on various social media platforms were posted about the news. Fans claim that the controllers are unique and innovative. Different social forums, such as Twitter and Instagram, were filled with gamers sharing their excitement over this promotion.\n\nAs one Instagram user put it:\n\n\"Xbox and Fantasy nailed it with these stunning new controller colours! This collab is next-level! \ud83d\udd25\"\n\nInstagram fan comment ( image via fantagb_ireland and xboxuk / Instagram )\n\nand another said:\n\n\"Let the games begin \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf08\"\n\nInstagram fan comment ( image via fantagb_ireland and xboxuk / Instagram )\n\nHow To Enter The Xbox Promotion\n\nTo enter the contest,scan the QR code on any Fanta pack and then follow all instructions on the Coke App. From there, you must complete the entry requirements to get yourselves into the sweepstakes.

The participants can win instant prizes on the app or participate in the Prize Draw.\n\nIn total, 1,600 winning moments are programmed for the promotional event. There will be a winner based on who's the first to enter at the precise time when a winning moment occurs or just right after. However, all prizes may be claimed if some winning moments go unmatched, adding a layer of exclusivity to the promotion.\n\nTrending\n\nThe custom Fanta Xbox controllers are the perfect creative blend of branding and gaming that will undoubtedly excite Coca-Cola fans as well as Xbox enthusiasts.\n\nKindly visit the official website of Coca-Cola for more details.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Is the Costco food court switching to Coca-Cola products? The rumor that locations would switch away from Pepsi has been swirling around social media for weeks, but the warehouse superstore has been quiet on the subject\u2014until now.\n\nOn January 23, the company held its annual shareholders meeting, and CEO Ron Vachris was asked about the food court beverage rumors. His reply? \u201cWe will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nLongtime Costco members will recall that Coke products used to be a food court staple. The company switched to Pepsi in 2013. According to CNN, \"Costco solicits bids from companies for its fountain drink business at food courts, and Pepsi has been awarded the fountain soda contract since 2013. The deal is not just for the machines and syrup in the sodas, but cups, straws and other products.\"\n\nKatie Bowlby\n\nVachris did not comment on the timing of the switch, or what other changes may come along with the swap to Coke products, but we're hoping for better cups and lids. Pepsi drinkers are bound to be disappointed, but Coke fans on Reddit are overjoyed with the news, writing \"Been waiting a long time for this! Best news ever!!! WOOHOO!!!\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\" Another said, \"Sorry but I\u2019m not a Pepsi fan, and can\u2019t wait to get that sweet Diet Coke at the fountains again.\"\n\nCostco has been switching things up at the food court lately by bringing in cookies and new sandwiches. We'll be keeping our fingers crossed that the hot dog combo stays at $1.50.",

            "content": "Birmingham\u2019s brand new amphitheater is scheduled to open in just a few months, and like many music lovers here, we\u2019re eagerly anticipating the first show.\n\nConstruction is ongoing, and the Coca-Cola Amphitheater should be ready for the public in June 2025, according to organizers. The outdoor venue is expected to have 9,380-seats, a $46 million price tag and a debut season of up to 20 concerts.\n\nThe amphitheater \u2014 owned by the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex and managed by Live Nation \u2014 already has 11 shows on its agenda, ranging from comedian Matt Rife (June 22) to country star Jason Aldean (Sept. 26).\n\nThat\u2019s reason to cheer, even for folks who bemoan the closing of Oak Mountain Amphitheatre, a Live Nation venue in nearby Pelham. Oak Mountain was shuttered after its 2024 season, making way for the high-profile project downtown.\n\nREAD: Thanks for the memories, Oak Mountain Amphitheatre, whatever the future holds\n\nMusic fans have plenty of opinions about Oak Mountain going dark, of course. But they\u2019re also quick to suggest big-name acts that could be perfect for the new amphitheater.\n\nCountry! Classic rock! \u201890s nostalgia! Rap and R&B!\n\nToday, we\u2019re adding another voice to the chorus, offering our top five picks for the Coca-Cola Amphitheater. And let\u2019s have no grumbling about \u201cso-and-so would never play at that venue in Birmingham.\u201d This is a wish list, OK?\n\nHere goes:\n\nBrittany Howard performed with the Alabama Shakes at Tuscaloosa Get Up 3 at the Bama Theatre in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024. An Alabama Shakes reunion is on our wish list for concerts at Coca-Cola Amphitheater in Birmingham. (Ben Flanagan / AL.com)Ben Flanagan\n\nAlabama Shakes\n\nWho: Soul-rock band from Athens, formed in 2009 and fronted by powerhouse singer Brittany Howard. The Shakes quickly became stars in the music world, releasing a debut album, \u201cBoys & Girls,\u201d in 2012 and earning rapturous reviews. The band won three Grammys in 2016, all linked to the album \u201cSound & Color,\u201d and one more in 2018 for \u201cKiller Diller Blues,\u201d a track from \u201cThe American Epic Sessions (Deluxe).\u201d The Shakes went on hiatus in 2018 as Howard launched a solo career, and she\u2019s continued to achieve in the music world. Howard won her first solo Grammy in 2021 for \u201cStay High,\u201d a track from the album \u201cJaime,\u201d in the category of Best Rock Performance. She was nominated again in 2025, in the category of Best Alternative Music Album for \u201cWhat Now.\u201d\n\nWhy: The Alabama Shakes are beloved in their home state, and many fans moaned when they heard the mega-popular group was disbanding. We\u2019d love to see a Shakes reunion in Birmingham, even if it\u2019s a one-off show and the band stays kaput. After all, Howard reunited with most of her former bandmates \u2014 Heath Fogg, Zac Cockrell and Ben Tanner \u2014 for the Tuscaloosa Get Up 3 fundraiser in December at the Bama Theatre. The setlist featured \u201cHold On,\u201d \u201cHang Loose,\u201d \u201cGimme All Your Love,\u201d \u201cI Ain\u2019t the Same\u201d and Always Alright.\u201d Why should Tuscaloosa have all the fun?\n\nGood to know: Howard, 36, recently announced plans for a new side project, Kumite. It\u2019s a hardcore punk band.\n\nREAD: Which Alabama music star has the most Grammy wins? The answer might surprise you\n\nBob Dylan performed as a surprise guest during Farm Aid at Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center on September 23, 2023, in Noblesville, Indiana. The folk-rock legend is on our wish list for concerts at Coca-Cola Amphitheater in Birmingham, Alabama.(Photo by Gary Miller/Getty Images)\n\nBob Dylan\n\nWho: Legendary folk-rock artist, 83, known for his influential, poetic and enduring music catalog, as well as his irascible and secretive personality. Dylan\u2019s years of touring and endurance on the road are part of his fame, along with his penchant for change. Dylan, perhaps the ultimate vocal stylist, rarely performs trademark tunes on stage as they were recorded originally. He pulls and prods, twists and truncates, stretches and slides, altering the melodies to suit his fancy. As a result, listeners at his shows play a guessing game \u2014 What song is that? \u2014 and there\u2019s a rush of victory when they figure it out. Dylan has a wealth of awards to his credit, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe and 10 Grammys. He\u2019s a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, was feted at Kennedy Center Honors in 1997 and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Dylan earned a Pulitzer Prize special citation in 2008, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016.\n\nWhy: Can you say \u201csuperstar\u201d? Dylan might not enjoy the spotlight, but he\u2019s earned a high-profile place in music history. He made his last appearance in Birmingham in 2022 at the BJCC Concert Hall, and has played here over the years at venues ranging from Boutwell Auditorium to Legacy Arena to the former City Stages festival. Right now, Dylan has one tour date on his agenda, on March 25 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. If he\u2019s planning to travel again on his \u201cRough and Rowdy Ways\u201d album, we definitely want a show.\n\nGood to know: Interest from hardcore Dylan fans never seems to wane. However, public attention has returned to his life and work in a big way, courtesy of the 2024 movie \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The bio-pic starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned eight Oscar nominations this week, and is on a roll at the box office. Dylan was involved in the making of the film, which features early signature songs such as \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me, Babe,\u201d \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019,\u201d \u201cMasters of War,\u201d \u201cMaggie\u2019s Farm\u201d and \u201cLike a Rolling Stone.\u201d\n\nJack White performed during \"Live From Detroit: The Concert at Michigan Central\" on Thursday, June 6, 2024, in Detroit. He's on our wish list for concerts at the new Coca-Cola Amphitheater in Birmingham, Alabama.(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nJack White\n\nWho: Innovative rock star, idiosyncratic artist, chameleon producer, record label chief and determined entrepreneur. White, 49, has earned fame for his work as a solo artist, but he initially made his name as a prime mover for The White Stripes, an indie rock darling that released six studio albums, 1997-2011. Other projects \u2014 such as The Dead Weather and The Raconteurs \u2014 have been intriguing, too. White\u2019s latest studio album, \u201cNo Name,\u201d was released in July 2024. He was among the cast of Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d taking a small but notable role in the 2023 film.\n\nWhy: White is unique and compelling, on stage and off. When he performs in Birmingham \u2014 as he did in 2012 at the WorkPlay soundstage \u2014 it always feels like a Very Special Event. (\u201dA few words that immediately came to mind were intensity, creativity, eccentricity and acid trip,\u201d AL.com said in its review.) White isn\u2019t a frequent visitor to Alabama, but he did perform in 2022 at the Orion Amphitheater in Huntsville. Now that Coca-Cola Amp is nearing completion, a Birmingham date seems like a necessity.\n\nGood to know: White was among the guest artists teaming with Ringo Starr when the former Beatle performed on Jan. 14-15 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The shows were filmed for a two-hour TV special, according to Variety, and proceeds from \u201cRingo & Friends at the Ryman\u201d are set to benefit the American Red Cross and those impacted by the California wildfires. Air date for the CBS special is TBA.\n\nCher performed at the 39th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2024, at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland. She's on our wish list for a concert in Birmingham, Alabama, especially at the new Coca-Cola Amphitheater.(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nCher\n\nWho: Glam pop icon, 78, renowned for her work in TV, movies, and the recording world. Her hits include \u201cThe Way of Love,\u201d \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time,\u201d \u201cI Found Someone,\u201d \u201cDark Lady,\u201d \u201cHalf-Breed,\u201d \u201cGypsies, Tramps and Thieves,\u201d \u201cI Got You Babe,\u201d and more. Cher first earned fame in the 1960s as part of the duo Sonny & Cher. She made waves with her rich alto voice and outrageous fashion sense, on full display when she starred in \u201cThe Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\u201d (1971-1974) with then-husband Sonny Bono. Cher has many awards to her credit, including a Grammy, an Emmy and Billboard accolades. She\u2019s an Oscar and Golden Globe winner, too, earning the awards for best actress in 1988 for \u201cMoonstruck.\u201d\n\nWhy: Well, it\u2019s Cher! She\u2019s a household name in the entertainment world, and her shows tend to be visual extravaganzas with elaborate costumes and sets. That makes a Cher show fun to watch, and her fans tend to come out in force. Cher rarely performs in Birmingham, and her last appearance here, set for March 20, 2020, at Legacy Arena, was canceled just a few days before the show date. The coronavirus pandemic hit, and sure, Cher did the right thing. But we still felt cheated. It\u2019s high time for a make-up concert.\n\nGood to know: \u201cCher: The Memoir, Part One,\u201d was published in November and quickly took the No. 1 spot for nonfiction on The New York Times best-seller list. A sequel is expected in 2025.\n\nSting performed on his \"Sting 3.0\" tour at The Wiltern, Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024, in Los Angeles. He's on our wish list for concerts at the new Coca-Cola Amphitheater in Birmingham, Alabama.(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nSting\n\nWho: Dynamic British singer and songwriter, known for his ethereal voice, on-stage charisma and intelligent meld of rock, blues, jazz, pop, reggae and world music. Sting, 73, first earned fame in the 1970s and \u201880s as the frontman of The Police, via five platinum albums and hit singles such as \u201cRoxanne,\u201d \u201dMessage in a Bottle\u201a\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Stand So Close to Me,\u201d \u201cEvery Little Thing She Does Is Magic\u201d and \u201cEvery Breath You Take.\u201d Sting\u2019s first solo album, 1985\u2019s \u201cThe Dream of the Blue Turtles,\u201c was a success, and he\u2019s followed that with more than a dozen records. Sting has won 17 Grammy Awards and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 with the Police.\n\nWhy: A full-scale Police reunion seems highly unlikely, but a Sting concert in Birmingham? Hey, it could happen. Fans here have waited way too long for Sting\u2019s return \u2014 it\u2019s been nearly 25 years since his last appearance at Oak Mountain Amphitheatre in Pelham \u2014 but hope springs eternal.\n\nGood to know: The \u201cSting 3.0\u2033 tour (with guitarist Dominic Miller and drummer Chris Maas) launched in fall 2024 and continues into 2025, with dates in the U.S. and overseas. Sting canceled and rescheduled some shows in January, due to a \u201ctemporary throat infection\u201d that made him unable to sing, according to a post on his Instagram. Sting\u2019s agenda includes two shows in May at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and six co-headlining shows with Billy Joel.\n\nDolly Parton performed at an event to celebrate the expansion of the Imagination Library of Kentucky at the Lyric Theatre in Lexington, Ky., on Aug. 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File)\n\nHonorable mention: Dolly Parton\n\nCan someone persuade this country queen to tour again? Parton, 79, seems way too busy these days, running an empire that includes The Dollywood Company, The Dollywood Foundation, her Imagination Library, a cornucopia of Dolly-themed products and more. She\u2019s still recording music, too, and released \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA: Family, Faith and Fables,\u201d in November 2024. Parton made her last appearance in Birmingham way back in 2005, performing at the BJCC. (\u201cWhen the star is so charismatic, the performance so absorbing and the material so good, time races past,\u201d The Birmingham News said in its review of her 90-minute show.) Twenty years later, we bet this lovely legend would pack \u2018em in with a return engagement at the new amphitheater.\n\nRELATED: 15 acts we\u2019d like to see at Protective Stadium in Alabama",

File Photo by Kevin Dietsch/UPI | License Photo\n\nJan. 25 (UPI) -- Aficionados of Costco's famous $1.50 hot dogs will once again be able to top off their cheap treats with a Coca-Cola after more than a decade of unavailability at the discount retailer, its CEO says. Costco's promotion of the inexpensive hot dog coupled with a Coke at its food courts became one of its signature branding elements in the decades after its founding, but in 2013, the chain opted to drop Coke products in favor of competitor Pepsi. Advertisement\n\nThat decision is now being repealed, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said Thursday at a shareholder's meeting, according to CNN.\n\n\"We will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\" he said.\n\nThe impending decision was first reported on Dec. 17 by the Costco Insider online blog.\n\nThe switch to Pepsi 12 years ago came because Costco was trying to cut costs in a way that would enable it to retain the $1.50 hot dog price, according to the Insider. The retailer ended up going with Pepsi because Coke wouldn't match the prices it was offering to rival Walmart and it was imperative for Costco to retain the hot dog price point -- per the orders of co-founder Jim Sinegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe promotion was so beloved by Sinegal that he warned his successor as CEO, W. Craig Jelinek, not to raise the price under any circumstances, even though it was a money-loser, Jelinek reportedly told a local Chamber of Commerce audience in 2018.\n\nNow, after a 12-year absence, Coke will finally be back the fountains at the Costco food courts, sparking joy among some fans.\n\n\"Coke is a much, much better option. I'm happy for this news!\" poster Rexpiper wrote in Costco Insider's comments section, while another, Wanda Flora, added, \"Thank you!! I only drink Pepsi when it's a last resort. Glad you are going back to the good stuff.\"",

With a grant of $15 million (nearly Rs 130 crore) from TCCF, this three-year program will be implemented across nine countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.Launched in India on Thursday (December 22), the initiative aims to revolutionise plastic waste management practices.This includes promoting recycling, minimising plastic pollution, developing country-specific solutions, and fostering regional cooperation.By sharing best practices and encouraging policy changes, the program seeks to reduce and ultimately eliminate disposable plastic, while also improving the livelihoods of waste workers.\u201cBy adopting and disseminating best practices across the region, the programme aims to inspire policy changes and community-level actions to reduce and help to eliminate disposable plastic and improve the livelihoods of waste workers,\u201d TCCF said in a statement.Carlos Pagoaga , president of The Coca-Cola Foundation emphasised that the partnership with UNDP will focus on advancing solutions to minimise packaging waste, improve collection methods, and enhance processing capabilities.\u201cCollaboration is key to help improve waste management systems and strengthen recycling infrastructure,\u201d Pagoaga added.Meanwhile, Christophe Bahuet, UNDP deputy regional director for Asia and the Pacific, highlighted the region\u2019s commitment to combating plastic waste through circular economy principles.\u201cAcross Asia, countries are combating the problem by embracing the circular economy. Through our Zero Waste and Plastics initiatives, we are helping them craft policies, attract investments, and reduce the consumption of single-use plastics,\u201d Bahuet added.",

But Costco plans to bring back Coca-Coca at its food court soda fountains this summer and ditch its archrival.\n\n\u201cWe will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\u201d Costco CEO Ron Vachris said Thursday at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting.\n\nRumors had been swirling that Costco planned to make the switch. A shareholder asked Vachris if the food court was \u201ctruly switching back to Coke products.\u201d\n\nCostco solicits bids from companies for its fountain drink business at food courts, and Pepsi has been awarded the fountain soda contract since 2013. The deal is not just for the machines and syrup in the sodas, but cups, straws and other products.\n\nCoke had been a mainstay of Costco food courts for decades, but Costco switched to Pepsi in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big shift,\u201d a Costco executive said in 2013 when the company made the change. Coke is the \u201conly vendor we\u2019ve ever had for the majority of the business locations.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Costco said it was making the switch to \u201cpreserve the integrity\u201d of Costco\u2019s $1.50 hot-dog soda combination deal. The price has remained the same since 1985, and Costco sold around 150 million of the hot dog-soda combos last year.\n\nThe $1.50 hot dog price is a powerful marketing tool for Costco and has become synonymous with Costco\u2019s brand. Costco loses money on the deal, but the company offsets these losses by raising prices on other goods it sells. Costco has increased prices of pizzas and other items at its food courts.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy making a big deal about a hot dog, but we spend a lot of time on it,\u201d Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal told the Seattle Times in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re known for that hot dog. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t mess with.\u201d\n\nSinegal also famously once said, \u201cIf you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out,\u201d according to former CEO Craig Jelinek.\n\nCostco\u2019s chief financial officer reassured inflation-weary customers last year not to worry about the price of the combo, saying the $1.50 price was \u201csafe.\u201d",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and The Coca-Cola Co. (KO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Today's Featured Research Reports Cisco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +23.9%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscriptions accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base. The buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition. (You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> ) Shares of Abbott have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. +18.6%). The company\u2019s pipeline is unlocking new growth opportunities, supporting the company\u2019s positive momentum and strong growth outlook for 2025. Freestyle Libre, Lingo and Libre Rio CGM devices are on a great trajectory. Alinity, the company\u2019s next-generation suite of systems, is a key driver in the core lab diagnostics business. The company is optimistic about its latest progress with biosimilars and expects this to significantly boost EPD sales, beginning 2025. Within Nutrition, despite softness in its international pediatric segment, Abbott is regaining market share banking on a strong Adult Nutrition business. Yet the significant runoff of COVID-19 testing-related sales is hurting Abbott\u2019s Diagnostics growth. Headwinds such as tough macro conditions and foreign exchange also add to the worry. (You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>> ) Coca-Cola\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+6.3% vs. -4.6%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evident by its strong track record of beating expectations. In third-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the seventh consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement. Results benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. KO is well-poised to benefit from its marketing and innovation strategies, and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024. It expects organic revenue growth of 10% for 2024, with comparable EPS to grow 5-6%. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.

Their long-standing commitment to South African rugby has been instrumental in the development of the sport.\n\n\u201cThis new chapter will help us achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, providing us with the support needed to nurture talent and engage with fans across the nation.\u201d\n\nLate last year, SA Rugby and rugby equipment brand Rhino agreed a seven-year ball supply partnership. Rhino will provide match balls at international level for the representative South African national sides in their home matches, as well as for all domestic leagues and cups.\n\nOther commercial partners of the governing body include MTN, FNB, and Nike.",

The familiar red label, adorned with the trademarked cursive font, is deeply rooted in American history \u2014 though it has spread to all corners of the world. While nothing will upstage the classic Coke, the brand has released several understudies, including Diet Coke, Coke Zero, and a selection of flavored Cokes. It seems like everyone has sworn their allegiance to a singular product (I'm talking about you, Diet Coke stans), but it left me wondering if any single Coke flavor is actually deserving of the \"best\" title.\n\nI'll be honest: I'm not a big soda drinker, which makes me a bit of an odd pick to take on this heavily carbonated project. But I wanted to finally settle some of the rumors about this iconic product for myself. For one, is there an actual difference between Diet Coke and Coke Zero? Does the glass bottle really make the flavor of Mexican Coke different? Only time, and a lot of sipping, would tell.

            "content": "The Coca-Cola Company is one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands. Founded in 1886, the company today is vastly different from its creator's original intent. The original formula was invented by John Stith Pemberton as a health drink, energy boost, and patent medicine following his time in the Civil War. The name is derived from two of the original ingredients coca leaves and kola nuts, although those ingredients are not used today, and was intended to be sold in pharmacies.\n\nPemberton sold his formula and brand in 1889 to Asa Griggs Candler who then embarked on a nationwide advertising campaign. By 1895 Coca-Cola was being sold in every state in the union and it wouldn\u2019t be long before the beverage was being enjoyed worldwide. By 1889 the company was operating under a franchised distribution system that is still in effect today.\n\nToday, the Coca-Cola Company primarily makes syrups that are shipped to bottler/distributors who command exclusive territories. The Coca-Cola Company retains ownership of the largest US bottler, Coca-Cola Refreshments but there are many others around the world. Coca-Cola Femsa, of which The Coca-Cola Company owns 28%, is located in Mexico and is the world\u2019s largest bottler of Coca-Cola\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and operates as a beverage company worldwide with sales in over 200 countries. The company manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages and has expanded well beyond soda and pop. After years of expansion and acquisitions, The Coca-Cola Company is represented in verticals from sparkling soft drinks to flavored water, enhanced water, sports beverages, juice, dairy, tea, and coffee. Brands under the Coca-Cola umbrella include Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Gold Peak, Minute Maid, Simply, BODYARMOR, FUZE TEA, and Powerade brands.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company first went public in 1919 and it began paying a dividend in 1920. The company has raised its dividend every year since 1962 making it a Dividend King. To put the company\u2019s growth and scale into perspective, one share of KO purchased at the IPO price of $40 was worth nearly $10 million in 2012 and the stock price has nearly doubled since then. Underwriters of the original IPO received $100,000 worth of shares in compensation for the deal and were able to sell it for $2 billion at that time. The Coca-Cola Company is also a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average holding its position from 1932 to 1935 and from 1987 to the present.",

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.93%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.22%.\n\nThe world's largest beverage maker's stock has dropped by 1.69% in the past month, exceeding the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 3.04% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 2.69%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Coca-Cola will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 11, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.52, reflecting a 6.12% increase from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $10.71 billion, down 1.3% from the year-ago period.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.28% upward. Coca-Cola presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Coca-Cola has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.84 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.62, which means Coca-Cola is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt's also important to note that KO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.38. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Beverages - Soft drinks industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.25.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 172, positioning it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.",

Rapid urbanization, increasing demand for single-use plastics, and gaps in waste management infrastructure have contributed to a rising volume of plastic waste, making effective solutions more urgent than ever.\n\nA significant portion of the world\u2019s plastic waste enters the ocean through waterways in the region, posing serious threats to marine ecosystems, human health, and livelihoods. Sixteen of the top twenty polluting rivers in the world are in Asia, and account for more than two thirds -of the global annual volume of plastics flowing into the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nIn response to this urgent issue, UNDP and TCCF are scaling up efforts in nine Asian countries\u2014Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam\u2014supported by a $15 million grant from TCCF to support UNDP\u2019s initiatives across the region.\n\nThe three-year multi-country programme launched in India today, will help improve plastic waste management, promote recycling, reduce plastic leakage into the environment, foster country-based solutions, and facilitate regional collaboration. By adopting and disseminating best practices across the region, the programme aims to inspire policy changes and community-level actions to reduce and help to eliminate disposable plastic and improve the livelihoods of waste workers.\n\nWhile expanding successful initiatives, the programme will focus on developing innovative business models for waste collection and recycling, offering technical advice on environmental best practices and tapping into the latest technology to improve collection and recycling, to reduce plastic leakage.\n\n\"Tackling plastic waste isn't just about cleaning up \u2013 it's also about building a smarter development model. Across Asia, countries are combating the problem by embracing the circular economy. Through our Zero Waste and Plastics initiatives, we are helping them craft policies, attract investments, and reduce the consumption of single-use plastics,\u201d said Christophe Bahuet, UNDP Deputy Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific. \u201cWith this initiative, we are also empowering communities to scale up solutions that will effectively reduce plastic pollution and safeguard our planet.\"\n\n\u201cCollaboration is key to help improve waste management systems and strengthen recycling infrastructure.

The company purchases beverage concentrates and syrup from Coca-Cola, which it then processes and packages for distribution through modern trade, traditional trade and the on-premises channel. Mexico and Brazil make up 80% of total sales, with the rest from other Central and South American countries, including Panama, Guatemala, Uruguay, and Argentina. Parent Femsa and Coca-Cola hold 47% and 28% of economic interests in Coca-Cola Femsa, through nonpublicly traded A and D shares, respectively, while controlling 56% and 33% of the respective voting power.\n\nA quick look at the share price history (below) over the past twelve months shows that the price is up 198.17%.\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\nOne of the metrics we use in our screens is IV/P (Intrinsic Value to Price). Let us simplify what it means:\n\nIV/P (Intrinsic Value to Price) tells you if a stock is a good deal or not based on how much value you\u2019re getting for the price you pay. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nThe Calculation: It adds up the stock\u2019s ability to make money (Earning Power), grow (Incremental Growth), and pay back investors (Shareholder Yield). This gives you an idea of what the stock is really worth, called its Implied Value. The Meaning of IV/P: If IV/P is greater than 1 , it means you\u2019re getting more value than you\u2019re paying for. For example, for every $1 you invest, you\u2019re getting more than $1 of value. That\u2019s a good deal!\n\n, it means you\u2019re getting more value than you\u2019re paying for. For example, for every $1 you invest, you\u2019re getting more than $1 of value. That\u2019s a good deal! If IV/P is less than 1, it means you\u2019re getting less value than you\u2019re paying for. For example, for every $1 you invest, you\u2019re getting less than $1 of value. That might not be a great deal. What It\u2019s Used For: It\u2019s a quick way to spot undervalued stocks (good deals).\n\nIf IV/P is very low, like 0.6 (you\u2019re only getting 60 cents of value for $1), it\u2019s likely overpriced. Important Note: This is just an estimate. Other factors, like market trends or company issues, can affect how accurate this is.\n\nSo, IV/P helps investors find stocks that are \u201ccheap\u201d based on how much value they give back. Higher is usually better!\n\nWe currently have an IV/P of 2.60 for Coca-Cola Femsa SAB de CV , which means the stock\u2019s Implied Value is calculated to be 2.60 times greater than its current price. In simpler terms:\n\nFor every $1 you invest , you\u2019re potentially getting $2.60 of value .\n\n, you\u2019re potentially getting . This is an extremely high ratio, which might suggest the stock is deeply undervalued or that there\u2019s some mispricing or unusual calculation in the data.\n\nPossible Reasons for This Undervaluation:\n\nEmerging Market Risks: With the bulk of its operations in Latin America, geopolitical instability, inflationary pressures, and varying economic conditions can lead to lower investor confidence in regionally exposed companies. Global Interest Rate Environment: Rising global interest rates may increase borrowing costs and reduce the relative attractiveness of equity investments, particularly in emerging markets. Commodities and Inflation Impact: Higher costs of raw materials (e.g., sugar, aluminum for cans) due to global inflationary trends could impact margins, even if temporary, leading to a cautious valuation. Slower Global Growth: Concerns about slowing global economic growth may make investors hesitant to invest in beverage companies, despite their relatively defensive nature. LatAm Economic Sentiment: Negative perceptions about the economic and political outlook in countries like Brazil and Mexico might contribute to lower valuations for regionally focused companies. FX and Devaluation Risks: Strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against Latin American currencies can lead to lower dollar-denominated earnings, making the stock less attractive to international investors. Despite all of the above, the company has a FCF Yield of 24.44%, a Dividend Yield of 17.80%, a 5Y ROA of 14%, and an Acquirer\u2019s Multiple of 2.80.\n\nFor all the latest news and podcasts, join our free newsletter here.\n\nFREE Stock Screener\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check out our FREE Large Cap 1000 \u2013 Stock Screener, here at The Acquirer\u2019s Multiple:",

            "content": "Kenya Barris is telling an American story, one can of soda after another.\n\nIn a new six-minute short film, the writer, director and showrunner, known for his work behind the ABC series \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d helps Coca-Cola show the resonance its broader portfolio of beverages have had on Americans for more than half a century. The new commercial, called \u201cWestside\u2019s Finest,\u201d features Barris, Omari Hardwick, Lionel Boyce, Lauren London and Nelson Franklin as the family that runs a local convenience store changes with the times and eras. There are also appearances by Coke, Sprite, Mr. Pibb, Honest Kids \u2014 and even New Coke and Tab.\n\nBy the time the piece ends, viewers may feel like they sat through a mini-series \u2014 one that is made for modern attention spans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but I think people do like to watch longer-form commercials when they\u2019re done in an interesting way,\u201d says Barris, during a recent interview.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe Westside saga is Coca-Cola\u2019s latest effort to remind consumers of the broader range of drinks it makes. Last year, the company rolled out an ad early in 2024 from \u201cThe Bear\u201d creator Christopher Storer that depicted a very large family making use of different Coca-Cola products as they welcome one woman\u2019s new significant other to the fold. The difference? That commercial was designed to turn up in ESPN programming and entertainment shows on cable networks. Barris\u2019 work will stream online, with different edits distributed to a variety of different audiences on social media and TV.\n\nThe strategy has \u201cincreased our share, increased even people\u2019s perception of the company, and the products we sold,\u201d says Alex Ames, director of content and creative excellence at Coca-Cola North America, during an interview.\n\nThis new effort seeks to remind consumers that Coca-Cola is a \u201csponsor of generations,\u201d a concept that Barris took to heart. \u201cI was able to really wrap my head around it,\u201d he says, and envisioned \u201cwhat it meant to see a store being in the neighborhood, and changing and changing and changing.\u201d Over the six minutes \u2014 and the decades depicted within them \u2014 couples meet; family members pass away; and others come to the fore. A neighborhood store, says Barris, \u201cis like a piece of life. It\u2019s almost a second home.\u201d\n\nThe effort sent Coca-Cola creative executives and archivists scrambling to find the appropriate designs, packaging materials and promotions so that every time period in the store looked just right. That sometimes meant having to source actual cans and memorabilia, said Ames, or having to recreate items from scratch.\n\nSometimes, such work is more difficult than coming up with the creative concept,, the executive says. \u201cYou try finding a Minute Maid can from 1995.\u201d",

The tradition dates back to 2005, when George Bush received one.\n\nEight years ago, when Donald Trump was first sworn in as president, the Coca-Cola Company got it wrong. The company offered a commemorative bottle of its flagship product to the incoming president to recognize his presidency. Problem was: Trump doesn\u2019t drink Coke. He\u2019s a Diet Coke fan.\n\nSo, as the transfer of power is set to take place Monday, the Atlanta-based soda giant is correcting that error. On Wednesday, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey presented Trump with a customized commemorative bottle of Diet Coke instead.\n\nTrump, according to some reports, would drink as many as 12 cans of Diet Coke a day during his first term. Still, as many tech companies have aligned themselves with Trump\u2019s inauguration, the president-elect\u2019s critics are turning their attentions to Coke.\n\nThe company, however, notes this sort of gift for an incoming president is nothing new and not a partisan statement.\n\n\u201cThe Coca-Cola Company has a tradition of creating commemorative Coca-Cola bottles in celebration of U.S. presidential inaugurations, dating back to 2005,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cJames Quincey, CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, met with President Elect Donald Trump to present a commemorative bottle of Diet Coke and to highlight Coca-Cola's contributions to the U.S. economy. With over 60 bottling partners, we generate $58 billion in U.S. economic activity and support 860,000 jobs annually. This meeting reinforces our commitment to strengthening America's economic future.\u201d\n\nWant one of the commemorative bottles? You\u2019re out of luck, unless you have some serious connections.\n\nThe inauguration bottles will not be sold at retail, but a limited number are being made for the White House and will be distributed at inauguration events.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the better-known and successful investors. His Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) since its inception in the mid-1960s. So respected is his reputation that some investors will assume a stock belongs on a buy list simply because Berkshire owns shares.\n\nThat may not be the case with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Despite being a long-held position of Berkshire and a globally known iconic brand, the company's growth track and financials indicate it is not likely to serve new investors as well as it did Buffett and his team. Here's why.\n\nCoca-Cola as a Buffett holding\n\nBerkshire Hathaway acquired 400 million Coca-Cola shares in various lots between 1988 and 1994. By any measure, Buffett's investment instincts have paid off for Berkshire. The investment holding company spent around $1.3 billion to acquire its shares. After over 30 years of appreciation, those shares are now worth around $25 billion.\n\nHowever, that is not the extent of Berkshire's returns. The company pays $1.94 per share in annual dividends, and because these increases have occurred for 62 straight years, the payout has become a lucrative cash source for Buffett's company.\n\nNew shareholders would earn a dividend yield of about 3.1% on shares purchased today, far above the S&P 500's 1.25% current average.\n\nStill, Berkshire's long-term ownership brings a significantly higher return. Its 400 million shares generated $776 million in dividend income in 2024. Thus, its annual dividend yield on cost averages almost 60% of its initial investment cost! Moreover, Coca-Cola will likely hike the payout for a 63rd year in February to maintain its Dividend King status, meaning Berkshire should continue to profit handsomely from the payout.\n\nWhy now is likely not a good time to buy\n\nStill, rather than focusing on following Buffett, investors should ask the more pertinent question of why his team has not added shares in over 30 years.\n\nThat likely comes down to the company's growth prospects. Its flagship beverage is in the enviable position of being available in nearly every country in the world. Unfortunately for the company, this leaves little room for additional significant growth for Coca-Cola. Hence, it drives most of its expansion through the acquisition of other brands.\n\nTo its credit, it saw this early and acquired its first brand, Minute Maid, in 1960. Coca-Cola has gone on to purchase over 200 brands and has also ventured into alcohol with its Topo Chico hard seltzers.",

Because the company generates free cash flow (FCF) worth around 20% of its estimated 2024 income, it can make its dividend payment bigger \u2013 this could happen via a potential 5.1% increase to $2.04 per share.\n\nAccording to analyst estimates, KO stock is forecasted to reach an average price between $71.49 and $73.77, showing they have a unified understanding of its potential direction. Current stockholders can make more money by trading short-bet put options that are currently unprofitable.\n\nDespite declining from $70 more recently, investors consider KO stock inexpensive because it offers a dividend yield above what it has been delivering in the past five years. Experts think KO's shares could jump 14% higher in the next few months, as cash flow is set to rise and dividend amounts are expected to increase.\n\nCoca-Cola's long history of steady growth combined with its strong financial standing means the company is poised to be successful in the future, making it appealing to both current and potential stockholders.",

            "content": "CONA Services LLC is an IT services company owned and governed by the 11 largest Coca-Cola bottlers in North America. CONA is a strategic partner that provides its bottlers with a common set of processes, data standards, and technology platforms. CONA, an abbreviation for Coke One North America (CONA), solutions have been rolled out to more than 500 locations in the US and Canada, representing 80,000 employees and more than $21 billion in annual revenue.\n\nCONA hosts the bottlers\u2019 solutions in a Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Its main applications include SAP for backend transactions, Blue Yonder for supply chain management, and Salesforce for sales. Snowflake is their BI environment.\n\nAn Interesting History\n\nThe history of both CONA and the bottlers they support is interesting. In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company unveiled its \u201c2020 Vision and Roadmap for Winning Together.\u201d This vision encompassed both Coca-Cola and their bottlers. Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO at the time said that by \u201cworking hand-in-hand\u201d with their bottling partners they would build a \u201cunified and aligned system equipped for long-term sustainable growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Baron Jordan, the Chief Product Officer for Supply Chain at CONA, the map of bottlers\u2019 territories was, in places, disjointed and inefficient. In 2010, Coca-Cola acquired the North American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in North America. Other acquisitions and new bottler agreements followed. The result was a much more streamlined regional bottling structure\u2014with the large majority of the North American Coca-Cola business being supported by large and sophisticated regional bottling companies.\n\nIn terms of production and supply chain coverage, these 11 bottling companies work together. While they are separate and independently-owned organizations, they agreed with The Coca-Cola Company to come on to a common data platform with common data standards. CONA Services was created in 2016 to support this vision.\n\nCONA\u2019s IT environment is cost-efficient and has very high service levels. It is also best in class in terms of preventing unplanned downtime.\n\nThe Value of a Common Platform\n\nMore importantly, by having the largest 11 bottlers on a common platform, the bottlers can work together to meet customer demand efficiently. The more than 40 production centers owned by the CONA bottlers work cooperatively as a common production system to drive supply chain efficiencies.\n\nThe National Product Supply Group, governed by members from most US producing bottlers, develops the collaborative supply chain plan based on defined governance processes. The demand, supply, transportation, and warehousing plans are created on the Blue Yonder platform. Eventually, these plans are executed. The production plan is fed into the MRP for production execution. Daily transportation and warehouse plans are developed that go down to the level of what will be picked, packed, and shipped.\n\nMr. Jordan describes the Blue Yonder user interface as being very user-friendly. \u201cWe have dashboards on top of dashboards.\u201d There are green, yellow, and red icons that help users see if things are proceeding on schedule. \u201cWe have many types of rules, tolerances and variances that are electronically detected as this data flows through the system.\u201d The system can detect a deviation from a forecast, for example, and yet understand if the deviation is in an allowable range and that an alert does not have to be generated.\n\nHowever, unexpected events do happen. For example, a large customer may place a large, unforeseen order that becomes visible at 9:00 a.m. Business operations may decide that its parameters must be changed to support the order. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be there with them partnering on how to do that, how to change the data, change the process, and move things forward.\u201d So, while CONA is not responsible for creating the plans, Mr. Jordan points out that \u201cwe\u2019re deeply involved in daily operations.\u201d\n\nA Foundation for AI\n\nOne of the things that Mr. Jordan is excited about is artificial intelligence. Because they have the foundation in place \u2013 all their core applications are up to date on the newest releases and share common data, the bottlers are in a place where they can leverage \u201call of this data that we\u2019ve amassed.\u201d We can take things to the \u201cnext level in terms of interoperability and connected planning.\u201d AI will allow the extended enterprise to further connect logistics and production execution, create more visibility, and thus be \u201cmore nimble and more proactive in terms of how we run the entire enterprise.\u201d\n\nOne CONA bottler is also piloting Blue Yonder\u2019s cognitive demand planning capabilities. This solution goes beyond a statistical baseline forecast to an improved forecast model capable based on including other forms of data and using other algorithms. Like many, CONA and its bottlers are looking for the right use cases. Should it be used to forecast a group of materials? Specific products? An important customer\u2019s demand? Or for promotions? They have an internal data science team working with their beta bottler on this.\n\nCONA is believes in moving away from a \u201cblack-box solution\u201d, meaning a system or device whose internal operations or algorithms are not readily visible or understandable to those using or interacting with it. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work for our business,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. Operations need to understand and know what\u2019s going on, and they also want to merge their models with Blue Yonder\u2019s baseline model. Mr. Jordan notes that Blue Yonder now supports a mix-and-match AI strategy.\n\nMr. Jordan concluded by saying, \u201cthe speed with which Blue Yonder is developing this cognitive platform is remarkable. That said, we are going to perform our due diligence, and construct value propositions and business cases. But we\u2019re engaged in that. There\u2019s a lot to evaluate.\u201d",

They provide passive income under almost any conditions, which strengthens your portfolio and protects your money in changing economies.\n\nYounger investors may want to focus more on growth, and retirees tend to switch to more dividend stocks. Whichever category you're in, if you're looking for excellent dividend stocks, consider Realty Income (O -0.91%), Home Depot (HD -4.19%), and Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%).\n\n1. Realty Income: All the right features plus monthly payments\n\nRealty Income is a top dividend stock that has an excellent business, high yield, and growing dividend, and it also has the added perk of cutting a monthly check.\n\nIt's a real estate investment trust (REIT), a business structure for companies that own and lease out rental properties. Realty Income is one of the largest REITs in the world, with more than 15,000 properties that it leases mostly to retailers. Its top 20 tenants include brands like Walmart and CVS, chains that do well in most circumstances and can keep up their leases. Although it touts that as an obvious advantage, it has also expanded to other categories through recent acquisitions and contracts.\n\nIt made a recent deal with Wynn Resorts, and 14% of its properties are in the industrials category. However, retail accounts for nearly 80% of the total, with grocery and convenience stores accounting for almost 20%. In other words, it has a stable and growing business, which is important in a dividend stock.\n\nAnother reason to be confident about Realty Income's ability to pay and grow its dividend is its extensive track record. It has paid a dividend for 655 months consecutively, and raised it 128 times since going public in 1994.\n\nThe dividend yields 5.9% at the current price, or more than 4 times the S&P 500 average. It's an excellent dividend pick for just about any investor.\n\n2. Home Depot: The industry leader\n\nHome Depot is the largest home improvement chain in the world. It has 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and it's opening new ones, although at a slow pace. People always need home improvement products, providing organic growth opportunities for Home Depot all the time.\n\nThe company has been challenged by the pressured housing market, but when people aren't moving they also have home improvement needs, since they might need more home maintenance in their current digs. Sales increased 6.6% year over year in the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 27), but comps were down 1.3%. Operating margin and net income were both down from last year but beat expectations.\n\nHome Depot is constantly upgrading its platform and converting to a heftier omnichannel model to meet today's consumer needs. It recently unveiled a larger regional distribution network with 19 fulfillment centers across the country, and it can reach 90% of its customers with same- or next-day delivery. The company launched a marketing campaign to highlight its reach and is already seeing results in higher conversions and incremental sales.\n\nThe underlying strength of this business supports its excellent dividend. It yields 2.2% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average, and it has increased more than 280% over the past 10 years.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: The Dividend King\n\nCoca-Cola is the classic great dividend stock. It's a Dividend King, and the company has raised its dividend annually for the past 62 years, under all kinds of circumstances. It's totally committed to the dividend, and its payout ratio reached more than 100% early in the pandemic when sales plunged.\n\nIt's the largest all-beverage company in the world, and it reaches customers in 200 countries all over the world. It has pricing power in its loved brands, which is why Coca-Cola is so reliable for strong performance. It's the top worldwide brand in the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink category, and it has developed all kinds of packaging and pricing changes to entice its fans even in the inflationary climate. Revenue dropped 1% in the 2023 third quarter, but organic revenue was up 9%.\n\nCoca-Cola has opportunities in acquiring new brands and capturing greater market share, and it has organic growth potential in its diverse beverage categories that include sparkling drinks, dairy, juice, coffee, and more.\n\nThe dividend yields 3.1% at the current price, and it's an excellent choice for a reliable, high-yielding stock.",

            "content": "Coke Freestyle machines are renowned for their ability to deliver over 100 different flavors of Coca-Cola and other Coke products, from routine options like Cherry Coke to exotic combinations like Vanilla Seagram's Lemon-Lime Seltzer. But this remarkable versatility can come with a downside: the difficult-to-identify Coke Freestyle taste.\n\nThe reason that drinks from a Coke Freestyle machine can sometimes taste a little off is primarily because of the nozzle that dispenses the drink -- as well as every other drink that comes out of the machine. With this mechanism, traces of the previous customer's Cherry Diet Coke could wind up in your Orange Vanilla Coke Zero.\n\nCoke Freestyle machines have gone through several iterations since their 2009 debut, but they all have this same unusual design issue. One can mitigate this freestyle backwash effect by flushing the nozzle with plain water for a few seconds before making a drink selection. While it will help with that issue, drinks from a Coke Freestyle machine taste a little different for another reason too.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: What You Need To Know Before You Drink Your Next Diet Coke\n\nCoke Freestyle's Flavor Storage Also Affects Taste\n\nCountertop model of a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, with a red Coke glass-shaped facade - Melissamn/Shutterstock\n\nA typical soda (or pop) fountain uses bag-in-box soda syrups and combines them in the fountain with carbonated water to make the soda. A Coke Freestyle machine, however, uses what Coca-Cola calls ingredient cartridges to load the flavors into the machine, almost like putting dozens of ink cartridges into a giant printer. Unlike bag-in-box syrups, the soda flavors in a Coke Freestyle machine are kept separate from their respective sweeteners, which are a more traditional bag-in-box design within the machine. The soda flavoring, sweetener, and carbonated water are all combined in the machine to produce the requested drink.\n\nWithout the ingredient cartridges to reduce space requirements, a Coke Freestyle machine would be unfeasibly large and complicated, if it could even be built. But separating the flavor and sweetener and blending them on-order will taste slightly different from other Coke preparations, and no amount of nozzle flushing will change that. And as with all soda fountains, cleanliness is an underrated X factor.\n\nHungry for more?

As part of the Maidaan Saaf campaign, the company has created and distributed 21,500 recycled PET jackets for sanitation workers, boatmen, and waste management volunteers.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Sunday Guardian Rajesh Ayapilla, Senior Director, Sustainability & CSR, Coca-Cola INSWA highlighted the role of Maidaan Saaf campaign on positive environmental impact.\n\nRajesh Ayapilla\n\nQ: What inspired Coca-Cola to take the lead in sustainability initiatives at Maha Kumbh 2025, and how does it align with the company\u2019s broader environmental goals?\n\nA: At Coca-Cola India, we are deeply committed to creating a positive environmental impact. Our focus is on increasing the use of recycled materials in primary packaging, supporting packaging collection infrastructure, and advocating for policies that enable a more sustainable future. To achieve these goals, we collaborate with both local and global partners. Maha Kumbh 2025 presented an incredible opportunity to work alongside PHD Rural Development Foundation (PHDRDF) and Prayagraj Mela Authority (PMA) to advance these efforts at one of the world\u2019s largest cultural gatherings.\n\nIn 2023, we first launched the Maidaan Saaf campaign, inspired by the opportunity to promote effective waste management at large-scale gatherings across the country. Events like the Maha Kumbh draw millions of people, making it a perfect platform to demonstrate how collective action can lead to significant change. Through this campaign, we are trying to showcase innovative recycling practices and encourage people to take small yet impactful steps toward reducing waste.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the \u2018Maidaan Saaf\u2019 campaign? What is its primary objective, and how has it been received so far?\n\nA: The Maidaan Saaf campaign, which began in 2023 during the ICC World Cup, was designed to promote innovative waste management and recycling practices at large-scale events. During the World Cup, we introduced national flags and ICC Unity flags made from recycled PET bottles, installed Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs), and created recycled jackets for our Safai Saathis (cleanliness partners). Building on the success of this campaign, we\u2019ve since activated Maidaan Saaf at several cultural events over the past two years. At the Maha Kumbh, the campaign focuses providing recycled products like life jackets and waste worker jackets made of recycled plastics, and changing rooms for women made from recycled multi-layer plastics. It also engages waste pickers, sanitation workers, and volunteers to enhance waste segregation and recycling efforts while establishing dedicated waste collection zones to reduce waste and send collected plastic waste back on the recycling ecosystem.\n\nQ. The distribution of 21,500 recycled PET jackets is a commendable initiative. What message does Coca-Cola want to convey through this gesture?\n\nA: Through the distribution of 21,500 recycled PET jackets, Coca-Cola aims to highlight the tangible impact of recycling and showcase how waste can be transformed into valuable resources. This initiative emphasises that sustainability is not just about reducing waste but also about creating circular economies where materials are reused innovatively. By equipping individuals such as volunteers, sanitation workers, and other stakeholders with these jackets, we want to highlight that sustainability is achievable when communities work together to close the loop on waste.\n\nQ: Can you share more details about the reverse vending machines and the changing rooms for women? How do these projects contribute to sustainability at the Kumbh?\n\nA: The reverse vending machines (RVMs) at the Maha Kumbh are designed to promote responsible disposal of PET bottles. Managed in collaboration with NGO partner, ReKart, these machines provide a convenient way for pilgrims to dispose of plastic waste, ensuring it is collected and sent for recycling. Similarly, the women\u2019s changing rooms, created from recycled multi-layer plastic, in partnership with Econscious, offer a safe and comfortable space for women pilgrims to change. We also have educational messages on the changing rooms created by top illustrators in India to raising public awareness about the importance of waste segregation and recycling.\n\nQ. How has Coca-Cola collaborated with local authorities, NGOs, or other stakeholders to ensure the success of these initiatives? Also with local communities, such as sanitation workers and boatmen, to make these initiatives meaningful and impactful? Mention NGO partners\n\nA: The Coca-Cola India and its foundation, Anandana, has collaborated with the PHD Rural Development Foundation (PHDRDF) and Prayagraj Mela Authority (PMA) to spearhead sustainability initiatives at Maha Kumbh 2025. We have also collaborated with several organisations to ensure the success of its sustainability initiatives on the ground such as with Go Rewise to recycle PET bottles into waste worker jackets, safety jackets and volunteer jackets, while Econscious is transforming hard plastics into women\u2019s changing rooms. ReKart is the on-ground waste management partner, is actively collecting waste from hydration carts and Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs), ensuring efficient waste segregation and recycling.\n\nQ. Beyond Maha Kumbh 2025, what are Coca-Cola\u2019s plans for driving sustainability and creating long-term environmental impact in India?\n\nA: Behavioral change takes time, but campaigns like Maidaan Saaf play a pivotal role in planting the seeds for a more sustainable future. By engaging directly with individuals\u2014whether it\u2019s through educating pilgrims, collaborating with sanitation workers, or demonstrating the impact of recycling\u2014we\u2019re trying to show that waste isn\u2019t just discarded material but a resource with immense potential. We believe that by integrating such initiatives into large-scale events, we are helping not only create immediate impact but also try and inspire lasting habits that communities and organizations can adopt beyond the event itself.",

            "content": "Unveiling the Top Dividend Stocks\n\nWarren Buffett is well-known for favoring large-cap stocks to amplify Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio, ensuring that his investments yield maximum impact. Among his notable holdings, six are prominent members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But which of these giants stands out for income seekers?\n\nThe longest-held positions in Buffett\u2019s portfolio include Coca-Cola, which he acquired in 1988, and American Express, bought in 1991. These companies are integral to his investment strategy, as Buffett considers them \u201cforever stocks.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he identified Apple as a superior business compared to both Coca-Cola and American Express, although it wasn\u2019t highlighted in his recent communique to shareholders. Apple is Berkshire\u2019s largest holding, followed closely by American Express.\n\nOver the past year, American Express has outperformed all other Dow stocks owned by Buffett, seeing a remarkable price increase. Conversely, Amazon\u2019s stock has also soared significantly. However, none of Buffett\u2019s considered favorites, apart from Coca-Cola, delivered notable earnings growth.\n\nFor income-oriented investors, the spotlight falls on Chevron and Coca-Cola. Chevron offers a robust forward dividend yield of 4.05% and boasts a remarkable history of 37 consecutive annual dividend increases. Coca-Cola\u2019s yield is slightly lower at 3.1%, but with an impressive 62 years of dividend hikes, it remains a strong contender. Given its superior yield, Chevron emerges as the top pick for those seeking reliable income.\n\nThe Broader Landscape of Dividend Investing\n\nThe intrigue surrounding top dividend stocks, particularly those in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio, resonates far beyond individual financial strategies; it reflects broader societal trends, cultural values, and economic shifts. As an aging population increasingly seeks stable income sources for retirement, dividend stocks have grown in popularity, shaping investment philosophies.\n\nIncome stability has become a focal point in today\u2019s volatile markets, particularly as inflation continues to challenge purchasing power. This demand amplifies the significance of companies like Coca-Cola and Chevron, which not only promise regular payouts but also signify corporate resilience amid market fluctuations. Their longstanding histories of dividend increases bolster investor confidence, fostering a culture where reliability and tradition play pivotal roles in investment decisions.\n\nOn a global scale, the burgeoning interest in dividend-paying stocks affects capital allocation, directing funds towards established firms while potentially stifling innovation in riskier startups. This trend may perpetuate a cycle where large corporations continue to thrive, leaving nascent industries scrambling for investment.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is another critical consideration. Companies with sustainable practices, like Chevron, are now under pressure to balance profit with ecological accountability, prompting a shift in how dividends are perceived. Future trends may see investors increasingly favoring firms that align with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, thus reshaping the landscape of income-generating investments.\n\nIn the long term, as the world grapples with dynamic economic realities, the principles of dividend investing are likely to evolve, reflecting societal needs for both financial stability and sustainable development. This evolution will inevitably influence how future generations interact with the stock market, ensuring that dividend stocks remain an integral part of the global economic tapestry.\n\nMaximize Your Returns: Top Dividend Stocks to Consider Now\n\nUnveiling Dividend Aristocrats: Insights and Analysis\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks can provide both income and growth, making them a popular choice for income-seeking investors. In this article, we delve deeper into the top dividend stocks that stand out not only for their yields but also for their historical performance, sustainability, and potential for future growth.\n\nKey Features of Top Dividend Stocks\n\n1. Consistent Dividend Payments: The hallmark of reliable dividend stocks is their history of consistent dividend payments. Companies like Coca-Cola and Chevron exemplify this criterion, with lengthy records of annual dividend increases, making them trusted by investors looking for stable income.\n\n2. Strong Financial Health: Companies that can sustain and grow their dividends generally exhibit strong financial performance, including high earnings per share (EPS) and robust cash flow. This financial health allows companies to weather economic downturns and maintain dividend payouts.\n\n3. Sector Appeal: Diversification across various sectors can minimize risks. Sectors like consumer staples (Coca-Cola) and energy (Chevron) tend to be more resilient during economic fluctuations, providing a safety net for dividend investors.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Dividend Stocks\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Regular Income: Dividend stocks provide a reliable stream of income, particularly attractive for retirees or conservative investors.\n\n\u2013 Potential for Growth: Many dividend-paying companies are also growth-oriented, offering the potential for capital appreciation.\n\n\u2013 Tax Advantages: In some jurisdictions, qualified dividends may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Interest Rate Sensitivity: Dividend stocks can be affected by rising interest rates, as investors may seek alternative income sources.\n\n\u2013 Market Volatility: Although they are generally less volatile, dividend stocks can still experience price fluctuations.\n\n\u2013 Limited Growth Potential: Companies focused on paying dividends may allocate less capital for growth projects, potentially limiting future gains.\n\nTrend Analysis and Market Insights\n\nAs of 2023, the trend shows a significant interest in enhancing dividend yield among investors, driven by rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Investors are gravitating towards companies that not only provide dividends but also show resilience during downturns.\n\nEmerging Trends:\n\n\u2013 The rise of \u2018Dividend Aristocrats\u2019, companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years, falls in line with the safety-seeking behavior of investors.\n\n\u2013 A growing focus on sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors is influencing investment decisions, with companies that prioritize sustainable practices becoming more attractive.\n\nNotable Dividend Stocks to Watch\n\n1. Chevron (CVX): With a forward dividend yield of 4.05% and a remarkable history of 37 consecutive annual dividend increases, Chevron remains a compelling option for dividend investors looking for income stability and growth in the energy sector.\n\n2. Coca-Cola (KO): Known for its impressive 62-year streak of dividend hikes, Coca-Cola offers a lower yield at 3.1% but is often seen as a staple in dividend investment portfolios, particularly due to its strong brand and global reach.\n\n3. Apple (AAPL): Although traditionally not a high-dividend payer, Apple\u2019s status as the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway highlights its potential for growth, which can complement a dividend-focused strategy for investors looking for total return.\n\nPricing and Predictions\n\nWhen considering investments in dividend stocks, it\u2019s essential to evaluate not just the yields but also the companies\u2019 growth metrics and market forecasts. Analysts predict that companies with sustainable practices and solid growth trajectories will emerge as leaders in the coming years.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks like Chevron and Coca-Cola can be a prudent strategy for those looking to balance income with growth potential. By understanding the pros and cons, trends, and key features of these stocks, investors can make well-informed decisions that align with their financial goals.\n\nFor more information and insights into the world of investing, check out Finance Insights.",

            "content": "Abu Dhabi, UAE \u2013 In a landmark step towards advancing sustainability, today at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company together with Emerge \u2013 a joint venture between UAE\u2019s Masdar and France\u2019s EDF Group \u2013 inaugurated a 1.8 megawatt solar power plant at its production facility in Al Ain.\n\nThe project marks a significant milestone in Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company\u2019s commitment to environmental stewardship and renewable energy adoption, aligning with the UAE\u2019s Green Agenda 2030 and national sustainability ambitions.\n\nThe newly activated solar power plant is designed to deliver clean and renewable energy to the facility, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources and significantly lowering overall carbon emissions. Utilizing cutting-edge technology such as bifacial panels, advanced inverters, and smart monitoring systems, the plant represents the future of energy solutions in the region.\n\nThe plant has the capacity to avoid approximately 1,566 metric tons of CO\u2082 emissions annually \u2013 equivalent to meeting the electricity needs of more than 300 homes for an entire year. Additionally, the solar power plant will help reduce the consumption of oil by more than 3,600 barrels per year, underscoring its contribution to environmental conservation.\n\nHis Excellency Osama Amir Fadhel, Assistant Undersecretary for the Industrial Accelerators Sector at the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology, highlighted that sustainability serves as a fundamental pillar of the National Strategy for Industry and Advanced Technology, Operation 300 Billion. The strategy aims to strengthen the industrial sector while supporting climate neutrality by encouraging sustainable practices and industrial transformation through the adoption of advanced technologies, enablers, and incentives. These efforts are reflected under the \"Make it in the Emirates\" initiative, a strategic platform that drives local manufacturing and supports businesses in adopting innovative technologies that promote investment in sustainability.\n\nHis Excellency underscored that \"Make it in the Emirates\" is both an initiative and an annual event, serving as a key platform to showcase the UAE's global competitive advantages to industrial investors on an international level. By attracting manufacturers and investors to the UAE, the initiative boosts local production capabilities, enhances supply chain resilience, and promotes self-sufficiency, particularly in critical strategic sectors such as food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nHis Excellency also emphasized the strategic partnership between Coca-Cola Al-Ahlia Beverages and Emerge to launch a 1.8 MW photovoltaic solar power plant. This project marks a significant milestone in incorporating renewable energy into manufacturing, aligning with the industrial decarbonization roadmap unveiled by the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology during COP28.\n\nFinally, His Excellency invited investors and manufacturers to participate in the fourth edition of the \"Make it in the Emirates\" Forum, which will be held at ADNEC in Abu Dhabi from May 19 to 22, 2025. This edition is expected to be the largest and most comprehensive yet, featuring over 20,000 participants, 5,000 \"Made in UAE\" products on display, and, for the first time, a dedicated pavilion showcasing Emirati handicrafts\n\n\u201cWe are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainable practices across our operations,\u201d said Banu Karakullukcu, CEO of Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company. \u201cThe installation of solar panels at our Al Ain plant is a testament to our shift towards renewable energy. Partnering with Emerge allows us to bring this vision to life and support the UAE\u2019s Green Agenda. This project sets a strong example, and we are eager to implement similar initiatives at our other plants in the region.\u201d\n\nWith the completion of phase one, the solar power project meets 18% of Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company production plant\u2019s total energy needs with solar power. This year, phase two will add an additional 5%, bringing the total solar contribution to 23%. As part of the partnership with Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company, Emerge will operate and maintain the solar energy project for the next 25 years.\n\n\u201cAt Emerge, we are committed to supporting organizations to reduce their environmental impact and become more sustainable on the road to realizing the UAE\u2019s Net Zero by 2050 Strategy. This solar plant is a great example of how innovative clean energy solutions can drive both environmental and business outcomes \u2013 in this case, helping Coca Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company meet their sustainability goals while reducing electricity costs,\u201d stated Michel Ali Saab, General Manager of Emerge.\n\nRenewable energy solutions like the solar power project demonstrate how the UAE is empowering organizations to reduce emissions and align industrial growth with environmental preservation.\n\nThrough collaborations like this, Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company aims to inspire broader action, paving the way for a greener, more sustainable future for the UAE.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nThe Coca Cola Company:\n\nNida Noor/ Clara Armanious, The_Coca-Cola_Company@talesandheads.com\n\nEmerge:\n\nMasdar press@masdar.ae\n\nEDF alexandra.taleva@edf.com\n\nAbout Coca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages\n\nCoca-Cola Al Ahlia Beverages Company (CCABC) are the bottlers for The Coca-Cola Company in the UAE.

            "content": "In 2022, Coca-Cola pledged to make 25% of its packaging reusable by 2030, but it now appears to have quietly removed the promise from its website.\n\nAs Grist reported, the company set a target of selling a quarter of its drinks in returnable or refillable glass or plastic bottles by the end of the decade. Industry leaders touted this as a revolutionary method of handling the plastic pollution crisis, and the reuse program has already had a significant impact. As of 2023, reusable plastic and glass bottles accounted for over 50% of Coke's drink sales in 20 markets.\n\nCoca-Cola also pledged in 2020 to reduce its use of virgin plastics, vowing to eliminate 3.3 million tons of the material \"derived from nonrenewable sources\" from its supply chain by 2025, per Grist.\n\nHowever, as of November, the company had scrapped both sustainability objectives, deleting the pledges from its website. In a blog post in December, Coca-Cola announced updated environmental goals, which Grist noted are regressive compared to its previous plans.\n\nCoke said it now hopes to make 35% to 40% of its primary packaging (plastic, glass, and aluminum) from recycled material by 2035, rather than 50% by 2030.\n\nFurthermore, instead of making all its packaging recyclable by 2025 and recycling or collecting one bottle or can for each one sold, its new goal is a 70-75% collection rate of the equivalent number of bottles and cans that enter the market annually by 2035.\n\nCoca-Cola didn't disclose why it abandoned its reuse goals, but Grist explained that it could be related to anti-greenwashing laws approved by the European Union in 2024. Since Coke was already falling short on its virgin plastic reduction and reusable packaging goals, the company may be trying to avoid lawsuits or public criticism.\n\nCoke isn't the only company falling behind on its packaging goals \u2014 hundreds of major companies are failing to meet their voluntary plastics commitments, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation cited by Grist. Sam Pearse, plastics campaign director for the nonprofit Story of Stuff Project, worries this is part of a larger trend of corporations shirking their environmental responsibilities.\n\n\"Once you start seeing that cycle a number of times, it's hard to not be skeptical about the intention,\" Pearse told Grist.\n\nAccording to a 2024 study, Coca-Cola is the largest global producer of branded plastic pollution, so it should be held accountable for addressing its plastic waste. Millions of animals die each year from choking on or being entangled in plastic, and chemicals from the materials leach into waterways and soil.\n\nReducing the production of single-use plastic is one of the best ways to protect the planet and lower pollution. According to research shared by Grist, replacing 10% of single-use plastics with reusable alternatives could slash the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans in half.\n\n\"That Coca-Cola has abandoned its refillable commitment is alarming, regrettable, and regressive,\" Frances Fairhead-Stanova, a shareholder advocate for the eco-friendly mutual fund Green Century Capital Management, told Grist.\n\n\"We remain committed to building long-term business resilience and earning our social license to operate through our evolved voluntary environmental goals,\" Bea Perez, Coca\u2011Cola executive vice president and global chief communications, sustainability, and strategic partnerships officer, said in a statement.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Scientific research over time has validated these concerns, yet many Brits still enjoy a can of Coke or Fanta with their meals or as a casual beverage. Despite the warnings, the UK remains a nation of Coca-Cola enthusiasts, a trend that began when it first hit our shores in August 1900. One person who took that advice to heart is Daily Star reporter Adam Cailler who had never had a sip of fizzy drink until recently. Having confessed to a workmate that he'd never sampled Coca-Cola, Adam found himself persuaded to try it for professional reasons.\n\nJust vile.\n\nIn the spirit of journalistic sacrifice, I visited my local Sainsbury's chosen out of personal preference and purchased two small cans of Coca Cola and Diet Coke, ready to undertake this daunting task...for work. Firstly, the aroma upon cracking open the standard Coke can, I was immediately struck by an odd scent. It took me some time to identify it, and once I did, everything fell into place... but more on that later. Upon taking my initial sip, I was instantly repulsed, suspecting that perhaps the drink was expired or from a faulty batch. However, after consulting my wife, it appears that Coca-Cola does indeed typically taste of overly sweet burnt sugar. It evoked memories of a distasteful science experiment that should have been discarded at inception.\n\nCAPTION: 'I tried Coca-Cola for the first time ever at 35 - Brits need their tastebuds testing'PICTURED: Adam Cailler\n\nIn my view, this beverage tasted of something that really shouldn't be near anyone's mouth and why would you want to drink something that TikTokkers love putting down toilets because it's a strong cleaning product?! The taste matched the smell, as it was at this point that I realised that it was indeed the smell of burned sugar that I was not enjoying. Moving onto the Diet Coke, which I was informed \"was not as bad\". Well, if \"not as bad\" was a redeeming quality of a product, then I'm sorry Coke lovers - seek help.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The company\u2019s high-end portfolio includes Rampur Indian Single Malt and Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin, among others, Managing Director Abhishek Khaitan said.\n\nThe company expects an 8-9 percent increase in volume and a 12-15 percent rise in value growth. \u201cThis year has been a good year for us, and hopefully next year should be much better,\u201d Khaitan said. For the next fiscal year, he anticipates the Prestige and Above (PNA) category to grow by over 15 percent, contributing to overall double-digit growth.\n\nRadico Khaitan\u2019s luxury brands include Rampur Indian Single Malt, Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin, Sangam World Malt, and Spirit of Victory 1999 Pure Malt. \u201cFor the first time in Q3 (December quarter), we achieved a turnover of Rs 100 crore (from premium), and for the nine months of FY24, we have achieved Rs 250 crore. We are very confident that for FY26, Radico Khaitan should achieve Rs 500 crore of turnover, just for the luxury segment,\u201d Khaitan stated.\n\nTo expand in the premium alcobev segment, the company plans to introduce two new brands in the first half of the next fiscal year. \u201cSo in the first half, we are planning to come out with two more brands in the luxury space. So we have been working for the last couple of years on that, and hopefully in the first half, we will see their entry into the Indian markets,\u201d he said.\n\nRadico Khaitan, which also owns other premium PNA brands like Royal Ranthambore, Dazzle Vodka, and Morpheus Blue, is experiencing high double-digit growth and expects this momentum to continue.\n\nThe company is also benefiting from rising per capita income and a young demographic, with India adding 20 million people to the legal drinking age bracket annually.\n\nAddressing the government\u2019s decision to reduce import duties on bourbon whiskey to 50 percent, Khaitan said it would have minimal impact on the local market. \u201cThat would not have so much pressure on the local companies,\u201d he said. However, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA), he suggested a gradual reduction of the current 150 percent duty on Scotch whisky to allow Indian brands to strengthen their presence in the premium segment.\n\n\u201cOur single malts are now outperforming the foreign single malts also, it is priced higher,\u201d Khaitan said, adding that duty cuts on bulk whisky imports from Scotland would help reduce costs for Indian liquor companies, including Radico Khaitan.\n\nThe company is also maintaining a strong presence in the Defense Ministry\u2019s Canteen Stores Department (CSD), where it is a leading supplier of branded IMFL to the armed forces. \u201cWe are the market leaders there (at CSD). We would be having a close to 26 to 27 percent, and we feel the demand for Indian products is very high. People are proud to consume the Indian brand,\u201d he said.\n\nRadico Khaitan competes in the premium and single malt segments with brands like Piccadilly Distilleries, Amrut, and Paul John.\n\nIn FY24, the company reported gross revenue of Rs 15,483.9 crore, selling 45.6 million cases, with the PNA category accounting for 11.26 million cases. The Prestige and Above segment grew 20.3 percent year-on-year in volume terms. \u201cIn Radico, we are very clear that our focus is on the PNA category, however, we are also present in the mass category, where our contributions are good. We achieved a 15 percent volume growth in Q3,\u201d Khaitan said.\n\nFor the December quarter, the company reported a 27 percent increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 95.48 crore and an 8 percent rise in revenue from operations to Rs 4,440.90 crore. The Prestige and Above brands saw a 17.7 percent increase in volume, reaching 3.67 million cases and accounting for 50.9 percent of IMFL volumes.\n\nThe company expects growth in the IMFL segment due to new liquor retail policies in states like Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, which have led to an increase in retail outlets.\n\nRegarding capital expenditure, Khaitan said the company has already invested Rs 750 crore to establish a greenfield distillery in Sitapur and is expanding capacity at its Rampur distillery. \u201cSo we are done with our Capex\u2026 there will be normal maintenance capex going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nRadico Khaitan, formerly Rampur Distillery Company, also operates a distillery in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, and has a total owned capacity of 320 million liters.",

            "content": "I tried Coca-Cola for the first time at 35 and I'm sorry to say it's disgusting\n\nChildren are generally warned against fizzy drinks due to their detrimental effects on dental health and overall poor nutritional value.\n\nOver time, science has validated these claims, yet many Brits still enjoy cracking open a can of Coke or Fanta with their meals or whenever they fancy a drink. Despite the warnings, the UK remains a nation of Coca-Cola enthusiasts, a trend that began when the beverage first hit our shores in August 1900, and is now ubiquitous in shops and restaurants worldwide.\n\nDaily Star reporter Adam Cailler took that advice to heart, and aged 35, had spent his life entire life avoiding fizzy drinks - until 2025. Read on for his rather disappointing experience.\n\nAfter confessing to a workmate that I'd never sampled Coca-Cola, I found myself persuaded to give it a try for professional reasons.\n\nSo, in the spirit of journalistic sacrifice for Daily Star readers, I made a trip to my local Sainsbury's chosen out of pure snobbery and purchased two small cans of Coca Cola and Diet Coke, ready to undertake this daunting task...for work.\n\nImage: Adam Cailler) Adam Cailler)\n\nFirstly, the aroma as soon as I popped open the standard Coke can, I was greeted by an odd smell. It took me some time to identify it, and once I did, everything fell into place... but more on that later.\n\nUpon taking my first sip, I was immediately repulsed, suspecting that the drink might be expired or from a faulty batch. However, after consulting my wife, I learned that Coca-Cola typically tastes like overly sweet burnt sugar.\n\nIt brought to mind a disastrous science experiment that should have been discarded at inception.\n\nIn my opinion, this drink tasted of something that really shouldn't be near anyone's mouth and why would you want to drink something that TikTokkers love putting down toilets because it's a strong cleaning product?\n\nThe taste matched the smell, as it was at this point that I realised that it was indeed the smell of burned sugar that I was not enjoying.\n\nImage: Adam Cailler) Adam Cailler)\n\nOnto the Diet Coke, which I was told \"was not as bad\". Well, if \"not as bad\" was a redeeming quality of a product, then I'm sorry Coke lovers...seek help.\n\nYes, this wasn't as vile as standard Coke, and you could definitely taste more floral notes, but again, burned sugar and weird brown liquids are not my idea of a good time.\n\nSo to sum up, Britain, you all need to get your taste buds checked but one of the most popular drinks on supermarket shelves is nothing but a mixture of nasty chemicals that combine to taste like the tears of disappointed children with a hint of Satan's secret juice mixed in.\n\nBut hey, we're also a nation obsessed with Prime drinks, so... shrug.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola has been a classic soft drink for more than a century. The first glass of the soda was poured on May 8, 1886, in Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta. That means Coca-Cola is more than 130 years old and is still going strong. Since its first pour, there have been numerous spin-offs of the soft drink, including Diet Coke, which debuted in 1982.\n\nDiet Coke, which was Coca-Cola's first sugar-free soda, has now been around for more than 40 years. It was introduced when there was a desire for more sugar-free options. However, a few decades later, a stigma grew around the word \"diet,\" which made a lot of food and beverage companies re-think their branding (you'll probably notice a lot of labels now say \"zero sugar\" instead of \"diet\" in hopes of casting a wider net to consumers). That's why Coca-Cola Zero was introduced in 2006 and then replaced by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 2016.\n\nSo, what actually is the difference between Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar? Both options are sugar-free and contain zero calories. The biggest difference is the taste. The Coca-Cola Company says Diet Coke has a lighter taste, thanks to a different blend of flavors, whereas Coca-Cola Zero Sugar both looks and tastes more like the original Coca-Cola recipe. Diet Coke uses more aspartame, which tastes a bit lighter. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar uses aspartame too, but combines it with acesulfame potassium, creating a more robust flavor that's closer to actual sugar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: We Tried And Ranked 12 Canned Corn Brands So You Don't Have To\n\nDiet Coke Is A Better Pick-Me-Up Than Coke Zero\n\nA glass of bubbling soda with ice - Antorti/Getty Images\n\nThere is truly nothing better than a glass of fresh, crisp, bubbly soda, and if you can enjoy it without all the extra sugar that's definitely a bonus. But, what about the energy boost that sugary Coca-Cola gives you? Well, if you're looking for a pick-me-up, Diet Coke may be your best option: It contains more caffeine than Coke Zero Sugar.\n\nAnd, while there are opposing loyalties when it comes to Coca-Cola versus Diet Coke, I'll just lay out my bias right now: I'm Team Diet Coke, and I know I'm not alone in my undying love for the soda. No matter what type of soda you like, there are also a ton of competing opinions on the best way to serve the beverage. Most regular soda drinkers have a ranking that goes something like this: can, glass bottle, plastic bottle, and fountain. Personally, I believe fountain beverages always taste the freshest.\n\nAnd, while there's a reason behind why some fast food restaurants offer Pepsi and others offer Coca-Cola, McDonald's is widely held to be the best purveyor of soft drinks. There's actually a specific reason for this (hint: water filtration and the temperature of the beverage both contribute).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, join The Takeout's newsletter.

            "content": "The recent change in Coca-Cola's recycling targets delays the creation of an additional global demand of at least 400,000 mt/year of recycled PET resin, according to an analysis by S&P Global Commodity Insights. In Brazil, recyclers say there is already an impact on demand, although there is no consensus.\n\nCoca-Cola, one of the world's main consumers of polyethylene terephthalate, announced new targets for 2035 that push back the ambitious mandates previously set for 2025 and 2030. The company now aims to use 35% to 40% recycled material in primary packaging (plastic, glass, and aluminum), including increasing the use of recycled plastic to 30% to 35% globally, according to a company statement on Dec. 2. Previously, the goal was to achieve at least 50% recycled content in packaging by 2030.\n\nOn Jan. 15, a recycler based in Brazil stated that Coca-Cola's announcement is pulling local demand down. \"It's the biggest player in the market. This change has strongly impacted me.\"\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on the impact. \"Demand has cooled, and it's not Coca-Cola's demand; it's market demand,\" a second recycler said.\n\nSources indicated that, seasonally, demand for rPET resin is lower in the first quarter, while the supply of bottles increases.\n\n\"You have a lower need for bottles during a time of year when there is higher generation, which is the holidays. In the summer, water consumption heats up, and 44% of the bottles are for water,\" the second recycler said.\n\nRegional differences\n\nThe additional demand of 400,000 mt per year represents nearly 10% of global rPET production and practically all currently installed capacity in Brazil.\n\nBut Coca-Cola's target is global. With this, the company can adapt its resin mix and regional approaches based on cost efficiency and local regulatory requirements. \"The company will continue to comply with local regulations, including where higher percentages of recycled content are required,\" Coca-Cola stated in the Dec. 2 announcement.\n\nThe first Brazilian recycler said that, given one of the largest price differentials between recycled and virgin PET resin in Brazil and the absence of regulations mandating a minimum amount of rPET usage, the country becomes a less attractive market for companies like Coca-Cola to meet their recycling targets. \"If it's more expensive here, Coca-Cola will meet its target in China,\" the source said.\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, last assessed post-consumer PET clear bottle bales at Real 5.80/kg DDP S\u00e3o Paulo on Jan. 17, up Real 1.30/kg since Aug. 12, 2024, when the assessment was launched. Recycled PET clear flakes were last assessed at Real 10.35/kg DDP S\u00e3o Paulo, up Real 3.35/kg since Aug. 12.\n\nPrice indications for virgin PET bottle-grade resin were last heard at $1,490-$1,520/mt DDP Southeast Brazil, while recycled clear food-grade pellets were last heard at Real 11.50/kg ($1,900/mt) DDP Southeast Brazil.\n\n\"Those regulating the rPET market are the prices of virgin resin,\" the second recycler said.\n\nPlatts asked Coca-Cola in Brazil if there is any target specifically aimed at the local market. Platts also inquired about the percentage of recycled material used by the company in Brazil and requested comments on reports of a lack of competitiveness in local recycling. The company's public relations department stated that they would not comment.\n\nLatest numbers\n\nCoca-Cola revealed in the report The Global Commitment 2024 that the company used a total of 3.4 million tons of plastic packaging in 2023. Notably, plastic packaging accounted for 47% of the total packaging units in 2023, an increase of 2 percentage points compared with 2018.\n\nThe Global Commitment, launched in 2018 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the United Nations Environment Programme, mobilized more than 1,000 organizations, including companies responsible for 20% of global plastic packaging production, to enhance the circular economy for plastics.\n\nIn its 2023 Environmental Update, Coca-Cola reported using 27% recycled materials in its primary packaging globally, with 17% of the PET used being rPET.",

The company just launched a collection of new flavors inspired by internet culture from the \u201890s and early 2000s. The Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix includes six flavors: Fanta Lime In My DMs, Sprite CherryBaby101, Sprite Orange Goin\u2019 Viral, Fanta Citrus Chatbox, Coca-Cola Vanilla Peach Luvr, and Coca-Cola Tropical Vlogg.\n\nFood insider @markie_devo recently shared the news with followers, writing \u201cIt\u2019s 2025, of course we have Coke that tastes like Windows 98.\u201d In the comment section, users enjoyed poking fun at the soda names, with one person quipping, \u201cAre these new? Because they are so yesterday.\u201d\n\nOverall, the new Freestyle flavors are getting positive reviews. \u201cI work at Wawa been drinking the peach vanilla Coke allllll shift it's delicious,\u201d wrote one fan. \u201cWawa has them and the lime one is sooo good. Highly recommend,\u201d added another.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix is drawing some criticism, however, from people who feel the flavor names are vague. Others find them to be a poor representation of the time period. \u201dThey all look good but those names are clearly pandering to Gen Z. Very cringe,\u201d said one Redditor, a sentiment echoed by many others on social media.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s true that no one was referring to messages as \u201cDMs\u201d in the \u201890s and Vlogging didn\u2019t really take off until 2005 when YouTube was created, we can all appreciate the playful names and nostalgic vibes that Coca-Cola is bringing to our cups. And, at the end of the day, we care more about how they taste.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix is available from Jan. 7 through March 3 at restaurants with Coca-Cola Freestyle Machines. So, next time you stop in for Wendy\u2019s 2 for 7 Deal, be sure to take a trip back in time with Coca-Cola\u2019s newest offering.",

            "content": "In 1942, the Nazi apparatchik Otto Dietrich sniffed, \u201cAmerica never contributed anything to world civilization but chewing gum and Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nHe rather understated our significance, but even if he\u2019d been right, giving the world Coca-Cola is a greater contributor to human happiness than most other countries have managed to muster.\n\nIn yet another sign of how corporate America is happy to be associated with Donald Trump as he takes office a second time, the CEO of Coca-Cola presented Trump a commemorative bottle of Diet Coke for his Inauguration.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s legendary attachment to the beverage, it must have been as satisfying to him as winning a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn one of what would prove a long series of confounding reversals of Trump policies, President Biden removed the red button Trump had installed at the Resolute Desk to instantly order Diet Cokes (and to occasionally prank visitors who assumed the red button had a more momentous purpose).\n\nCoke occupies an outsized place, not just in the US beverage market, but in our culture.\n\nThe drink is inextricably part of Americana. The cola has been associated with cutting-edge aspects of our national life since its formulation as a medicinal drink in the late 19th century, from soda fountains, to gas stations, to the movies.\n\nIts logo is instantly recognizable, and its iconic advertising has marked changing tastes in the country down through the decades.\n\nThe traditional Coke container, the green so-called hobbleskirt bottle (a curvier prototype was nicknamed the Mae West), is itself a symbol of America.\n\nIn World War II, everyone considered it a national imperative to get Coke overseas to our troops. As Mark Pendergast notes in his history of the cola, the military brass was all-in. Patton always wanted Coke available, MacArthur signed the first bottle produced in the Philippines when he returned, and Bradley had a case in his office.\n\nThen, there was Ike. Pendergast recounts a celebratory luncheon in Washington, DC, after VE Day in 1945. Eisenhower was asked if he wanted anything.\n\n\u201cCould somebody get me a Coke?\u201d he asked. After finishing it, the future president let it be known he had one more request. Asked what it was, he replied: \u201cAnother Coke.\u201d\n\nThat Coke is as American as motherhood and Apple pie, and maybe more American than the pie, made its dabbling in fashionable left-wing politics all the more disappointing.\n\nUnder pressure in 2021, the Atlanta-based company denounced the Georgia election law. Its CEO, James Quincey, said, \u201cThe Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.\u201d\n\nHe was wrong, and clearly joining the corporate parade. Coke also embraced DEI training. Critics dubbed the company Woke-a-Cola.\n\nThe commemorative Diet Coke bottle is not as nearly as consequential as Meta\u2019s turnabout on its speech policies \u2014 Coke has been creating special bottles for presidential inaugurations for a while now.\n\nBut the CEO didn\u2019t have to personally deliver it to Trump, and Coke didn\u2019t have to make a nod to Trump\u2019s personal preference with the Diet Coke bottle.\n\nWhereas companies like Coke once felt compelled to go along with the woke tide, Trump\u2019s victory is now giving them permission to reject or distance themselves from what seemed an irresistible ideological trend.\n\nBy the way, the soda cross-pressures the Trump coalition: While the president himself is a devotee, reportedly consuming 12 Diet Cokes a day, his HHS nominee, RFK, Jr., is a not a fan.\n\nIf Coke finds itself targeted on public-health grounds, it won\u2019t be the first time. Going back to the early 20th century, the crusading federal health official Harvey Wiley waged a campaign against Coke for containing cocaine (which had already been removed) and caffeine; the company escaped his clutches.\n\nRegardless of the politics of the day, Coke will surely endure. Nearly a 150 years since John Pemberton invented the drink, it\u2019s still the real thing.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry",

            "content": "In April of last year, Qu\u00e9bec lost one of its musical greats. Jean-Pierre Ferland, a member of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and a man who touched generations with his work had passed away, and the world was a little less bright for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s in times such as those that it falls to the community to create a little spark of its own. Sure, it\u2019ll never perfectly replicate the light that\u2019s been lost, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not beautiful in its own way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what Coca-Cola \u2013 in an initiative ideated and developed by WPP's Open X, led by VML Canada\u2019s TAXI Montreal \u2013 achieved. In a heartfelt tribute to the musician, the participants brought together 10 Qu\u00e9bec artists from various generations to record and reinterpret one of Jean-Pierre\u2019s most famous songs, \u2018Le petit roi\u2019 (The Little King), which debuted at the 2024 Bye Bye Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extension of Coca-Cola\u2019s \u2018Real Magic\u2019 platform, this enterprise was led in part by Louis-Jean Cormier \u2013 another of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s most respected artistic talents. Responsible for the musical direction of the project, including the arrangement of the song, much of this can be seen in the extended version of the spot, which offers a glimpse into the recording sessions, alongside testimonials from the participating artists about Jean-Pierre Ferland\u2019s influence on their careers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about how this initiative came to life, LBB\u2019s Jordan Won Neufeldt sat down with TAXI Montreal executive creative director Antoine B\u00e9cotte for a chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What made now the right time for a campaign like this, and why was it the right way to build upon Coca-Cola\u2019s \u2018Real Magic\u2019 platform?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> Music is a major passion point for Coca-Cola. Every year, the brand launches international and local music-based initiatives to create an emotional connection with its consumers. And, as a sponsor of the Bye Bye 2024 show, Coca-Cola wanted an ad that would connect with Quebecers in a genuine way. Investing in the Qu\u00e9bec music scene felt natural for this occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we also wanted to celebrate Qu\u00e9bec's vibrant music scene, so it made sense to leverage Coca-Cola's \u2018Real Magic\u2019 platform, which emphasises authentic human connection. Following Jean-Pierre Ferland's passing, we sought to create a campaign that would honour his musical legacy and connect with audiences across generations by fostering a shared cultural experience \u2013 a celebration of the unifying power of music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> The decision to re-record one of his songs \u2013 \u2018Le petit roi\u2019 \u2013 is brilliant. Specifically, what made this the one you wanted to cover? What does it represent to fans of the late artist?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> \u2018Le petit roi\u2019 (The Little King) is not only one of the most touching songs in Jean-Pierre\u2019s repertoire, but also a loving nickname of his. The beloved melody is emblematic of his profound impact on Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s music scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Louis-Jean Cormier was responsible for both the arrangement, and the musical direction. What made him the right person for the job? Tell us about the collaboration!\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> Louis-Jean Cormier was selected for his exceptional talent in reimagining songs with a unique artistic vision. He is one of the most respected artists in the Qu\u00e9bec music industry \u2013 admired across generations. We knew that Louis-Jean's involvement would inspire other artists to join and create a truly amazing tribute to Jean-Pierre's career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> You also brought on an exceptional roster of artists to partake in the recording. What was your selection process like, and how did recording go?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> We aimed to select artists representing diverse styles and generations to ensure broad appeal and inclusivity. Not only that, but we also sought a variety of vocal textures and ranges to create the most emotionally resonant rendition possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, we were guided by Louis-Jean's vision. We prioritised giving the artists creative freedom, and this collaborative and authentic environment allowed their genuine emotion and artistry to shine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Do you have any anecdotes from the experience?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> Witnessing the artists arrive at the studio was truly special. Established legends and emerging talents alike were visibly moved and inspired by the shared experience of honouring Jean-Pierre. The atmosphere was electric, creating a palpable sense of connection, and a real magic between the artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> The edit on the long form version of the song is really well done. What did it take to bring the video to life?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> Our director, Matt Charland, has a gift for capturing authentic behind-the-scenes moments, which became key to the video's impact. He and his team filmed continuously, allowing the artists and Louis-Jean to work organically while seamlessly documenting the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What challenges did you face during this project? And what lessons did you learn in the process?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> The biggest challenge was the incredibly tight timeline. We completed this project in less than a month! The production's success stemmed from several key ingredients: the invaluable support of Mr. Ferland's estate, the artists' passion for Jean-Pierre\u2019s music, the creative freedom they were given, and the raw authenticity of the unscripted behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of lessons, the power of authentic storytelling and cross-generational collaboration is remarkable. It\u2019s clear that consumers crave genuine emotion and connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Since launch, how have people reacted to this campaign?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> The campaign has been incredibly well-received, generating significant media coverage and positive online engagement. While we don't have all the final results yet, it's clear the campaign resonated deeply with audiences during the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What did the chance to be involved in this mean to you?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> It was an honour for our team to bring together these incredible artists to pay tribute to such a musical icon. Seeing the positive reactions to the campaign from Jean-Pierre\u2019s family and friends, both on social media and in interviews, has been especially rewarding and makes us incredibly proud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Finally, is there anything you\u2019d like to say about the legacy of Jean-Pierre Ferland?\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine> The campaign itself serves as a testament to Jean-Pierre\u2019s enduring legacy, showcasing his influence on generations of Qu\u00e9bec artists and the timeless appeal of his music. He touched the hearts of Quebecers, and his music will continue to resonate for decades to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Adobe Stock\n\nThe only thing better than the taste of a crisp, fountain soda is being able to customize it yourself. People have been mixing soda for years, but in 2009, Coca-Cola launched Freestyle machines, which took flavor blending to the next level. The bright red machines are stocked with numerous soda bases and fruity syrups which customers can use to create their own beverages or choose from a curated selection of flavors that aren\u2019t typically found in stores.\n\nWhile Freestyle machines already have a lot to choose from, Coca-Cola continues to update its offerings with limited-time specialties including Olympics-themed flavors and its Tropical Holiday lineup.\n\nNow, Coca-Cola has created six new flavors inspired by the internet's early years when Y2K was the buzzword and we had to wait ten minutes for a single video to download.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix Freestyle Flavors\n\nNext time you fill up your cup at a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, you\u2019ll be treated to a taste of nostalgia. The company just launched a collection of new flavors inspired by internet culture from the \u201890s and early 2000s. The Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix includes six flavors: Fanta Lime In My DMs, Sprite CherryBaby101, Sprite Orange Goin\u2019 Viral, Fanta Citrus Chatbox, Coca-Cola Vanilla Peach Luvr, and Coca-Cola Tropical Vlogg.\n\nFood insider @markie_devo recently shared the news with followers, writing \u201cIt\u2019s 2025, of course we have Coke that tastes like Windows 98.\u201d In the comment section, users enjoyed poking fun at the soda names, with one person quipping, \u201cAre these new? Because they are so yesterday.\u201d\n\nOverall, the new Freestyle flavors are getting positive reviews. \u201cI work at Wawa been drinking the peach vanilla Coke allllll shift it's delicious,\u201d wrote one fan. \u201cWawa has them and the lime one is sooo good. Highly recommend,\u201d added another.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix is drawing some criticism, however, from people who feel the flavor names are vague. Others find them to be a poor representation of the time period. \u201dThey all look good but those names are clearly pandering to Gen Z. Very cringe,\u201d said one Redditor, a sentiment echoed by many others on social media.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s true that no one was referring to messages as \u201cDMs\u201d in the \u201890s and Vlogging didn\u2019t really take off until 2005 when YouTube was created, we can all appreciate the playful names and nostalgic vibes that Coca-Cola is bringing to our cups. And, at the end of the day, we care more about how they taste.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s Favorite Mix is available from Jan. 7 through March 3 at restaurants with Coca-Cola Freestyle Machines. So, next time you stop in for Wendy\u2019s 2 for 7 Deal, be sure to take a trip back in time with Coca-Cola\u2019s newest offering.\n\nRead the original article on ALLRECIPES",

            "content": "With third-quarter 2024 revenue of $11.9 billion, a presence in more than 200 countries and territories, and more than 200 different brands under its umbrella, Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) is the undisputed leader in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink market. Its industry position is probably one reason Warren Buffett loves the company so much.\n\nCelsius (CELH -3.13%) is a niche player, focusing exclusively on energy drinks. While its shares are currently 72% off their peak, they have still soared an unbelievable 1,660% in the past five years.\n\nWhich of these beverage stocks is the better buy today?\n\nPowerful brand and rising dividends\n\nCoca-Cola's most important competitive strength comes from its powerful brand, which supports its economic moat. The business has delivered a consistent product that consumers across the globe have become familiar with, leading to brand loyalty that any company would dream of.\n\nThe result is that Coca-Cola has pricing power. Unit volumes declined 1% in the latest fiscal quarter, but favorable pricing helped offset that drop. This is a usual occurrence, again showing customer loyalty. This adds to the company's durability and staying power.\n\nAs a mature business that leads its industry, Coca-Cola reports sizable profits. Its operating margin typically exceeds 20%, demonstrating a scaled and lucrative operation. There is minimal financial risk for shareholders, as profits are still produced in recessionary periods.\n\nHigh earnings have led to meaningful free-cash-flow generation, to the tune of an estimated $9.2 billion in 2024 (excluding an IRS tax litigation deposit). Investors have reaped the rewards in the form of a dividend payout that has increased 62 straight years. The current yield of 3.15% provides a nice income stream that strengthens returns.\n\nDisrupting the energy category\n\nCelsius was once a darling on Wall Street. In the five years leading up to its peak in March 2024, the stock skyrocketed 7,330%. This was driven by monster growth. Revenue of $1.3 billion in 2023 was 25 times higher than in 2018. That's an incredible gain that certainly propelled investor returns.\n\nBut sales took a hit in Q3, tanking 31% year over year due to Celsius' largest distributor cutting back on orders. The business, which has cemented its place as the third largest energy drink company, is learning the hard way just how critical it is to balance surging demand with not having too much inventory. I believe Celsius' latest challenge shines light on the question of whether or not the brand has staying power, as there are always new entrants popping up that consumers are free to try.\n\nNonetheless, consensus analyst estimates call for revenue and earnings per share to grow at compound annual rates of 10.7% and 15%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. So, the view is that the company will get back to healthy gains, albeit at a much more muted pace than in the past.\n\nWhat's your risk tolerance?\n\nAs this writing, shares of Coca-Cola trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.5. That's about in line with its trailing-five-year average.\n\nCelsius, on the other hand, trades for a P/E multiple of 37.8. This is nearly one-tenth of the 351.9 average over the past five years.\n\nGiven Celsius' previous growth, it's certainly dealing with souring investor sentiment. Prospective investors might view the valuation as too hard to ignore.\n\nThat might be the case, but what stock you choose depends on your risk tolerance. Celsius is undoubtedly the riskier business to own, as there is more uncertainty about its five-year outlook. The company could get back on track to register market share gains in its category, which can lead to soaring revenue and earnings.\n\nBut the probability of this happening is anyone's guess. Of course, for that risk investors receive the possibility of stronger portfolio returns.\n\nFor risk-averse investors, Coca-Cola is the no-brainer choice. The company will still be dominating the beverage industry decades from now. Just don't expect market-beating returns from owning the stock.",

            "content": "The Coca-Cola Company (KO), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. With a market cap of $267.3 billion, the company also distributes and markets juice and juice-drink products to retailers and wholesalers worldwide. The beverage giant is expected to announce its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for 2024 before the market opens on Tuesday, Feb. 11.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect KO to report a profit of $0.52 per share on a diluted basis, up 6.1% from $0.49 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect KO to report EPS of $2.85, up 6% from $2.69 in fiscal 2023. Its EPS is expected to rise 3.9% year over year to $2.96 in fiscal 2025.\n\nKO stock has underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 24.4% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 2.3% during this period. Similarly, it underperformed the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLP) 4.7% gains over the same time frame.\n\nCoca-Cola's underperformance stems from weak consumer demand in Europe, economic pressures, and declining convenience store traffic. The company faces additional challenges, including a lawsuit alleging plastic pollution and deceptive practices, soft volume trends across operating segments, and unfavorable currency rates. Macroeconomic disruptions, such as rising internal costs, slowing consumer spending, and geopolitical challenges, also pose concerns, while the company's premium valuation and exposure to inflationary pressures raise investor worries, ultimately impacting Coca-Cola's profitability.\n\nOn Oct. 30, KO shares closed up marginally after reporting its Q3 results.

Critics are already saying they will be switching to Pepsi...\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are many things Donald Trump is known for, but a healthy lifestyle when it comes to food is not one of them.\n\nThe soon-to-be 47th president has a documented love of McDonalds and reportedly had a button in the Oval Office of the White House during his first term, a small knob which signaled he wanted Diet Coke. He apparently consumed around 12 per day.\n\nNow, ahead of his second inauguration on Monday, it has been revealed that the Coca-Cola Company has issued a commemorative bottle of Diet Coke to mark the event.\n\nTrump\u2019s deputy director of communications, Margo Martin, shared a picture on X, captioned with: \u201cTonight, President Trump received the first ever Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle from the Chairman and CEO of Coca Cola Company, James Quincey.\u201d\n\nThe bottle of Diet Coke has a label with a drawing of the White House and the phrase \u201cThe Inauguration of the President of the United States\u201d and Trump\u2019s name and the date of Monday\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe bottle came in a box with a letter stating: \u201cFounded 126 years ago in Atlanta, Georgia, The Coca-Cola Company takes great pride in producing hundreds of brands that people enjoy. Along with our 60+ independent bottling partners, the Coca-Cola system generates $58+ billion in U.S. economic activity annually and supports more than 860,000 jobs in the United States.\u201d\n\nA Coca-Cola representative told Newsweek that the meeting between Quincey and Trump \u201creinforces our commitment to strengthening America\u2019s economic future.\u201d\n\nThe letter from the company also stated that Coca Cola is \u201cproud to continue our decades-long tradition of celebrating the US presidential inauguration with a commemorative bottle\u201d.\n\nIndeed, the company has made these commemorative bottles for each incoming president since 2005. Trump\u2019s bottle, however, is the first one that is Diet.\n\nThe commemorative bottle of Diet Coke X\n\nCritics have already reacted to the gift, with many bemoaning that Coca-Cola is now hypocritically falling in line with the new Trump era, despite the company condemning Trump and his supporters following the January 6 Capitol riot in 2021.\n\nThe company said at the time that the assault on the Capitol was \u201can offense to the ideals of American democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump as often blasted Coca-Cola and in 2021, called for a boycott of Coca-Cola and other companies opposing reforms in Georgia\u2019s voting laws that were signed by the state\u2019s Republican governor.\n\nFaced with this reversal in relations between Trump and Coca-Cola, Trump critics took the opportunity to declare they\u2019d be switching to Pepsi going forward.\n\nSo, has the age-old Coke vs Pepsi rivalry been reignited?\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that social media users have compared Coca-Cola to other companies like Amazon, Walmart and Meta, the parent company to Facebook and Instagram, who have also taken steps to align themselves with the upcoming Trump administration. In Meta\u2019s case, it has rolled back its fact-checking initiatives, content moderation policies, and has removed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programmes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMark Zuckerberg, like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.\n\nSo, Coke or Pepsi?\n\nThe latter currently seems to have the upper hand \u2013 making their current slogan \u201cThat\u2019s what I like\u201d even more appropriate. But at the end of the day, does it matter? The alarming decision to ditch fact-checking initiatives - that matters.",

However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman & CEO, James Robert Quincey, sold US$15m worth of shares at a price of US$60.94 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$62.04). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 33% of James Robert Quincey's stake.\n\nCoca-Cola insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nNYSE:KO Insider Trading Volume January 15th 2025\n\nI will like Coca-Cola better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsiders At Coca-Cola Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. In total, insiders dumped US$7.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Coca-Cola insiders own about US$1.8b worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?\n\nInsiders sold Coca-Cola shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Be aware that Coca-Cola is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those doesn't sit too well with us...",

But the folks at Coca-Cola have really managed to distinguish themselves by giving the president-elect an honor that is dumb, unnecessary, and hypocritical.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Margo Martin, Trump\u2019s deputy director of communications, announced on X that he had \u201creceived the first ever Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle,\u201d along with a photo of Coca-Cola Company chairman and CEO James Quincey personally presenting it to Trump.\n\nTonight, President Trump received the first ever Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle from the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Company, James Quincey \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/IgV2pxHnxD \u2014 Margo Martin (@margomartin) January 15, 2025\n\nMartin\u2019s post is somewhat misleading; Trump is not the first president to receive a commemorative Coke bottle. The note shown in the second photo reads, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to continue our decades-long tradition of celebrating the U.S. presidential inauguration with a commemorative [bottle].\u201d\n\nA Coca-Cola Company spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the company has created Coke bottles for each presidential inauguration \u201cdating back to 2005.\u201d Indeed, there are plenty of Coke bottles marking presidential inaugurations \u2014 and even gubernatorial inaugurations \u2014 available on eBay.\n\nBut it seems Trump is the first to receive a Diet Coke bottle, in a nod to his legendary love of that particular Coke variant.\n\nWhile this is not a new \u201chonor,\u201d the way the Coca-Cola Company went about bestowing it is still embarrassing.\n\nTrump already loves Diet Coke as much as any human can love a carbonated beverage. He reportedly consumed around 12 servings per day when he was in the White House. He installed a \u201cDiet Coke Button,\u201d and the man who answered the buzzer\u2019s call \u2014 earning the nickname \u201cDiet Coke Valet\u201d \u2014 became a trusted aide (and co-defendant).\n\nNone of this prevented Trump from calling for a boycott of Coke in 2021, along with other companies that spoke out against Georgia\u2019s new voting-rights restrictions.\n\nCoca-Cola could have taken this as a sign that nothing will ensure Trump\u2019s loyalty and quietly sent him the same commemorative Coke glass every other president receives. Instead, the company tried to make a cute gesture to Trump\u2019s Diet Coke addiction and had its CEO hand-deliver the package.\n\nAll this gesture managed to do was generate headlines about how Coca-Cola is hypocritically sucking up to Trump four years after declaring that his supporters\u2019 attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was \u201can offense to the ideals of American democracy.\u201d\n\nBut, hey, at least Trump is a little happier with the company that produces his main source of hydration \u2014 at least, until Coca-Cola ticks him off again.",

The marketing approaches of the companies have been likened to that of \u2018big tobacco\u2019.\n\n\u00a9 iStock/Maartje-van-Caspel\n\nIn the lawsuit, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, plaintiff Bryce Martinez alleges he developed type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diagnosed at age 16, as a result of consuming the companies' products.\n\nThe lawsuit reads: \u201cDue to Defendants\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff regularly, frequently, and chronically ingested their UPF, which caused him to contract Type 2 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Plaintiff is now suffering from these devastating diseases, and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nCarlos Monteiro, the Brazilian public health professor who coined the UPF term, posted on X: \u201cA first-of-its-kind lawsuit against 11 UPF industries alleging they engineer their UPF products to be addictive with details on the actions taken to target children including internal memos, meetings [and] the research conducted to create addictive substances.\u201d\n\nThe food companies named are Coca-Cola, Conagra, General Mills, Kellanova, Kraft, Mars, Mondelez, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Post and WK Kellogg.\n\nIn a response, the Consumer Brands Association, a US-based trade association for manufacturers of consumer packaged goods, pointed to the lack of an \u201cagreed upon scientific definition\u201d of UPFs. \u201cAttempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,\u201d Sarah Gallo, the Association\u2019s senior vice president of product policy, told Reuters.\n\nMarion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health (Emerita) at New York University said the lawsuit \u201cmakes interesting reading\u201d.\n\nThe lawsuit contains references to how the same MRI machines used by scientific researchers to study potential cures for addiction are used by UPF companies to engineer their products to be more addictive.\n\nIt also notes how \u2018big tobacco\u2019 repurposed marketing strategies designed to sell cigarettes to children and minorities, and aggressively marketed to these groups. The UPF industry currently spends a reported $2 billion each year marketing UPFs to children.\n\nA massive market with huge health impacts\n\nStudies show that UPFs make up more than 73% of the food in the United States\u2019 food supply and 67% of American children\u2019s diets on average. At least 14% of adults and 12% of children in the US have been reported to demonstrate behavioural indicators of addiction in response to UPFs. The lawsuit alleges the problem remains pervasive among American children due to the food industry\u2019s targeted marketing toward them.\n\n\u201cThese companies\u2019 tactics closely mirror those employed by big tobacco, with a singular objective: to addict kids to their products,\u201d said Chris Seeger from law firm Seeger Weiss, which filed the lawsuit together with lawyers at Morgan & Morgan.\n\nOther lawyers have suggested the case will be difficult to prove. There are many factors involved in someone\u2019s health, for example, while proving causation between the allegedly deceptive advertising of the defendants and the alleged health impacts of their foods will also be a challenge.\n\nHowever, the case certainly intensifies the spotlight on UPFs. In a recent report, the World Health Organization (WHO) placed processed foods in the same harmful category as tobacco, alcohol, fossil fuels, and certain occupational practices. These categories combined are linked to nearly 7,500 deaths per day in Europe.\n\nThe lawsuit references scientific research showing that when compared to less-processed foods, ultra-processed foods significantly increase disease risks \u2013 even if they have the same amount of fat, sugar, salt, carbohydrates and other nutrients as comparable, less processed foods.\n\nWriting about recent studies on UPFs, Nestle at New York University said it is \u201cgreat to see all this research coming together. Whatever the reasons \u2013 energy density, hyper-palatability, less chewing \u2013 the take-home-message seems utterly obvious: reduce intake of ultra-processed foods,\u201d she added.\n\nDoubts over definition\n\nThere is confusion among consumers as to what constitutes a UPF. Recent research shows that many US consumers cannot correctly identify UPF products and vastly underestimate their consumption of these foods.\n\nFor example, a recent survey by Innova Markets, presented at the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) First in Chicago in July, revealed that nearly 30% of US consumers believe they consume UPFs less than once a week or never, while over half of consumers say they eat UPFs between one and six times a week. However, studies looking at actual UPF intake show that these foods constitute about 58% of the average US diet, which implies a stark discrepancy between perceived and actual intake.\n\nWhen Innova asked consumers about the kinds of food they considered ultra-processed, the picture that emerged was closer to the traditional notion of \u2018junk food\u2019 than the classification of UPFs, as used in scientific literature. Under the NOVA system \u2013 created in 2010 when Brazilian researchers including Monteiro classified food and beverages according to their degree of processing \u2013 UPFs, considered as \u2018category 4\u2019 on the scale, comprise snacks, drinks, ready meals, and other product types largely or entirely formulated by substances extracted from or derived from food constituents.\n\n\u201cWhile the media, some scientists, and some NGOs have been happy to promote the term and use it to denigrate industry, the actual definition remains very nebulous and is open to a very large degree of interpretation by all who use it,\u201d said Andrew Curtis, director general scientific and regulatory affairs at Snack, Nut and Crisp Manufacturers Association (SNACMA), recently.\n\nAs Ingredients Network reported, the doubts and deliberations over definitions have slowed the process of regulating these products. Evidence to date is almost exclusively of the association variety, such as observational studies, prospective cohort, and cross-sectional studies, WHO said. \u201cA clear path of causality cannot be made between consumption of UPF and most if not all observed health outcomes,\u201d added a WHO spokesperson.\n\nMore UPF lawsuits on the way?\n\nThe lawsuit kicks off what could be a long process. The document includes claims for conspiracy, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, and unfair business practices.\n\nIf the ruling is that UPFs have been falsely advertised, for example that they are healthy when in fact they are not, companies would have to change their marketing. However, if the focus is on the health effects, the industry could be looking at potential UPF bans or at least mandatory warning labels.\n\nMorgan & Morgan attorney Rene Rocha said the lawsuit is the result of more than 12 months of research and investigation. \u201cOur goal is to hold these companies responsible for their alleged efforts to make ultra-processed foods as addictive as possible and get them into the hands of children,\u201d he added.",

            "content": "Investor preferences have led many US companies to increase and sustain their dividends in 2024. Financial experts anticipate continued dividend growth in 2025. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, predicts an average dividend increase of around 8% for the current year. He expects another record payout in 2025, estimated at approximately $685 billion, compared to the projected $630 billion for 2024. Silverblatt attributes this growth to record earnings, anticipated future earnings, declining interest rates, strong employment, and overall economic growth.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind the broader market, but their future remains promising. Analysts are optimistic about a rebound, as cash flow remains a key priority for investors. Capital Group has advised looking for opportunities in overlooked dividend-paying companies, such as pharmaceutical firms overshadowed by the focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and select banks. In addition, dividend growth stocks with substantial yields continue to attract interest. Companies offering dividends alongside strong balance sheets and appealing yields can deliver steady income, cushion against market downturns, and foster solid investment growth. A report from ProShares noted that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For example, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to more than $61,000 by March 2023.\n\n\u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have long supported dividend stocks due to their historically robust performance. Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, has highlighted several reasons to consider investing in these stocks. She pointed out that the income generated by dividend stocks can assist investors in meeting their liquidity needs. In addition, dividend-focused investments have shown a tendency to reduce volatility and mitigate losses during market downturns. Cabacungan particularly emphasizes the value of dividend growth stocks in this context. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks has been a focal point for investors for several years. The attractive income generated from these stocks motivates many to invest. Among these, dividend growth stocks stand out, as they offer the potential for increasing income over time, which is highly appealing. In the US, numerous companies have consistently raised their dividends for over five decades, earning them the prestigious title of Dividend Kings.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where he Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend king stocks to invest in now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition, the broader market\u2019s dividend yield has recently hit a 20-year low, dipping below 1.19%, well below the long-term average of 4.3%. As interest rates rise on risk-free options like Treasuries, companies are increasingly aware of the competition for yield. In response, many are boosting their dividends or starting to offer them for the first time. Notably, several major tech firms began paying dividends in 2024, indicating their intention to position themselves as value investments within the traditionally high-growth tech sector. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend kings to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed the Dividend Kings companies and selected the ten stocks that were most favored by hedge funds in the third quarter of 2024, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge fund investments, starting with the lowest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Now, the scheme is being expanded to improve nutrition in the community \u2013 through supporting small-scale agriculture development \u2013 and help foster community business opportunities in waste management and agriculture.\n\nThe programme is being delivered against a challenging backdrop. Indonesians still face significant difficulties when it comes to accessing proper sanitation. Based on data from the World Health Organisation and UNICEF, 192 million Indonesians don\u2019t have access to safely managed drinking water services, whilst 32 million lack access to at least basic sanitation.\n\nTo help address the lack of local infrastructure in Kutamaneuh Village \u2013 an area identified as having urgent need for better sanitation access \u2013 CCEP, alongside local partners Water Stewardship Indonesia and Safe Water Gardens, introduced a community project that set out to increase access to clean water.\n\nDesigning the provision of clean water, sanitation and waste management facilities in collaboration with the community, CCEP staged a series of interventions in the local area which would help support the one in four local families\u2019 whose quality of life was restricted by inadequate sanitation facilities.\n\nThis approach paved the way for the implementation of water and sanitation infrastructure, water reuse systems and water gardens and a series of training sessions for village officials to increase their understanding of the importance of sanitation and nutrition.\n\nWith the latest evolution of the project, CCEP will now also help support the Indonesian government\u2019s targets for medium- and long-term development by providing local economic opportunities via micro-farming training and education in better waste management practices.\n\nLucia Karina, Director of Public Affairs, Communications, and Sustainability CCEP Indonesia, said: \"The WASH+ programme has demonstrated the success of community-based water management. By expanding the programme further, we aim to evolve and grow this approach by integrating waste management, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture. This will not only improve access to clean water and sanitation but also promote better health through improved nutrition and create economic opportunities through waste-based and agricultural micro-enterprises. Together, these will drive sustainable community development.\"\n\nOur action in Indonesia forms part of our global commitment to water stewardship.\n\n1 JMP, 2022",

            "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Coca-Cola (KO), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry.\n\nThis world's largest beverage maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.53%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola was expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share, but it reported $0.77 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.05%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.80 per share, while it actually produced $0.84 per share, a surprise of 5%.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nCoca-Cola currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.",

            "content": "Family champions education, opportunity at Kennesaw State through gift\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. | Jan 13, 2025\n\nBorja de Olano, a retired executive from The Coca-Cola Company, and wife Rosemary recently made a $100,000 gift to the university to support the Bagwell College of Education and KSU Athletics.\n\nIntroduced to Kennesaw State University by fellow trustee Judith Moen Stanley, de Olano joined the KSU Foundation Board of Trustees. Drawn to KSU\u2019s status as a relatively new institution with one of the largest and most diverse student bodies in Georgia, de Olano was impressed by its affordability and mission to support first-generation college students.\n\n\u201cKSU is a relatively new university, with one of the largest student bodies in the state of Georgia; it has a growing, diverse student body and a large selection of degree programs,\u201d he said. His enthusiasm for the university\u2019s mission and growth is rooted in its affordability and commitment to supporting first-generation college students.\n\nHis commitment to KSU extends beyond de Olano\u2019s role on the Board of Trustees. He established the de Olano Family Education Scholarship, aimed at supporting future educators, emphasizing the importance of quality teachers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of partnerships with community leaders like Borja de Olano and our incredible faculty, staff, and students that this college is at the epicenter of innovation in education,\u201d said Adrian L. Epps, dean of the Bagwell College of Education. \u201cBorja is on the Bagwell College Board of Visitors, and we are grateful for his time, his insight, and his investment in our students.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the challenges faced by today\u2019s aspiring teachers, de Olano is committed to alleviating some of their burdens.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, education is the most important element for anyone to be successful,\u201d he explained.\n\nHis belief in the transformative power of education is deeply personal. It is influenced by his own experiences with exceptional teachers, like Mrs. Penny Pullum, who taught him the value of individuality and high standards.\n\n\u201cMrs. Pullum was a really tough teacher, expecting nothing but the best, very demanding, and at the same time very supportive, fair, and loving\u2013a great combination,\u201d he recalled.\n\nIn addition to his support for education, de Olano has made a substantial gift to the Athletics Capital Campaign, acknowledging athletics' vital role in university life. De Olano notes the visibility KSU gained from participating in the March Madness basketball tournament and how the experience underscored the importance of investing in athletics to elevate the university\u2019s profile.\n\n\u201cAthletics is a key element in any successful school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps create an environment of unity among students, faculty, staff, alumni, and supporters.\u201d\n\nAs an ASCEND mentor, de Olano is deeply committed to the holistic development of students. Through mentorship, he shares his life experiences, guiding students and encouraging them to be role models to others as they go out into the world.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it is all about helping the development of the students, and at KSU, we\u2019re focused on developing the whole person,\u201d said de Olano.\n\n\u2013 Story by Elyssa Reed\n\nPhoto by Judith Pishnery\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees to its more than 47,000 students.

While the giant warehouse chain hasn't officially confirmed the change (we did reach out, stand by), eagle-eyed Redditors in California noticed the Pepsi machines were disappearing from food courts. \"Monterey Park, CA. All Pepsi dispensers are gone,\" one Redditor posted. \"Include Coke Zero and my local Costco will be sick of my face real quick,\" one excited fan commented. \"Please for the love of god let me get a coke zero, I would get one every time I shop,\" another gushed.\n\nAnother Redditor posted, \"Good news for my fellow Costco-going [diet] coke enjoyers. My well-placed source said 'early 2025'.\" Costco members seem thrilled at the news, with one saying, \"Don't toy with my emotions like this\u2026\". The general consensus appears to be that Coke is vastly preferred over Pepsi, and customers don't understand why the switch wasn't made earlier.\n\n6 Facts About Costco's Famous Food Court Pizza\n\nA significant number of commenters have their fingers crossed for Costco also offering Dr Pepper. \"I never get the hot dog and drink deal because it's not worth it to have my one soda per week limit used on Pepsi. If it was Dr. Pepper, I'd get that deal way more often. I bet you'd see a significant spike in revenue in Texas,\" a Redditor commented. Even people who no longer drink soda are excited for their fellow Coca-Cola aficionados. \"I got SO EXCITED about this news\u2026 then I remembered I haven't had a Diet Coke in the last ten years. (I had to give up soda for health reasons.) I used to love Coke products so much! I drank Diet Coke from morning to night. So I'll rejoice for everyone else!\"\n\nInfluencer Ryan Quinlan (@butthatsmyopinion) announced the news via a December Instagram post, and followers were very excited at the news. \"They're bringing Coca-Cola products back to the Costco food court. That means instead of having Pepsi, Mountain Dew, or Starry, you'll have sodas like Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and root beer,\" he said. \"Coke rules. Pepsi drools,\" one person commented. \"Haven't bought a drink from Costco since they went to Pepsi. I stop at McDonald's on the way there and take me Coke in with me. Saves me an extra stop,\" another user said.\n\nFor those who prefer Pepsi over Coke\u2014enjoy the option while you can, because it might soon be gone forever (or at least for a long while).

            "content": "The bulk of Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income can be traced to seven core holdings.\n\nFew if any money managers command the attention of investors quite like the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. Since taking over as Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 1.51%) (BRK.B 1.68%) CEO six decades ago, Buffett has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares of 5,477,866%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 8. When you lap the benchmark S&P 500 many times over, you're going to draw a crowd.\n\nBuffett's success has been defined by his unwavering search for value, a preference to concentrate Berkshire's investment portfolio into his top ideas, and his long-term ethos.\n\nBut another factor that's not given nearly enough credit is his love of dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable on a recurring basis, time-tested, and capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks.\n\nAdditionally, a study from Hartford Funds (The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future) found that income stocks have more than doubled the average annual return of non-payers covering a 50-year period (1973-2023): 9.17% vs. 4.27%.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's portfolio is packed with dividend stocks. However, seven of these magnificent stocks are expected to, collectively, generate $4.5 billion in annual dividend income for Buffett's company.\n\n1. Occidental Petroleum: $911,597,004 (includes preferred dividend income)\n\nBelieve it or not, the top income-producing stock for 2025 in the 44-stock, $296 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is integrated oil and gas company Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.41%). The more than 264 million shares of Occidental common stock Berkshire holds are set to generate almost $232.5 million in dividend income, while the $8.489 billion in preferred stock yielding 8% will produce another $679.1 million. The end result is north of $911 million in expected dividends from Occidental this year.\n\nUnlike most integrated oil and gas stocks, Occidental's revenue heavily relies on its upstream drilling operations. Although it has downstream chemical plants that can help to partially offset declines in the spot price of crude oil, Occidental's operating cash flow ebbs-and-flows more than most oil stocks depending on the direction the price of crude oil moves.\n\nAnother interesting quirk about Occidental Petroleum is that it doesn't fit the mold of a typical Buffett investment. Whereas the Oracle of Omaha often avoids heavily indebted companies, Occidental's balance sheet has been constrained since it acquired Anadarko in 2019.\n\n2. Bank of America: $796,957,680\n\nDespite Warren Buffett overseeing the sale of more than 266 million shares of Bank of America (BAC -0.60%) stock since July 17, one of America's largest banks by total assets is still on track to generate almost $797 million in dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway in the new year.\n\nThe clearest competitive edge BofA brings to the table for its shareholders is its interest rate sensitivity. No big bank benefited more from the Federal Reserve's most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades, in terms of net interest income generation, than Bank of America. Even though the nation's central bank is now in a rate-easing cycle, the slow and methodical rate at which interest rates are falling should allow BofA ample opportunity to continue originating high-value loans.\n\nCredit should also be given to Bank of America's leadership for investing in technology. As of the end of September, 77% of households were banking digitally, and 54% of all loan sales were completed online or via mobile app, up 11 percentage points from the same period three years prior. Digital banking is significantly more cost-effective for Bank of America than in-person interactions.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: $776,000,000\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's longest-tenured holding (since 1988), consumer staples colossus Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%), is one of Buffett's top dividend payers. Coca-Cola has raised its base annual payout for 62 consecutive years and is on track to provide Berkshire with $776 million in annual dividend income.\n\nGeographic diversity and a well-known brand have played a key role in Coca-Cola's long-term success. This is a company that operates in all but three countries worldwide (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia) and has been the most-chosen brand off retail shelves for 12 years running, based on Kantar's annual \"Brand Footprint\" report. Its ability to cross generational gaps and connect with consumers via social media and well-known brand ambassadors speaks to the strength of its brand and marketing team.\n\nFurthermore, Coca-Cola benefits from selling a basic necessity: beverages. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. or global economy are performing, consumers need beverages, which leads to consistent operating cash flow year after year.\n\n4. Chevron: $773,340,682\n\nGlobal energy companies are known for their robust dividends, and integrated oil and gas goliath Chevron (CVX 0.62%) is no exception. Chevron has boosted its base annual payout for 37 straight years, with its $6.52-per-share dividend expected to generate over $773 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway in 2025.\n\nAlthough the juiciest margins are to be had from the company's upstream drilling segment, Chevron's midstream and downstream operations play a key role in its success. Chevron operates transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries, all of which help to offset potential weakness in the spot price of crude oil or natural gas. Having these hedges in place ensures steady cash flow.\n\nChevron has considerably more financial flexibility than Occidental Petroleum, as well. Capital spending is expected to retreat by 2026, all while new projects in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. shale, and Kazakhstan come online. The end result for Chevron should be a multibillion-dollar uptick in its operating cash flow.\n\n5. Kraft Heinz: $521,015,709\n\nEven though it's been one of the Oracle of Omaha's worst investments, consumer-packaged foods company Kraft Heinz (KHC -0.36%) doles out a hearty dividend. The nearly 27% stake Berkshire Hathaway holds in Kraft Heinz will yield more than $521 million in annual dividend income for Buffett's company this year.\n\nIn similar fashion to Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz benefits from food being a basic necessity. Though consumers may pare back their spending from time to time on discretionary items, food is something that's always in demand. Kraft Heinz's assortment of well-known brands and easy-to-prepare meals, sides, and snacks leads to relatively consistent operating results in most economic climates.\n\nThe downside for Kraft Heinz is that it's lugging around a lot of long-term debt ($19.4 billion) and quite a bit of goodwill ($28.9 billion) that it's unlikely to recoup. The company is struggling to generate enough buzz around its brands to meaningfully improve its financial flexibility.\n\n6. American Express: $424,509,960\n\nCredit-services provider American Express (AXP -1.66%) is the second longest-held stock in Berkshire Hathaway's $296 billion portfolio (since 1991) and one of the eight stocks Buffett considers to be a forever holding. In 2025, Berkshire is expected to collect $424.5 million in dividend income from AmEx.\n\nThe heart of American Express's operating success is its ability to double dip. On one hand, it's the nation's third-largest payment processor by credit card network purchase volume, which generates consistent fees from merchants. On the other side of the transaction counter, AmEx is also a lender, which allows it to collect interest income and annual fees from its cardholders. Long periods of economic expansion fuel AmEx's \"double-dipping\" opportunity.\n\nWhat's more, American Express has often been synonymous with affluent clientele. Cardholders with higher incomes are less likely to change their spending habits or fail to make their payments during periods of minor economic turbulence. Catering to the wealthy helps AmEx navigate recessions better than most lending institutions.\n\n7. Apple: $300,000,000\n\nLast but not least is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by market value, Apple (AAPL -3.36%). Even though the Oracle of Omaha has sold 67% of his company's stake in Apple, it's still Berkshire's top holding. The 300 million shares owned should produce $300 million in annual dividend income.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite thing about Apple may very well be its world-leading capital-return program. Over the last 11 fiscal years (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September), Apple has bought back more than $725 billion worth of its stock and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43%. Consistently buying back shares has helped to lift Apple's earnings per share and made its stock more attractive to value-oriented investors.\n\nApple's brand value can't be overlooked, either. It's the leading domestic smartphone provider by market share, and the company's subscription-driven Services segment has been steadily growing by a double-digit percentage.",

            "content": "Photo/Agencies\n\nMUMBAI: As scores of people gear up to visit the Maha Kumbh mela at Prayagraj, brands are going all out on advertising and marketing to gain a share of consumers' mind space.At a time when consumption is sluggish and the Indian middle class is counting every penny they are spending, getting 40 crore people - that's the estimated number of visitors expected to turn up at the religious congregation held once in every 12 years - to potentially sample and be introduced to their products is an opportunity brands cannot afford to overlook. From FMCG companies to banks and startups, companies have lined up promotional activities to market their brands and showcase new launches.Brands are estimated to spend about Rs 3,600 crore on advertising and marketing around Maha Kumbh, about 25% of which will be allocated for outdoor advertising , business and brand strategy specialist Harish Bijoor told TOI. Events like Maha Kumbh allow brands to cash in on moment marketing - the visibility becomes manifold and most brands use this as an opportunity to showcase their innovation, said Sandeep Goyal, chairman at Rediffusion. Besides, Maha Kumbh can act as a good testing ground for brands - they can gauge consumer feedback for new products they plan to push to wider markets and strategise accordingly. \"Such events allow brands to do test marketing which otherwise can be difficult,\" said Goyal.FMCG firms like Dabur, Reliance Consumer Products, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and ITC are betting big on Maha Kumbh to grab more eyeballs for their products amid a slowdown in broader industry sales. Some have installed big hoardings of their brands, some have set up product booths with most ramping up production to ensure adequate supply of products. Dabur has tied up with dhabas and eateries in the city and on the highways to get consumers to sample its digestive brands like Hajmola. The company is spending on brand activations-for instance, it is setting up changing rooms for women devotees at ghats, baby care rooms which will be branded with its hair care and baby care brands. \"Standing out in a crowded environment requires creativity and innovation. While the space may seem cluttered, it offers companies the opportunity to get consumers to touch, feel and experience their brands and build greater connect. This will generate sales in the days to come,\" said Mohit Malhotra, CEO at DaburIndia.Reliance Consumer Products, which has been sharpening its focus on the beverage portfolio is heavily advertising its brand Campa. It has set up a resting zone for pilgrims at the mela and branded it as Campa Ashram. The firm will also leverage the reach of Kumbh to market staples and snacks offered by its brand Independence. ITC will go local-it will serve consumers regional food that will be fused with products from its brand Bingo! Coca-Cola has adopted a somewhat similar strategy. \"We will be pairing our diverse portfolio of beverages with local foods and flavours bringing to life immersive experiences,\" said Greishma Singh, VP, marketing at Coca-Cola India and southwest Asia. PepsiCo's energy drink Sting has set up mobile charging towers for devotees besides branding auto rickshaws. \"Brands have always wanted to be where people are. It is the typical large CPG (consumer packaged goods) brands which have taken a first heads up opportunity in places like this. The outlay for such events is not yet as large as traditional media,\" said Kushal Sanghvi, chief revenue officer at iCubesWire.Every brand wants to capitalise on an event of a scale of that of Kumbh. Bank of Baroda is using the opportunity to market its new UPI payment PSP app Bob Epay.",

The Snake, symbolising wisdom and transformation, offers opportunities for personal growth and change.\n\nThe event, organised by the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Dubai, took place Saturday night at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai. This year marks the Emirates' eleventh Chinese New Year Gala celebration and the biggest in terms of venue size.\n\nDiverse performances\n\nPerformances included traditional Han Chinese opera songs, martial arts shows, poetry and songs, and jazz and hip-hop dances. The Spring Festival Gala showcased talent from all age groups, from toddlers to middle-aged artists, and celebrated diversity with international performers like Ukrainian singer Michael Brunsky, who impressed the audience with his near-flawless Mandarin rendition, earning rousing applause.\n\nJane Jiang, a Chinese expat living in the UAE for seven years, has been attending New Year festivities every year since moving here. She said that the event grows bigger and better every year.\n\n\"It's great to make it more international.

            "content": "Given the streak of controversies that plagued the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season, there was a need for changes to the rule book. Although NASCAR hasn\u2019t touched the playoff format so far, they listed out a series of major changes through which they will govern the events in 2025. Welcoming changes were made to the DVP policy, and OEMs were finally brought under the scope of being reprimanded over race manipulation tactics. But the waiver rule was the one that has caught the eyes of many race fans.\n\nThe playoff waiver is an exemption that NASCAR grants to drivers for missing a race for medical or emergency reasons. However, in recent history, the waiver provision has been used for more than just that. Kyle Larson opting to miss the Coca-Cola 600 race for his Indy 500 debut is what seems to be the reason behind the new changes. As soon as this rule change came out in public, it was dubbed as the Kyle Larson rule, and fans weren\u2019t happy with NASCAR trying to restrict his attempts to win the Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWas NASCAR justified in clamping down on drivers with changes to playoff waivers?\n\nThe Indy 500 race was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him to compete in this race, so despite a delayed start, he stayed and opted to miss the start of the Coca-Cola 600. But NASCAR\u2019s biggest star driver ditching NASCAR events to compete in other series wasn\u2019t a good look for the series. This is why the waiver drama spilled off in the way it did, and even Rick Hendrick had to get involved in this saga that went all the way up to Jim France.\n\nNow, this was a tough decision, and NASCAR did fancy themselves to be in this situation. So they made this new rule where drivers opting to miss the race and opting for a waiver will lose out on playoff points they earned in the regular season. Thus, the knockout stages with a base of 2,000. HMS fans didn\u2019t like this rule that singled out Kyle Larson, but they were forced to bring about this change.\n\nSharing a similar opinion, BrakeHard host said this on YouTube: \u201cThe problem with that is you decide to skip a race, run the Indianapolis 500, or whatever other race, and you get a waiver for it, and your penalty is you don\u2019t get any points for that race; that\u2019s not enough of a deterrent for these teams and drivers to just decide to do that at other times.\u201d\n\nvia Imago Syndication: The Indianapolis Star Jeff Gordon and Kyle Larson sit in the Arrow McLaren pit box Thursday, May 18, 2023, during the third day of practice for the 107th running of the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. , EDITORIAL USE ONLY PUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xKristinxEnzor/ForxIndyStarx 20692938\n\nA single race points deficit doesn\u2019t make a dent. We saw that despite missing the Coca-Cola 600 race, Larson almost won the regular season championship. So NASCAR needed a mechanism in place that would keep their drivers in check. There\u2019s a reason teams and NASCAR have a charter agreement in place, which also makes this situation sensitive. The rule clearly stated that drivers need to enter all 36 races to be eligible for the championship. Only medical and family emergencies were valid reasons to seek a waiver to compete in the playoffs.\n\nAlthough fans might disagree with this change, NASCAR needs its star drivers to prioritize NASCAR events over other racing events. \u201cI think it\u2019s something NASCAR had to do to deter people from doing it. Ultimately, NASCAR wants its stars racing in NASCAR. They don\u2019t want their stars skipping NASCAR races and go race in another series regardless of if it\u2019s the biggest race in the world or not,\u201d the host of the show added.\n\nIt\u2019s not just NASCAR; Hendrick Motorsport themselves have taken concrete steps to ensure they don\u2019t land in a similar situation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHMS and Larson will prioritize the NASCAR race despite his dream return to the Indy 500\n\nWith the drama and chaos that ensued after the waiver drama, it looked as if Larson\u2019s hopes of winning the Indy 500 were crushed. After all, only a team like Hendrick Motorsports could fuel his attempt to win the historic open-wheel race. But his dream got back on track when HMS announced that he would get a second bite at the Indy 500 race and settle his unfinished business.\n\nBut the big change this time around was that the veteran owner gave his word that Larson would prioritize the Charlotte race if weather interrupts racing at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. \u201cIt was unfinished business. Weather just cost us a lot. A second time, it\u2019s just not going to be the same case. NASCAR knows he\u2019ll be at the 600. We don\u2019t want to spot Reddick another entire race. My commitment is to NASCAR; that\u2019s where we\u2019re in; that\u2019s where we run for the championship.\u201d Rick Hendrick said during the announcement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSo both NASCAR and Hendrick Motorsports were on the same page well before the new waiver rule was rolled out. However, it will be interesting to see if Larson will ditch the race lead at the Indy 500 to be at Charlotte if there is a delay.",

For many, it would be nice to have a sizeable second income to call upon.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll explore how \u00a320k in savings could be put to work in the stock market in order to lay the foundations for such a sum.\n\nBeginning the journey\n\nAt last count, there were nearly 4m Stocks and Shares ISA accounts subscribed to in the UK.\n\nI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not more, to be honest. That\u2019s because these fantastic vehicles offer the chance to invest up to \u00a320k a year in shares, bonds, or funds without paying tax on returns, including income.\n\nConsequently, it\u2019s possible to build wealth much faster in a Stocks and Shares ISA. And this makes them a no-brainer for newbie investors, in my opinion.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future. The content in this article is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice. Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions.\n\nBut what return is realistic?\n\nAccording to the latest data, the average annual return for a Stocks and Shares ISA is just under 10%.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean all investors enjoy that return every year. The stock market doesn\u2019t go up in a straight line and individual shares do fall, while dividends aren\u2019t guranteed.\n\nFor example, the S&P 500 rose 23.3% during 2024. This was largely driven by shares related to artificial intelligence (AI), notably Palantir Technologies (up 360%) and Nvidia (+177%).\n\nIn total, 66% of stocks delivered positive gains for the year, which means 34% didn\u2019t. Clearly then, some people lose money in the stock market, while others generate much higher returns than the average.\n\nBut I think 10% is a realistic long-term target for most investors, as the ISA return figures demonstrate.\n\nWhat shares to consider buying?\n\nAn investor can buy dividend shares, growth stocks, or a combination of different types of stocks. In the latter group, I believe Coca-Cola HBC (LSE: CCH) is worth considering. I own shares myself.\n\nThe FTSE 100 company is a partner of The Coca-Cola Company. It manages bottling, distribution, and sales in 28 markets across Europe and Africa, while the US soda giant oversees branding and formulas.\n\nThere are a few things I like here. First, its portfolio of brands is unsurprisingly rock-solid, including Schweppes, Fanta, Sprite, Costa Coffee beverages, and of course Coke. These top-tier brands enable pricing power.\n\nSecond, despite high inflation and weak consumer spend, Coca-Cola HBC is still growing. This year, City analysts expect it to increase its earnings by around 10.7%. And this is expected to feed through to a 10% rise in the dividend. The forward yield is 3.35%.\n\nFinally, the valuation looks reasonable. Right now, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 13.5, broadly in line with the wider FTSE 100.\n\nOne risk worth mentioning is ongoing boycotts of well-known US brands in Muslim-majority countries due to America\u2019s support of Israel in Gaza. For the firm, these include Egypt and Bosnia.\n\nGetting to \u00a350k\n\nTwenty grand alone isn\u2019t enough to generate a sizeable second income, but it can lay the groundwork.\n\nIf an investor adds a further \u00a3500 a month, and reinvests dividends instead of spending them, then their ISA would grow to \u00a3833,821 after 25 years.\n\nAt this point, a portfolio yielding 6% could be throwing off \u00a350,029 a year in dividends.",

With a whopping 1.9 billion servings consumed daily, Coca-Cola might have the broadest reach of any company in the world.\n\nThe company has generated a total return, which includes dividends, of 25,770% in the past 50 years. This would've turned a $5,000 investment into over $1 million.\n\nBut investors rightfully care about the future. Could putting $5,000 into this beverage stock now make you a millionaire one day?\n\nA Buffett favorite\n\nLegendary capital allocator Warren Buffett is closely watched by many investors due to his impressive track record as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The conglomerate has long been a shareholder in Coca-Cola, today owning 9.3% of the company's outstanding stock.\n\nThat's a huge vote of confidence, and it's easy to understand. Coca-Cola's most important characteristic is its brand, giving it a great economic moat. The brand has incredible consumer mindshare thanks to the company's consistency, unrivaled distribution, and effective marketing tactics.\n\nThe brand helps drive pricing power. In the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Sept. 27, 2024), Coca-Cola unit volume dipped 1% year over year. But this was offset by 10% higher prices. That's nothing new, as consumers have historically proven their loyalty to the Coca-Cola brand.\n\nAnother reason to appreciate this business is its stability and durability. Coca-Cola's products are consumer staples, so the company's financials don't fluctuate much during changing macro conditions. And that can give shareholders peace of mind, especially in an economy that's constantly changing.\n\nWhat's more, Coca-Cola doesn't face much disruption. Investors can count on the company still being around 50 years from now. It's impossible to say that about the vast majority of businesses.\n\nAnd we can't ignore the company's impressive profits. In the past decade, Coca-Cola's operating margin has averaged a stellar 27%.\n\nThat profitability has benefited shareholders directly. Coca-Cola has raised its dividend, currently 3.19%, for 62 straight years, a tremendous feat that clearly shows management cares about its investors.\n\nShow me the returns\n\nCoca-Cola is a special business thanks to its brand, durability, and huge profits. Investors might wonder why they don't already own the company.\n\nBut consider that in the last decade, a long enough time to judge a stock's performance, Coca-Cola shares generated a total return of 97%. That's a disappointing showing given that the S&P 500 produced a total return of 258% during that same stretch.\n\nI believe this underperformance will continue in the decades ahead. Sales won't increase at a rapid clip, as this is a very mature company that operates in a low-growth industry. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, revenue will rise 4% in 2025 and 5% in 2026.\n\nThat's nothing to write home about, even if the future is better than the past. Revenue in fiscal 2023 was lower than in fiscal 2013, so there's no reason to believe Coca-Cola will soon experience fast growth.\n\nInvestors are being asked to pay a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.1 to buy shares of Coca-Cola right now. That represents a slight premium to the overall market. But it's in line with the stock's trailing-10-year average valuation. Shares look fully valued today based on historical data.\n\nInvesting $5,000 in Coca-Cola stock might make you a millionaire, but it could take another 50 years. Better to buy an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500.",

Investment bank analysts who follow the business closely think it's in better shape than its stock price suggests.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nOn Monday, Jan. 7, Michael Lavery at Piper Sandler initiated coverage of the beverage giant, with an overweight rating and a $74 price target. Lavery's new target implies a gain of about 20% from recent prices. On Tuesday, Jan. 8, TD Cowen upgraded its rating on Coca-Cola from hold to buy with a $75 price target.\n\nWall Street might be excited about Coca-Cola stock, but that doesn't necessarily make it a smart buy for your portfolio. Let's weigh some of the reasons it's been beaten down against the reasons Wall Street's bullish to see if it's right for you.\n\nWhy Coca-Cola's down\n\nShares of Coca-Cola have been under pressure since the company's CEO, James Quincey warned investors about \"a challenging operating environment\" in China, during the company's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nDuring the third quarter, unit case volume from the entire Asia-Pacific region fell 2% year over year. Unfortunately, Asia-Pacific isn't the only region that declined. The company also reported third-quarter unit case volumes that shrank by 2% year over year from operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIn addition to slightly declining case volume, the past few months have been generally rough for reliable dividend stocks. Markets expecting a combination of economic growth, higher inflation, and rising debts pushed yields on 10-year Treasury notes up by nearly a full percentage point since Coca-Cola stock peaked in September.\n\nCoca-Cola's dividend program is about as reliable as dividend programs get, but it can't hold a candle to securities backed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. When Treasury yields rise, stocks like Coca-Cola become a little less attractive.\n\nInvestors have been extra-sensitive about Coca-Cola's performance lately because its dividend doesn't leave much room for error. Over the past 12 months, Coca-Cola distributed dividend payments totaling $8.1 billion. Management only expects to report $9.2 billion in free cash flow in 2024.\n\nOver the past five years, Coca-Cola has only been able to raise its payout by 18.3%, which is less than the pace of inflation over the same period. In other words, the company's long-term shareholders are receiving lower payments now than they were a few years ago, once adjusted for inflation.\n\nWhy Wall Street's bullish for Coca-Cola stock\n\nOverall third-quarter unit case volume may have declined, but it didn't stop Coca-Cola's business from growing. Third-quarter organic revenues, which ignore the negative effects of a stronger dollar, rose 9% year over year.\n\nChina aside, rising incomes in emerging markets could be a tailwind. With internationally well-recognized beverage brands, there's a good chance Coca-Cola can keep growing in terms of sales and volume over the long run.\n\nThe past few months weren't the first time concerns about volume losses pushed down Coca-Cola's stock price, and it won't be the last. A dividend payout that keeps moving in the right direction could make holding on through the volatility a breeze.\n\nLast February, Coca-Cola raised its dividend payout for the 62nd consecutive year. At recent prices, the stock offers a 3.2% yield that's rising, albeit slowly.\n\nTime to buy?\n\nInvestors seeking rapid dividend growth or high yields up front probably want to keep looking. That said, Coca-Cola's dividend growth track record is long because its brands provide a valuable and durable advantage over the competition.\n\nRapid payout raises aren't likely, but, through the strength of its brands, Coca-Cola could continue raising its dividend faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual inflation target for at least the next decade. For income seekers with a very long time horizon, taking advantage of Coca-Cola's beaten-down stock price could be a smart move.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(Provided by the artist)\n\nHe never got on with his family and then was bullied when he reached fifth grade.\n\nKeito developed an aversion to people.\n\n\u201cI hardly talked about myself to my friends when I was in junior high school because I was afraid of being disliked,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a third-year student, Keito became so stressed out about his senior high school entrance exam that he could not sleep.\n\nHe was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which causes chronic fatigue and headaches.\n\nHe became unable to attend school after the start of second semester.\n\nIt was then that Keito discovered and became fascinated with photorealistic color pencil drawings on Twitter (now X) and wanted to draw them himself.\n\nIt seemed like an odd thing to want to do as his penmanship for writing kanji characters had been poor since he was a grade-schooler.\n\nHe was chastised by his teachers when he couldn\u2019t finish writing down what they had written on the blackboard by the end of class.\n\nBut Keito was adept at recreating shapes and colors. Art classes became his emotional support.\n\nWhen Keito draws, he works on a rough draft on a piece of A-4 size Kent paper with a smooth surface before adding colors using sharpened colored pencils.\n\nAt first, when he was unaccustomed to his new hobby, his drawings looked just like they were done with colored pencils. He also had trouble with mixing colors.\n\nBut through trial and error, Keito ended up using the technique of cross-hatching, which involves adding colors first vertically, then horizontally and finally diagonally.\n\nThe number of colors he used also increased from 10 to at least 30.\n\nThe first piece he shared on Twitter was a drawing of a diamond created using 40 or so colors.\n\nAlthough he was not satisfied with the drawing, it attracted likes in four-digit figures.\n\nKeito thought he could garner more likes if he tried harder.\n\nAfter finishing junior high school, Keito did a correspondence at high school and continued drawing every day, even when he worked part time at a bakery.\n\nKeito began gaining confidence a little over a year after he started creating colored pencil drawings.\n\nA three-dimensional drawing of a Coca Cola bottle he posted in fall of the year when he became a first-year senior high school student attracted an unprecedented response.\n\n\u201cThe transparent texture is wonderful,\u201d one Twitter user said, while another added, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly realistic.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola (Japan) Co. also praised his art through its official account, saying, \u201cThank you so much for drawing a great picture.\u201d\n\nKeito found it hard to believe that so many people were surprised by and appreciated his artwork.\n\n\u201cI had always thought I had no talent for anything, but finally I found something I could be proud of,\u201d the artist said.\n\nNow, he is stepping out of cyberspace to showcase his works.\n\nKeito\u2019s first solo exhibition featuring his original drawings was recently held at the Hirano Museum in Hamamatsu\u2019s Chuo Ward. The event closed on Dec. 22.\n\nKeito\u2019s first drawing of a diamond created with 40 or so colored pencils (Provided by the artist)\n\nInitially, Keito worried about how he should interact with visitors.\n\nBut his worries turned out to be unfounded.\n\nVisitors told him they were impressed by his artworks and that they felt happy.\n\n\u201cWe wanted visitors to see his pencil strokes first-hand and the warmth of his drawings that are not visible on the computer screen,\u201d said curator Kanon Miura.\n\nKeito said he keenly felt how museum visitors resonated more deeply with his photorealistic drawings than social media users.\n\nHe now is seeking more opportunities to showcase his works, not only on social media but also in an exhibition setting.",

Anthony also held various roles for Coca-Cola Enterprises \u2014 which sold its North American business to the Coca-Cola Company in 2010 \u2014 during a 15-year tenure with the company, including as its VP, CFO for the Americas and as its VP of investor relations and planning.\n\nHis successor Blickley joined Coca-Cola Consolidated in 2014 and has served as its SVP of FP&A and CAO since August 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prior to joining Coca-Cola, he served a three-year tenure at Family Dollar in roles including DVP, FP&A, and started his career at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nThe bottler did not specify Blickley\u2019s compensation as CFO in its Friday filing. In 2023, his predecessor Anthony received total compensation of approximately $2.7 million as finance chief, including a base salary of $594,347 and a bonus of $350,000, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy filing.\n\nThe financial leadership swap comes nine months after the company announced a stock buyback program in May 2024, aiming to purchase up to $3.1 billion of its common stock via both \u201ca modified \u2018Dutch auction\u2019 tender offer for up to $2.0 billion of its Common Stock and a separate share purchase agreement with The Coca\u2011Cola Company,\u201d the bottler said at the time.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is an ideal time to leverage the strength of our balance sheet by taking on a prudent amount of debt to return cash to stockholders and build long-term value,\u201d Chairman and CEO J. Frank Harrison III said in a statement at the time. Shortly after announcing the buyback, the bottler raised $1.2 billion in the blue-chip bond market in order to purchase the stock, marking \u201cthe first time the company has tapped the investment-grade dollar debt market with a public offering since 2015,\u201d according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe company followed up the buyback program with the announcement of a $1 billion share repurchase program in August, according to a release at the time, with CEO Harrison noting \u201cthe progress we\u2019ve made improving our profitability and strengthening our balance sheet allows us to reinvest in our business,\u201d per a statement.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated has seen steady growth over its past several quarters as it continues to improve its profitability. For its most recent quarter ended Sept. 27, the beverage bottling company reported $698 million in gross profit, a 5.5% increase from the prior year period, according to its earnings report. Net sales rose 3.1% to reach $1.8 billion for the quarter.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated declined to comment beyond the details in their press release and filing.",

From last year\u2019s (short-lived) Spiced flavor to a K-pop-inspired creation and even an Oreo collab, Coca-Cola has been keeping fans on their toes with new and unexpected flavors.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve got confirmation on the first new Coca-Cola flavor of the year, and while it\u2019s technically brand-new, it feels like a nostalgic nod to a discontinued fan favorite.\n\nNew Coca-Cola Orange Cream\n\nCoca-Cola has officially announced its latest flavor: Orange Cream. It\u2019s everything we love about the classic Coke, infused with a refreshing orange and smooth, creamy vanilla taste. The new fruit-forward flavor is coming in both original and Zero Sugar varieties.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the flavor sounds familiar, there\u2019s a good reason why. Back in 2019, Coca-Cola launched Orange Vanilla and Orange Vanilla Zero Sugar to its lineup. But much to fans\u2019 dismay, both varieties were quietly pulled from shelves in 2022, then disappeared from Freestyle machines just a few months ago.\n\nSo, this new orange-flavored variation couldn\u2019t be arriving at a better time. Fans of the original Orange Vanilla Coca-Cola are expecting it to serve as a worthy replacement. \u201cI loved Orange Vanilla, so hopefully this one lives up!\u201d one fan shared on Instagram. \u201cWhen they took away Orange Vanilla Coke, it broke my heart, but this should make up for it,\u201d added another.\n\nNow for the real question: what's the difference between Orange Vanilla and Orange Cream? Coca-Cola hasn\u2019t spilled the full details yet, but while some speculate marketing is the only differentiator, we\u2019d like to think the brand has something more interesting in store for its fans.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s also unclear whether the new addition will be permanent, but there is hope. After all, its predecessor was previously part of Coca-Cola\u2019s year-round lineup. If anything, the soda\u2019s summery flavor profile has us convinced it will at least stick around for the first half of the year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoca-Cola Orange Cream and Orange Cream Zero Sugar are set to hit shelves this February, so keep an eye out for any early arrivals in stores. With this sunny new soda flavor on the horizon, the winter months are already starting to feel a bit brighter.\n\nRead the original article on ALLRECIPES",

The strong two-year performance has left the index with a relatively expensive valuation.\n\nThe benefits of dividend stocks can be lost by the sound of a roaring market. But dividends can go a long way when the market is trading sideways or going down. Dividends are a way to book a return without selling stock, which can be helpful when equity prices are falling.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.46%), Unilever (UL -0.68%), and LyondellBasell (LYB 0.58%) all have sizable yields. Investing $2,000 into each stock should help generate $278 in passive income in 2025, assuming all companies keep their payouts at least as high as last year. Here's why all three dividend stocks are worth buying now.\n\nCoke benefits from global diversification\n\nCoca-Cola is a company that needs no introduction. But what you may not know is the extent of its beverage brand distribution network.\n\nCoke has bottling partners around the globe. These partners help Coke simplify its business and achieve incredibly high operating margins. With a trailing-12-month operating margin of 29.2%, Coke's margins are closer to a company like Apple (31.5% operating margin) than fellow beverage behemoth PepsiCo (14.4% operating margin).\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept. 27, 2024 -- Coke's most recently reported quarter -- North America made up less than half of global sales and just 28.7% of operating income. Meaning Coke's international business is now more important than its domestic business.\n\nOutside of flagship Coca-Cola, other notable brands owned by the company include Bodyarmor, Costa Coffee, Dasani, Fanta, Fuze, Gold Peak, Minute Maid, Powerade, Simply, Schweppes, Sprite, and Topo Chico, among others.\n\nCoke has 62 consecutive years of dividend increases, a 3.1% yield, a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.6, and a forward P/E of just 20.8 -- a discount to its historical median valuation.\n\nCoke's history of slow and steady growth, the expansion and effective marketing and distribution of its brands, and its ultra-reliable dividend make it a top dividend stock to consider in 2025.\n\nBy investing $2,000 in Coke, you can expect to earn about $62 in passive income in 2025.\n\nUnilever is a dirt-cheap dividend stock\n\nUnilever is a consumer packaged goods company with recognizable brands spanning several key categories. Beauty and Wellbeing includes Dove, TRESemme, and Vaseline. Personal Care features Axe, other Dove products like body washes, and more. Home Care features Domestos, Comfort, and others. Nutrition includes Hellmann's and Knorr. Ice Cream features Ben & Jerry's, Magnum, and other brands.\n\nUnilever is a balanced business, with each segment making up between 16% and 22% of product turnover in the company's most recent quarter. However, a big change could be coming later this year as Unilever moves to separate its ice cream segment as a stand-alone business.\n\nUnilever isn't the fastest-growing company, with a multiyear targeted underlying sales growth range of just 3% to 5% per year. However, the company does have solid operating margins of 17.4%, an inexpensive valuation with a P/E ratio of 20 and a forward P/E of just 17.4, and a high yield of 3.4%.\n\nA $2,000 investment in Unilever would earn you about $68 in dividend income this year.\n\nLyondellBasell has fallen far enough\n\nThe chemical giant's stock price has been crushed and is now hovering around a four-year low. One look at its operating margins, and it's easy to see why.\n\nSales are near a three-year low, and margins are at their lowest levels in the last decade. LyondellBasell isn't alone, as fellow commodity chemical giants Dow, BASF, and Celanese, and refiners Valero Energy, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum have also been selling off.\n\nHigher interest rates have been dragging on the broader industry. Higher capital costs can impact manufacturing and heavy industry -- key buyers of LyondellBasell's products. Higher interest rates also make it more expensive for LyondellBasell to take on debt to accelerate growth. However, the company has a solid balance sheet, with leverage ratios such as debt-to-capital and financial debt-to-equity at reasonable levels.\n\nThe main concern with investing in LyondellBasell is the reliability of its dividend payment. When the company is in growth mode, the dividend expense isn't as much of a burden. But with the business not at the top of its game, managing an expensive dividend payment is more challenging.\n\nThe company sports a whopping 7.4% dividend yield, or $5.36 per share. Trailing-12-month earnings are $6.59 per share. Consensus analyst estimates call for $8.00 in 2025 earnings per share. So, even with earnings down and an inflated yield, the company should still be able to fund its dividend with earnings. However, investors shouldn't expect meaningful dividend raises until the industry recovers.\n\nBased on the current payout, a $2,000 investment in LyondellBasell should earn you $148 in passive income in 2025.",

            "content": "Many Spotify users eagerly await the annual review of their listening habits shown in Spotify Wrapped. These end-of-year recaps are often considered a masterclass in personalised marketing and have helped the streaming company build brand loyalty and inspired other companies outside of the music sector to launch their own data-driven roundups.\n\nBut, in 2024, what fans unwrapped was a little underwhelming. Reddit users accused Wrapped 2024 of being \u2018AI-generated slop\u2019 \u2013 pointing to the made-up genres, such as \u201cPink Pilates Princess Strut Pop\u201d, as generative AI giveaways. Posts questioning its authenticity were widely shared on X. Similarly, Spotify\u2019s new Wrapped AI podcast feature, where AI podcast \u2018hosts\u2019 outline and comment on users\u2019 stats, left listeners cold.\n\nSpotify Wrapped was famously created by an intern. There\u2019s currently no code for that.\n\nSpotify wasn\u2019t the only brand to face backlash from fans due to uses of AI. Coca-Cola had a similar misfire with its AI-generated Christmas ad, which paid homage to its 1995 \u201cHolidays are coming\u201d commercial. The ad, which was created in collaboration with three AI studios, features AI-generated animals and red Coca-Cola lorries. But, instead of reviving the holiday magic of the original commercial, the AI advert sparked backlash online. Not only were the ethics of the endeavour questioned, the advert\u2019s quality was pulled apart and branded \u2018soulless\u2019 and \u2018devoid of any actual creativity\u2019.\n\nOf course, Spotify and Coca-Cola aren\u2019t alone in receiving criticism for outsourcing creativity to algorithms. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us provoked controversy with an AI-generated ad in April last year. Hipster movie production company A24, meanwhile, was called out for using AI to create promotional posters for Alex Garland\u2019s dystopian film Civil War. This week, the Labour Party has faced criticism for its TikTok video featuring AI-generated animals.\n\nThese examples aren\u2019t anomalies and they speak to a larger issue: a fundamental misunderstanding of how to use AI.\n\nAI is a double-edged sword\n\nIn the rush to embrace AI, brands risk leaving their critical-thinking skills behind. The public is more concerned with the outcome than the process. Most people aren\u2019t interested in whether the latest cutting-edge systems have been deployed if the result is clumsy, generic and flat.\n\nConsumers are becoming increasingly intolerant of AI-generated missteps, even from their favourite brands. This year\u2019s backlashes highlights a key risk for businesses adopting AI in 2025. Using automation in the wrong places has the power to turn your most loyal fans into vocal critics.\n\nUsing AI the right way\n\nBut using AI is not a mistake in itself, the problem is how brands choose to harness it. For example, generative AI cannot replace genuine human creativity \u2013 it is merely a mulch of previous human ideas. What made Spotify Wrapped genius wasn\u2019t its super-specific genres but its ability to encourage connection and reflection among users. There\u2019s currently no code for that.\n\nUsing AI in the wrong places can turn your most loyal fans into vocal critics\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that AI should automatically be removed from the creative sphere. There is a role for technology to play in this space. The key is to apply the right models to the right use cases. For instance, AI can be used to automate repetitive, low-value tasks, freeing up time for teams to focus on high-value, strategic initiatives. By leveraging AI in this way, businesses can enhance productivity, without delegating their most important tasks to tech that isn\u2019t suited to the task.\n\nIf brands want to reap the full benefit of AI, they should also take a closer look at their data. Successful AI models run on high-quality, well-governed data, so getting this in order should be top of the agenda for 2025. Businesses should be checking their data is accurately labelled and properly secured, ensuring sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it.\n\nAs adoption becomes more widespread, we\u2019re likely to see brands churn out more AI slop. But the future is not without hope. If businesses can learn from their peers\u2019 mistakes and apply AI in the right way, they\u2019ll have an opportunity to enhance their offering, rather than become an example of bad use cases. Wrapped 2024\u2019s end-of-year offering may have been as entertaining as receiving a lump of coal for Christmas, but if Spotify can learn from its misstep, it may prove the greatest gift yet.\n\nPaul Maker is chief technology officer at Aiimi.",

When Coca-Cola\u2019s Sprite discontinued its cranberry holiday flavor, Pepsi\u2019s Starry introduced a version. When Pepsi got Michael Jackson for its commercials, Coke countered with Paula Abdul. And, when Coca-Cola ran Super Bowl ads, Pepsi one-upped them by sponsoring the entire halftime show.\n\nOld feuds die hard, so it\u2019s no surprise that Pepsi is starting off the year with a little drama. Pepsi is releasing a new flavor that might remind fans of a beloved Coca-Cola offering discontinued in 2024.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Pepsi is debuting its new Wild Cherry & Cream flavor.\n\nPepsi Introduces Wild Cherry & Cream Soda\n\nAllrecipes/Pepsi\n\nPepsi\u2019s new Wild Cherry & Cream soda adds a sweet, indulgent twist to its fan-loved Wild Cherry flavor. The drink combines the tart, juicy taste of Wild Cherry Pepsi with a smooth, creamy finish.\n\nIt\u2019s like if Pepsi Wild Cherry and Pepsi Cream Soda or Pepsi Vanilla combined for an even sweeter new flavor.\n\nPepsi\u2019s launch comes nearly a year after Coke discontinued its Cherry Vanilla soda. So, if you\u2019ve been looking for a new creamy, sweet, cherry-flavored pop to satisfy your craving, you\u2019re in luck. Not only is Pepsi releasing the Wild Cherry & Cream flavor in both full and zero-sugar varieties, but it\u2019s also adding the soda to its permanent portfolio.\n\nUnlike its most recent limited-edition launch\u2014Pepsi Zero Sugar Gingerbread\u2014which was only available via TikTok Shop and a holiday giveaway, Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream and Pepsi Zero Sugar Wild Cherry & Cream 12-ounce cans will be sold at retailers nationwide for good. However, Pepsi is offering the new flavor, in both original and zero-sugar varieties, as 20-ounce bottles for a limited time.\n\nKeep an eye out for the new flavor in late January. But if you\u2019re curious for an early taste, here\u2019s my honest review.\n\nMy Honest Review\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a die-hard Wild Cherry Pepsi fan. My go-to is usually a Diet Pepsi, but if Wild Cherry is the only option, it\u2019s more than ok. That said, Wild Cherry Pepsi is officially moving to third on the list because Wild Cherry & Cream will be taking the second spot.\n\nPepsi\u2019s new Wild Cherry & Cream soda is, of course, reminiscent of Coke Cherry Vanilla, but I'd actually compare it more closely to Dr. Pepper\u2019s Strawberries & Cream soda. It has a similar burst of sweet, fruity flavor followed by a hint of vanilla. However, what I\u2019m a big fan of is the creamy mouthfeel that it provides. If you tried the Dr. Pepper Creamy Coconut pop over the summer, you'll know what I mean\u2014the creamy finish reminds me of a dirty soda but without any real cream.\n\nI only tried the full-sugar variety, but I\u2019m excited to try the zero-sugar version once it hits shelves in January. Pepsi is starting the year off with a bang, and its push to reclaim its spot as the second most popular soda in the U.S. is officially on.",

            "content": "Dividend Kings are an elite category of companies that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. But not all Dividend Kings have a schedule for making these raises.\n\nFor decades, Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) and Procter & Gamble (PG 0.13%) have raised their payouts in the first half of the calendar year. Here's why both Dividend Kings stand out as solid buys for 2025.\n\nCoke's next dividend raise should come in February or March\n\nCoke has paid and raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years. And like clockwork, for over 30 years in a row, it has announced a dividend raise in February or March.\n\nWhile the timing of the raises has been consistent, the size has varied. Coke has made minimum, $0.01 per share per quarter raises multiple times in recent years to keep its streak alive. The raises tend to be larger if Coke's business is doing better and it feels it can pass along more profits to shareholders. But Coke also wants to avoid digging itself into a hole that would make the dividend expense too much of a burden to support future raises.\n\nAlthough Coke passes the majority of profits along to shareholders through dividends, the company also retains some earnings so it can reinvest in the business, maintain a solid balance sheet, or possibly fund an acquisition with cash.\n\nAcquisitions have been an integral part of Coke's over 130-year history. The company has expanded far beyond soft drinks, with acquisitions such as Minute Maid in 1960, Vitaminwater in 2007, Honest Tea in 2011, a minority stake in Monster Beverage in 2015, Topo Chico in 2019, Costa Coffee in 2019, BodyArmor in 2021, and more. Not every acquisition has been a smashing success, but all told, I'd say Coke has done a decent job in deciding which companies to buy -- but a phenomenal job expanding the marketing and distribution of its brands. For example, Coke has compounded Topo Chico volumes by tenfold from pre-acquisition levels in 2016.\n\nWith a 3.1% yield and a 21.8 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Coke stands out as an excellent dividend stock to buy in 2025.\n\nExpect P&G to raise its dividend in April\n\nP&G has raised its dividend for 68 consecutive years, giving it one of the longest track records among Dividend Kings. Every year for the last 20 years, P&G has announced a dividend raise in April, usually before its fiscal third-quarter earnings announcement. The trend should continue in calendar year 2025.\n\nLike Coke, the timing of P&G's dividend increases is consistent, but the size of the raises can vary. The last raise was 7%. Before that, in order, each annual raise was 3%, 5%, 10%, and 6%. In general, I would pencil in a mid-single-digit dividend raise from P&G. But the company also buys back a considerable amount of stock. In fact, the size of its buyback program rivals its dividend expense.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Dividend expense $7.29 billion $7.44 billion $7.24 billion $7.31 billion $7.5 billion $7.79 billion $8.26 billion $8.77 billion $9 billion $9.31 billion Stock buybacks $4.6 billion $4 billion $5.2 billion $7 billion $5 billion $7.41 billion $11.01 billion $10 billion $7.35 billion $5.01 billion Total capital returned $11.89 billion $11.44 billion $12.44 billion $14.31 billion $12.5 billion $15.2 billion $19.27 billion $18.77 billion $16.35 billion $14.32 billion\n\nAs you can see in the table, P&G consistently repurchases a ton of stock. Over the last decade, it has spent a combined $146.49 billion on dividends and buybacks -- rewarding investors with passive income and reducing its share count by 12.8%.\n\nWhile some investors may prefer P&G scrap the buyback program and focus on dividends, it can be better for long-term investors to do a hybrid approach. By reducing the share count, buybacks artificially increase earnings per share (EPS), allowing EPS to grow faster than net income. Accelerated EPS growth can help justify a higher stock price and, in turn, higher capital gains over time.\n\nP&G has a dividend yield of 2.4% and a forward P/E of 24.1 -- making it more expensive than Coke. However, P&G could be a better buy for folks who prefer P&G's lineup of baby products, detergents, fabric care, grooming products, cleaning products, and personal care products over Coke's beverage brands.\n\nTwo dividend stocks you can count on no matter what 2025 brings\n\nCoke and P&G have recession-resistant business models, making them great buys for risk-averse investors in 2025. Coke and P&G sell relatively low-cost, daily use products far less dependent on the economic cycle than big-ticket discretionary items.\n\nSo, if there is an economic slowdown, you can rest easy knowing Coke and P&G have endured all kinds of market dynamics in the past and have still been able to raise their dividends no matter what the business cycle is doing.",

The company isn't afraid to experiment with new flavors, like the recent holiday offering of 7Up\u00ae Shirley Temple which the company called 'Newstalgia' in a Can. \"Our team loves the challenge of developing and marketing a beverage that evokes a deep sense of nostalgia with a modern twist, and the 7UP Shirley Temple does just that,\" said Andrew Springate, Chief Marketing Officer at KDP. \"Consumers will be delighted by this sweet reminder of the magic of childhood with a contemporary burst of flavorful refreshment.\"\n\nNo, Dr Pepper Wasn't Actually Created By a Doctor\n\nDr Pepper also has fantastic distribution thanks to the drink not competing as a cola against Coke and Pepsi, which means you can usually find Dr Pepper wherever Coke and Pepsi are sold. According to Dickow Gen Z and millennials want \"something different from the conventional cola flavor.\"\n\nKeurig Dr. Pepper also recently acquired the GHOST beverage brand of energy drinks, calling it a \"standout brand.\" \"I'm also excited to share that we recently signed a sales and distribution deal for Bloom's ready-to-drink energy beverages, which will have a female-forward positioning,\" says KDP's Chief Strategy Officer Justin Whitmore. \"We were impressed by the standout launch it had at Target this summer.\" And if you enjoyed this article, don't miss these 6 Best Drinks to Relieve Bloating Instantly.",

Following the loss of fan favourite Coca-Cola Cherry Vanilla, we count down to reveal the greatest Coca-Cola flavour of all time.\n\nFeeling thirsty? Read on to discover where your favourite Coca-Cola flavour comes on our list.\n\nOur ranking is based on the popularity of each flavour, taking into account sales, longevity and the reaction to the products at the time of their release.\n\n32. Coca-Cola Y3000 and Coca-Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar\n\nCourtesy of Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Y3000 and Coca-Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar launched in late 2023 to a fair amount of fanfare \u2013 not least because the limited-edition drink was made using artificial intelligence (AI). The company claimed that the new flavour offered fans a glimpse of the future \u2013 or a sample of what Coca-Cola would taste like at least. Feedback was mixed. Some praised the fruity taste of the drinks, highlighting that the background notes of vanilla and caramel worked well. Others said the flavour just wasn\u2019t exciting or impactful enough.\n\n31. Coca-Cola Spiced and Coca-Cola Spiced Zero Sugar\n\nCourtesy of Coca-Cola\n\nThe first permanent addition to The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s North American portfolio in three years saw the brand spicing things up a little. Seizing on the growing trend for all things sweet and spicy, Coca-Cola Spiced and Coca-Cola Spiced Zero Sugar were introduced in the US and Canada in February 2024. While the exact ingredients in the drinks remained a closely guarded secret, fans were quick to note that, despite the name, neither delivered a huge amount of fiery heat, with raspberry cited as the most prominent flavour. Inevitably, the styles have since been discontinued.\n\n30. Coca-Cola Energy\n\npixinoo/Shutterstock\n\nOriginally launched in Spain and Hungary in 2019, Coca-Cola Energy quickly became available across the globe, eventually landing in the US in 2020. Hoping to appeal to lovers of energy drinks, it offered a new take on the brand\u2019s already heavily caffeinated beverage, but it didn\u2019t prove to be successful. It was soon discontinued in the US, with other countries later following suit.\n\n29. Coca-Cola Bl\u0101k\n\nLike_the_Grand_Canyon/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nThe brand\u2019s first foray into coffee drinks, Coca-Cola Bl\u0101k was introduced in France, the US and Canada in 2006. Its intended audience was apparently the savvy, sophisticated over-30s set, but the drink never took off with them \u2013 or anyone else, for that matter. The plug was pulled on the energy-boosting beverage just a few years later.\n\n28. New Coke\n\nadrigu/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nIn April 1985, The Coca-Cola Company released an updated version of its classic drink, known unofficially as \u2018New Coke\u2019. The change was so unpopular a return to the original formula was announced just a few months later. The retro soda resurfaced in 2019 in collaboration with Netflix's Stranger Things and was described as being sweeter and less fizzy than the flagship drink.\n\n27. Coca-Cola Plus\n\ncocacola_japan/Instagram\n\nA Japan exclusive, Coca-Cola Plus launched in 2017 and was essentially regular Coke with an extra 0.2oz (5g) of dietary fibre. The addition of the indigestible dextrin was said to give the drink a thicker texture, which many considered a small trade-off for the fact that it claimed to reduce the body's ability to absorb fat from food.\n\n26. Coca-Cola Life\n\nMike Mozart/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nCoca-Cola Life first arrived in shops in 2014 and contained the natural sweetener stevia instead of aspartame, becoming the first drink in the main Coca-Cola range to make use of the ingredient. At its peak it was available in more than 30 countries, but was scrapped in the UK in June 2017, eventually coming off global shelves for good in 2020 due to low sales.\n\n25. Diet Coke Plus\n\nLike_the_Grand_Canyon/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nBranded as a 'healthy' energy drink, Diet Coke Plus made its debut in the UK in October 2007 with two versions: one with added B3, B12 and vitamin C, and the other enriched with green tea and vitamin C. It also landed in Belgium and the US the same year, but drew attention from the FDA, which said that there were too few nutrients to justify the word \u2018plus\u2019 in the product name.\n\n24. Coca-Cola Orange\n\nRalph, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nCoca-Cola Orange has been available around the world over the years and enjoyed particular popularity in countries such as Japan, Turkey and Brazil. Presented in an opaque orange bottle, the drink has been compared to Mezzo Mix, a cola and orange concoction sold in Europe and also made by The Coca-Cola Company. A similar product, Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla, was released in the US in 2019, only to be phased out by 2022.\n\n23. Coca-Cola Citra\n\nUsodesita/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nThe strikingly packaged Coca-Cola Citra was first available to buy in Japan in 2006. It\u2019s similar to \u2013 but not to be confused with \u2013 Citra, a predominantly grapefruit-flavoured drink that came in a yellow can and was sold by Coca-Cola in India in the 1980s and 1990s, and in the US in the 1990s. This version infuses classic Coca-Cola with notes of lemon and lime.\n\n22. Coca-Cola Lime\n\nE4024, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nCitrussy Coca-Cola Lime first made an appearance in the US and UK in 2005 and launched in Romania in 2016. By 2018, though, the drink had been removed from shelves in the US, with fans now only able to purchase it from the brand\u2019s touchscreen soda fountains known as Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. The fruity flavour was also discontinued in the UK in 2007, but has since made a reappearance in supermarkets following a 17-year hiatus.\n\n21. Diet Coke with Splenda\n\nThe.Comedian/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nThe soft drinks giant took its already popular diet variety to new heights with the launch of Diet Coke with Splenda in 2005. A tasty alternative, it was a great option for those who were allergic to aspartame, with some fans claiming it tasted better than the original Diet Coke. The style was exclusively available in the US and graced supermarket shelves for 19 years before the brand sadly discontinued the variety in 2024.\n\n20. Diet Coke Citrus Zest\n\nImprezes, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLaunched in 2007, Diet Coke Citrus Zest ended up being hugely popular. The bottle was sold in the UK and featured a zippy combination of lemon and lime flavours. Unfortunately for fans, the variety was discontinued without any warning in 2018, and devotees have been yearning for its revival ever since.\n\n19. Coca-Cola with Lemon\n\nLike_the_Grand_Canyon/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nA zingy take on original Coke, Coca-Cola with Lemon was introduced in the US in 2001 to compete with Pepsi Twist. A diet version was also available, but both failed to make an impact and were discontinued a few years later. Other exotic flavours (including Twisted Mango and Ginger Lime variations) appeared in 2018, but have since been phased out too.\n\n18. Coca-Cola Clear\n\nRuslan Kokarev/Shutterstock\n\nLaunched in 2018 in Japan, translucent Coca-Cola Clear lacks the distinctive caramel colour and flavour of the original product. The lemony drink has zero calories and is more than slightly reminiscent of 1990s favourite, Crystal Pepsi. A lime-flavoured variation known as Coca-Cola Clear Lime has also been available in Japan since 2019, though there are currently no plans to bring the drink to other markets.\n\n17. Coca-Cola Plus Coffee\n\ncocacolasouthafrica/Facebook\n\nOne of the brand\u2019s biggest launches in recent years, Coca-Cola Plus Coffee blends both beverages in one drink. It contains more caffeine than a normal can of Coke, but claims to have less than your average cup of coffee. First trialled in Japan in 2017, Coca-Cola Plus Coffee was available in more than 30 markets by 2020, proving to be a hit in Australia in particular. After years of testing it was eventually launched in the US in 2021, but was discontinued the following year.\n\n16. Coca-Cola Ginger\n\ntheimpulsivebuy/Flickr [CC BY-SA 2.0]\n\nCreated in response to an increase in popularity of ginger beer and aimed at those with \u2018curious taste buds', Coca-Cola Ginger made its debut in Australia and New Zealand for a limited time in the summer of 2016. However, the fiery new product failed to catch on, with some complaining it just wasn\u2019t gingery enough.\n\n15. Diet Coke Twisted Mango\n\nSheila Fitzgerald/Shutterstock\n\nIn one of Coca-Cola\u2019s biggest branding change-ups to date, the soft drink heavyweight released four new Diet Coke flavours in the US in 2018: Twisted Mango, Zesty Blood Orange, Feisty Cherry and Ginger Lime. The shake-up aimed to attract younger consumers, who were increasingly opting to sip sparkling water over soda. Twisted Mango was generally considered the best of the bunch, but while you can still find cans online, the range appears to have been quietly discontinued.\n\n14. Coca-Cola Zero\n\nVox Efx/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nMaking its debut in 2005, Coca-Cola Zero was one of the brand's most successful flavour launches for over a decade. Despite its popularity, however, it was discontinued in 2017 and replaced with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar \u2013 a new formula intended to taste more like classic Coca-Cola. Despite the new option being a hit with many, some fans continue to call for Coca-Cola Zero's revival.\n\n13. Coca-Cola Peach\n\nLike_the_Grand_Canyon/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nAiming to combine the delicious juiciness of the stone fruit with the brand\u2019s classic caramel flavour, Coca-Cola Peach launched in Japan in 2018 and quickly became a popular choice for many. The variety went on to become available in many countries including the UK and Poland. In the US, a similar style became available in 2018 \u2013 inspired by Georgia\u2019s state fruit, it was named Georgia Peach Coke.\n\n12. Coca-Cola Light Sango\n\nJos\u00e9 Roitberg/Flickr [CC BY-NC-ND 2.0]\n\nA blood orange\u2013flavoured drink available in both France and Belgium, Coca-Cola Light Sango was the first Coca-Cola drink developed outside of the company\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. It was apparently given its catchy name in reference to the French word for blood: sang. Despite its zippy flavour, the drink was discontinued in 2008.\n\n11. Coca-Cola Plus Catechin\n\nDavid McKelvey/Flickr [CC BY-NC-ND 2.0]\n\nOnly in Japan are you able to find this particular version of Coca-Cola: Coca-Cola Plus Catechin. Aimed at health-conscious soda sippers, the innovative green tea\u2013flavoured drink went on sale in 2009 and, as the name suggests, contains catechins (antioxidants found in green tea). Despite being popular in Japan, it hasn't ever been made available in other countries.\n\n10. Coca-Cola Cinnamon\n\nBystrov/Shutterstock\n\nThis cult favourite first appeared as a limited-edition festive flavour for Christmas 2019. It proved such a hit that Coca-Cola re-released it the following year. Considering cinnamon is one of the major flavour notes in the original drink, the addition makes perfect sense and fans praised the warming, spicy taste. Despite being off shelves for three years, the brand relaunched the flavour in the UK for a short time for Christmas 2024.\n\n9. Coca-Cola Raspberry\n\nLike_the_Grand_Canyon/Flickr [CC BY-NC 2.0]\n\nThis fruity product first materialised in New Zealand in 2006, only to be revived again 10 years later. In an unexpected development, it then crossed the globe; a zero-sugar version arrived on shelves in the UK in 2019, much to the delight of die-hard Coca-Cola fans. These days, though, the only remaining place to find the flavour is in Coca-Cola Freestyle touchscreen soda fountains.\n\n8. Coca-Cola Starlight\n\nBilly F Blume Jr/Shutterstock\n\nHaving already taken over the world, The Coca-Cola Company set its sights on other galaxies in 2022 \u2013 sort of. As part of its Coca-Cola Creations initiative, which was intended to appeal to younger consumers thanks to the experimental flavours, the space-inspired Coca-Cola Starlight was available for a limited time across North America and in select countries around the globe. The drink had a reddish hue and was intended to give a cooling sensation that evoked the feeling of journeying into space. Fans described it as tasting like strawberries and cotton candy.\n\n7. Coca-Cola Cherry Vanilla\n\nMDV Edwards/Shutterstock\n\nCombining two of the most popular Coke varieties to delicious effect, Coca-Cola Cherry Vanilla was introduced in 2020 (alongside a zero-sugar version) and was apparently inspired by the many customers who mix the two flavours at Coca-Cola\u2019s Freestyle soda fountains. While it was one of the soft drink company's core flavours, it was sadly discontinued in late 2023 much to the dismay of loyal fans.\n\n6. Coca-Cola Apple\n\ncocacolapark/Facebook\n\nBack in autumn 2019, Coca-Cola Japan launched a limited-edition apple-flavour drink. Quickly becoming a popular choice with the brand's devotees, it was loved for its vibrant fruity flavour and unique red and gold bottle design. Coke fans called for the soda to be made available globally, but unfortunately it was never released outside of Japan.\n\n5. Coca-Cola Vanilla\n\nErvins Strauhmanis/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nRemaining a much-loved flavour to this day, Coca-Cola Vanilla initially went on sale in the US in 2002, and in the UK a year later. But it was discontinued as quickly as it was launched, disappearing from shelves by the end of 2005 to make way for Black Cherry Vanilla Coke. Much to the delight of the Coca-Cola-loving public, Coca-Cola Vanilla returned to the US for a limited time in 2023 to mark its anniversary and continues to be available today.\n\n4. Diet Coke\n\nfocal point/Shutterstock\n\nUnveiled in July 1982, Diet Coke was the first new brand to use the Coca-Cola trademark since Coca-Cola's creation in 1886, and the drink quickly overtook the company's existing diet cola, Tab, in sales and popularity. Over the years, Diet Coke has gained a massive cult following, with fans raving about the fresh, thirst-quenching taste; others, however, criticise the very strong aspartame flavour. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was introduced in 2021 and is generally considered to taste more like original Coca-Cola.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nFoodAndPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nThe original, culturally iconic Coca-Cola has been delighting fans with its unique, hard-to-describe flavour and perfect fizz for over a century. Originally marketed as a temperance drink, it was invented in 1886 by John Pemberton, a doctor and pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia, who cooked up the formula in his backyard. Today it\u2019s sold in more than 200 countries worldwide, with fans drinking more than 1.9 billion servings each day. For many, classic Coca-Cola simply cannot be beaten, although we think a few of its variations might be even better\u2026\n\n2. Mexican Coke\n\nMike Mozart/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nMade with cane sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup, Mexican Coke, or MexiCoke, was first produced in the 1920s. Fans praise it for the distinct buzz that the real sugar hit delivers. The drink can be found throughout Mexico, as well as in select US restaurants, having become something of a hipster choice in recent years. It's identifiable by its packaging and is always sold in the brand's old-style glass bottles.\n\n1. Coca-Cola Cherry\n\nMike Mozart/Flickr [CC BY 2.0]\n\nOne of the oldest Coke flavours, Coca-Cola Cherry (often simply called 'Cherry Coke') was launched in 1985, making its debut in the US. Its popularity spread and at its height it was available in 36 countries, including the UK, Ireland, China and Switzerland. The drink has a strong UK following; in 2018, British fans became upset following (false) rumours that the drink had been discontinued. These days, it's a Coca-Cola staple all over the world \u2013 and is considered by many to be far superior to the original.\n\nNow discover the greatest Oreo flavours of all time\n\nLast updated by Lottie Woodrow.",

While it is still impossible to say how much time and money it will take to rebuild, one Palestinian activist has plans to piece one small part of it back with the help of a soft drink.\n\nOsama Qashoo, the creator of Gaza Cola, hopes to use profits from his Coca-Cola alternative, recently launched in London, to rebuild al Karama hospital, which used to stand in northern Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s been reduced to rubble for no just reason, like all of these hospitals in Gaza,\u201d according to the 43-year-old film-maker, human rights advocate and, now, fizzy-drink maker.\n\nQashoo has chosen that hospital because, relatively speaking, \u201cit\u2019s small, it\u2019s quite manageable, it doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money\u201d. He could not put a figure on how much that would mean, or when it might happen, but, he said, \u201cwe are allowed to have an imagination \u2026 we have to dream, otherwise we can\u2019t live\u201d.\n\nHe is already looking into the best medical equipment and the design, right down to the lighting, but for the time being they have built a field hospital in another location in Gaza using the parachutes left behind from aid airdrops for makeshift shelter.\n\nQashoo first had the idea for Gaza Cola in November 2023. The red can features the Palestinian flag, \u201cGaza Cola\u201d written in Arabic calligraphy, and a pattern riffing on the Palestinian keffiyeh, the scarf often worn as a symbol of resistance.\n\nIronically not himself a fan of fizzy drinks, Qashoo identifies Gaza Cola as a vehicle for a message. It is, he said, \u201ca statement to all these corporate companies who are investing in armed trade. To ask them the question of dignity. Do you see what your money\u2019s doing? Because it is doing damage. It is destroying homes and our environment \u2026 they need to wake up and they need to understand that their money, their greed, is causing our genocide\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2001, he co-founded the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) and was involved in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in 2010. Originally from Nablus in the West Bank, he has been living in the UK since he was forced to flee Palestine more than 18 years ago \u2013 he was shot, imprisoned and tortured by occupation forces. Last year he opened Palestine House, a political and cultural hub in central London for Palestinians \u2013 where they can be \u201cPalestinian unapologetically\u201d \u2013 and their supporters.\n\nCoca-Cola, which BDS calls to boycott, reportedly operates facilities in occupied East Jerusalem. Qashoo views the company as \u201crepresentative of all the big corporations who actually don\u2019t care about the human being\u201d. It is not the first time Coca-Cola, along with other major western food and drinks companies, have been the target of calls for boycott \u2013 McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were among the brands criticised for continuing to operate in Russia after it launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoycotts of Coke and Pepsi in countries across the Middle East have already proved to be good news for local soft-drink brands, and Qashoo hopes people will get into the habit of drinking Gaza Cola instead of the big brands. \u201cIf you want to drink cola and you like it, what about this one? It\u2019s an alternative.\u201d\n\nIt had sold more than 500,000 by the end of last year \u2013 online, a 24-pack costs \u00a330 and a six pack costs \u00a312 \u2013 and is being bought wholesale and shipped all over the UK, as well as farther afield, including to Spain, Australia, South Africa and Kuwait. But Qashoo\u2019s friends and family in Gaza and the West Bank, whom he says would love to try it, are, he says, unlikely to get the chance.\n\nCoca-Cola did not respond to a request to comment.",

Whatever idiom suits your fancy, but the message is still the same.\n\nI was still holding on to some naive hope that we wouldn\u2019t get to this point. The writing had been on the wall for awhile now, but I thought that there was still a chance that, if enough people continued to push back at both the disturbing look of it and the gross injustice of its production, the wheels of capitalism might hopefully shift in the right direction.\n\nBut then I saw it. I was sitting on my parents couch, innocently watching a college football game, when it assaulted my eyes. For thirty straight seconds, Coca-Cola decided to subject me to a horror that insulted both my intelligence and my four summers of dedicated service to put their products on the shelves of County Market and Walmart.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft often is vague in his descriptions of the Eldritch monstrosities, a technique utilized to help illustrate the fact that these horrors are beyond the capabilities of humans to describe using words. Similarly, I find it difficult to put a description of this Coca-Cola ad to paper\u2026perhaps this is what being an unfortunate protagonist in one of Lovecraft\u2019s tales is like.\n\nStill, for any of this to make any sense, I must try my best. For what I witnessed was a commercial like no other, but I fear others of its ilk will become all too commonplace. It was, as the text at the bottom of the screen proclaimed, an ad made by Real Magic AI, a hilariously ironic name given that nothing on screen was remotely \u201creal\u201d and very debatably \u201cmagic\u201d (though, unfortunately, very \u201cAI\u201d).\n\nThe first three shots suggest nothing is afoot, luring you in as a quick pass at a bottle of Coke being opened and two landscape shots fall into the wheelhouse of what current AI is capable of for the second they are on screen. But then, just as quickly, a disgusting image of what is supposed to be an elk or a reindeer appears on screen, instantly shattering any sort of disbelief the opening shots may have suspended. It is wholly unnerving, the way this animal moves jankily while half the snowflakes \u201cfall\u201d upwards in soft focus around it. The polar bear that has become synonymous with Coca-Cola Christmas ads then appears in the next shot, its eye shape wobbling in and out of existence as it bursts out of the water. Then, horribly deformed trucks strung with Christmas lights set out to deliver disgusting AI Coca-Cola to this AI world, their wheel wells threatening to break this facade of reality with just how extremely horrible they look in motion. The ad also drags poor puppies into fray, creating a disturbing facsimile of a golden retriever and begging its audience to believe that it is real. Somehow, only half the commercial has passed, and I feel ill. It feels like I am watching the death of the universe, only with seven-eighths of it out of focus so you can\u2019t tell how fake everything looks. But the mind-bend-ing trucks continue their journey across this God-forsaken simulation of Earth and I slide further into despair. Finally, the attack on my retinas ends, with Coca-Cola proudly proclaiming \u201cReal Magic\u201d under its logo, still without a sniff of irony despite what just happened over the last 30 seconds.\n\nI cannot believe what I just saw. Surely\u2026no, surely one of the richest companies in the world wouldn\u2019t put out something like \u201cthis.\u201d There was no way this slop could have made its way through the corporate labyrinth of pitch meetings and focus groups, right?\n\nEven now, weeks later, its imagery haunts me. I cannot get that elk/reindeer out of my head, nor the morphing Coca-Cola trucks treading through some snowy suburban neighborhood that has never existed but was rather constructed from a million images of snowing suburban neighborhoods.\n\nBut, as disturbing as the commercial itself was, it was what it represented that is the true horror. The fact that the megacorporation Coca-Cola made something as completely soulless as this ad during Christmas\u2026well, if that doesn\u2019t speak for itself, I don\u2019t know what will. In the endless pursuit of profits, this company decided to forgo utilizing real human ingenuity and creativity and opted to have a computer make something instead. Worse yet, they thought that their audience would neither notice, nor care. And\u2026perhaps the scariest of all is that they may be right.\n\nThe number of horrible AI created images that I\u2019ve seen on social media is astounding, and yet, they continue to get thousands of likes and shares. Netflix has used AI to create backgrounds for some of its animated shows. This commercial was likely seen by millions, and a company worth over $250 billion thought they could sell even more syrup water by showing it to them. So, I\u2019m left to wonder, do we really lack the media literacy to tell what is real or what is not, or do we just not care?\n\nMachine learning is an impressive technology. It has many applications that can make many mundane or time consuming tasks easier and, as it gets better, hopefully it will be utilized for those purposes. But right now, it is being used as a shortcut for pursuits it is both ill-equipped to handle at this time and, I would argue, are better off left in the hands of humans anyway. AI art, without truly machine sentience, cannot be any more than wholly and truly derivative. But there is money to be made, so money must be made.\n\nWe are rapidly approaching the point of no return\u2026or maybe we\u2019ve just whizzed right past it. It\u2019s hard to tell with how blurry all these AI images are. All I know is that if I have to be subjected to some company trying to sell me fizzy drinks, I\u2019d feel a bit better knowing someone was at least paid to animate the CGI polar bear attempting to do it.\n\nA C ERTAIN POINT OF V IEW\n\nBY\n\nNATHANIEL U NDERWOOD REPORTER",

Courtesy of Zach Hinkle\n\nZach Hinkle didn\u2019t have any 30-point games or game-winning baskets during his Edwardsville High School basketball career, but the lessons he learned at EHS more than make up for the lack of dazzling statistics.\n\nA 2009 EHS graduate, Hinkle played basketball for longtime Tigers coach Mike Waldo. He lives in Atlanta with his wife Laura and works for Coca-Cola at their corporate headquarters as Director of Field Commercialization for The McDonald\u2019s Division.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhere Are They Now? Each month, the Edwardsville Intelligencer will release a \u201cWhere Are They Now?\u201d story about former student-athletes from Edwardsville High School or Metro-East Lutheran. If there is a former student-athlete you would like to know about, please e-mail Scott Marion at smarion@edwpub.net.\n\n\u201cHaving worked for Coca-Cola for more than ten years, there was a great opportunity for me to further my professional development at our company\u2019s headquarters. I\u2019m so fortunate to have a partner willing to support me along my career journey,\u201d said Hinkle, who got married in September of this year and moved to Atlanta in November of 2023.\n\nHinkle has officially been with Coca-Cola for 11\u00bd years starting as a campus ambassador for the company for three semesters at the University of Illinois.\n\nAt EHS, Hinkle\u2019s varsity basketball experience consisted of 11 points in nine games during his senior season in 2008-09 when the Tigers posted a 22-6 record and earned a regional title.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBut like many Edwardsville players over the years, Hinkle played a valuable role as one of the Tigers\u2019 scout team players, helping the varsity regulars prepare for upcoming opponents.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot about preparation from coach Waldo and that preparation was the key to his success,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cThere is a certain level of expectation that he has for every player and if you\u2019re on the scout team, you\u2019re mirroring the stylistic play of the opposition.\n\n\u201cWhen you play for Coach Waldo, every role on the team is equally important to your success. That\u2019s something that all the guys on the scout team took a lot of pride in.\u201d\n\nWhile Hinkle\u2019s varsity playing time was limited, he will always be grateful for the support shown from the Tiger fanbase. \u201cWE WANT UNO\u201d became a popular chant from the student section in the closing minutes of most games and when his number got called, there was a raucous reception from the crowd (Hinkle donned No. 1 his senior year).\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMuch more important than the fanfare is Waldo\u2019s influence on him which cannot be overstated.\n\n\u201cI credit coach Waldo for helping me become the person I am now,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cI carried the values he instilled in me through college as well as my professional career. He taught us that you don\u2019t necessarily have to be the highest point scorer to be a leader.\n\n\u201cCoach Waldo did a great job of making sure every player on his team felt valued and had a role that contributed to the greater good of the team and what we were trying to achieve. He was an incredible mentor, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for having as many years under his leadership as I did.\u201d\n\nThe 2008-09 Tigers, led by Will Triggs, James Edmond, Ismiah Roundtree and Richard Siebers, beat Alton 40-38 to win the Class AA Granite City Regional. Edwardsville\u2019s season ended with a 75-65 loss to Belleville East in the semifinals of the Collinsville Sectional.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe would challenge those guys in practice and try to contain \u2018Ish\u2019 (Roundtree) or Richard Siebers from getting off a 3-point shot,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cWe would try to stop Tommie Anderson from penetrating to the hole or try to get around a screen set by Will Triggs. That wasn\u2019t easy, but we enjoyed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of that team and the relationships that we still have to this day. Those are strong bonds, and I talk to several of those guys on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Edwardsville, Hinkle went on to Illinois, where he majored in political science with a minor in business. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity along with several fellow EHS graduates. As a Campus Ambassador for Coca-Cola, Zach was responsible for running on-campus marketing initiatives for the company.\n\n\u201cFollowing my time as a Campus Ambassador, the connections I made allowed me to move back to St. Louis and start my career with Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHinkle spent five years with the company in St. Louis and spent four years between Dallas, Los Angeles, and Tampa before going to Atlanta.\n\nHinkle met his wife, who is from the Philadelphia area, in Dallas while he was working there for Coca-Cola. She was in Dallas to pursue her master\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cWe met in February of 2020, and it was a really short honeymoon phase that went right into quarantine during the (COVID-19) pandemic,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cLaura played field hockey and lacrosse at Union College (in Schenectady, New York), so we\u2019re two competitive people. We enjoy playing pickleball and golf together.\n\nFor Hinkle, there is seldom a day that goes by when he doesn\u2019t reflect on his experiences as a scout team basketball player at EHS, and his Edwardsville connection remains as strong as ever.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWhen I think about what has made me successful in my career, I look back at the time I spent as a member of that Tigers squad and being a team player and finding ways to win and to contribute,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cI do everything I can to put our people in a position where they can be successful.",

            "content": "Joriki Beverages, a Canadian contract beverage manufacturer, has abruptly closed its processing plant in Pittston, Pennsylvania, leaving more than 200 employees without jobs. The closure, which occurred just after the New Year, has shocked workers who were expecting to return to work after the holiday break. Instead, they received termination emails on New Year's Eve, notifying them of their immediate layoffs.\n\nThe Pittston plant, which was Joriki's only processing facility in the United States, produced beverages for major brands like Welch\u2019s and Coca-Cola.\n\nJoriki, which had been struggling financially for several months, did not issue the usual 60-day notice of layoffs as required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The company cited \"unforeseen business circumstances\" for not providing the proper notice. In letters sent to employees and the state Department of Labor and Industry, Joriki stated that it had been actively pursuing a transaction that could have helped save the plant and jobs. However, the potential deal fell through just before Christmas, leading to the sudden financial crisis.\n\nJoriki also noted that its major customer and primary lenders had been providing financial support, but after the failed transaction, they decided to stop funding the company\u2019s operations. \u201cUnfortunately, on Dec 23, 2024, the potential buyer advised it did not intend to proceed with a transaction. Following this, Joriki\u2019s major customer and lenders advised they would no longer fund Joriki\u2019s ongoing operations,\u201d the company\u2019s letters explained. This sudden financial collapse left the company with no choice but to shut down the facility.\n\nLocal officials were also left in the dark about the closure. Kyle Rozitski, administrator for Pittston Township, said the first word of the shutdown came from the media. The plant's abrupt closing without notice from Joriki has raised concerns about the potential violations of the WARN Act.\n\nAs workers scramble to file for unemployment insurance and seek new employment, many are left wondering what led to the closure and whether Joriki will face legal or financial consequences for not adhering to the required notice protocol. Joriki's Pittston plant closure follows a tumultuous few months for the company, which had already faced significant challenges, including a deadly listeria outbreak at its Canadian facility that was linked to plant-based milks in 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s future remains uncertain, with many workers now left to deal with the consequences of the sudden shutdown.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nAs retirement approaches, ensuring financial stability becomes increasingly important for investors. Among the available investment options, consistent dividend payments are especially attractive due to their dependability and security. Dividends, which represent a portion of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, provide a reliable income stream.\n\nDividend stocks are well-suited for retirees because they also offer protection during challenging times. A report by Morningstar highlighted that dividend-stock funds were well-prepared to endure the tech stock crash from 2000 to 2002, as they had minimal exposure to the sector. During that period, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index suffered a cumulative loss of nearly 44%, largely due to significant declines in its growth stocks, whereas dividend stock funds experienced only about a third of that loss.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Best January Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDue to their solid long-term performance in the past, dividend stocks are becoming a vital part of a well-rounded retirement portfolio for many investors. Strategically chosen dividend-paying stocks can offer stability during market declines and enhance gains during upswings by providing regular income that helps mitigate losses and amplify returns. In addition, they offer a hedge against inflation, which has become a growing concern due to rising costs of essentials like food and energy. Several top-performing companies have consistently increased their dividend payouts over decades. David Giroux, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price who oversees the firm's capital appreciation strategy, shared insights on dividend stocks in an interview with Barron\u2019s. Below are some of his remarks:\n\n\u201cTo have a retirement portfolio that has a significant component of stocks with attractive dividends makes a tremendous amount of sense. If the average company in the market can grow its earnings at 7% to 8% a year, your dividends should be growing at a similar rate.\u201d\n\nAnalysts point out that while income and growth are crucial for retirees to maintain financial stability during a potentially long retirement, this approach has its limitations and may not be suitable for everyone. They advise building a portfolio that is diversified across various sectors and includes companies with strong cash reserves to support stock buybacks. Dave King, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, stressed the importance of straightforward diversification in an interview with Barron\u2019s. He recommended holding at least eight stocks from different sectors, suggesting that while diversification doesn\u2019t need to be overly extensive, it should include more than just a few stocks\u2014ideally more than five, with representation from each major sector. King also advised that when selecting stocks, investors should not rely too heavily on Wall Street research. Instead, they should prioritize fundamental, time-tested factors like a company\u2019s credit rating or the reputation of its management, which can provide key insights into the stability of its dividend payments.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nIn today\u2019s economy, it is crucial for any modern enterprise to have a robust supply chain management and operation process. It is also one of the most complex elements of a modern enterprise.\n\nIf you want to guarantee competitiveness in today\u2019s markets, an organization needs to optimize its supply chain. And the best way to optimize a supply chain is to digitize it. Conversely, failure to optimize a supply chain can cause any business to fall behind the competition. Additionally, if a supply chain process relies heavily on paper and physical records for management, operating effectively in the modern business era can quickly become an overwhelming responsibility.\n\nFor example, The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and its bottlers, Coca-Cola Bottlers\u2019 Sales and Services (CCBSS) are each multinational organizations with highly detailed and complex supply chain processes. And CCBSS, notably, sought ways to enhance its supply chains by digitizing paper records and data to ensure optimized and more efficient operation.\n\nLearn More: Advanced Analytics in Demand Forecasting: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nA New Era for CCBSS\u2019s Supply Chain\n\nCoca-Cola has a unique approach to scaling its business through franchising the manufacturing, packaging, and logistics to the CCBSS \u201cbottlers.\u201d The CCBSS works with Coca-Cola to fulfill orders to various customers across the country, however, there was a problem with its \u2018proof of delivery\u2019 documentation with their customers.\n\nTCCC owns contracts with those customers such as Walmart, Target, and Costco, but outsourced all of the manufacturing and logistics management of its products CCBSS. The CCBSS simply fulfills the orders.\n\nFor example, each month TCCC is required to provide evidence of the fulfillment of goods and services to customers. This is done through a proof of delivery (POD) ticket between the deliverers and receivers. The burden of proof falls on CCBSS, if they are unable to provide these tickets upon delivery of the goods, the customer won\u2019t pay the bill.\n\nThe previous procedure was to take the POD tickets to FedEx, photocopy them and send them to a supply chain management company. Yet, the process was still losing approximately 25 million of these documents a year. A staggering number and a significant loss of revenue. The process was costly to TCCC, roughly 25 million of these were being lost per year.\n\nIn order to fulfill these orders, TCCC worked with several different contractors to support a complicated delivery ecosystem \u2013 and breakdowns and human error due to these complications were frequent.\n\nTCCC has decided to digitize parts of its supply chain management and operation; to maximize accuracy and efficiency. By digitizing parts of the supply chain, TCCC is able to consolidate vendors and save roughly millions per year through a process called document lifecycle management. A single vendor is able to manage document management, image storage, indexing, and physical storage and shredding suppliers once done by multiple vendors. It turns what was a confusing process into a streamlined system with advanced technology that can process millions of documents with greater quality, speed, and accuracy.\n\nLearn More: Robotic Process Automation: What is it good for?\n\nThe State of Digitization in the World\n\nMany organizations operate with 21st-century business tactics, practices and strategies designed to help them be as competitive and marketable as possible, Coca Cola and its subsidiaries included. These same organizations still keep much of their data on paper or physical records. Due, to this approach, many organizations are now faced with potentially losing data when it is needed for a specific task. In turn, this can severely hinder capabilities to effectively perform a task and hinder the bottom line of your organization.\n\nBuilding an Effective Supply Chain Through Digitizing Records\n\nTraditionally, many supply chain models are linear \u2013 and this is by design. Suppliers, producers, distributors, and retailers interact with each other in a straight-forward, linear process. Even so, these interactions are planned, ordered and confirmed transactions that are determined without much information from the other parties in the chain.\n\nWith an integrated, digitized supply chain, data does not have to move linearly. Instead, suppliers can effectively plan, qualify and confirm production based on real-time data showcasing an increase in consumer demand. Supply chain digitization allows every member of the supply chain to make informed decisions using higher-quality data.\n\nIn this new fast-moving, data-centric world, the most effective way to optimize any supply chain is to digitize it.\n\nUtilizing High-Performance Robots to Automate and Digitize Supply Chain\n\nWe live and work in a fast-moving and efficient era of the modern enterprise. Those who fail to upgrade business processes in a \u201creal-time\u201d world are bound to fall behind. Through digitization, an organization can optimize its supply chain is through digitization. Digitization improves operational capability, flexibility, and profitability. Robotics-powered automation is the next logical step for any organization that is seeking to boost efficiency and supply chain operational capability.\n\nRobotic technology has undoubtedly had a profound impact on markets such as manufacturing and industrials. Some of the most well-known corporations around the world have realized the benefits of automated robotic digitization. They are better positioned to make more informed decisions across a supply chain.\n\nEncouraging Other Businesses To Digitize\n\nDigitization through robotic automation can save an organization time, money and relieve stress when looking for documents needed for a particular purpose. As CCBSS digitizes its supply chain for these reasons, other major corporations need to consider the benefits of doing the same. These companies should be sold on the fact that digitization can help ensure they are maintaining a competitive edge in a competitive business market.\n\nLet us know if you liked this article on LinkedInOpens a new window , TwitterOpens a new window , or FacebookOpens a new window .

            "content": "Across Europe, Deposit Return Systems (DRS) are playing a crucial role in building a circular economy for packaging. In Romania, a successful partnership with producers, retailers, the government and the operator RetuRO is delivering strong results.\n\nA DRS allows consumers to buy a product with a deposit additional to the price and then, once it has been used, return the packaging to a collection point in exchange for their deposit back. From these collection points, the used packaging is sent to counting and sorting centres, then to recyclers where it is cleaned, and then returned to the manufacturers to be re-used or re-purposed.\n\nLaunched in December 2023, the DRS in Romania has recently marked its first full year in operation with some strong statistics:\n\nSeven counting and sorting centres across the country\n\nMore than three billion containers returned in one year\n\nIn October 2024, 84% of containers sold in the market were returned through the scheme.\n\n200,000 tonnes of packaging recycled in one year\n\n98% of households in Romania are aware of the DRS\n\nSix out of 10 Romanians regularly return the packaging to collection points.\n\nThe European Union has set key goals \u2013 to collect 77% of PET by 2025 and 90% by 2029, and to recycle 75% of glass and 60% of aluminium from 2030 \u2013 which it hopes to achieve through DRS.\n\nIn Romania, DRS is managed by the national operator RetuRO, which comprises a consortium of private companies and the Romanian Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests. Coca-Cola HBC joins this consortium through the industry association \u2013 Romanian Soft-Drinks Producers for Sustainability (APBRS). The Brewers for Environment association represents the other producers as a shareholder from the industry and they are also joined by the Retailers for Environment association and the Romanian State via the Ministry of Environment.\n\nWhat is the DRS?\n\n\u201cThe DRS is the largest circular economy project in Romania today,\u201d explains Gemma Webb, CEO and President of ReturRO.\n\n\u201cThe whole purpose of this project is to increase the recycling rates here in Romania.\u201d\n\nThis massive undertaking involves nearly 80,000 collection points across the country, making it the most comprehensive integrated system of its kind globally.\n\nUnder the scheme, consumers pay a deposit of 0.5 Romanian leu (approximately US$0.10) for each eligible beverage container, which can be reclaimed upon returning the empty container to designated collection points. The system covers all beverages, including wine and spirits, and plastic, glass and aluminium drink containers ranging from 0.1 to 3 litres.\n\n\u201cThe DRS puts in the infrastructure to make it easy for consumers to recycle,\u201d Gemma says.\n\n\u201cOur network of retailers then collect the used packaging for us to sort, count and sell to recyclers. This is highly complex as we have to have sorting and counting centres all over the country.\u201d\n\nThe DRS in Romania is one of the most intricate packaging recovery systems in the world. It requires the collaboration of 19 million Romanian citizens, 80,000 retailers, 4,000 importers and producers and involves seven billion glass, plastic and aluminium containers The DRS is expected to manage 5.6 billion containers in 2025.\n\nThe system is mandatory for the retailers, importers and producers, but engaging the population with the system is essential.\n\n\u201cThe great thing is that Romanian consumers have taken to it, and they\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Gemma shares. \u201cThis is really good packaging material because it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s separated into different colours, and it is already back in the system.\u201d\n\nMircea Fechet, the Minister for the Environment, Waters and Forests was instrumental in setting up the DRS. He says Romanian citizens truly believe in the system: \u201cThey are the ones who make the most effort because they go back to the shops with all the containers. They are the true heroes of the DRS here in Romania.\u201d\n\nThe partnership behind DRS\n\n\u201cAnything that can be realised cannot be done without partnership,\u201d says Mihaela Fr\u0103sineanu, State Counsellor on the Chancellery of the Romanian Prime Minister. \u201cThat\u2019s why we first started talking with the beverage industry in September 2016 and since then have implemented the DRS here in Romania.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola HBC played a key role in setting up the DRS by providing essential knowledge from other European CCHBC markets.\n\n\u201cWe partnered with the government and other players in the industry such as beverages and beer producers and retailers,\u201d explains Marcel Martin, Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer at Coca-Cola HBC. \u201cThis group of companies, together with the government, are shareholders of RetuRO and helped to create our common vision.\u201d\n\nRetuRO is the most successful public-private partnership in Romania and the only partnership of this kind for the circular economy. As a shareholder of the DRS administrator, the government collaborates with producers and retailers. The system also requires key stakeholders to implement and drive it.\n\n\u201cPartnerships are absolutely critical because to make an impact, all the contributors that produce or sell packages, the regulators and the government need to come together and have a common approach,\u201d Marcel says.\n\nInnovation at Coca-Cola HBC\u2019s Ploie\u0219ti plant\n\nCoca-Cola HBC's Ploie\u0219ti plant is the company\u2019s second-largest facility in the Coca-Cola HBC Group, generating 70% of the total volumes sold in Romania while simultaneously exporting to 15 other countries in the region.\n\nIt is also home to state-of-the-art decontamination technology that operates on 100% renewable electricity for processing recycled plastic that enables the plant to transform up to 20,000 tonnes of PET annually into bottles made entirely from recycled PET (rPET).\n\n\u201cWhat we do in Ploie\u0219ti is closing the circle of packaging circularity and producing food grade recycled PET,\u201d Marcel explains. \u201cInnovation is absolutely critical because circular packaging requires new solutions. We have to explore, invest in and collaborate to design these new solutions.\u201d\n\nThe investment in this rPET production unit was approved to become operational at the same time with the Deposit Return System, as, through DRS, beverage producers should access quality raw material to use in their packaging.\n\nThe benefits of DRS\n\nWhile the environmental improvements of DRS might be the first that come to mind, the system\u2019s benefits extend far further to include:\n\nCulture and consumer engagement\n\n\u201cThere are a number of benefits from the DRS, including the culture that\u2019s created by partnerships between industry players, retailers and the government. It is also the enthusiasm that it gives consumers. It is definitely going to be reflected in what you see in the country in terms of protecting nature and the environment.\u201d\n\nMarcel Martin\n\nEconomic value and green jobs\n\n\u201cI am hoping that DRS will also bring a lot of capital in new investments for new technologies and develop investments that will generate green jobs. This is a great story for Romania and a great story for the Romanian circular economy.\u201d\n\nMircea Fechet\n\nTransparency\n\n\u201cOne of the benefits is you have complete transparency of the system, from putting the product on the market, through to collection, sorting, counting, right to the recyclers,\u201d\n\nGemma Webb\n\nGlobal potential\n\n\u201cI believe that this example has to be spread around other countries. They can look at the complexity of our system and build on our learnings. I believe that this can be an example for all the DRS in the world, not only in Europe.\u201d\n\nMihaela Fr\u0103sineanu\n\nIs DRS the future of recycling?\n\nAs one of the largest integrated DRS in the world, Romania\u2019s system is setting an example for the rest of the world and proving that it is not just possible, but it is possible at scale and quickly.\n\nMarcel points out that DRS and a country\u2019s sustainability goals go hand in hand: \u201cAll European Union countries need to reach a 90% collection by 2029 target,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an important objective of the European Union, but it is also an important criteria for creating this concept of a circular economy.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to support rolling out similar schemes in other countries, including Austria, Poland and Greece, in 2025. It is a significant initiative that takes a lot of effort, and for this reason, learning is extremely important.\u201d\n\nMircea agrees: \u201cI hope that 10 years from now \u2013 or maybe less \u2013 when we look back and look up for the things that we developed we will say that the DRS was the best decision regarding the circular economy that the Romanian Government has taken for the last 35 years.\u201d\n\nTo read the full article in the magazine, click HERE.\n\nExplore the latest edition of Sustainability Magazine and be part of the conversation at our global conference series, Sustainability LIVE.\n\nDiscover all our upcoming events and secure your tickets today.\n\nSustainability Magazine is a BizClik brand",

            "content": "Sometimes, the best investments can feel almost too obvious.\n\nIs there a more iconic American brand than The Coca-Cola Company (KO -0.46%)? The global beverage giant sells over 200 brands of soda, water, juice, tea, coffee, and other drinks to billions of people. Renowned investor Warren Buffett is famous for his affinity for the company and has maintained a significant position in Coca-Cola via Berkshire Hathaway for decades.\n\nIt's almost so well known that it bores investors. Tell anyone in the office break room that you're buying Coca-Cola stock, and you'll probably struggle to get much of a reaction. Don't make the mistake of dismissing this blue chip dividend stock.

The company sells 1.9 billion servings across 200 countries daily, and 28 brands generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue.\n\nCoca-Cola is making money as long as people are out and living their lives.\n\n2. It has endless incremental growth in a global market\n\nCoca-Cola is not a high-growth business at its size, but the global beverage market is so large and fragmented that the company has a virtually endless growth runway. Since 1990, the global beverage market has grown by approximately 3% to 5% annually. That's a solid path to steady mid-single-digit revenue growth without factoring in market share.\n\nPlus, there is still so much room to increase customer engagement. Less than 30% of the world's developed population (20% of the global population) consume a Coca-Cola beverage more than once weekly. Most people in emerging markets, the remaining 80% of the world, still rarely drink a Coca-Cola beverage. That's a tremendous opportunity as emerging markets economically develop over the coming decades.\n\n3. It's an efficient, cash-producing business\n\nCompanies that make shareholders wealthy must be efficient and profitable, and Coca-Cola meets both criteria. In a given year, the company converts roughly 20% to 30% of its sales into free cash flow and earns a solid 15% return on invested capital. In other words, good things happen when Coca-Cola invests in the business.\n\nFrom a non-numbers point of view, such a lucrative business signals that Coca-Cola has a competitive moat. It has remarkable leverage over its distribution (places where it sells its products). A seller will almost always give Coca-Cola products the best shelf space, making it difficult for other beverage brands to compete. And if they do find success, Coca-Cola isn't afraid to buy them out.\n\n4. The dividend is terrific\n\nMany people know Coca-Cola stock for its dividend, which is remarkable and one of the most important reasons the stock can make you money over the long haul. The company is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive annual dividend increases. Today, the dividend payout ratio is 68% of 2024 earnings. That's plenty of financial cushion for a business that doesn't need to spend much money besides advertising.\n\nHow important is the dividend to long-term investors? The above chart compares Coca-Cola stock's long-term performance using just price appreciation versus total returns (dividends included). The best way to profit from Coca-Cola stock is to buy and hold it and reinvest the dividends for a long time.\n\n5. The stock is a stellar company at a solid price\n\nYou may be sold on the company now, but what about the stock? You don't need to put as much emphasis on valuation when you invest for a decade or more into the future. Still, you don't want to egregiously overpay for a stock like Coca-Cola because it doesn't grow fast enough to burn off an expensive valuation quickly. At the same time, dependable, proven winners like Coca-Cola often enjoy a higher valuation.\n\nToday, the stock trades at just under 22 times 2024 earnings, notably below its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 26. That makes the stock a buy today because even if you still don't think it's a bargain, investors will probably realize most of Coca-Cola's future growth and dividends as investment returns. Buy, hold, reinvest, and enjoy the long-term journey.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Through the first nine months of 2024, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway unloaded $133 billion worth of stocks. Buffett reduced Berkshire's massive stake in Apple and sold nearly a quarter of its Bank of America holding.\n\nIn the third quarter, Apple, American Express (AXP -1.66%), Bank of America, and Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) made up 70% of Berkshire's $271 billion stock portfolio. Buffett is raising cash at a time when the S&P 500 is trading at 30 times earnings, which is historically high for this popular market barometer.\n\nHowever, it's worth looking at the stocks Buffett is choosing not to sell right now. Buffett continues to hold shares of Coca-Cola and American Express, which says a lot about what he thinks of their competitive advantages and growth prospects.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nWarren Buffett has often invested in top consumer brands over his investing career. When Buffett sees a quality business trading at an attractive valuation, he pounces, and his 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is a great example.\n\nCoca-Cola stock fell sharply in the 1987 Black Monday crash. But the company was growing earnings at double-digit rates, and it still had a tremendous international growth opportunity. In the aftermath of the sell-off, the shares traded at around 16 times earnings, which prompted Buffett to invest a fifth of Berkshire's equity in Coke stock.\n\nBuffett has never sold a single share of Coca-Cola. The stock has split a few times over the last 30 years, leaving Berkshire with 400 million shares at the end of the 2024 third quarter. Those shares are worth $25 billion at current share prices, and paying $776 million in annual dividends.\n\nCoca-Cola is not the high-growth company it was when Berkshire originally invested, but the company should continue to grow earnings as it gains market share. Coca-Cola experienced a slight decline in unit case volume last quarter, reflecting a weak consumer spending environment. But over the long term, management expects to grow revenue marginally faster than the 4% historical growth rate of the global beverage industry.\n\nThe stock trades at 21 times 2025 earnings estimates and offers a high dividend yield of 3.14%. Assuming the company grows earnings faster than revenue, it probably won't be enough to outperform the S&P 500 over time. However, Coca-Cola's strong brand and consistent sales performance make it a great stock to hold if you want to boost your passive income.\n\n2. American Express\n\nBerkshire has held a large stake in American Express stock for 30 years, and as of Q3 2024, it still held 151 million shares. After adding to the position in 1998, Buffett has continued to patiently hold the stock and let it compound in value with the growth of the business.\n\nAmerican Express earned $12.5 million in 1964, $1.4 billion in 1994, and $9.9 billion over the past year. That record of profitable growth clearly reflects a wide competitive moat.\n\nAmerican Express stands out in an industry dominated by a few credit card companies. It has built a strong brand on customer service and a card membership model. Net card fees totaled nearly $2.2 billion in Q3, up 18% over the year-ago quarter. This gives American Express recurring revenue that it reinvests in benefits to retain and attract new card members.\n\nAnother attractive aspect of the business is that American Express card members spend more on average than customers of other card brands. Despite recent weakness in consumer spending, total transaction volumes, or billed business, grew 6% over the past year.\n\nEven with a single-digit growth rate in billed business, American Express is still on pace to report outstanding earnings growth of 25% for 2024. This reflects strong growth in card fees, low delinquency rates, and steady growth in new card members.\n\nThe stock is not cheap. It's trading at 20 times 2025 earnings estimates, which is higher than its 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 18. However, analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of about 14% over the long term, consistent with management's target, which may justify the higher valuation.\n\nWhile American Express could experience weaker financial results in a recession, Buffett clearly believes that the stock will grow in value over time.",

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Coca-Cola.\n\nView our latest analysis for Coca-Cola\n\nNYSE:KO Ownership Breakdown January 4th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:KO Earnings and Revenue Growth January 4th 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.4% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

            "content": "Warren Buffett is probably the most famous investor alive today, drawing followers who want to replicate his success. But, oddly enough, his investing portfolio is replete with what the market would label \"boring\" stocks, harboring a tiny subset of what could be called tech stocks. It has zero young, hyped-up tech or artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and is chock-full of dividend-paying consumer goods stocks.\n\nInvestors getting their feet wet in the stock market would do well to actually heed Buffett's advice and buy some of his favorites instead of betting on the next big tech stock. There's a place for that, if done responsibly. But there's also a place for the solid, global industry giant -- that's what diversification is all about.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.46%) is Buffett's longest-held stock and one of his favorites, while Domino's Pizza (DPZ -2.29%) is one of his newest holdings. Which one is the better buy for 2025?\n\nThe case for Coke: The unmatched global brand\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, first bought shares of Coca-Cola stock in 1985. Today, it owns 9.3% of the company, and it accounts for 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's total portfolio, its fourth-largest position.\n\nBuffett has made clear on many occasions why he's such a fan of the beverage king. It has an unmatched global brand presence, providing favored drinks for masses of worldwide consumers. It has a large and well-run distribution network bringing drinks to all kinds of retailers, with a packaged drink business as well as a concentrate business for away-from-home destinations like restaurants and movie theaters.\n\nAlthough it's facing pressure due to inflation, it has been able to successfully raise prices because of its brand, and therefore pricing power. It might begin to ease up this year as inflation moderates and consumers feel more comfortable in their spending habits.\n\nOne of Coca-Cola's most compelling features is its dividend. It's a Dividend King, and it has raised its dividend annually for the past 62 years. When you think about everything that has happened in the world over that time frame, which began in 1963, you can start to imagine what kind of strength that implies. It covers periods of hyperinflation, economic instability, pandemics, and more.\n\nAnd since Coca-Cola is a global company, it's not limited to challenges in one region. That means it has managed through multiple regional events without skipping a year of increasing its dividend and creating greater shareholder value. That's incredible durability and commitment.\n\nCoca-Cola stock ended 2024 up 6%. At the current price, its dividend yields 3.1%, and although there are some general ups and downs over time, that's pretty much where it lands.\n\nThe case for Domino's: Higher growth\n\nBuffett bought Domino's stock for the first time this year, and it's a small portion. Berkshire Hathaway owns 3.7% of the outstanding shares, and the position accounts for just 0.2% of its total portfolio.\n\nDomino's is like the Coke of the pizza industry. It's the largest global pizza chain, operating in 94 global regions with more than 20,000 stores. Because it runs a franchise model, it's actually selling franchises rather than pizza, which is a higher-margin business. Like Coca-Cola, it has strength in the global brand, and because it's affordable, it has greater resilience under pressure than fine dining or premium takeout.\n\nUnlike Coca-Cola, Domino's is experiencing strong sales growth, including comparable sales growth, despite worldwide economic volatility. It reported stellar results for the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended Sept. 8), with a 5.1% revenue increase over last year and a 5% increase in operating income.\n\nAs large as it is, it continues to open stores at a steady pace, with 800 to 850 new stores expected for fiscal 2024.\n\nDomino's also pays a dividend, and although it doesn't have the same track record as Coke, its dividend has grown much faster. It has raised the dividend annually since 2013, and it has increased 655% since that time, vs. 73% for Coca-Cola.\n\nDomino's stock was roughly flat in 2024, up just a notch. Its dividend yields 1.4% at the current price, or less than half of Coke's.\n\nBetter stock for 2025\n\nI think that sometimes it's hard to focus on what makes a really great stock, which is the ability to stand strong and weather tough times. This is Buffett's forte. In other words, headlining this as the best stock for this year is really a misnomer; a great stock is for any time.\n\nChoosing one of these stocks for 2025 is acknowledging that whatever happens this year, the stock will be well-positioned to create long-term shareholder value. Both of these stocks fit the bill, and they trade at the same P/E ratio of 26.\n\nBoth of these stocks offer value for investors. In this contest, though, I'm going to choose Coca-Cola for its longer track record of reliability and higher dividend yield.",

In 2016, organised clean-ups took place at Strand and Milnerton beaches where more than 1350kg of rubbish were collected and sorted for recycling.\n\nThe festive season is unfortunately a time when litter on the beach becomes problematic with revellers at beach parties not taking their rubbish with them or disposing of it in the municipal bins provided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of photos of empty bottles and other rubbish on popular beaches being shared on social media by beach-goers, who arrive in the morning at the beach to find the unsightly mess greeting them. We decided to be proactive as part of our commitment to sustainability and protecting the environment and put together two teams of 15 each to tackle the problem on the popular Camps Bay and Strand beaches,\u201d said Priscilla Urquhart, Public Affairs and Communications Manager for Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages.\n\n\u201cWe are not just picking up litter. We are helping make these beaches and our City something to be proud of, creating awareness about beach litter and protecting the environment at the same time.

It\u2019s that time of year when the \u201cCan Can\u201d sale prompts shoppers to load up on a variety of canned goods...and more.\n\nThe sale itself starts on Sunday, Jan. 5 at midnight. To get ahead of the game, digital coupons are available to clip now, although for use online after the sale begins.\n\nHeadlining in Week One of the three-week winter event are soups, tuna fish, tomato sauce, veggies and other shelf-stable products such as oil and coffee. Pepsi, Coca-Cola, iced tea and water varietals also are on sale \u2014 mainly in plastic bottles, despite the \u201ccan\u201d theme.\n\nHere is just a little taste of the Can Can Sale, ShopRite's biggest bi-annual sale of the year. (ShopRite)Silvestri\n\nGenerally, there are limits of four pieces per variety of product per shopper.\n\nDubbed as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest sale\u201d by ShopRite\u2019s circular standards, the race is on for most of January. In the first leg of the \u201cCan Can Bash,\u201d shoppers can expect select discounts until Saturday, Jan. 11.\n\nThe ShopRite Can Can tradition has been an annual or bi-annual celebration since 1971. The Can Can promotion turned some of the slowest weeks of the year into the busiest, the Mannix family owners have shared.\n\nThe supermarket chain\u2019s initial ad campaign featured dancing vaudeville girls. That original commercial featured words to an earworm, \u201cFrom apple sauce to zucchini, it\u2019s a can can savings spree!\u201d In the early 80s, the animation took on a disco theme. The catchy song in that era changed slightly to include, \u201cFrom can to can to can to can, you\u2019ll save much more on every brand.\u201d\n\nAs per an official ShopRite rep, \u201cThe strategy was to create a unique merchandising and advertising event that resonated with customers. Central to the campaign was the catchy Moulin Rouge-influenced tune to remind shoppers to purchase mostly private label canned fruits, vegetables, tuna and beverages on promotion.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the ShopRite sale weathered a 1974 industry-wide shortage of canned goods. Ultimately, store owners expanded into national brands and even beyond canned goods. A Summer Can Can event was introduced in 2002.\n\nStore associates could not confirm if there will be another can-centric event in this calendar year.\n\nPamela Silvestri is Advance/SILive.com Food Editor.

            "content": "More than 200 people are without jobs after Joriki USA Inc., a bottling plant for Coca-Cola and other companies\u2019 products in Pittston Twp., closed its doors on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAlthough the company had been struggling financially as of a few months ago, the news came as a shock to the 226 workers who are now without paychecks and health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe were closing down for Christmas break and expected to return to work on Dec. 27, but I got a text from a supervisor saying they were finishing up some projects, and they wouldn\u2019t be opening till Jan. 2, so we didn\u2019t have to report Dec. 29 or 30. We took it as getting a couple extra days off,\u201d Anthony Salvaggio, who worked at the plant as a maintenance mechanic for about seven months, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cCome New Year\u2019s Eve, we got a random email telling us our jobs were gone and our insurance was gone,\u201d Salvaggio, 29, of Forty Fort, said.\n\nJoriki did not give the state or employees a 60-day notice of the layoffs as usually required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act when a plant is closing or imposing sizable layoffs. This notice goes to affected workers or their representatives, the state\u2019s dislocated worker unit, and the local government.\n\nAccording to letters dated Dec. 31 that Joriki sent to employees and to the state Department of Labor and Industry, Joriki \u201cwould have preferred to provide more notice\u201d of the facility closure, but the company was unable to do so \u201cdue to unforeseen business circumstances and because of the circumstances explained herein.\u201d\n\nFor several months, Joriki was actively pursuing a transaction that the company reasonably believed would enable it to maintain operations and prevent employment losses. At the same time, Joriki has been receiving financial support from one of its major customers, as well as from its primary lenders, to continue operations in the normal course and pursue a transaction, according to the letters.\n\n\u201cIn good faith and reasonably, the company believed that giving WARN notice at least 60 days prior to the termination date would have precluded the company from finding a buyer that would want to purchase the company\u2019s business and from continuing to receive funding support from the customer and the lenders,\u201d the letters state.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, on Dec. 23, 2024, the potential buyer advised it did not intend to proceed with a transaction. Following this, Joriki\u2019s major customer and lenders advised they would no longer fund Joriki\u2019s ongoing operations. These events were sudden, dramatic, and unexpected and have led to a significant financial crisis that the company believes cannot be realistically addressed without implementing the facility closure,\u201d the letters state.\n\nThe letter to the Department of Labor and Industry indicated that a copy was sent to Michael Lombardo, mayor of the City of Pittston, even though the bottling plant is located in Pittston Twp.\n\nKyle Rozitski, administrator for Pittston Twp., said supervisors learned of the plant closing through a media report, and township officials received no notice from the company, which is headquartered and has two production facilities in Ontario, Canada, and one facility in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThe Department of Labor and Industry did not provide potential consequences of violating the WARN Act prior to press time.\n\nJoriki\u2019s letter to employees provided websites for instructions on filing for unemployment insurance as well as for seeking new jobs. \u201cIf the company concludes you are needed in connection with the wind-down of the facility, you will be advised separately,\u201d it states.\n\nSalvaggio said he filed for unemployment insurance, but he was floored that the company did not extend health insurance coverage for even one month.\n\n\u201cI personally called the medical insurer and they told me everything ceased as of Dec. 31,\u201d Salvaggio said. \u201cI have two children and one is asthmatic.\u201d\n\nFortunately, his wife, who also has medical issues that require medications, was able to pick up coverage through her employer, Salvaggio said, adding that his last paycheck was missing almost 50 hours of pay.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a decent job, but the place was very mismanaged the entire time, almost like a circus. It was just not ran right from day one. But, it was a job that paid the bills,\u201d said Salvaggio, who added that he has some employment prospects in the works. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit around and weep. It\u2019s time to move on.\u201d",

This is a big blow to the environment, as the company has long been one of the top plastic polluters in the world.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nCoca-Cola announced it will try to use 35% to 40% recycled material in its packaging by 2035. This might sound good, but it previously pledged to use 50% recycled material by 2030.\n\nThe company also announced drastic reductions to its recycling pledges. After stating it wanted to recycle every bottle it produced by 2030, it says it will recycle only 70% to 75% of bottles and cans.\n\nShould companies be required to help recycle their own products?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nExperts, environmental activists, and everyday people are all understandably horrified. Matt Littlejohn, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at Oceana, blasted the announcement, saying, \"Coca-Cola's decision \u2026 is short-sighted, irresponsible, and worthy of widespread condemnation by its customers, its employees, its investors[,] and governments worried about the impact of plastics on our oceans and health.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenters on a CNN article about the changes are also furious. \"It's almost becoming funny how blatant corporations are admitting that [their] only purpose is profit,\" one quipped, while another had a simple solution: \"Boycott Coke until they relent. Remember, the weakest part of the corporate body is its pocketbook.\"\n\nWhy is Coca-Cola's decision concerning?\n\nCoca-Cola's decision to abandon its stated sustainability goals comes at a precarious time for the planet. Plastic waste is a growing, catastrophic problem.\n\n\"Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world's oceans, rivers, and lakes,\" according to the U.N. Environment Programme. This pollution alters the world's food production as well as the general health of the global population.\n\nStudies show that microplastics are increasingly found in our bloodstreams. NPR reported \"microplastics are 'suspected' to harm human reproductive, digestive and respiratory health, with a possible link to colon and lung cancer.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are also negatively impacting ecosystems. For instance, microplastics have been found to transport bacteria and viruses around the globe that normally wouldn't survive an ocean journey.\n\nWhat's being done about plastic pollution?\n\nThe good news is dedicated researchers continue their exhaustive work to find solutions to our plastic problem. A recent study showed how scientists figured out a way to break down a common plastic polymer in months rather than decades. Another exciting report found that an insect in Kenya helps break down plastic.\n\nAs always, it is important we educate ourselves about the dangers of greenwashing. In the face of this decision, an informed public may not be so quick to hand a massive corporation such as Coca-Cola their money until it makes sustainability practices a priority.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

It offers a glimpse into the recording sessions and includes touching testimonials from the artists about the influence of Jean-Pierre Ferland and his music on their respective careers. A 90-second film was broadcast during Quebec's biggest annual rendezvous: Bye bye 2024 on December 31st.\n\nUnder the musical direction of Louis-Jean Cormier, who also created the arrangements, this new version of \"Le petit roi\" brings together an exceptional cast of artists who were all inspired by Jean-Pierre Ferland: Claude Dubois, Marjo, Pierre Lapointe, Sarahm\u00e9e, Klo Pelgag, Les Louanges, Lou-Adriane Cassidy, Rose Perron, and \u00c9mile Bourgault.\n\nThis initiative, ideated and developed by WPP's Open X, led in Montreal by TAXI, a VML Canada company, is part of Coca-Cola's \"Real Magic\" platform, which celebrates authentic moments of human connection.

            "content": "In the Seventh Arrondissement of Paris, there\u2019s a perfect little restaurant that specializes in Burgundian food. I\u2019ve been going there for 20 years, and nothing\u2014the napkins, the menu, the stuffy bourgeois crowd\u2014ever changes.\n\nBut on a recent visit, the dashing, snowy-haired gentleman at the neighboring table truly shocked me. \u201cI\u2019ll have the quenelles, poulet au vin jaune, a side of pommes vapeur, and, to drink, a Diet Coke,\u201d he said, unwinding his foulard. \u201cWith ice.\u201d The waiter didn\u2019t even blink.\n\nDiet Coke is trending far beyond TikTok and Instagram; as we launch into 2025, it may be the most discussed beverage on social media. First, there was the conversation around \u201cmarinating\u201d and \u201cpickling\u201d\u2014leaving it to chill in the fridge for weeks on end. Then there were the blind taste tests of \u201cice pairings.\u201d (Crushed is the clear winner, with bonus points if it originates at a Regal Cinema.) And let\u2019s not forget the \u201cdirty soda\u201d craze, in which, in the name of health, Diet Coke was mixed with a protein-rich vanilla shake (Fairlife Core Power, preferably).\n\nWhy now? Alcohol is looking less desirable all the time, but the group of teetotalers ordering Diet Coke instead of C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne is only part of the story. Since the drink\u2019s launch, in 1982, savvy marketing has made it a very big business, and it\u2019s never stopped growing. Its parent company, Coca-Cola, earned $43 billion in revenue in 2023, and in the United States, Diet Coke constitutes 7.8 percent of all soda consumed. (Regular Coke, with 35 grams of sugar\u2014or nine teaspoons\u2014in a 12-ounce can, leads the category with 19.2 percent.)\n\nCoke, Pepsi, Sprite, Mountain Dew, Dr Pepper\u2014that\u2019s largely considered child\u2019s play, rarely seen at adult dinner tables (or, God forbid, at dinner parties). But Diet Coke has fully transcended the snobbery that usually surrounds soda consumption. Karl Lagerfeld drank 10 glasses a day out of Lalique goblets. In 2022, the brand announced Kate Moss as its creative director. One of the world\u2019s greatest chefs is even rumored to have had a serious Diet Coke habit\u2014although he swears he no longer touches the stuff.\n\nSo what\u2019s in this delicious chemical soup? Carbonated water, artificial coloring (Caramel E150d), \u201cnatural flavorings\u201d (which could mean anything), the preservatives phosphoric and citric acids, caffeine (46 milligrams per 12-ounce can), and the artificial sweetener aspartame. (Coke Zero, popular with Europeans, contains the same ingredients and includes another artificial sweetener, acesulfame potassium. And it has 34 milligrams of caffeine.)\n\nDiet Coke is widely considered to be one of the healthier types of soda, but still\u2014is it even remotely \u201chealthy\u201d? First, its virtues: Because it\u2019s artificially sweetened, it doesn\u2019t cause the blood sugar to spike or increase one\u2019s caloric intake. For those with diabetes, insulin resistance, or obesity, it\u2019s a better choice than sugar-sweetened sodas.\n\nSince the early 2000s, there have been concerns about possible links between aspartame and cancer, especially of the liver, but the evidence is limited. Today, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies aspartame as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans,\u201d and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives declared that it does not pose a health concern. (It\u2019s also used in sugar-free gums, diet-drink mixes, reduced-sugar condiments, and some yogurts.) If choosing between diet soda and anything containing alcohol, a known carcinogen, the consensus is clear: Diet Coke for the win.\n\nBut Diet Coke is no hero. Artificial sweeteners can still trigger sugar cravings and cause bloating, and in scientific communities, there\u2019s increasing concern that they can harm the gut microbiome.\n\n\u201cWhen a lot of the safety testing was done, we didn\u2019t really appreciate that we have these trillions of bacteria in our gut, and anything that reaches them and changes the types that live in there can impact our systemic health, whether it is things like blood-sugar regulation or heart health,\u201d says Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King\u2019s College London with a doctorate in gut health.\n\nIn one way, sugar may not be as evil as previously believed. \u201cOur digestive tract is nine meters long, and most of the bacteria live in the last 1.5 meters,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cSugar is absorbed so high up in the intestine that it doesn\u2019t reach the microbiome.\u201d The artificial sweeteners, however, make it all the way through the digestive tract. \u201cOur bodies lack the enzymes to digest them,\u201d says Rossi.\n\nIn 2022, a randomized controlled study on the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners in humans was published by scientists at Johns Hopkins University. It revealed that different sweeteners affect the gut microbiome in different ways, which can contribute to increased levels of inflammation.\n\n\u201cAs a clinician and researcher, I\u2019m very cautious around artificial sweeteners,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cPerhaps you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too.\u201d\n\nDiet Coke\u2019s caffeine content may also be problematic. The F.D.A. recommends no more than 400 milligrams a day, but a two-shot cappuccino followed by two cans of Diet Coke would likely exceed that level, potentially exacerbating anxiety, insomnia, and high blood pressure.\n\nPhosphoric acid, an additive in most dark-colored sodas, used to enhance flavor, may be linked to tooth decay and bone de-mineralization. A recent study from scientists at Tufts University found that, in older women, high levels of cola intake were associated with lower levels of bone density.\n\nThe occasional can of Diet Coke won\u2019t kill you, but there\u2019s no reason to tempt fate and make like Lagerfeld. Rossi suggests gradually replacing Diet Coke with sparkling water, preferably poured over mixed berries. \u201cThey contain polyphenols, which feed your microbiome in a really positive and anti-inflammatory way,\u201d she says. Let\u2019s hope that, too, starts trending on TikTok.\n\nPhotos: Lenscap/Alamy; Sharon Suh (Baker)",

Jubilant Bhartia Group is fine-tuning its strategy in the market after acquiring a 40per cent stake in Coca-Cola India's bottling arm Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB) for Rs 12,500 crore.Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) is also making aggressive moves, expanding its Campa brand into the North and West markets through various channels, including quick commerce platforms like Swiggy Instamart , almost two years after it first relaunched the brand in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\"Similar to other cities, in the North too, Reliance is selling Campa brand at prices lower than rivals and on higher trade margins,\" said an executive directly aware of the developments.PepsiCo's bottling partner Varun Beverages (VBL) is bolstering its war chest, raising Rs 7,500 crore through qualified institutional placements (QIP).The funds are earmarked for expansion of existing businesses and fresh investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and even associates through equity, preference capital, or debt.\"Soft drinks are distributed in about four million outlets, which is close to 35per cent of the overall FMCG market; this indicates the massive opportunity for growth,\" Varun Beverages chairman Ravi Jaipuria told ET. \"We are expanding distribution because the market is big enough and consumers are responsive to packaged beverages...We are expanding distribution; so is the competition.\"Varun Beverages said in an investor presentation that it is stepping up installing new visi-coolers (or refrigeration equipment) in new markets, over and above its existing 1.02 million visi-coolers, to meet demand.Last month, it acquired a 39.93per cent stake in Lunarmech Technologies-which makes and exports bottle closures, bottle caps and packaging material-for Rs 200 crore.Bisleri International, which has focused on packaged water, is also scaling up soft drinks. \"We are expanding our portfolio with Limonata, Rev, Pop and Spyci Jeera to tap into the rising demand in the carbonated beverages market,\" said Angelo George, chief executive of Bisleri International.India's non-alcoholic beverage market is expected to reach sales of Rs 1.47 lakh crore by 2030, up from Rs 67,100 crore in 2019, a report by economic policy think-tank ICRIER said. Carbonated soft drinks and bottled water dominate India's non-alcoholic beverages market, the report said.While mainstream FMCG categories such as detergents and biscuits have seen urban demand cooling off due to inflation and heightened competition from regional and D2C (direct-to-consumer) brands, soft drinks have bucked the slowdown trend, according to global research firm Kantar. The average Indian household's consumption of bottled soft drinks breached an annual penetration of 50per cent in financial year 2023-24, it said.Meanwhile, one of Coca-Cola India's biggest franchise bottlers Moon Beverages last month acquired the beverage maker's bottling operations in Jharkhand.Moon Beverages-which also operates Coca-Cola's bottling in Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, the Northeast and select areas of West Bengal-is owned by Sanjeev Agrawal-promoted MMG Group, which operates quick service restaurant chain McDonald's in the North and East.\"This business transfer (to Moon Beverages) marks a significant decision for HCCB,\" Juan Pablo Rodriguez, chief executive of HCCB India, said in a statement. \"It (the development) ensures the right level of investments can be undertaken in all parts of the business, while bringing both scale and contiguity,\" he added.",

            "content": "By Gillian Garside-Wight, Consulting Director at Aura\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nCollaborative sustainability: Brands, even fierce competitors like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, should consider joining forces to promote Deposit Return Schemes (DRS), creating a unified message that demonstrates industry-wide commitment to recycling and environmental responsibility.\n\nRegulatory preparedness: Companies must proactively adapt their packaging to comply with emerging Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and DRS regulations, ensuring their products are recyclable and meeting new standards to avoid financial penalties and maintain brand reputation.\n\nConsumer education is critical: Successful implementation of recycling initiatives requires comprehensive communication strategies that not only inform consumers about how to participate in DRS programs but also create ongoing engagement and a sense of shared responsibility for sustainable packaging.\n\n\n\nAn MIT study recently found that a national Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) would drastically boost recycling. These container-deposit laws, AKA \u201cbottle bills,\u201d are already active in 10 U.S. states including California, Maine, and Michigan. Similar initiatives are taking off around the globe, with the U.K.\u2019s program now potentially going live before 2027 (though now not Wales) and Ireland launching earlier this year.\n\nThey present an enormous opportunity for drinks brands in particular, providing a chance for even the bitterest rivals to work together in service of the greater good.\n\nTime to team up?\n\nSpecifically, the success of a bottle bill is based on collaboration. Brands will need to work with local governments and collection scheme operators, but in truth this may also be the perfect opportunity for them to work with each other.\n\nPicture a world where deposit returns were the norm globally, with Pepsi and Coca-Cola, two drinks behemoths that are keen to demonstrate their sustainability credentials, combining their might. It makes sense: the purchases have already been made, so they\u2019re not competing for customers. This is the end-of-life of the product and both brands would face the same challenges in communicating the value and need for a DRS.\n\nThe power of joining forces \u2013 not just for Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but across every brand \u2013 is that doing so shows consumers that the bottle bill is the de facto industry standard; not just an initiative developed by one brand on its own.\n\nBrands would share the same messaging and could even share the costs involved in promoting it. Celebrity influencers and endorsers could be used to drive home the message. In addition to talking about how great a drink is, they can communicate what to do with the bottle or can when you\u2019re done with it.\n\nDRS and EPR go hand in hand\n\nThere is also a direct correlation between DRS programs and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), the new standards for ensuring producers take responsibility for their packaging until the end of its useful life, with fees and fines for producers (in some cases where eco-modulation exists, these are determined by recyclability and the inclusion of recycled content). EPR is currently coming into force across North America, Europe, and beyond.\n\nStates looking to approve EPR regulations are likely to be interested in bottle bills (and vice versa) because they are designed to increase the rates of recycling, while Bottle Bill programs result in an increased quantity of post-consumer recyclate (PCR) \u2013 the highly sought-after material needed to create more responsible packaging, which ideally should also be recyclable. One feeds into the other.\n\nThat is vital because the best EPR laws are eco-modulated, so producers that use more recyclable packaging face lower charges.\n\nWith more types of recycled packaging materials becoming available, expect an increase in regulations, incentives, and subsidies. Plus, of course, interest in bottle bills in a particular state or country are an indicator of consumer interest in recycling more broadly.\n\nWhat does this mean for CPG brands and retailers?\n\nThat puts the onus on brands to ensure their packaging and products are bottle-bill-eligible. That can mean anything from ensuring bottles are compatible in material and format, to using the correct labels. Everything from labeling to the color of the bottle cap \u2013 and the tethered caps that are now mandatory on plastic drinks bottles sold in the EU \u2013 will need to be designed to ease the collection process.\n\nDrinks manufacturers looking to sell in states and countries with DRS programs will need to prepare accordingly. There is a cost involved, but the cost of non-compliance may be far higher \u2013 not just in terms of EPR charges, but in terms of brand reputation and perception among an increasingly sustainability-conscious consumer base.\n\nAny solution will also require communication strategies to encourage a change of consumer behavior. Both EPR and bottle bill regulations work better in areas where consumers are already recycling their waste and packaging, but further encouragement and education are vital to ensure the initiative\u2019s future success.\n\nBrands will need to educate consumers on how to use the relevant DRS program \u2013 and if their bottle or can is not bottle-bill-compliant, they need to say so clearly as the machines won\u2019t accept them.\n\nThey should also consider how they encourage consumers to return those DRS-compliant containers, even beyond the financial incentives. How do they avoid complacency and keep the redemption incentive engaging after the initial burst of interest? They need to educate and inform and help to create a chain of responsibility.\n\nTo make accurate, trustworthy on-pack claims, brands need to join forces to educate consumers to close the loop on packaging recyclability. To reduce consumer confusion and enhance credibility, they need to communicate accurate recycling instructions using technology to do so at scale.\n\nEducation is paramount to promoting responsible information direct to consumers. Dynamic labels on packaging will allow end users to dispose of packaging by the correct route relevant to their ZIP code.\n\nAnd if brands can join up with a fierce competitor to help drive home the message, showing consumers that the future of our planet is more important than their rivalry, that is even better.\n\nGill leads Aura\u2019s consulting offer, with over 25 years\u2019 experience in the packaging industry, strategically developing packaging strategies, roadmaps, and packaging solutions to meet the needs of clients, consumers, and the planet.

Then, Coca-Cola Consolidated makes the beverage.\n\nThe company also acts as a distributer for their beverage clientele, distributing the products to restaurants, stores, vending machines, and other outlets for beverage purchasing. As such, Coca-Cola Consolidated controls much of the logistics of these beverages, with many of them not being owned or manufactured by Coca-Cola.\n\nRecent Earnings\n\nThe most recent quarterly earnings report from Coca-Cola Consolidated is for the third quarter. In the Q3 2024, net sales, gross profit, and income from operations increased. However, the company\u2019s product volume decreased.\n\n(Coca-Cola Consolidated) Q3 2024 Report\n\nThe most notable increase in Q3 2024 report is the first nine months comparison for 2023 and 2024. When the first 9 months are compared, income from operations increased 7% in the first 9 months of 2024 when compared with the same time in 2023.\n\nGuidance\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated is currently anticipating a 2% sales increase in 2025. According to the forecast, the company\u2019s revenue should increase $135.68m, putting total revenue at $6.92b.\n\nThe company is also aiming to increase their EBITDA margin. Their current margin is 15.5%, and they currently hope to achieve a margin of 16% or above in 1 to 2 years.\n\nMarket Control\n\nAs mentioned before, Coca-Cola consolidated is the largest Coca-Cola beverage bottler in the United States. Their territory includes much of the Midwest, South, and parts of the East coast.\n\n(Coca-Cola Consolidated) Map of Territory\n\nOther Coca-Cola beverage bottlers in the United States control much less territory. For instance, the second largest bottler is Coca-Cola Bottling Company United. Their territory is Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and parts of Mississippi.\n\nIn the past year, the company began making and distributing Bang Energy. Bang Energy is currently a subsidiary of Monster Energy, the second largest energy drink company in the United States. Monster Energy is in a partnership with Coca-Cola.\n\nRecently, Coke Consolidated has also opened two new facilities: one in Columbus, Ohio and one in Monroe, North Carolina.\n\nStock Buyback and Dividends\n\nIn August, the company\u2019s executives decided to approve a $1 billion common stock buyback program. Stock buybacks are usually a good sign that a company believes they anticipate future gains. Along with that, buybacks also increase stock price.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve previously stated, the progress we\u2019ve made improving our profitability and strengthening our balance sheet allows us to reinvest in our business and our teammates while taking steps to build long-term value for our stockholders,\u201d said J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cOur strong financial performance supports increasing our quarterly dividend and establishing a share repurchase program, which aligns with our commitment to return cash to our stockholders over time.\u201d Coca-Cola Consolidated Press Release\n\nCoke Consolidated, earlier in the year, established a different buyback program aimed to regain shares that were owned by subsidiaries of Coca-Cola, like Carolina Coca-Cola Bottling Investments. The deal to buyback shares totaled to $553.7 million.\n\nIn the same announcement as the buyback, the company increased the dividend by 5x, from $0.50 each quarter to $2.50 quarterly. The dividend yield is now 0.81%.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated just has such a grip on the market for bottling and distributing. Most of the drinks you buy in the grocery store, or consume at a restaurant, move through Coca-Cola Consolidated, especially if you live in the Midwest.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated has experienced rapid growth in the past couple of years, with expansions by building new facilities and expanding into Kentucky. The company executives must also anticipate future growth, as shown with the capital they are pouring into stock buybacks.\n\nWith Coca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s position in the market, and being the only Coca-Cola bottler in the U.S. to be a public company, the stock is an amazing addition to someone\u2019s portfolio. This is one of the few companies that almost always has a good, guaranteed, revenue and profit.\n\nI believe that Coca-Cola Consolidated is a Strong Buy.",

Here\u2019s what we know at this point.\n\nNutthaseth Vanchaichana/istockphoto\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening to Costco\u2019s Soda Fountain?\n\nAccording to Costco Insider and an anonymous source on the Costco Reddit forum, the soda fountains in Costco\u2019s cafes are going to switch from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola products. That means you\u2019ll have drinks like Coke, Diet Coke, and Sprite to choose from instead of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Starry.

The store switched to Pepsi after Coke refused to give Costco as good a deal as the company supposedly gave Walmart. And for about a month, Costco stopped carrying ANY Coke products, not just in the food court.\n\nCheapism\n\nHas Costco Confirmed Anything?\n\nNo, Costco has not confirmed the switch from Pepsi to Coke.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC ( ).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is:\n\n18% = \u20ac1.6b \u00f7 \u20ac9.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every \u20ac1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u20ac0.18.\n\nDoes Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a higher ROE than the average (9.6%) in the .\n\nThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners visit our\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nCombining Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' Debt And Its 18% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.29. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

            "content": "As 2025 gets underway, investors looking to refresh their portfolios with some attractively valued companies might be eyeing stocks that lagged the market in 2024. Beverage giants Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) and PepsiCo (PEP 0.11%) have been under pressure over the past year, and both have fallen by around 14% from their 52-week highs.\n\nGiven the overlapping businesses, it probably doesn't make sense for most investors to have both stocks in their portfolios. So which one is the better buy now?\n\nHow far have PepsiCo and Coca-Cola really fallen?\n\nPepsiCo's 2024 has been a little worse than Coca-Cola's. Not only was its dip from its peak slightly steeper, it's actually down more than 10% year to date, while Coca-Cola is up by about 5%.\n\nHowever, if you pull the lens further back, PepsiCo's drop from its three-year high is around 22%, while Coca-Cola's is around 14%. But Coke enjoyed a rally from late 2023 that lasted into 2024, while PepsiCo didn't. All in, investors appear to have been a little more negative about PepsiCo overall.\n\nThat negativity gap extends to their relative valuations. PepsiCo's price-to-sales ratio is nearly 18% below its five-year average. Coca-Cola's P/S ratio is only about 7% lower than its five-year average. Similarly, PepsiCo's price-to-earnings ratio is about 14% below its five-year average while Coca-Cola's P/E is roughly 2% below its average.\n\nAnd then there are their dividend yields. At their current share prices, PepsiCo yields 3.5% while Coca-Cola yields 3.1%. On an absolute level, PepsiCo's yield is more attractive, but there's more to the story. While Coca-Cola's current yield is roughly middle of the road for the stock over recent years, PepsiCo's is near its all-time high. All in all, PepsiCo looks like the better value if you have a value bias when you invest.\n\nSimilarities and differences\n\nTo be fair, these companies are not exactly interchangeable even though their beverage businesses have material overlap. That said, they are similar in many ways. For example, both have increased their dividends annually for over 50 years, earning them both spots among the Dividend Kings. Members of that elite group have proven they can weather the inevitable ups and downs in the business world and keep rewarding their shareholders along the way.\n\nBut consider the difference between them. Coca-Cola has grown its revenue at a slightly faster clip over the past few years, and its earnings have increased at a dramatically faster pace. PepsiCo's full-year earnings growth rates have been stuck in the low single digits while Coca-Cola has been growing earnings at paces in the low double digits. In that light, it makes sense why investors appear to like Coca-Cola more than PepsiCo right now.\n\nBut there's another, more fundamental difference between the two companies. Coca-Cola sells beverages and only beverages. It's good at what it does, but it doesn't have much diversification. PepsiCo, by contrast, sells beverages, snacks, and packaged food products, and it's a major player in each of those businesses. For an investor who wants to gain broad portfolio exposure to the consumer staples sector, PepsiCo could provide that with a single investment. Coca-Cola can't. If diversification is important to you, you'll likely prefer PepsiCo.\n\nNeither is a bad choice\n\nThe truth is that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are both well-run companies that investors could comfortably buy and hold for decades. But if you are trying to maximize the income your portfolio generates, have a preference for value stocks, or like to own diversified businesses, PepsiCo is likely to be the better choice for your portfolio in 2025.",

            "content": "When I was in college, I declared Diet Coke my enemy. My reason was the only good reason to declare anything an enemy: Someone wrote a bad blog about it.\n\nSome girl I didn\u2019t know published an op-ed in the school newspaper counting all the reasons she was truly, deeply devoted to Diet Coke. It wasn\u2019t serious, but it pissed me off so much that I started fights with girls in my sorority kitchen over it. Couldn\u2019t they see that she was making all of us look like idiots by publishing something like this?\n\nI was a newly converted gender studies major in an SEC sorority, which is a little like being Snow White in that scene where she runs through the haunted forest and keeps being accosted by scary faces, except the scary faces were the racism and misogyny that I could see and name clearly, for the first time. Thankfully for all of us, any evidence of this article seems to be wiped from the internet, so all I have left is the silhouette of my outrage from that time, and a deep hatred for Diet Coke.\n\nMy opposition to Diet Coke was political, a vehement objection that mirrored everything that stank of \u201cdiet,\u201d and there it was, right in the name on the can. To explicitly diet was to admit that I\u2019d succumbed to the miasma of feminine self-hatred. If I was going to drink a soda, I proudly ordered full sugar Coca-Cola, a political act of self love defying the collective ritual of \u201cwatching what we eat,\u201d even as I watched what I ate\u2014constantly.\n\nI lived in an uneasy truce with my body, promising to avoid diets and diet foods, and in exchange I believed my body would never get sick, gain weight, or become otherwise unruly. This was magical thinking, of course, but I was in denial of the ways I let this control me; constantly ruminating on the ways I wasn\u2019t dieting still took up a huge amount of space in my brain and I would often end up paralyzed in front of the open refrigerator, unable to make a decision about what to eat for lunch that fit within the myriad intersecting and contradicting rules in my head. I didn\u2019t explicitly let myself live by the diet rules I knew, but they constantly loomed in the background, a yardstick against which every decision was still measured.\n\nLast year I finally started treatment for disordered eating that focused on intuitive eating, a framework that discourages assigning morality to foods and food groups and encourages paying close attention to hunger cues and cravings as a way to guide eating habits. I slowly let go of the thousands of food rules I kept cataloged in my mind and for six months, I felt freedom. Then came the prediabetes.\n\nI was finishing my makeup the morning of my partner\u2019s graduation in May when I got the news that my A1C was in the prediabetic range. I didn\u2019t have time to do any panicked googling, because we had to pick up my in-laws and begin a highly choreographed routine of ticket-wrangling and sun protection and snack management that would last the whole day. But after it was all over, when I lay in bed tipsy off red wine with my phone glowing two inches from my eyes, I read deep into the prediabetes subreddit. I learned that prediabetes is a condition where your blood sugar is elevated to higher than healthy levels, and which left unchecked, can develop into diabetes. As with diabetes, you can develop prediabetes through a combination of genetics and lifestyle; according to the CDC, a third of American adults have prediabetes. I have a strong family history of diabetes on both sides, and Asians are also among the groups of people with higher risk of prediabetes and diabetes, so in retrospect, it seems overdetermined.\n\nBefore that day, my relationship with the world of diabetes, blood glucose, and insulin was distant, but I was vaguely aware of the morality assigned to the different types. Type 1 was the kind you got as a kid\u2014what Nick Jonas has. Blameless. Innocent. Type 2 was the kind you \u201cgave yourself\u201d after living an indulgent life. It conjures images of men in their 60s who refuse to stretch or drink water despite their wives\u2019 pleading. Blame. Immorality.\n\nI thought I was above blaming people for their health conditions, even in the privacy of my own mind. But the tendrils of ableism are wily and sometimes only reveal themselves when turned on the only viable target: the self. I realized that I had been hiding deeper, uglier feelings beneath the surface.\n\nThe strongest was shame, which didn\u2019t cling to a single thought as much as it contaminated the way I looked at and engaged with my body. My thoughts ricocheted from the shame about what I\u2019d done to my body (of course it was my fault) to fear about how quickly this could develop into Type 2 (Reddit said 3-6 months) to confusion about how this had happened.\n\nI wondered if the intuitive eating was responsible. Surely, the snacks I let myself eat with abandon over the last year were responsible for my high A1C. Could I even trust the dietitian I\u2019d worked with last year? I didn\u2019t know what was safe to believe.\n\nI read articles about managing prediabetes and felt all the old diet rules rush back. My new priority moving forward was to try to keep my blood sugar from spiking for long periods of time. Your blood sugar always spikes after a meal, but there\u2019s a variety of things you can do to make sure that spike doesn\u2019t go too high for too long: go for a walk after you eat, make half your plate veggies, prioritize protein over carbs, pair protein and fat with carbs, and always remember that sugar is a carb and sugar is in basically everything in this country so good luck.\n\nI decided to give myself three months to see what lifestyle changes alone could do for my A1C and begrudgingly committed to my new diet.\n\nI spent the summer experimenting with low-carb recipes, drinking a ton of apple cider vinegar mocktails, and chopping raw vegetables. Meanwhile, Oprah and Lizzo and Kelly Clarkson debuted new, lithe bodies after taking weight loss medications, and Ariana Grande fielded concerned comments about her health on the Wicked press tour. I switched from oat milk back to dairy in my lattes and smoothies, and Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s supplement brand, Lemme, released a GLP-1 Ozempic dupe. I ate so many salads, and I figured out glucose-friendly meals that didn\u2019t feel like sacrifice. Buffalo wings and Caesar salad became my new go-to when eating out at restaurants. The influencer Liv Schmidt was banned from TikTok for posting content that promotes eating disorders.\n\nCutting out sweets was the hardest part, because I have a huge sweet tooth. I love sour candies, I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love Cherry Coke. In the first weeks of my new diet, I dreamed of eating cookies and entire cakes and even in the dreams I felt the shame of knowing I was spiking my blood sugar, ruining everything.\n\nI was uncomfortable because I was hungry all the time, but also because what I was doing looked an awful lot like a diet. I refused to call it that at the moment, favoring euphemisms like \u201cmy new lifestyle\u201d and the more vague \u201cyou know, all the changes\u201d as I waved my hands around. I was appalled that I could so easily take the shape of Woman on a Diet, examining nutrition facts on every food and logging my meals in MyFitnessPal to tally up my macros.\n\nOnce, in a coffee shop before a Normal Gossip live show, I put back a yogurt when I realized it had almost 30 grams of sugar in it. I made sure to clarify to the acquaintance I was standing in line with that I was acting like this because I had prediabetes, not because I am someone who actually cares about the amount of sugar I eat. Writing this now, though, I wonder what the difference is.\n\nAfter six weeks, I didn\u2019t feel quite so deprived. People told me I would lose a lot of my sweet tooth and they were right; I still crave chocolate, but my desire for sweets is much less pronounced than it used to be. After three months, I had lowered my A1C, not quite out of the prediabetic range, but extremely close. The changes I made worked for me.\n\nI also lost 13 percent of my body weight, a return to my pre-pandemic size. Clothes that used to fit me perfectly now fall right off, and I\u2019m angry about it because I liked how they looked before. Family members praised my weight loss and I mumbled thanks, uncomfortable with the knowledge that the changes were visible enough for people to clock through their phone screens across the country. By losing weight, I felt like I had betrayed the version of me who went through the eating disorder treatment, who didn\u2019t believe in \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d foods, who wasn\u2019t afraid of calories or carbs.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we got tickets for a late movie. When we got to the lobby, I saw that the theater had those Coke Freestyle Machines. There were so many sugar-free options, I felt overwhelmed. I bought a 20-ounce cup and filled it with caffeine-free Diet Coke, half cherry and half vanilla. Look, I know about aspartame, but I also know how I felt being able to have this sweet treat without a blood sugar spike or caffeine buzz, and that feeling was fantastic. As I sat in the dark theater, I couldn\u2019t believe how thrilled I was to be drinking Diet Coke, this beverage I derided for so long.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk this year about how our cultural pendulum of preferred women\u2019s bodies is swinging back toward thinness, and I hesitated to write this essay at first because I worried I would be contributing to the body-positivity backlash. The hardest part of these changes has been figuring out a way to hold multiple truths in my mind at once. I believe in the political roots of the body positive movement, despite how distorted the modern conception has become, refracted through 50 years of capitalism. But I am learning to forgive myself when I look and act like a woman on a diet, because my body is just a little less effective than the average body at processing carbs. I know I\u2019ll feel my best when I\u2019m intentional about when and how many of them I consume. Sometimes that means a little Diet Coke as a treat.",

            "content": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into content marketing has revolutionized the way brands connect with their audiences. AI has significantly increased the speed at which content can be produced and the volume of content that can be generated. This allows marketers to quickly go to market with various types of content, including text, images, and videos, at a scale that was not possible before due to human limitations.\n\nAI also enables the extraction of insights that were previously unavailable, making it easier to turn data into actionable knowledge. This allows marketers to implement information more effectively and enhance their strategies. AI has changed the approach to personalization in marketing by enabling personalization at scale.\n\nEarlier, marketers faced a significant divide: they could either personalize content for a small audience or send out non-personalized messages to a large group. With AI, it is now possible to create multiple iterations of personalized content for thousands of recipients simultaneously. For instance, instead of just addressing an email with a recipient\u2019s name, AI allows marketers to tailor the entire body of the email to reflect the unique vocabulary and writing style of each individual recipient.\n\nAI amplifies creativity by inspiring marketers. It allows them to do more with less, reducing costs while maintaining quality. This balance between experimentation and efficiency is a game-changer.\n\nText has been the most tangible outcome of AI so far, but text-to-video is where the real challenge lies. While the technology is still in its nascent stage, the pace of its evolution is astonishing. While the benefits of AI are evident, there is concern about the potential for content saturation.\n\nIf every brand leverages AI to flood the market with content, differentiation becomes difficult. Authenticity might diminish, and consumers may struggle to distinguish between brands. Early adopters of AI will have the advantage, but moving forward, marketers must innovate beyond the mundane to stay ahead.\n\nThe ethical implications of AI in marketing are another focal point. As AI becomes more prevalent, transparency and accountability are key to maintaining consumer trust. The promise of AI lies in its ability to scale creativity, but it also raises questions about authenticity.\n\nWhen consumers interact with a piece of content, they should know whether it\u2019s been created by a human or an AI. Brands must ensure that AI-generated content doesn\u2019t perpetuate biases or stereotypes. Coca-Cola is one of the most prominent brands incorporating AI into its advertising.\n\nThe company\u2019s AI remake of its iconic \u201cThe Holidays are Coming\u201d ad showcased technological advancements made in a short time. Coca-Cola employed AI for image generation, translation, and other tasks previously outsourced. Ad agencies are also heavily investing in AI.\n\nA Forrester survey found that many ad executives are engaging with generative AI, recognizing its ability to refine ad tactics and tailor messages effectively. AI can predict conversion rates for engagement activities across customer segments and identify optimal times to send messages based on user behavior. Despite the growing use of AI in marketing and advertising, concerns persist.\n\nResearch from the World Federation of Advertisers showed that 80% of multinationals are uneasy about how their agencies use generative AI.\n\nHarnessing AI for marketing personalization\n\nLegal, ethical, and reputational risks were identified as top concerns.\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, it offers significant opportunities to enhance both the creative and operational aspects of advertising. It is becoming a vital tool for brands, solving practical problems at substantially reduced costs. The key is for marketers to focus on using AI not just for easy tasks but for complex, strategic developments that can provide significant competitive advantages.\n\nMore than two-thirds (69.5 per cent) of all worldwide advertising spend this year will be enabled or informed by AI tools, according to the Pakistan Advertisers Society. AI has swiftly transitioned from a nascent technology to a cornerstone of the global advertising landscape, with its capabilities transforming corporate communication with consumers. While today\u2019s AI models remain far from becoming science fiction-like entities, their potential for disruption, whether through innovation or job displacement, is undeniable.\n\nThe timeline for when AI might pose existential risks is a matter of debate, but for now, its application in industries like advertising is reshaping the sector\u2019s fundamentals. Adidas recently unveiled its groundbreaking AI-designed \u2018Flora\u2019 ad campaign, created using advanced AI tools such as RunwayML and Midjourney. This campaign serves as a vivid illustration of how AI is pushing the boundaries of creativity.\n\nBy blending cutting-edge technology with innovative storytelling, Adidas not only showcased its products but also offered a glimpse into a future where AI tools become indispensable in crafting compelling advertisements. The integration of AI in advertising has sparked debates about whether it is going to affect jobs or be a catalyst for innovation. On the one hand, AI offers unparalleled efficiencies, automating tasks that once required human intervention.\n\nFrom designing graphics to analyzing consumer behavior, AI can handle complex processes with speed and accuracy. This allows companies to allocate resources toward more strategic initiatives. On the other hand, the automation of roles traditionally performed by humans raises concerns about job security.\n\nThe creative industry, which has long been driven by human ingenuity, now faces the challenge of adapting to a landscape where machines can replicate, and sometimes surpass, human capabilities. Graphic designers and even marketing strategists are seeing aspects of their roles being taken over by AI-powered tools. A report by McKinsey highlights that while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones that require a blend of technical expertise and creative thinking.\n\nFor instance, roles like AI trainers, prompt engineers, and data ethicists are emerging, indicating that the industry is not witnessing a net loss of jobs but rather a transformation in the skill sets required. As AI continues to permeate the industry landscape, it is crucial to address the ethical and strategic concerns it brings. The use of AI in creative processes must be transparent, ensuring that audiences are aware of the role technology plays in shaping their perceptions.\n\nIt is important for workers to invest in upskilling themselves to prepare for the AI-driven future. By providing training in AI tools and fostering a culture of adaptability, businesses can ensure that their employees remain relevant in an evolving industry. As technology continues to advance, we can expect AI to play an even more integral role in shaping the future of the industry.\n\nFrom hyper-personalized campaigns to real-time consumer engagement, the possibilities are endless. However, the industry must tread carefully to strike a balance between leveraging AI\u2019s capabilities and preserving the human touch that makes content relatable and impactful. As AI tools become more sophisticated, the focus should shift from replacing human roles to augmenting human creativity, ensuring that innovation and inclusivity go hand in hand.\n\nAI is not merely a tool for enhancing efficiency but a transformative force that is redefining the industry\u2019s core. The debate over whether it\u2019s killing jobs or encouraging innovation will continue, but one thing is clear: AI is here to stay, and its impact on all industries will be profound. The challenge lies in harnessing its potential responsibly, ensuring that it serves as a force for progress rather than a source of disruption.",

Mexican Coke contains cane sugar while Coke produced in the U.S. began using high-fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar in 1980.

This usually means that there are no clear support levels at this time, so buying the stock as it falls could be considered catching a falling knife. Buy signals only exist if resistance breaks higher.\n\nThis often is a signal that the stock you are watching is weak. Waiting for a turn higher may be more intelligent than trying to catch a falling knife. In any case, new support levels are usually revised to the database at the beginning of the next trading session. Short KO slightly under 63.57, target n/a, stop loss @ 63.75 Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of KO as it gets near 63.57, but the downside target is not available from the current data. This tells us to hold that position if it is triggered until a new downside target has been established (updates occur at the beginning of every trading session) or until the position has been stopped. The summary data tells us to have a stop loss in place at 63.75. 63.57 is the first level of resistance above 62.26, and by rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance 63.57 is being tested, so a short signal would exist.\n\nSwing Trading Plans for KO\n\nBuy KO slightly over 62.57, target 63.57, Stop Loss @ 62.39 Details\n\nIf 62.57 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy KO just slightly over 62.57, with an upside target of 63.57. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 62.39 in case the stock turns against the trade. 62.57 is the first level of resistance above 62.26, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 62.57, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short KO slightly near 62.57, target 61.66, Stop Loss @ 62.75. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of KO if it tests 62.57 with a downside target of 61.66. We should have a stop loss in place at 62.75 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 62.57, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.\n\nDay Trading Plans for KO\n\nBuy KO slightly over 62.64, target 63.57, Stop Loss @ 62.49 Details\n\nIf 62.64 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy KO just slightly over 62.64, with an upside target of 63.57. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 62.49 in case the stock turns against the trade. 62.64 is the first level of resistance above 62.26, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal.

            "content": "Dividend investing will likely never go out of style. This is not only because people generally like the idea of earning some money while doing nothing, but also because companies that consistently pay and increase their payouts usually have excellent underlying businesses. That's primarily why dividend stocks have outperformed their non-dividend-paying peers over long periods. So, investing in top income stocks is not a bad way to kick off 2025.\n\nHere are two excellent candidates to consider: Coca-Cola (KO -0.46%) and Visa (V -1.29%).\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nBrand names matter. Few companies worldwide have a stronger brand than Coca-Cola, a soft drink market leader. Coca-Cola's name, reputation, and presence in practically every country known to man means it will continue to attract a good amount of business. That's the company's competitive edge. Further, it isn't just a soft drinks leader, although that is how it made its name. Coca-Cola has significantly diversified its portfolio. It offers practically everything from alcohol to coffee and tea, sports drinks, energy brands, and water.\n\nCoca-Cola's diversification is an essential part of its strategy. It allows it to cater to the needs and preferences of different markets. And with rising concerns over the health impact of some of its more popular offerings, this strategy has also helped it decrease its exposure to these less healthy options. So, the company can survive and thrive in a more health-conscious market. True, Coca-Cola probably isn't a particularly attractive growth stock. Don't expect the stock to keep up with artificial intelligence leaders.\n\nWhat it does offer, though, is consistency and reliability. Coca-Cola records steady revenue and profits.\n\nIt has done so for a long time, which is how it has supported its incredible dividend track record. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with an active streak of 62 consecutive payout increases. The company's forward yield is 3.11%, well above the S&P 500's average of 1.32%. Coca-Cola's payout ratio looks a bit high at 74%, but the company has often maintained a pretty high payout ratio while still increasing its dividends. Investors have nothing to worry about: Coca-Cola will remain an excellent income stock beyond 2025. It's little wonder the business remains one of Warren Buffett's favorites.\n\n2. Visa\n\nLike Coca-Cola, Visa has one of the most powerful brands in its market. Millions of credit cards in circulation bear the logo of the financial industry giant, which cuts a fee for every transaction it helps facilitate through its payment network. True, the company's business can be susceptible to recessions. When the going gets rough and consumers start spending less, Visa's payment volume can drop, leading to lower revenue and earnings for the company.\n\nNo business is risk free, and so long as Visa's performance in good times can more than make up for the slowdown in bad times, the company will be just fine. In fact, Visa should benefit as the cash displacement phenomenon continues. People switching from cash transactions to credit cards and digital forms of payment have been a tailwind for Visa for a while, but cash and checks haven't been completely phased out yet -- not even close. There are still trillions of dollars worth of payment volume the company can bring into its ecosystem.\n\nAnd while Visa won't capture this entire market, it doesn't need to. Even grabbing a small slice of the remaining available pie -- which will probably get bigger over the long run -- will allow Visa to continue growing its revenue and earnings at a good clip for a while. Further, the company's network effect means it is likely to remain a top dog in the industry. In short, Visa has a strong moat and excellent growth prospects, all of which have usually led to solid financial results.\n\nLastly, the company's dividends have grown by almost 392% in the past decade. Though Visa's forward yield is pretty low, only 0.74%, it is still an attractive income stock to hold onto for a while, given its robust underlying business and a payout ratio of 21.36%, which leaves ample space for more dividend growth.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation.\n\nImproved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024.\n\nDividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019\u2014a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates\u2014dividends contributed 75% to the market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nInvestors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company\u2019s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not.\n\nReflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Coca-Cola Consolidated ( ) we really liked what we saw.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Coca-Cola Consolidated, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.21 = US$875m \u00f7 (US$5.3b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nSo, Coca-Cola Consolidated has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 16% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you're interested in investigating Coca-Cola Consolidated's past further, check out this free .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Coca-Cola Consolidated are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 21%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 69%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Coca-Cola Consolidated thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Coca-Cola Consolidated has. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Coca-Cola Consolidated can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

            "content": "Jolt Cola aims to make a comeback - this time with even more caffeine\n\nJolt Cola, the soda brand that gained attention in the 1980s for offering \"all the sugar and twice the caffeine,\" is heading back to stores in 2025. This time, it's promising more than twice the original caffeine content.\n\nOnce marketed as an alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Jolt Cola will now join the crowded energy-drink market with the likes of Red Bull, Monster and Celsius. It will be marketed as a nostalgic drink due to its past reputation, according to Redcon1, the sports nutrition brand leading the relaunch.\n\n\"There's a neat way to bring something back where it'll pay homage to what once was, yet we can do it in a very modern way,\" Ryan Monahan, chief marketing officer at Redcon1, told CNN.\n\nJolt Cola will come in 16-ounce cans and be priced at about $2.50 or $3. It will have 200 milligrams of caffeine, up from around 70 milligrams in a 12-ounce can in 1985.\n\nThis relaunch marks the third release in the United States for Jolt Cola. In 2009, the brand's company filed for bankruptcy protection. Jolt Cola would briefly resurface on shelves at Dollar General stores in 2017 before the chain stopped selling it in 2019.\n\nA shift to a growing market\n\nWhen Redcon1 announced in October that it would reintroduce Jolt Cola, it could have brought it back as a soda. But growth in the energy-drink market has outpaced the soda market, prompting Jolt Cola to instead compete against the energy drinks that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Dr Pepper have a stake in rather than those brands' signature soda products.\n\nThe energy-drink market has long been dominated by Red Bull, but beverage giants have found their way into the industry in recent years. In 2015, The Coca-Cola Company bought a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage Corp. PepsiCo has a major stake in energy-drink maker Celsius Holdings and acquired Rockstar Energy in 2020 for $3.8 billion. In October, Keurig Dr Pepper announced it would spend more than a billion dollars to acquire energy-drink maker Ghost by 2028.\n\n\"Consumers pick and choose who wins with their dollars. The reality is, it's the soda companies that we're really seeing a decline in,\" said Monahan.\n\nMarket research group Imarc forecasts the global energy-drink market will reach $48.1 billion in 2024 and grow to $80.8 billion by 2033. In contrast, total soft drink volumes grew 1.3% from a year ago after a decline for two decades, according to data from Evercore ISI.\n\nRedcon1 has partnered with IMG Licensing, which represented the owners of Jolt's rights, ECC-Jolt, to make Jolt energy drinks. Monahan said they would release limited-edition flavors to increase interest instead of only sticking with a cola. The company may also launch energy shots, pre-workout drinks and other products, according to Monahan.\n\nJolt Cola, the soda brand that gained attention in the 1980s for offering \"all the sugar and twice the caffeine,\" is heading back to stores in 2025. REDCON1 via CNN Newsource\n\nHealth concerns remain\n\nEnergy drinks have long faced backlash for their sugar and caffeine content, though public pressure has eased compared with the outcry over Jolt Cola in the 1980s.\n\nConsuming at least two energy drinks with about 200 milligrams of caffeine, or more than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily, is considered excessive for most adults, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile Jolt Cola's 200 milligrams of caffeine may seem like a lot, it's nowhere near the leader. Celsius HEAT packs a whopping 300 milligrams of caffeine for a 16-ounce can.\n\nEnergy drinks can also pack a high amount of sugar. A typical energy drink contains about 40 grams of it, according to Harvard University's School of Public Health. That's almost a day's worth of recommended sugar for someone with a 2,000-calorie diet, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nRedcon1 said Jolt Cola will offer a zero-sugar beverage, as well as added supplements.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics discourages children from consuming caffeine, while the National Institutes of Health said marketing has led younger consumers to buy energy drinks for performance boosts. Thousands of people, some of them children, receive emergency treatment related to caffeine use each year, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nMonahan said Redcon1 doesn't want to target its caffeine-filled drinks to anyone under 21. He added that Jolt Cola can attract older consumers looking for \"old school nostalgia\" and young adults interested in a \"throwback.\"\n\n\"It's that thing of, 'I remember I wasn't allowed to have it and it's come back,' or 'I remember enjoying it and it went away,'\" Monahan said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

            "content": "Coca-Cola has brought back an iconic flavour, 17 years after it was discontinued.\n\nNearly two decades ago, the drinks giant axed one particular flavour, leaving fans gutted over the loss of a classic.\n\nBut in recent weeks, shoppers have spotted it back on the shelves. Turns out, the flavour is back, with the NewFoodsUK Instagram page sharing the news.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Lime Coca-Cola is back!! Spotted today at Farmfoods!\" the page revealed.\n\nPeople are pretty happy about the news, with one person writing on X: \"First Coca-Cola Lemon came back, and now Coca-Cola Lime. 2024 is such a good year. Only way 2025 can beat it is if Coca-Cola Orange is resurrected.\"\n\nAnd another said: \"So glad they did this as a full sugar version.\"\n\nWhile a third added: \"I need to try this and find some.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nSome pointed out that there had been a variation of the flavour already released by Coca-Cola - called Diet Coke Sublime Lime - although many agreed that it 'wasn't the same'.\n\nOne wrote: \"Diet Coke Sublime Lime just doesn\u2019t hit the spot, though Pepsi Max Lime has been refreshing as a stop-gap. Having full sugar Coca-Cola Lime back is a real win.\"\n\nCoca-Cola lime is back (Getty Stock Photo)\n\nThe lime cola is available in a pack of eight cans at Farmfoods, meanwhile others have reported it being available at Tesco, too.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt's not clear if the lime flavour will be sticking around temporarily or if it will be permanently joining other flavours including lemon and cherry.\n\nEarlier this year, the drinks giant launched a rather controversial flavour - Coca-Cola Cinnamon Zero Sugar.\n\nThe flavour divided coke fans, with one writing online: \"Who comes up with the flavours I mean cola is okay with lemon and lime and vanilla and cherry, but cinnamon? Not something I'd want to try doesn't sound appealing.\"\n\nWhile another added: \"I'm not sure if I'd like to try Cinnamon Coke don't like the sound of that. I wish Coke Cola should bring back the Diet Vanilla Coke, that was delicious.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nPeople are excited to see the return of the iconic flavour (Getty Stock Photo)\n\nOthers liked the idea of it, however, with a third commenting: \"Oh I remember this. It came out one year only a long time ago. I tried it, was ok nothing special. It's good to see its coming back again. I may try it again just to see if the favourite has changed.\"\n\nAnother agreed, adding: \"It's not for everyone, but I like it a lot when I've had it. Coca-Cola with an after taste of cinnamon, not too strong either.\"",

            "content": "Call it soda or call it pop, but either way, there\u2019s a new no. 2 soda in America, and it ain\u2019t Pepsi.\n\nAfter generations of competition, Dr Pepper has risen past Pepsi to become the second most popular pop in America, trailing the crimson wave of Coca-Cola. Recent data from Beverage Digest shows that although the brands have been competing for no. 2 for decades, Dr Pepper\u2019s new ranking follows a slow but steady rise since almost the turn of the millennium. The 139-year-old brand has benefitted from huge marketing investments, novel flavors, and a distribution model that sees it on more soda fountains than any other soft drink.\n\nOver the past 30 years, Coca-Cola has enjoyed a steady market share of about 20%, give or take a point or two year to year. That outpaces the next four competitors by over a 10% margin (Dr Pepper; Pepsi; Sprite; Diet Coke).\n\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise that the 23 flavors of Dr Pepper \u2013 most notably cherry and vanilla, combined with other spices \u2013 should help it overtake Pepsi in 2024. In a new-look foodscape of swicy flavors during a time of shifting brand loyalties and a pair of generations in Z and the millennials who have demonstrated they\u2019re up for, well, just about anything, the new ranking in the ongoing soda wars is less an anomaly of generations and perhaps more an indicator about where the national palate is heading.\n\n\u201cDr Pepper has distinguished itself through effective marketing campaigns that emphasize its unique flavor and individuality,\u201d said Andrew Dickow, managing director of Greenwich Capital Group and national leader of its food and beverage practice, to FI. \u201cThis strategy resonates particularly well with younger demographics seeking alternatives to traditional cola drinks.\u201d\n\nDickow highlighted Dr Pepper\u2019s 40% increase in brand value opposed to Pepsi\u2019s \u201crelatively stagnant performance.\u201d He also noted that many consumers \u2013 most notably Gen Z and millennials \u2013 want \u201csomething different from the conventional cola flavor.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, the American soft drink market is largely bisected into red and blue camps (no \u2013 not those ones) as consumers crack a Coke or pour a Pepsi. Each brand has its own distribution network and conducts an endless, ongoing, and ferocious battle for consumers\u2019 taste buds during major events and scattered among the endless bars, restaurants, QSRs, and just about anywhere else soft drinks are sold.\n\nDr Pepper, however, is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper and maintains wary alliances with both competitors, meaning that wherever Coke or Pepsi are sold, there\u2019s a good chance Dr Pepper has a backlit button as well.\n\n\u201cWhile Coca-Cola remains the market leader, the rise of Dr Pepper is a signal that consumer preferences are shifting,\u201d Dickow added. \u201cCoca-Cola will need to continue its focus on innovation, offering new flavors and healthier options to maintain its dominance.\u201d\n\nAndrew Springate is Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s chief marketing officer with over 20 years of experience who noted that the brand is growing fastest among Gen Z consumers, and its flavors appeal to those seeking indulgence and something a little left of center. When a TikTok-inspired recipe for Dirty Dr Pepper went viral earlier this year \u2013 that\u2019s Dr Pepper, lime juice, coconut-flavored coffee creamer, and even liquor \u2013 the brand followed suit and introduced a nonalcoholic version called Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut.\n\nTry as I might to find it, I\u2019ve been unable to locate any of the Creamy Coconut (at least in diet form). But there may be a reason for that.\n\nCoconuts for Dr Pepper\n\nDr Pepper Creamy Coconut was released little over a month ago on May 1, and since then, the internet (a.k.a. the culture) has been wildly divided on whether this fan-inspired LTO should be praised or panned. According to data from Pattern, an e-commerce accelerator, demand for the drink on Amazon has plummeted 21% since its release.\n\nStill, demand for Dr Pepper \u2013 the OG Dr Pepper \u2013 has experienced a 26% boost since the debut, though curious consumers may look to TikTok for that as another Dr Pepper remix has gone viral \u2013 the Dr Pepper pickle drink, as ordered by mississippimemaw:\n\n\n\nA pickle-flavored Dr Pepper? It\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility. It may even go well with another summer LTO \u2013 Spicy Dill Pickle Goldfish.\n\nThe Food Institute Podcast\n\nIs it possible to balance a legacy brand and innovative ideas for a food company?

REDCON1\n\nJolt did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn 1985, Jolt\u2019s 72 milligrams of caffeine was enough to cause many nervous parents to ban their children from drinking the soda.\n\nNow, the drink will have a whopping 200 milligrams of caffeine per 16-ounce can, according to the Jolt Cola website.\n\nThe cans will cost around $2.50 or $3, according to a CNN report.\n\nRedcon1 does not want to market the Jolt energy drinks to anyone under 21, Monahan told CNN.\n\nThe nostalgic drinks are meant to grab older consumers and young adults, he added.\n\n4 Redcon1 is relaunching the soda in a partnership with Jolt\u2019s licensing agency IMG. REDCON1\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that thing of, \u2018I remember I wasn\u2019t allowed to have it and it\u2019s come back,\u2019 or \u2018I remember enjoying it and it went away,\u2019\u201d Monahan told CNN.\n\nThe relaunch, first announced in October, comes after Jolt filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009. It made a brief return to Dollar General shelves in 2017 before stopping sales just two years later.\n\nBut the energy drink market \u2014 long dominated by Red Bull \u2014 has boomed in recent years and is growing faster than the traditional soda industry.\n\n4 Jolt cola gained popularity in the 1980s. Bettmann Archive\n\nThe global energy drink market was expected to hit $48.1 billion in 2024 and grow to $80.8 billion by 2033, according to market research group Imarc.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company owns a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage Corp., while Pepsi owns 8.5% of Celsius Holdings and acquired Rockstar Energy for $3.8 billion in 2020.\n\nIn October, Keurig Dr Pepper said it would spend more than $1 billion to buy energy drink maker Ghost.\n\n4 Jolt Cola will have 200 milligrams of caffeine \u2014 more than twice its 1985 dose, according to its website.\n\nJolt will branch out from its cola origins with limited-edition flavors, Monahan told CNN. The brand may also launch pre-workout drinks and energy shots down the line, Monahan added.\n\nThe cola will likely have an easier time this third go-around, without the 1980s-era outcry that demonized the drink over health concerns.\n\nJolt\u2019s 200 milligram caffeine-dose is below 300 milligrams in a 16-ounce can of Celsius HEAT \u2013 which nears the 400 milligram daily limit that the FDA deems excessive for adults.\n\nAlongside the caffeine overload, energy drinks are often high in sugar \u2013 containing about 40 grams per can on average, according to Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health. That\u2019s near the daily sugar intake recommendation for a person with a 2,000-calorie diet, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nJolt will offer a sugar-free drink with vitamins B6, B12 and B5, according to its website.\n\nCaffeine is not recommended for children, per the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2013 though the drinks have become more popular among kids looking for an energy boost.",

            "content": "Many dreams and ambitions never materialize. In NASCAR, you can find a generous spread of such instances. In the 2010s, there was a proposed racetrack across Big Cedar Lodge in Ridgedale, Missouri. However, the plan was scrapped by the Bass Pro Shops founder and owner of Big Cedar Lodge Johnny Morris due to complaints from residents. While this track was opposed, some tracks have been promises that were never kept, notably one by the POTUS Donald Trump over two decades ago.\n\nDonald Trump won the 2024 US elections as the Republican candidate. The POTUS even planned to include a Coca-Cola 600 visit in his campaigns \u2013 but that did not materialize. However, this is only the most recent promise to the sport that Trump could not fulfill. A long-forgotten plan lies buried in his history of interaction with NASCAR.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nDonald Trump dreamed big\n\nWell, the origin of NASCAR was the result of a dream. The passion for stock car racing emerged back when moonshine runners fled from law enforcement. After that, the France family built their empire, step by step \u2013 creating jaw-dropping racetracks like Daytona International Speedway. International Speedway Corporation was a publicly traded company before Jim France acquired it in 2018. By 1999, it owned five racetracks, including Daytona and Watkins Glen in New York. Currently, ISC owns and operates 13 facilities, among the 42 tracks that NASCAR uses across the USA and Canada. Interestingly, Donald Trump also wanted to contribute to this list.\n\nThe first vision came in 1996, when he proposed building a Trump Motor Speedway in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Then three years later, Donald Trump offered to pay the Town of Riverhead on Long Island $55 million to acquire the Northrup Grumman test site. But Riverhead already had a racetrack and local residents protested against the project citing noise and chaos. However, Trump was still determined \u2013 he partnered with then NASCAR president William France Jr. to build a major speedway. It would be 1000 acres big and cost $400 Million while seating 300,000 race fans. According to a Trump executive, \u201cIt\u2019ll be the tallest building in the world sideways.\u201d\n\nvia Imago Daytona International Speedway plays host to the NASCAR, Motorsport, USA Cup Series for the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, FL, USA.

Several sites were considered in the Catskills, northern New Jersey or Connecticut. Donald Trump thought there needed to be a track closer to New York, a hub of capitalism. Yet no architect renderings were made or ever existed. Trump filed a trademark for Trump Super Speedway in 2004, but the application was abandoned in 2008. That was the year when the Great Recession hit, and it axed Trump\u2019s plan. Attendance and ratings began to slide in NASCAR races and sponsors began to bail on their commitments.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s failed dream may have upset a section of NASCAR fans. This year as well, the POTUS was not particularly welcome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nA great racing spectacle was at stake\n\nKyle Larson embarked on a mission in 2024. He became only the fifth NASCAR driver to attempt the 1100-mile Double \u2013 a quest that only Tony Stewart has successfully won. Larson intended to run the Indianapolis 500 in Indiana and then jet to Concord, North Carolina to compete in the Coca-Cola 600. However, Donald Trump\u2019s rumored appearance threw his plan into uncertainty. Trump wanted to become the first president to attend a race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Earlier, he had attended the 2020 Daytona 500 while he was in office and issued the command to drivers to fire their engines.\n\nHowever, the decision to attend the 2024 Coke 600 complicated Kyle Larson\u2019s timely schedule. The airspace around Charlotte could have been restricted while Trump was on the grounds. According to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s website, \u201cNo person may operate an aircraft over or in the vicinity of any area to be visited or traveled by the President, the Vice President, or other public figures contrary to the restrictions established by the FAA and published in a NOTAM.\u201d This possibility jittered Larson\u2019s fans, who expressed their displeasure about Trump attending the crown jewel race.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nEventually, however, Trump could not attend. But Larson\u2019s Double plan failed anyway \u2013 because of rain marring both races. Although Donald Trump could not fulfill his promise, he may have more opportunities to do so in his second term as the POTUS.",
