Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Roche Holding AG RHHBY, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Eaton Corp. plc ETN and National Presto Industries, Inc. NPK.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Roche, Comcast and Eaton\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Roche Holding AG, Comcast Corp. and Eaton Corp. plc, as well as a micro-cap stock National Presto Industries, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Up on \"Narrower\" April 2nd Tariffs\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nRoche\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.7% vs. -2.9%). The company\u2019s top-line growth is being driven by high demand for its drugs and diagnostic tests. Growth in demand for Vabysmo, Phesgo, Ocrevus and Hemlibra boosted the top line. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.\n\n\n\nRoche is also looking to diversify its portfolio in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs (Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera and Actemra) due to competition from biosimilars. Roche has also made strategic acquisitions to expand its portfolio/pipeline. The recent collaboration with Zealand Pharma for its obesity candidate will expand its pipeline in the field of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases.\n\n\n\nHigher demand for immunodiagnostic, pathology and molecular boosts the diagnostics business. However, recent pipeline setbacks are concerning. Roche has also made a late entry into the lucrative obesity space.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Comcast have underperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (-11.1% vs. -2.9%). The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Comcast is benefiting from steady growth in domestic wireless subscribers. The company\u2019s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 holds promise. The technology will expand it much faster and at a lower cost compared with its competitors. Decreasing marketing and promotional expenses bode well for CMCSA's profitability.\n\n\n\nComcast\u2019s streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Recovery in the theme park and movie business bodes well for bottom line growth. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\n\n\n\nEaton\u2019s shares have declined -9.5% over the past six months against the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry\u2019s decline of -11.6%. The company\u2019s Eaton\u2019s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Eaton's consistent research and development work allows the company to develop new products and cater to a wider customer base. Eaton is aided by rising demand from the new AI-data center and contributions from its organic assets.\n\n\n\nEaton has been expanding its footprints via acquisitions and organic initiatives. Reindustrialization and megatrends will create more opportunities for Eaton. Our model expects total revenues to improve year over year in the 2025-2027 period.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Eaton here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of National Presto have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+12.3% vs. +3.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $638.48 million offers strong long-term visibility driven by a $1.1 billion defense backlog, nearly double 2023 levels, with multi-year contracts extending through 2028. Growth is supported by U.S. defense spending, with the company aligned to priority programs such as 40mm ammunition and Ukraine resupply.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, net earnings rose 20% to $41.5 million, driven by Defense segment growth and margin expansion in Housewares. Strategic investments, including a new 507,000 sq. ft. facility, enhance logistics capacity. Stable dividends reflect strong cash generation and conservative capital allocation.\n\n\n\nHowever, challenges include heavy reliance on U.S. defense contracts, exposure to tariff volatility in Asian-sourced segments, and a cybersecurity incident with undetermined financial impact. The Safety segment remains unprofitable, and Housewares faces margin pressure from industry consolidation.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on National Presto here >>>)",

With the support of DriveNets, a leader in cloud-native software, the initiative will now reach a nationwide scale, impacting over 64 million locations. Initially trialed last fall, Janus combines virtualization, disaggregation, and AI deployment across Comcast\u2019s network core. This move intends to enhance network operation management, reduce costs, and boost service flexibility to meet the rising demand for superior Internet connectivity.\n\nBy utilizing DriveNets\u2019 Network Cloud, which handles significant amounts of AT&T\u2019s core traffic, Comcast hopes to transform its distributed physical network infrastructure into a unified resource. This shared structure guarantees zero packet loss and optimal bandwidth, independent of physical limitations.

Our customers are consuming more data, faster, than ever before and we\u2019re driving network virtualization and AI innovation to meet and exceed their expectations now and into the future.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide Janus expansion is poised to revolutionize Comcast\u2019s management of internet traffic, ensuring peak network performance, reliability, and efficiency. DriveNets Network Cloud\u2019s capabilities enable Comcast to integrate AI-driven self-healing features and make dynamic customer experience improvements. It is anticipated that these developments will facilitate quicker capacity scaling to deliver low latency for live-streamed events and other services.\n\n\u201cWe expect to improve efficiency and maximize network performance by disaggregating and virtualizing functions. This also enables more dynamic customer experience improvements,\u201d Comcast stated. These advancements are crucial for integrating AI and machine learning in operations, performance optimization, and troubleshooting. Moreover, Comcast aims to shrink their network facilities\u2019 footprint with energy-efficient virtualized compute platforms.\n\nIdo Susan, founder and CEO of DriveNets, added, \u201cDriveNets Network Cloud enables Comcast to converge and automate its network infrastructure end-to-end so it can scale faster to meet growing service demands. The combination of our cloud-native software and the adoption of GenAI network operations tools enables Comcast to optimize the network performance, increase network reliability, and introduce new service innovations faster.\u201d",

            "content": "Big sponsors cancel support for Pride parades, but LGBTQ+ groups remain determined\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Pride Month comes to an end with celebrations around the world From New York to Paris, Pride Month was celebrated with large parades and celebrations around the world.\n\nSan Francisco Pride Director Suzanne Ford feels both saddened and determined about this year's plans for the city's iconic Pride parade.\n\nThe longtime LGBTQ organization is dealing with the potential loss of $300,000 in corporate sponsorship for its hugely popular annual parade, funding needed ahead of June's Pride Month. Multiyear sponsors including Comcast, Anheuser-Busch and Diageo have all backed away from participating.\n\n\"We're very disappointed. We're hurt. It's not just a number or transaction,\" Ford told USA TODAY shortly after announcing the sponsors' exit. \"We know everybody is facing difficult decisions to make right now. But we're not going anywhere.\"\n\nComcast and Diageo told USA TODAY Thursday that while those companies are not sponsoring the SF Pride parade, they are supporting other Pride-related events across the city. Anheuser-Busch has not returned USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nSan Francisco isn't alone. Kendra Walker, a former president of Pride Houston, said a similar sponsorship trend is occurring for Pride parades and festivals nationwide. The organization currently has a $100,000 deficit for its 47th Annual Houston Pride Festival and Parade, also scheduled for June.\n\n\"It's happening everywhere,\" Walker said. \"Most of us have some of the same sponsors, and once you started seeing cuts in San Francisco, San Diego and here, it's like a double-whammy. The reasons become both economic \u2013 and political.\"\n\nIn the Nation's Capital, organizers of WorldPride 2025, one of the largest LGBTQ+ festivals, said events are expected to go on without a hitch, despite losing a key sponsor, government defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nThe sponsorship shortfalls for nonprofit Pride organizations \u2212 which hold events that attract millions of people across America \u2212 come amid political DEI backlash. In January, President Donald Trump began issuing executive orders to dismantle DEI programs, prompting companies to end \u201cillegal DEI discrimination\u201d and saying they could be investigated for their initiatives.\n\n\"And our country will be woke no longer,\" Trump reiterated during an address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.\n\nNone of the businesses USA TODAY reached for comment said they were pulling funding because of the Trump administration's actions. But Pride Month organizers still feel let down.\n\n\"For years, businesses across industries have proudly championed LGBTQ+ rights, workplace diversity, and economic equity \u2013 not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because it drives innovation, increases the talent pool, and expands the bottom line,\" Andrea Abrams, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Defending American Values Coalition, and a member of the American Pride Rises Network, told USA TODAY in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We urge businesses and community leaders to hold the line, reject fear-driven politics meant to divide, and stand up for the values they claim to support,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nDEI explained: What is DEI and why is it so divisive? What you need to know.\n\nSan Francisco Pride says 'We're not victims'\n\nAnnually attracting more than a million attendees to its parade and Pride-related events in late June, San Francisco has one of the largest LGBTQ+ gatherings in the nation, Ford said. It's also an economic driver as Pride week fills restaurants and bars and crowds the streets, bringing an estimated $500 million to city coffers, studies show.\n\n\"People travel from all over the world to attend,\" said Ford, and planning typically begins a year in advance. \"This is for the LBGTQ community, but it belongs to all of San Francisco, and the city cannot afford for us to fail.\"\n\nSan Francisco Pride has budgeted $3.2 million for this year's gathering called \"Queer Joy is Resistance.\" The nonprofit's sponsorship goal is $2.3 million, but only $1 million has been committed so far, Ford said. The funds offset the free admission.\n\nThe funds will also be used to increase security in anticipation of more threats, given the escalating social divisiveness, Ford said.\n\nFord wished SF Pride could've been better prepared for corporate shifts as Trump's second presidency began.\n\nIn another example, Ford announced earlier this month that San Francisco Pride was ending its relationship with Meta, the parent company of Facebook after the social media giant reportedly ended its DEI programs.\n\nBut Ford doesn't want any pity. More sponsors, like the San Francisco International Airport, are on board. Two other companies Ford initially believed were removing their sponsorship, La Crema, a wine company, and Benefit Cosmetics, remain steadfast sponsors, spokespersons for the companies confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nSF Pride is also seeking additional private donations to cover costs, and it has already received more than $5,000 since word of the sponsorship loss spread, Ford said.\n\n\"We're not victims. It's not all doom and gloom,\" Ford said. \"We're going live up to what we said we're going to do.\"\n\nThis also includes celebrating the parade's 55th anniversary this summer.\n\n\"We\u2019re a beacon of hope and love and we\u2019re not going to shirk those responsibilities,\" Ford said. \"We\u2019re still going to make a huge statement to the rest of the country that we still celebrate our LGBTQ community. We'll find a way.\"\n\nD.C. prepares for World Pride 2025, despite losing key sponsor\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington, D.C.-based Capital Pride Alliance said it plans to commemorate 50 years of celebrations in the nation's Capital this summer despite \"navigating current challenges and many unknowns.\"\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, the alliance said Booz Allen Hamilton is the only corporate sponsor that has pulled its backing from the alliance's nearly monthlong WorldPride 2025 event, which is expected to have more than 3 million attendees globally.\n\n\"We are confident, however, that we will have the support necessary to have a successful and safe WorldPride that meets this moment,\" Capital Pride's statement read. \"That support includes individuals, families, organizations and businesses from across our community, and corporations that truly celebrate diversity and value equity and inclusion for all.\n\n\"Many in our community are extremely vulnerable right now, and standing up for them, with those who stand with us, in this moment is what we all need,\" Capital Pride concluded.\n\nLast month, Booz Allen Hamilton ended its DEI programs, citing President Trump\u2019s executive order pressuring federal suppliers to cancel diversity practices, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton has not responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\n'A first taste': Trump DEI war escalates, reshaping diversity in corporate America\n\nPride Houston says 'Don't count us out'\n\nWalker and current Pride Houston Co-President Kerry-Ann Morrison are optimistic they will find the $100,000 sponsorship funding gap.\n\nWith annual costs ranging from $500,000 to $800,000, Walker and Morrison say Pride Houston is the largest pride event in Texas. They say the parade and festival are among the largest single-day events in Houston, outside of the popular Houston Rodeo. They estimate more than 850,000 people attend monthlong Pride-related events.\n\n\"Last year, we thought we had turned the corner, now there\u2019s this political and financial turmoil, and this year, we\u2019re being hit from different sides,\" said Walker, adding a good portion of funds are used for pay for security and entertainment, similar to other organizations.\n\n\"We keep hearing the words 'political climate,' and that's unfortunate,\" Morrison said. \"Who knows what next year will look like?\"\n\nIn previous years, Walker and Morrison said sponsors wanted their logos wherever they could be seen. But about two years ago, Walker said she noticed that sponsors wanted more strategic logo placement \u2013 and some sponsors didn't even want to be publicly known.\n\n\"So fast forward this year, some have outright said they don\u2019t want the backlash or the negative attention,\" said Walker, declining to name the sponsors to honor their request.\n\nWalker said not all supporters are upset seeing some corporate sponsors go. Some have argued that Pride Houston needs to be a more community-driven event.\n\n\"Well, this is the best time for the community to step up and fill the gap and show and prove they can take care of its own,\" Walker said. \"I think we have enough resources.\"\n\nHaving fewer corporate sponsors also opens the door for local small businesses \"to get some shine,\" Walker said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not June yet, don\u2019t count us out,\" Walker concluded. \"We'll come together. We always do.\"",

The company\u2019s top-line growth is being driven by high demand for its drugs and diagnostic tests. Growth in demand for Vabysmo, Phesgo, Ocrevus and Hemlibra boosted the top line. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.\n\n\n\nRoche is also looking to diversify its portfolio in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs (Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera and Actemra) due to competition from biosimilars. Roche has also made strategic acquisitions to expand its portfolio/pipeline. The recent collaboration with Zealand Pharma for its obesity candidate will expand its pipeline in the field of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases.\n\n\n\nHigher demand for immunodiagnostic, pathology and molecular boosts the diagnostics business. However, recent pipeline setbacks are concerning. Roche has also made a late entry into the lucrative obesity space.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Comcast have underperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (-11.1% vs. -2.9%). The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Comcast is benefiting from steady growth in domestic wireless subscribers. The company\u2019s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 holds promise. The technology will expand it much faster and at a lower cost compared with its competitors. Decreasing marketing and promotional expenses bode well for CMCSA's profitability.\n\n\n\nComcast\u2019s streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Recovery in the theme park and movie business bodes well for bottom line growth. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\n\n\n\nEaton\u2019s shares have declined -9.5% over the past six months against the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry\u2019s decline of -11.6%. The company\u2019s Eaton\u2019s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Eaton's consistent research and development work allows the company to develop new products and cater to a wider customer base.

Growth is supported by U.S. defense spending, with the company aligned to priority programs such as 40mm ammunition and Ukraine resupply.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, net earnings rose 20% to $41.5 million, driven by Defense segment growth and margin expansion in Housewares. Strategic investments, including a new 507,000 sq. ft. facility, enhance logistics capacity. Stable dividends reflect strong cash generation and conservative capital allocation.\n\n\n\nHowever, challenges include heavy reliance on U.S. defense contracts, exposure to tariff volatility in Asian-sourced segments, and a cybersecurity incident with undetermined financial impact. The Safety segment remains unprofitable, and Housewares faces margin pressure from industry consolidation.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on National Presto here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Williams Companies, Inc.

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Seattle?\n\nOur CNET experts rank Quantum Fiber as the best internet provider in Seattle. In our tests, we found this fiber provider to deliver quality symmetrical speeds and unlimited data, making it the best option for most households in the Seattle area. Prices begin at $40 a month for the 200Mbps plan, which is suitable for basic browsing, streaming and gaming activities. For those with a greater need for speed, Quantum Fiber offers a premium 2Gbps plan priced at $100 a month. If you can't get Quantum Fiber at your address, then Astound Broadband, T-Mobile and Xfinity are all solid alternatives.\n\nIf you're looking for budget internet plans in Seattle, we've got some options for you. Ziply Fiber, Xfinity and Astound all tie for the title of the cheapest internet provider in the city, each offering a broadband plan for only $20 per month (though Ziply's plan is $10 per month for the first three month for eligible customers). Each option has its pros and cons, but here\u2019s the gist: Ziply Fiber\u2019s plan offers download speeds up to 100Mbps, Xfinity\u2019s Connect plan provides 150Mbps and Astound\u2019s cheapest plan delivers 300Mbps.\n\nIf you're looking for an internet service provider that can get you the fastest speeds possible in Seattle and money isn't an issue, you'll want to look at Ziply Fiber's 50 gigabit per second plan, costing an eye-watering $900 monthly. If that's more speed than you need, Ziply and Xfinity offer a 10Gbps tier (in select areas), which is more than enough speed to power most households.\n\nBest internet in Seattle, Washington\n\nSeattle internet providers compared Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score Astound Broadband\n\nRead full review Cable $20-$55 300-1,500Mbps None Varies; 500GB-1TB or unlimited None 7 CenturyLink\n\nRead full review DSL $55-$75 10-940Mbps $15 modem None None 6.7 Google Fiber Webpass\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $63-$70 1,000Mbps None None None 7.5 Quantum Fiber Fiber $55-$100 500-940Mbps (varies by location) None None None 6.7 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($40-$50 for eligible phone plan) 87-415Mbps None None None 7.4 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 with qualifying Verizon 5G mobile plans) 80-1,000Mbps None None None 7.2 Xfinity\n\nRead full review Cable $20-$300 150-10,000Mbps $15 (optional) 1.2TB 1-2 years for some plans 7 Ziply Fiber DSL/Fiber $10-$900 100-50,000Mbps $12 None None 7.2 Show more (3 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Seattle\n\nGoogle Fiber Webpass: Don't be confused by the fiber in the name. This is a fixed-wireless option from Google Fiber that's focused solely on apartment buildings. Although it's not fiber internet, it's still plenty zippy: It offers symmetrical gigabit speeds for $70 a month (or an average of $63 a month if you sign up for the yearly plan via a full, $750 upfront payment). Webpass also features free installation, unlimited data and no equipment fees. If your building cannot support the full gig speeds, Webpass will reduce the pricing. You can find Google Fiber Webpass within Seattle city limits, including the Belltown, Capitol Hill, First Hill, Fremont, Queen Anne and Uptown neighborhoods.\n\nSatellite internet: This always feels like cheating, but it must be said that no matter the city or area in which you live in the US, this mode of internet connectivity is always an option. Is it a great option for Seattle residents? If you live in the city, no. You'll have much faster and cheaper choices available to you. Even areas south of Tacoma or north of Everett should have some viable alternatives, but if you find yourself in a rural town with limited options, you might consider it. Hughesnet and Viasat will be your top picks, although both require you to commit to a two-year contract. A more intriguing possibility is Starlink, which just became available in the area in 2023. It features faster download speeds and no term agreement.\n\nVerizon 5G Home Internet: Why choose Verizon's fixed wireless home internet product over T-Mobile Home Internet? On the plus side, it has a much faster average download speed (300Mbps) than T-Mobile. If you're among eligible Verizon Wireless subscribers, it's even cheaper, with the same \"all-in\" approach where equipment, installation and fees are all covered in your flat monthly rate. Where it falls short of T-Mobile is availability. Its heavy reliance on its 5G network -- T-Mobile uses its 4G LTE network more aggressively, in addition to 5G, to boost its coverage territory -- means it doesn't quite hit the same reach.\n\nZiply Fiber: Despite being relatively new to the game, having launched services in the middle of 2020, Ziply Fiber is a viable option if you're eligible for its fiber internet, which boasts unlimited data and no long-term contract requirements. Despite its name, some of its footprint includes the much slower DSL type. A Ziply spokesperson tells CNET that the company is actively building a fiber alternative for those communities, including over 112 projects in Seattle and the greater Northwest. Also, Ziply Fiber is rolling out several multi-gigabit plans, including 10Gbps and 50Gbps options. Confirmed cities around Seattle where multi-gig plans are currently available include Bellevue, Bothell, Brier, Edmonds, Everett, Kenmore, Kirkland, Lake Stevens, Lynnwood, Marysville, Mill Creek, Mountlake Terrace, Mukilteo, Redmond, Shoreline, Snohomish and Woodinville.\n\nCheap internet options in Seattle\n\nThe average price for internet service in Seattle is just under $42 per month. If you're looking for a cheaper internet plan, you'll find the lowest starting price of $10 a month from Ziply Fiber for its 100Mbps plan. The next cheapest options are Xfinity and Astound's $20 per month plans which offer speeds up to 150Mbps and 300Mbps, respectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cheapest internet plan in Seattle?

Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nSeattle internet providers, such as Astound Broadband, T-Mobile, Ziply Fiber and Xfinity, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Others, including CenturyLink, Quantum Fiber and Verizon 5G Home Internet, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nJoel Rogers/Getty Images\n\nHow fast is Seattle broadband?\n\nSeattle is far from being in the first lane when it comes to high-speed internet options. Although the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue region is among the country's top 20 most populous metro areas, it could muster only a 97th-place finish among the fastest cities in the US for broadband. It ranked just below Denver and above Atlanta, with a median download speed of just over 118Mbps. This makes it the 3rd slowest in the US.\n\nIf you're searching for the speediest internet in the Seattle area, Ziply Fiber takes the gold with its 50Gbps (50,000Mbps) plan for $900 monthly. Ziply and Xfinity also offer 10,000Mbps options, which is still incredibly fast for home broadband.\n\nFastest internet plans in Seattle Provider Starting monthly price Max download speed Max upload speed Data cap Connection type Ziply Fiber 50 Gig $900 50,000Mbps 50,000Mbps None Fiber Xfinity Gigabit Pro\n\nRead full review $300 10,000Mbps (available only in select areas) 10,000Mbps None Cable Ziply Fiber 10 Gig $300 10,000Mbps 10,000Mbps None Fiber Ziply Fiber 5 Gig $80 ($105 after 12 months) 5,000Mbps 5,000Mbps None Fiber Ziply Fiber 2 Gig $70 ($95 after 12 months) 2,000Mbps 2,000Mbps None Fiber Astound Broadband/Wave\n\nRead full review $55 1,500Mbps 1,000Mbps None Cable Google Fiber Webpass\n\nRead full review $63-70 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None Fixed wireless Verizon 5G Home Plus Internet\n\nRead full review $70 ($45 for eligible mobile customers) 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None Fixed wireless Ziply Fiber Gig $60 ($85 after 12 months) 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None Fiber Quantum Fiber $75 940Mbps 940Mbps None Fiber Show more (5 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Seattle\n\nSee all results for internet providers in Washington\n\nWhat's a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities all at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Seattle\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclaimer: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Seattle?\n\nIf you've been keeping up with CNET's coverage of the best internet providers across the country -- and I certainly hope you have -- you may have noticed fewer options in Seattle than in other big US cities. On the other hand, Seattle can brag that it has cheaper internet options than most towns and more multi-gig providers. They're spread out throughout the area, but they're there. Xfinity's seven cable internet plans are the most widely available in Seattle. Still, Astound Broadband's four cable internet tiers are cheaper and don't require you to sign a contract to get the lowest price. As we always say, if you're serviceable for fiber internet in Seattle, including Quantum Fiber, Ziply Fiber or Xfinity's Gigabit Pro plan, that should be your top option.\n\nInternet providers in Seattle FAQs\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet in Seattle? On the surface, it's a pretty close race in Seattle. While Ziply takes the crown for being the cheapest -- $10 per month -- Astound Broadband and Xfinity aren't that much more expensive, with plans starting at $20 per month. Each provider's cheapest plan features a different speed. Ziply offers 100Mbps, Xfinity offers 150Mbps, whereas Astound Broadband -- the fastest of the three -- features a download speed of 300Mbps. Show more\n\nCan you get fiber internet in Seattle? Yes. Quantum Fiber and Ziply Fiber offer 100% fiber-optic internet plans featuring symmetrical download and upload speeds. Ziply Fiber doesn't exclusively offer fiber plans. It includes DSL connections within its network, so you must ensure your address is serviceable for higher-quality fiber internet, not just DSL.

            "content": "TSSAA boys basketball state championships: Hillsboro captures first state championship with 4A title\n\nMURFREESBORO \u2015 For the first time in school history, Hillsboro High School can call itself state basketball champions.\n\nThe Burros knocked off Oak Ridge, 57-42, Saturday in the final game of the TSSAA boys basketball state tournament, claiming the Class 4A crown. It's the first state championship for a Metro Nashville Large Class school since 1981 when the former Pearl High School captured the 3A title.\n\nThis was Hillsboro first state championship appearance since 1956. Cortez Graham-Howard led the Burros with 20 points and five rebounds. Max Burtner had 12 points and Jalen Heard finished with 11 points, including a pair of big 3-pointers late in the second half.\n\nTICKETS How to buy tickets for TSSAA boys basketball state tournament\n\nThe Burros Cortez Graham-Howard re-entered the game at the 3:53 mark and hit a lay up to give Hillsboro a 48-35 lead with 2:14 left in the game. Hillsboro fans can sense it as the program inches closer to its first ever state championship.\n\nHillsboro has built a 44-35 lead with its star Cortez Graham-Howard sitting on the bench with four fouls. Jalen Heard has provided an offensive spark in the fourth quarter, hitting a pair of 3-pointers to give the Burros a nine-point lead with 5:03 left in the game.\n\nThe Hillsboro senior and leading scorer picked up his third and fourth foul in quick succession and will likely sit for a good portion of the fourth quarter, but Hillsboro's Jalen Heard hit a pair of shots, including a 3-pointer to end the quarter with the Burros up 41-34 going into the fourth.\n\nOak Ridge has tied the game twice in the third quarter but Hillsboro has built a slight 30-27 lead with 4:26 left in the third quarter. Cortez Graham-Howard found himself open for a layup on a back cut and Max Burtner drilled a 3-pointer in the quarter.\n\nBut Oak Ridge has found open shots off set plays and Ray'Quan Watson continues to give Hillsboro defenders fits.\n\nThe Burros have been patient offensively and that's part of the reason for a low-scoring first half as Hillsboro holds a 21-18 lead at the break.\n\nOak Ridge's Ray'Quan Watson has 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting and has a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nHillsboro is led by Cortez Graham-Howard who has six points. Hillsboro is shooting 8-of-24 in the first half but Oak Ridge hasn't been much better, shooting 7-of-20.\n\nIt's been a slow-moving second quarter but Oak Ridge has cut the Hillsboro lead to 18-16 after a three-point play by Cooper Williams with less than a minute left in the first half.\n\nHillsboro has a 12-6 lead going into the second quarter. Cortez Graham-Howard's shot at the buzzer rolled around the rim twice before falling out. It was the second time in the first quarter that Howard's shot seemed to drop only to bounce out.\n\nThe Burros have jumped out to a 9-2 lead with solid interior defense and a 3-pointer from Max Burtner with 3:59 left in the first quarter\n\nIn the program's ninth TSSAA basketball state tournament appearance, the Bees captured its first championship, knocking off Tullahoma, 65-55, in the Class 3A title game.\n\nIt's the fourth appearance in the last five years for coach Bobby McWilliams who now joins his wife, Dana, as state championship winning coaches at the school. Dana McWilliams has three state titles at Upperman and four runner-up finishes.\n\nMr. Basketball winner Ty Cobb finished with a game-high 33 points with 10 rebounds while Bronzden Chaffin added 12 points and nine board. Upperman shot 52% from the field.\n\nKhani Jonson had 21 points and Xavier Farrell finished with 19 to lead Tullahoma who were only 4-of-17 from the 3-point arc.\n\nA pair of free-throws from Ty Cobb has given Upperman a 49-38 lead on Tullahoma with 4:34 left in the game.\n\nTy Cobb stood and posed for a split second after knocking down a 3-pointer with about 8 seconds left in the third quarter. But not to be outdone, Tullahoma star Xavier Farrell drained a baseline jumper as time expired. Upperman leads 41-34 entering the fourth quarter.\n\nThere were fireworks to end the first half as Upperman's Ty Cobb was fouled and then a technical foul was called on Upperman's Colton Johnson. Cobb sank both his foul shots while Tullahoma's Xavier Farrell hit one of two on the technical shots.\n\nCobb leads all scorers with 16 points and six rebounds. Farrell leads Tullahoma with nine points.\n\nUpperman holds a 16-15 lead on Tullahoma during a media timeout with 4:19 left in the first half. Class 3A Mr. Basketball winner Ty Cobb has 12 points in the first quarter.\n\nLoretto completes its dream season, knocking off Alcoa, 68-66 in overtime, to capture the TSSAA Class 2A state championship.\n\nThe win leaves Loretto with a perfect 35-0 record. The Mustangs are the first public school in the state to finish the season with an unbeaten record and win a state title since Union City in 2008.\n\nIt was Corben Reynolds' block of Condis Cherry's 3-point attempt at the buzzer that sealed it for Loretto. The Mustangs made thing in the extra period, going 3-for-6 at the foul line and giving Alcoa chances to steal the win.\n\nKasen Buie had 19 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks for Loretto. Grayson Burleson had 20 points and 10 rebounds. Mason Tidwell hit two big 3-pointers in the fourth quarter as Loretto's 12-0 run in the period erased an eight-point deficit.\n\nAlcoa (25-6) fell short of a third straight 2A state title.\n\nReynold skied in the air to get a piece of Condis Cherry's 3-point attempt as time expired to seal Loretto's 68-66 win as the Mustangs capture the Class 2A state championship.\n\nLoretto is 2-of-4 from the foul line with under a minute left in overtime and holds a 67-66 lead on Alcoa.\n\nGrayson Burleson made one of two foul shots to give Loretto a 66-64 lead with 57.4 seconds left in overtime.\n\nAlcoa rallied in the closing minute to tie the game and Loretto's last possession in regulation never materialized as the Class 2A championship games goes into overtime, tied at 61.\n\nCondis Cherry's lay up with 23.3 seconds left has tied the game at 61-61. Loretto has the ball coming out of a timeout.\n\nDean limped his way to the corner of the court, near his bench, bent over in pain after falling on Alcoa's defensive possession. But Dean got the ball and drained a corner 3-pointer to cut into Loretto's lead, 56-53, with 2:00 left in the game.\n\nKasen Buie's length under the basket has altered Alcoa's shots. He's swatted three shots. He's also stepped outside and knocked down 3-pointers and is scoring in the post to give Loretto a 51-46 lead with 4:00 left in the game.\n\nLoretto and Alcoa are tied at 44-44. Loretto stormed back into the game early in the period using a 12-0 run to pull in front. But Alcoa responded with 5-2 run to close out the quarter as we head into the fourth.\n\nKasen Buie has 11 points and 10 rebounds for Loretto while Grayson Burleson has 17 points and seven rebounds. Alcoa is led by Jamir Dean's 12 points and Jay Kirk's 11.\n\nDealing with a bad ankle since Loretto's region semifinal, Mason Tidwell drilled a 3-pointer from the left wing to give Loretto a 38-36 lead.\n\nLoretto came out of the halftime locker room like its hair was on fire. The Mustangs have scored the first seven points of the quarter and now trail Alcoa, 36-35, with 5:02 left in the third.\n\nIt's been a fast-paced, up-tempo game in the first half as Alcoa heads to the locker room with a 36-28 lead on Loretto.\n\nJamir Dean leads Alcoa with 10 points and three rebounds. Alcoa has hit 5-of-16 3-pointers and has 11 points off Loretto turnovers.\n\nLoretto, looking to finish the season with a perfect record, is led by Grayson Burleson's 13 points and five rebounds.\n\nKirk sprinted toward the basket on a breakaway, going up for a dunk when he was fouled from behind by Loretto. Kirk grabbed the rim and hung on for a split second before he released it, sending him nearly flipping on his head. Kirk landed on a back and immediately grabbed the back of his head. He got up moments later and walked off the court with trainers.\n\nAn 8-0 run in the second quarter has pushed Alcoa's lead to 12 as the Tornado start to slowly grab control of the game.\n\nThe Tornado blitzed Loretto near the end of the first quarter but Loretto has started to climb back into the game. Kasen Buie's putback cut Alcoa's lead to 24-20 with five minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nBoth teams seem ready for this championship game and the crowd is into it. Alcoa leads 18-15 with less than a minute left in the opening quarter\n\nFor the second straight year, Chattanooga Prep walks out of MTSU's Murphy Center as the TSSAA Class 1A basketball state champs, beating Hillcrest 77-50 Saturday.\n\nBoth teams got off to a slow start but Chattanooga Prep found its rhythm late in the first quarter and poured it on in the second half. A 26-11 third quarter pushed the margin beyond what Hillcrest was able to endure.\n\nDemarion Bowman led Chattanooga Prep (29-8) with 15 points. Joel Bulis had a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds while Derrick Roberson added 10 points and seven boards.\n\nBoth teams got to the foul line frequently. Prep was 23-of-28 from the line while Hillcrest shot 22-of-35. Prep had 21 points off turnovers and held Hillcrest to 13-of-40 shooting (25%). J'acoby Lewis led Hillcrest with 26 points.\n\nIt isn't official just yet but it won't be long before Chattanooga Prep is hoisting its second straight gold ball, barring a miracle rally from Hillcrest. Prep leads 67-38 with 5:46 left in the game.\n\nA couple of huge Chattanooga Prep dunks have its fanbase on their feet as the Sentinels are cruising through the latter stages of the third quarter with a 55-33 lead on Hillcrest.\n\nChattanooga Prep has scored the first seven points of the third quarter and have opened up a 37-23 lead on Hillcrest with 6:02 left in the third.\n\nThe defending Class 1A champs haven't had too many issues as it goes into halftime leading 30-23. Hillcrest closed the gap a bit after hitting four foul shots, two of which came after a Prep technical foul. But it's been all Chattanooga Prep in the second quarter.\n\nDemarion Bowman leads the Sentinels with eight points as the team shot 50% from the field in the first half. Prep has 10 points off Hillcrest turnovers and has scored 20 points in the paint.\n\nHillcrest has been saved by its work on the foul line, shooting 10-of-16 from the stripe to keep it in the game.\n\nPrep has a 26-14 lead with 2:40 left in the first half as all eight of the players that have logged minutes in the game have scored.\n\nIt took a while for the game to get going but both Chattanooga Prep and Hillcrest found a flow late in the first quarter as Prep holds a 12-6 lead going into the second period.\n\nHillcrest has struggled shooting, going 1-ofr-8 but have gotten to the free throw line to keep the game competitive, hitting 4-of-6 from the line. Demarion Bowman leads Chattanooga with six points.\n\nAfter what was a slow start, stunted by a media timeout, Chattanooga Prep has found some flow scoring four straight points to force Hillcrest into a timeout as Prep's bench erupts.\n\nIt's been a rhythm-less game so far in the first quarter but Chattanooga Prep holds a 6-3 lead after Demarion Bowman's lay up.\n\nTSSAA boys basketball state tournament 2025 brackets, schedule and scores\n\nClass 1A\n\nFriday, March 21: Semifinals: Chattanooga Prep 65, Humboldt 59; Hillcrest 44, Wayne Co. 41\n\nSaturday, March 22: Championship: Chattanooga Prep vs. Hillcrest, 11 a.m.\n\nClass 2A\n\nFriday, March 21: Semifinals: Loretto 59, Tyner Academy 47; Alcoa 59, Jackson Co. 38\n\nSaturday, March 22: Championship: Loretto vs. Alcoa, 1:30 p.m.\n\nClass 3A\n\nFriday, March 21: Semifinals: Upperman 55, Greeneville 47; Tullahoma 67, Fayette-Ware 58\n\nSaturday, March 22: Championship: Upperman vs. Tullahoma, 4 p.m.\n\nClass 4A\n\nFriday, March 21: Semifinals, Hillsboro 63, Bradley Central 48; Oak Ridge 59, Whitehaven 53\n\nSaturday: March 22: Championship: Hillsboro vs. Oak Ridge, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMORE TSSAA BOYS BASKETBALL Should TSSAA basketball state tournament brackets be seeded?

She sat on the right shoulder of fellow American Morgan through the opening 2,500 meters of the race. Out front, Nozomi Tanaka (JPN) led the field.\n\nBut with 500 meters remaining, Freweyni Hailu (ETH) made her move toward the front and the field scrambled for position. Houlihan found herself in third on the rail at the bell lap, 10 meters back from Hailu and Jessica Hull (AUS) in second.\n\nOver the last 100 meters, Houlihan made up the gap on Hull and was able to out-lean the Australian at the line. They were separated by just two-hundredths of a second. Houlihan crossed in 8:38.26 ahead of Hull's 8:38.28. Hailu ran away with the win in 8:37.21.\n\nBehind them, Morgan secured her run in fourth at 8:39.18.\n\nThis weekend's meet was Houlihan's first World Championship since the 2019 IAAF World Outdoor Championships in Doha. At those games, Houlihan ran a 3:54.99 1,500m for fourth. That time is the American Record.\n\nHoulihan made her return to the sport in January after serving a four-year sanction ban. She received her ban in 2021 after testing positive for nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. She maintained her innocence over that span and made her return to the sport in January 2025 at age 31. She turned 32 in early February.\n\nShe qualified for the USATF Indoor Championships with her 8:31.56 3,000m at the Razorback Invitational on Feb. 1. Houlihan then ran a 4:20.30 mile at the BU Scarlet and White Invite on February 8 before qualifying for the World Indoor Championships with a second-place finish in the 3,000m at the USATF Indoor Championships.\n\nWorld 3,000m Indoor Championship Results:\n\nFreweyni HAILU (ETH) - 8:37.21 - GOLD Shelby HOULIHAN (USA) - 8:38.26 - SILVER Jessica HULL (AUS) - 8:38.28 - BRONZE Whittni MORGAN (USA) - 8:39.18 Birke HAYLOM (ETH) - 8:39.28 Sarah HEALY (IRL) - 8:40.00 Marta GARC\u00cdA (ESP) - 8:40.80 SB Purity Kajuju GITONGA (KEN) - 8:44.56 Linden HALL (AUS) - 8:44.99 Nozomi TANAKA (JPN) - 8:47.93 Adva COHEN (ISR) - 8:59.62 Yuan LI (CHN) - 9:14.14 PB\n\nA sit-and-kick 3,000m final\u203c\ufe0f\n\n\n\nFreweyni Hailu \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf9 -- one of the best to ever do it over 3,000m -- sprints to a win over the final two laps to win the women's World Indoor title in 8:37.21.\n\n\n\nShelby Houlihan \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8, racing in her first international competition since her four-year ban\u2026 pic.twitter.com/hRTMIldiMv \u2014 FloTrack (@FloTrack) March 22, 2025\n\nFloTrack Is The Streaming Home For Many Track And Field Meets Each Year\n\nDon't miss all of the track & field action streaming on FloTrack.

A new bobblehead series, more theme nights, lots of fan giveaways, and the introduction of new ballpark concessions are attempts to put butts in seats.\n\nDuring White Sox Media Preview Day last week, Boyer was kind enough to grant a one-on-one interview to address the upcoming season. One that will see struggles selling tickets and dealing with a new TV network that\u2019s still not available on Comcast, the largest cable distributor in Chicagoland.\n\nJOSH NELSON: How are Opening Day ticket sales going?\n\n\n\nBROOKS BOYER: It's tough. It's what we expected.\n\n\n\nI mean, we are not blind to the fact that we had some real struggles on the field, and you know, many of our fans believe what happens on the field is the most important thing. We can't control what happens in the Major League Baseball game when grown men have a round ball and a round bat between those lines. We can't control that. We have to control everything on the outside.\n\nThat's why days like Media Preview Day are essential for people to see what we will do. But attendance is beaten up, and the season ticket base is beaten up, as people would expect.\n\nWe are pretty realistic about what's happening, but we're going to open those gates anyway. People will come in, and we're going to try to wow every single person, even if we can't do it on the field.\n\nNELSON: With the ticket sales struggles, is that why you brought back the Ballpark Pass?\n\n\n\nBOYER: Yeah. Even when we were excellent on the field, early in the season in Chicago is always challenging. We have been more of a summer and weekend team. It's a way to get people into the ballpark early and get them used to coming out. Hopefully, that'll continue into the summer.\n\n\n\nNELSON: Lots of fan giveaways this season. What's with the giveaway strategy?\n\n\n\nBOYER: Because we are realistic, we know that we're going to need help selling tickets.\n\nNew 2025 Chicago White Sox promotion item features the four straight complete games in 2005 American League Championship Series (Photo by Josh Nelson, Sox Machine)\n\nWhen you have a unique opportunity like the 125th anniversary, I went to Mike Downey (Senior Director of Marketing and Promotions) and Gareth Breunlin (Vice President of Marketing and Advertising). I said, \"The giveaways will help drive ticket sales.\" I'm super proud of all the giveaways and that we're going to introduce the Bobblehead series.\n\nOur sponsors are always excited about it, and they drive people to the ballpark.\n\nNELSON: How's the new network going (CHSN)? How are things going with Comcast?\n\n\n\nBOYER: Well, we're not on Comcast. We are fully engaged with Comcast and trying to get something done. There's Opening Day on March 27, and then Bulls vs. Lakers that night.\n\nMeanwhile, the direct-to-consumer option is available. We're on DIRECTV, DIRECTV Stream, and Fubo.\n\nBecause I'm a Comcast subscriber, I have one antenna in my house. You can't pause live TV and miss those types of things, but if people want the games, there's a way to get them.\n\n\n\nNELSON: New personalities are being introduced with Brooke Fletcher and Connor McKnight. Are we going to see more of them at the stadium for CHSN productions?\n\n\n\nBOYER: One of the things that will be unique to the new production is that we have the studio on the 400 level. So, Ozzie Guillen and Chuck Garfien will be there instead of being in a basement at the Merchandise Mart.\n\nThe studio is an indoor/outdoor studio. When we open the windows, you can see Ozzie and Chuck on a perch, watching or commenting on the game, which will be unique.\n\nThe way Chris Getz has put together this team is the foundation, and now we're just starting to pop out of the ground in this house. For us to tell that story, a lot of it starts in the minor leagues. That's where Connor and Brooke bring a unique perspective. They've covered much of the minor league stuff in our spring training games, and we will continue doing that.\n\nNELSON: John Schriffen entering Year 2. How do you like the TV pairing of Schriffen and Steve Stone? What are you hoping to see in 2025?\n\n\n\nBOYER: Obviously, you want to see growth. Last year was a terrific learning experience for John.\n\nChicago's a unique market, and he's learned from that. After watching some of the broadcasts we've had so far in spring training, it's early, but he's taking a step forward.\n\nI am so very excited for John and Steve, but I am also excited for Brooke and Connor because they are going to be additive to the broadcast. We built a large coverage team because we need to cover not only what's going on in the field right now but also a lot more in the coming years.\n\nNELSON: How did you like SoxFest at the Ramova Theater?\n\n\n\nBOYER: I liked it, and it was much more intimate. I think the fans who went enjoyed it. I also think the days of big fan conventions lasting three days where everyone is worn out are over. I don't think we'll go back in that direction.\n\nMy feedback from people was that fans really enjoyed being in the neighborhood and enjoyed the fact that we had enough guys there to make it interesting and compelling.\n\nNELSON: So, Flo Rida in June. Are we going to see more postgame concerts in the future or more non-game day events at the stadium?\n\nBOYER: I don't think we'll see any more postgame concerts this year, and the Savannah Bananas is an outside event. Many of those events are outside of the White Sox and are up to ISFA to host. We work really well with them and are always open to more events as long as they fit into our baseball schedule.\n\nNELSON: New City Connect uniforms coming in April. Why the change?\n\nBOYER: It'll be up to your audience to see if we did it right. One of the hardest things we did was going through the redesign because that \"Southside\" look became iconic. It's always one of the top two or three in any sales rankings, so it defines us. But like food and beverages, we can't go backwards, and with the new look, we are not going backwards.",

The project will bring Comcast's smart, fast, reliable, fiber-rich Xfinity and Comcast Business broadband network to previously unserved homes and businesses.\n\nThe planned expansion adds to Comcast's more than $4 billion in technology and infrastructure investments across California in the past three years. The expansion is made possible by a grant from Solano County, through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) and private funding by Comcast.\n\nPrior to the groundbreaking event, members of the internal Comcast Veteran's Employee Resource Group (Vet ERG) participated in an event titled, \"Operation Old Glory\", where they replaced a tattered flag hanging outside of the Vacaville Fire District Station 65 in Elmira. Additionally, Comcast announced a $5,000 contribution to \"Play 4 All\" park in Vacaville, CA. Vacaville's Rotary Club created the park to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities, which includes wheelchair-friendly playground equipment, light and sound minimizing structures for those with sensory sensitivities, along with many other features and structures. Today's contribution to \"Play 4 All\" park is in addition to a previous $25,000 commitment Comcast made when the park was first established.\n\n\"Expanding broadband access to rural communities like Elmira, CA, is a vital infrastructure investment that will bridge the digital divide and create new opportunities for residents,\" said CA State Senator Christopher Cabaldon. \"Reliable high-speed internet is no longer a luxury. With Comcast bringing this critical expansion, more Elmira residents will have the tools to thrive in today's digital world-participating in the modern economy, accessing online learning, and utilizing telehealth services. This investment ensures our community remains connected, competitive, and prepared for the future.\"\n\n\"The digital divide continues to leave rural areas behind, limiting economic growth, educational advancement, and access to essential services,\" added Supervisor Mitch Mashburn, Solano County Board of Supervisors. \"I commend Comcast for working diligently to bring their broadband services to the community of Elmira, which will only help continue to break down barriers. By ensuring that high-speed internet reaches these communities, we are not just improving lives - we are creating sustainable futures.\"",

With just a microwave antenna, he said, dropouts were common and high-quality streaming was impossible.\n\nBecause of his father and grandfather\u2019s work, he said, he was inspired to do something about the issue.\n\n\u201cI knew that it\u2019s possible,\u201d Dally said, \u201cI knew that through work and through talking to people you can make change in your community.\u201d\n\nLess than two miles from Vacaville, Dally said that Elmira has repeatedly seen hardship but has repeatedly been neglected from an infrastructure perspective.\n\n\u201cJust knowing that is so close, it can be really frustrating,\u201d Dally said.\n\nStill, Dally sees potential for Elmira and other places in the unincorporated area. Growth is important, he said, especially with California Forever\u2019s possible plans in the county. Ultimately, he said he thinks Elmira might need to incorporate or face encroachment from other communities.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of areas that could be developed,\u201d he said.",

Brands from 2001-14, executive chairman from 2015-16 and a director on the JPMorgan Chase board from 2001-12.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be appointed Chair of SpinCo\u2019s board during this dynamic time in the media industry,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThis is a unique opportunity to build around SpinCo\u2019s incredible portfolio of assets alongside some of the top talent in this ever-evolving industry. I look forward to working closely with Mark and the rest of the leadership team to create the leading independent, modern media company.\u201d\n\nAlong with USA Network and MSNBC, SpinCo\u2019s portfolio will include Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel, along with digital assets Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and SportsEngine.

This growth aligns with key product developments, notably the expansion of Xfinity Multiview and upgraded internet speeds, which likely enhanced consumer engagement, especially during March Madness. Customers now enjoy increased interactivity through voice commands and access to comprehensive tournament coverage. Meanwhile, broader market trends showed significant challenges, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all experiencing declines due to economic uncertainties. Despite these hurdles, Comcast's investments in expanding digital infrastructure, such as in Phillipsburg and Northeastern Pennsylvania, likely contribute positively to the company\u2019s long-term trajectory, balancing the immediate market pressures from tech sector struggles. Overall, Comcast\u2019s focused enhancements in services and regional expansions appear well-timed, supporting its stock performance despite an unsettled broader market environment.\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen Comcast (NasdaqGS:CMCSA) achieve a total shareholder return of 18.96%, amidst both challenges and expansions. A critical factor has been its consistent earnings growth, averaging 4% annually, underscoring steady financial stability. The company's aggressive share buyback policy, including the substantial repurchase of 49.51 million shares for US$2.05 billion at the end of 2024, further supported share value. Comcast's commitment to rewarding shareholders is also evident in its increased dividends, rising by US$0.08, reflecting a 6.5% enhancement.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure, such as expanding high-speed internet services to new areas like Hagerstown, MD, has bolstered regional connectivity and service offerings. Furthermore, Trian Fund Management's acquisition of a stake in Comcast in 2020 signaled confidence in the company's potential, fostering positive investor sentiment. Despite recent underperformance compared to the broader US market, Comcast's focused initiatives over five years demonstrate comprehensive efforts to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

C-Span\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to NBC anymore,\u201d Trump said with a wave of his hand. \u201cI think you\u2019re so discredited.\u201d\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s bad blood with Comcast, which owns NBC News and MSNBC, goes back years.\n\nIn 2023, during his presidential campaign, he threatened to sue Comcast once he was back in the White House over NBC News\u2019 and MSNBC\u2019s allegedly unfair coverage of him.\n\nHis attacks on the left-leaning sister channel have only ramped up, last month calling MSNBC a \u201cTHREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY\u201d and earlier questioning whether the outlet should \u201chave a right to broadcast.\u201d\n\nDuring his conversation with reporters on Monday, the president, who recently crowned himself chairman of the storied Kennedy Center, said he plans to release 80,000 pages of JFK files on Tuesday.\n\n3 President Trump\u2019s refusal to answer a question from an NBC News reporter is just his latest spat with members of the press. NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n\u201cPeople have been waiting decades for this,\u201d Trump said about the Kennedy papers\u2019 release. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount of paper. You have a lot of reading. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to redact anything.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s refusal to speak with the NBC News reporter is just his latest spat with members of the press.\n\nOn Monday, he signed an executive order gutting the federal agency that oversees the Voice of America \u2013 effectively shuttering the news outlet that for more than 80 years broadcast news into countries where independent reporting is censored.\n\nIn a press release, the White House accused Voice of America stations of \u201ca leftist bias aligned with partisan national media.\u201d\n\nLast month, after the Associated Press continued to use the term \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d \u2013 ignoring Trump\u2019s proclamation to rename it \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2013 officials barred their reporters from the White House\u2019s briefing room and kept them from boarding Air Force One.\n\n3 President Trump told reporters he plans to release 80,000 pages of JFK files on Tuesday. C-Span\n\nThe wire service responded with a lawsuit accusing top White House officials of violating the First and Fifth Amendments.\n\nMembers of his administration and close Trump allies have also called on the White House to \u201cdefund\u201d public broadcast networks like NPR and PBS.\n\nIn January, FCC Chair Brendan Carr launched a probe into the two networks over their alleged use of \u201cprohibited commercial advertisements,\u201d which he argued could be reason enough to yank their federal funding.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire behind the White House\u2019s cost-cutting task force, has also threatened to \u201cdefund\u201d the public station, arguing \u201cIt should survive on its own.\u201d\n\nNPR has reported that it receives about 1% of its funding from federal sources annually, and that PBS receives 16% of its funds from the government.\n\nFaced with the threats, public broadcaster PBS last month shuttered its diversity office and fired two staffers, citing a need to comply with Trump\u2019s order since the network relies on federal funding.",

The package offers a 24/7 stream of NBC Sports Philadelphia, including the network's pre- and post-game shows and other programs.\n\nMORE: Wonder Food Hall approaches big rollout in Philly area, with 7 of 10 locations set to open in next couple months\n\nPeacock, NBCUniversal's streaming library, costs $7.99 per month for a Premium subscription and $13.99 for a Premium Plus subscription. The NBC Sports Philadelphia add-on costs $24.95 per month, which still keeps the combined package below the cost of cable subscriptions that include live broadcasts of the three teams.\n\nThe add-on for NBC Sports Philadelphia is notably pricier than the streaming packages for NBC's other regional sports networks. For NBC Sports Boston, the add-on costs $14.95 per month. It costs $17.95 for NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California.\n\nThe NBC Sports Philadelphia add-on will not include coverage of nationally televised Phillies, Flyers and 76ers games.\n\nPeacock is poised to pick up a package of NBA games next season when its 11-year streaming deal kicks in, giving the platform 100 national games each season \u2014 including Monday night games and doubleheaders. The NFL also has expanded its slate of games carried by streamers, adding exclusive partnerships with Peacock and Netflix last season in addition to Amazon Prime Video's \"Thursday Night Football\" and ESPN+'s \"Monday Night Football\" coverage.\n\nThe new package is the latest effort by parent company Comcast to offer a more affordable option for live sports. In January, Comcast unveiled a $70 sports and news package, exclusively for Xfinity broadband customers, that includes a Peacock subscription and more than 50 cable and news channels.\n\nComcast has seen long-term losses of both cable and broadband subscribers, including many cord-cutters who switched to streaming options like YouTube TV and Disney's Hulu + Live TV. Prices for both streaming competitors crept up to $82.99 per month this year.\n\nThe streaming add-on for NBC Sports Philadelphia will also include live coverage of college basketball and football, the network said.",

A buried NIPSCO gas line still needs to be moved as part of Phase III(A) of the Westchester Liberty Trail.\n\nIt\u2019s not always the case, however, that a municipality and the utility are on the same page, and should a necessary relocation not make it onto a utility\u2019s to-do list in a timely fashion\u2014through some oversight or miscommunication\u2014then the whole project can be delayed. Delays, of course, cost money.\n\nThat\u2019s why Chesterton Assistant Town Engineer Matt Gavelek wanted the Town Council to know at its meeting Monday night, March 10, that Assistant StreetCommissioner Dan Moy once again showed why his colleagues regard him so highly, by expediting action on a pair of overhead utilities which must be relocated for the construction of one of the two public parking lots in the Downtown this year.\n\nLast week Gavelek and Town Engineer Mark O\u2019Dell held a pre-construction meeting with Grimmer Construction, the general contractor on the Downtown parking project, at which it was made clear that \u201cthe critical path\u201d for the parking lot in the 100 block of East Indiana Ave. is the relocation of a NIPSCO overhead electric line and a Comcast communication line.\n\n\u201cIn response, Dan Moy immediately started making phone calls with NIPSCO and Comcast,\u201d Gavelek said. \u201cComcast removed their line with days and NIPSCO has assigned a project manager to work on the relocation. Dan went above and beyond his duties to help with a priority special project and his efforts helped ensure the project remains on schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to give credit to Dan,\u201d Gavelek told the Town Council. \u201cHe came in at the 11th hour and helped us. So props to Dan for his efforts.\u201d\n\nGround should break on the two public parking lots\u2014the one in the 100 block of East Indiana Ave. and a second in the 100 block of Grant Ave.\u2014by the end of March. Construction should be completed before the end of summer.\n\nThe East Indiana Ave. lot will be located just east of Broadway. Twenty-eight new parking spaces will be created while 23 existing ones will be \u201cfreshened up,\u201d as Gavelek put it.\n\nThe Grant Ave. lot will be located immediately west of North Calumet Road and north of Thomas Centennial Park. Sixty new parking spaces will be created.",

            "content": "Understandably, the market has seen considerable movement this year, influenced by earnings reports, concerns over DeepSeek, and uncertainty around President Trump\u2019s tariff policies. With rising volatility, investors should focus on fundamentals, take a long-term approach, and carefully evaluate valuations. As of February 28, 2025, the US stock market was trading about 1% below fair value. Morningstar\u2019s 2025 US Market Outlook suggests that the market was approaching the upper end of its fair value range, noting investors should set realistic expectations for returns. Morningstar advised favoring value stocks over growth stocks, as growth stocks were priced at their highest premium since the 2021 tech boom, while value stocks remained undervalued. In a market where economic policies can quickly shift valuations, portfolio positioning is crucial. Regardless of short-term tariff impacts, investors should focus on stocks trading well below their long-term value while being cautious with overvalued ones.\n\nAdding to market uncertainty is the current government\u2019s inconsistent trade policy. Initially, tariffs were set to take effect on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican imports on February 4. However, duties on Canadian and Mexican goods were postponed until March 4, then further adjusted on March 6, granting exemptions until April 2 for goods complying with the free trade agreement. These back-and-forth policy changes have contributed to market volatility. Despite the uncertainty, history shows that the NASDAQ has recovered from every past correction, suggesting this pullback could present a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Index closed more than 10% below its December high of 20,174 on March 6, 2025. This officially puts the index in a market correction \u2013 which has happened a dozen times since 2010. Historically, the index has delivered an average return of 21% in the 12 months following its first close in correction territory, compared to an annual average of 15% over the entire period. This suggests that past corrections have often been followed by above average gains. Meanwhile, proposed tariffs under the Trump administration could significantly affect trade. As of February 27, 2025, these tariffs were set to raise the average tax on US imports to 13.8%, which is the highest level since 1939. Some duties are already in effect, shaking up the stock market.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other most undervalued NASDAQ stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a turbulent market where growth stocks are tumbling and value stocks have gained, sector valuations are starting to balance out. Healthcare, real estate, and basic materials, which were undervalued at the start of 2025, have moved closer to fair value. Meanwhile, consumer cyclical stocks, previously the most overvalued, have now dropped to fair value. Some sectors have moved differently, like communication services becoming more undervalued, while consumer defensive stocks have continued to rise and are now the most overvalued, trading at a 17% premium.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz screener to filter out stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange with a forward P/E ratio of less than 15. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database, we examined the hedge fund sentiment for each stock and selected 13 most popular ones. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024. We have also mentioned the forward P/E ratio as of March 12 for each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) The Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds?\n\nA couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 12: 8.87\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the most undervalued stocks on our list. It is a Pennsylvania-based media and technology firm that operates across Residential Connectivity & Platforms, Business Services Connectivity, Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. On March 11, Comcast announced a free upgrade to Xfinity Internet speeds for over 20 million customers. With this upgrade, upload speeds will increase by 50% to 100%, making it faster to share large files, work remotely, and upload videos to social media.\n\nIn 2024, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) achieved record revenue of $124 billion and an all-time high adjusted EBITDA of $38 billion. The company also saw a 9% increase in adjusted EPS and generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow, despite facing strong competition and strategic challenges. Total revenue grew by 2% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by steady mid-single-digit growth across primary segments.\n\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 80 funds were bullish on Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) at the end of Q4 2024, compared to 72 funds that invested in the stock in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard\u2019s First Eagle Investment Management was the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 34.1 million shares worth $1.28 billion.\n\nOverall, CMCSA ranks 6th on our list of most undervalued NASDAQ stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Communications giant Comcast (CMCSA) has been delivering quite a bit of benefit for its customers lately, and new reports suggest more is on the way. In fact, just ahead of March Madness play, Xfinity X1 customers are about to get a huge new shot of sports, access to the Multiview feature. That was welcome for shareholders, meanwhile, who gave Comcast shares a fractional boost in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nWith Multiview, Comcast customers will be able to watch as many as four different games at the same time on the same screen. Given that there will be 164 such games running over the course of a few weeks, a tool like Multiview might be one of the best ways to ensure that viewers do not miss a moment of their favorites in action.\n\nAnd getting in on the Multiview action will be pretty easy as well. All a customer need do is bring out their voice remote and say \u201cMultiview\u201d or \u201cMarch Madness,\u201d and the system will do the rest. Plus, Comcast has plans to bring more sports action to its subscribers, a move that seems to be echoed throughout the broader communications market these days. Comcast will have a complete tournament hub available, keeping everything under one roof. Further, an interactive app called Sports Zone will track results and provide schedules of upcoming events, among others.\n\nA Growing Uncertainty\n\nWhile Comcast is forging ahead with its sports content, the rest of its content is looking a bit shaky. For instance, its news division is suffering right now. For instance, MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell noted that he has stopped watching MSNBC. Sure, he has migrated to sister station CNBC for business news instead, reports note, but it still is kind of a blow that he is not watching what amounts to his own channel. Further, O\u2019Donnell also noted his taking a week off of hosting his show, claiming he was \u201cexhausted\u201d from the sheer amount of news generated by the Trump administration.\n\nEven the film business is taking a hit. Focus Features\u2014a part of Comcast\u2014could only bring in $7.5 million in opening weekend business for Black Bag, a feature from no less than Steven Soderbergh. That would be bad news\u2026if the weekend\u2019s winner, Paramount\u2019s (PARA) Novocaine, had not only brought in about $8 million by itself. Reports note that this weekend managed to, somehow, fare worse than Super Bowl weekend\u2019s take at the movies.\n\nIs Comcast Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on CMCSA stock based on 10 Buys and nine Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 14.51% loss in its share price over the past year, the average CMCSA price target of $41.58 per share implies 16.24% upside potential.\n\nSee more CMCSA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Thomas S. Ricketts, one of the biggest names in Major League Baseball, has done wonders for the Chicago Cubs. Ever since the Ricketts family became the owner of the Chicago Cubs on October 27, 2009, they have transformed the Cubs like no one else. Everyone knows how Ricketts\u2019 love for the Chicago Cubs since his childhood made him move to Chicago for college, and fortunately, he was the one selected for the Cubs\u2019 winning bid in 2009.\n\nThis sale turned out to be a deal-breaker as the Ricketts family garnered 95 percent interest in the Chicago Cubs, along with the Tribune Company\u2019s 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet, culminating in a total value worth $845 million. However, the Ricketts\u2019 family holds the control over the joint venture at the maximum percentage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhat does he do? What is his net worth? Into the business side of the billionaire owner\n\nBeing one of the oldest baseball clubs has its own set of advantages. The Chicago Cubs are currently worth $4.225 billion, as calculated in 2024. All thanks to the Ricketts family, who made it possible by making good investments in players, scouting, and development, and also to the fans who instilled their faith in the Cubs for a long time.\n\nThomas S. Ricketts\u2019 net worth is huge considering that he is the son of billionaire, J. Joseph Ricketts, who had a net worth of US$2.3 billion, as recorded in 2018. Considering the business side, Ricketts is the chairman and former CEO of Incapital LLC, which later got into a merger with 28 CapMarkets to develop InspereX, which focused on improving the distribution of income and trading activities. As of now, the Cubs are valued at $4.225 billion, and Ricketts\u2019 net worth is $2.3 billion currently.\n\nHow long has he been handling the cubs? Timeline of Thomas S. Ricketts\u2019s entry into the Cubs\n\nThe Ricketts family owned the Chicago Cubs on October 27, 2009. Tom Ricketts became the board chairman, taking 95% of the ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and also gaining 25% of the ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Although the Tribune sought a 5% stake, the Cubs finally managed to acquire the remaining stake in 2019. However, amid the ownership of the Cubs with his siblings, Tom Ricketts shares some of his upcoming plans and the key challenges he faced.\n\nWhat are his plans with the Chicago Cubs? Know the answer\n\nDuring a recent interview conducted by CNBC\u2019s Alex Sherman, Tom Ricketts has his say on the end of the decade-long television rights deal between ESPN and MLB. According to Ricketts, it\u2019s also a major challenge to compete with big-market teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets, who spend huge amounts. \u201cWell, I think for us, our strategy has been the same since day one. And that\u2019s been consistent, and try to make the playoffs,\u201d Ricketts was quoted saying, indicating that their main focus remains on making it to the playoffs; however, they do not have much to do with the dollars that other teams have.\n\nTom Ricketts has instilled faith in Jed Hoyer, the Cubs\u2019 president, who has turned the Cubs\u2019 fate back from the bad years that they had earlier. Ricketts also talked about having a strong farm system, and with the inclusion of multiple free agents over the last few years, they would definitely look to get back in the mix this year. But that\u2019s not all!\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhen asked about the impact of private equity on the MLB, Tom Ricketts said, \u201cYeah, I think it is a net positive, and I do expect it to continue.\u201d He believed that private equity firms have diversified assets, and just having limited partnership stakes could be a great and eventful thing to happen. And given that the money is going to increase the value of teams as well as improve the liquidity for the limited partners, it might be a valuable investment that Ricketts is planning for in the upcoming times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTo whom is he married? Meet Cecelia Rickets\n\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t know who Tom Ricketts\u2019 wife is, Cecelia Ricketts is a certified dermatologist. Her practice of dermatology involves medical, cosmetic, and surgical dermatology, along with educating patients about the particular dermatological condition and the specific treatment plan that will work for them. While Ricketts juggled his business interests with his ownership of the Cubs, his wife has always stood by his side. They have five children as well. However, recently, the Cubs\u2019 chairman and owner, Tom Ricketts, and his wife, Cecelia, have sold their vintage Colonial-style mansion located in Wilmette for a hefty $2.5 million.",

Its power to bring joy, and the unifying spirit it embodies, are truly unique. We live in a time when technology is driving faster and more fundamental transformation than we\u2019ve seen in decades. This groundbreaking, new, long-term partnership between Comcast NBCUniversal and the International Olympic Committee not only recognises this dynamic but anticipates that it will accelerate. It is our honour to continue to bring the full power of our company\u2019s expertise in creating and distributing content that connects with Americans, as well as to begin to provide even more innovative technological support and solutions to the IOC and its stakeholders in areas that benefit athletes and the many people dedicated to organising the Olympic Games around the world.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), Gene Sykes, said: \u201cAs we recommit to our collective mission, this groundbreaking partnership between the IOC, Comcast NBCUniversal and the USOPC signifies a new era of collaboration and engagement that will enhance the Olympic and Paralympic Movements immediately. With our eyes set on the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 and beyond, we are excited to leverage innovative technologies and shared resources that will ensure an unforgettable experience for athletes and fans alike.\u201d\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s fully distributed coverage of Paris 2024 generated consumption records and milestones wherever fans were watching. The company\u2019s coverage from Paris reached an average of 67 million total viewers per day across its broadcast, cable and streaming platforms. Fans streamed 23.5 billion minutes of NBCUniversal\u2019s Paris 2024 coverage, led by streaming service Peacock \u2013 40 per cent more than all prior Olympic Summer and Winter Games combined. Gen Z powered a record 6.55 billion impressions across NBCUniversal\u2019s social media platforms for Paris 2024, a 184 per cent increase compared to Tokyo 2020.\n\nComcast NBCUniversal has a deep and critically acclaimed history with the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement. Beginning with Tokyo 1964, NBCUniversal has presented 19 total Olympic Games and 13 consecutive editions, more than any other US media company. Today\u2019s announcement means that at the conclusion of the Summer Games in 2036, NBCUniversal will have presented 25 Olympic Games and 19 consecutive editions. Comcast is also a major sponsor of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements in the US, having served as an Official Partner of Team USA since 2017.\n\nThe IOC EB, which has approved the agreement, has also authorised the next IOC President, who will be elected on 20 March, to sign the agreement after taking office in June 2025.",

The donation from Roberts and his wife, Aileen Roberts, establishes Roberts Children\u2019s Health, a 20-story inpatient tower that is expected to open in 2028.\n\nComcast has deep roots in Philadelphia and the Roberts family has been a supporter of Childrens\u2019 Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) for decades. The announcement comes on what would have been the 105th birthday of Comcast founder and patriarch Ralph Roberts, who died in 2015 at age 95.\n\n\u201cOur lives have been touched by Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia in countless ways, and with this gift, we hope to deliver on Madeline\u2019s vision for the future of pediatrics and inspire others to support this life-changing work happening right here in our backyard,\u201d said Aileen and Brian Roberts said in a statement. \u201cCHOP is already the world\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital, where the best doctors, technology, and patient care come together to serve families.

We wanted to create a space that could accommodate the needs of children now and for years to come,\u201d said Madeline Bell, CHOP president and CEO. \u201cRoberts Children\u2019s Health will greatly enhance the hospital experience for our patients and their families, equip our staff with the latest innovations, and revolutionize how we provide care, all while continuing our long legacy of breakthroughs.\u201d\n\nDonations from the Roberts family previously helped establish the hospital\u2019s Roberts Center for Pediatric Research, which opened in 2017, and the Roberts Collaborative for Genetics and Individualized Medicine at CHOP. That program is described as a \u201cmultidisciplinary approach to diagnostics, clinical management, consulting, therapeutics and research driven by the power of genetics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful for the continued generosity of the Roberts family. They have helped propel us to the forefront of pediatric genetics research,\u201d Bell said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll be able to translate that research into extraordinary care more quickly and help more children live healthier lives.\u201d",

NBC also delivers the Paralympic Games, which take place in the subsequent weeks after the Olympic events.\n\nNBC has broadcasted 13 straight Summer and Winter Games. Between 2011 (when Comcast officially acquired NBC) and 2032, the broadcaster had committed nearly $12 billion in U.S. rights, cementing Comcast as one of the largest sources of revenue for the IOC.\n\n\u201cWe live in a time when technology is driving faster and more fundamental transformation than we\u2019ve seen in decades,\u201d Comcast president Brian Roberts said in a statement. \u201cThis groundbreaking, new, long-term partnership between Comcast NBCUniversal and the International Olympic Committee not only recognizes this dynamic but anticipates that it will accelerate.\u201d\n\nAfter the Tokyo Olympics were postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Paris Games helped generate significant revenue for Comcast in 2024. According to its third-quarter earnings report in October, the media conglomerate drew $1.432 billion in ad sales and $474 million in distribution revenue.\n\nThe distribution revenue was likely a result of an uptick in Peacock subscriptions through an additional 3 million customers in 3Q 2024, with 2.8 million coming aboard in the first six days of the Summer Games. The streamer has 36 million total subscribers.\n\nComcast likely drew a profit, though how much was not disclosed. With the rights fee for Paris set at $1.452 billion, Comcast likely pulled in $454 million before production costs and other expenses were factored in.\n\nThe friendlier time zones of Paris proved to lift Comcast\u2019s fortunes, setting the stage for a potentially bigger windfall when the Olympics come to home turf in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nThat said, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal as a whole will look different; Comcast has planned to spin off several of its ad-supported cable channels\u2014Bravo, MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, E! and Syfy\u2014into a separate company informally being called \u201cSpinCo\u201d to stave off the declining revenues that have impacted linear television.\n\nThose linear properties carried live Olympic programming over the years, though Peacock\u2019s growth made NBCU less dependent on those channels during the last Olympiad. Coupled with the shuttering of cable channel NBC Sports Network at the end of 2021, the majority of Comcast\u2019s sports programming has aired on NBC broadcasts and Peacock.",

            "content": "The board of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.33 on the 23rd of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the annual payment to 3.8% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nComcast's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Comcast's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 7.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Historic Dividend March 13th 2025\n\nComcast Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.45 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.32. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\n\nComcast Could Grow Its Dividend\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Comcast has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.3% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Comcast's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nWe Really Like Comcast's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Comcast (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The campus currently has 607 licensed beds, some of which will be converted from double rooms into private rooms. CHOP will have more than 30 procedure and imaging rooms for cardiology, neurology, and other specialties at the site.\n\n\u201cRoberts Children\u2019s Health will greatly enhance the hospital experience for our patients and their families, equip our staff with the latest innovations, and revolutionize how we provide care, all while continuing our long legacy of breakthroughs,\u201d CHOP CEO Madeline Bell said in a statement.\n\nRoberts family ties to CHOP\n\nThe $125 million donation continues a history of giving by the Roberts family at CHOP. The $275 million Roberts Center for Pediatric Research opened in 2017 with the help of a $25 million gift from the family. That gift also helped pay for the Roberts Collaborative for Genetics and Individualized Medicine.\n\nThe Roberts family\u2019s ties to CHOP span three generations, starting with Brian Robert\u2019s uncle, Robert Fleisher. He was on CHOP\u2019s board and got Comcast founder Ralph Roberts and his wife Suzanne Fleisher Roberts involved in supporting CHOP. Aileen Roberts is a former CHOP board member. A member of the third generation, Sarah Hall, is on the CHOP Foundation Board of Advisors.\n\nThe Roberts family has also donated to Penn Medicine, which has clinical and academic ties to CHOP though they are separate nonprofits.\n\nIn 2006, Brian Roberts and his father (whose 105th birthday would have been Thursday), announced a $15 million gift to Penn Medicine in 2006 for proton therapy center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBrian Roberts\u2019 sister, Catherine Clifton, and her husband, Anthony, donated $120 million to Penn last month for the renaming of Penn\u2019s new patient pavilion. It\u2019s now called the Clifton Center for Medical Breakthroughs.\n\nCHOP construction boom\n\nCHOP\u2019s new 1.3 million-square-foot patient tower is going up on the site of the Wood Center, which opened in 1989 as CHOP\u2019s first outpatient facility. The steel frame of the new building is one-third completed, CHOP said.\n\nThe cost of Roberts Children\u2019s Health adds to the billions CHOP has poured into construction in University City and at a site across the Schuylkill River next to the South Street Bridge.\n\nCHOP opened the Colket Center for Translational Research in 2010 ($480 million), the Buerger Center for Advanced Pediatric Care in 2015 ($645 million), and The Hub for Clinical Collaboration in 2022 ($492 million).\n\nOn the Center City side of the river, CHOP is building a 17-story tower that will be named the Morgan Center for Research and Innovation for $480 million. A $50 million gift from real estate investor Mitchell L. Morgan and his family is helping to pay for that center going up next to the Roberts Center for Pediatric Research.\n\nMore than five years ago, CHOP started working its plan for the new patient tower, saying at the time the existing hospital was out of room. CHOP said the system would pay for the new building without borrowing money, instead relying on financial reserves, profits, and philanthropy.\n\nSince then construction costs have increased substantially and the \u201cconceptual\u201d price tag increased from $1.9 billion to nearly $2.6 billion, according to municipal bond offerings last fall that raised $750 million toward the construction of the Morgan and Roberts buildings.\n\nOverall higher operating costs in health care have squeezed CHOP\u2019s profitability. From fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, CHOP\u2019s operating profit margin averaged 2.2%. In the three years before the pandemic, the average was 7.4%.\n\nNow CHOP faces potential cuts to Medicaid and federal research funding from the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has bee updated to correct the age Ralph Roberts would have been Thursday.",

            "content": "However, with the advent of thousands of cable channels and high-speed broadband, the service became increasingly expensive for the city to operate.\n\nSan Bruno had already recently paid for the installation of fiber-optic service in nearly 20% of the city \u2014 primarily in multi-family complexes. However, it would have cost roughly $20 million more to complete the citywide upgrade, which the council declined to approve in 2023. Last year, the council unanimously decided to ask the city manager to begin exploring the sale of CityNet.\n\n\u201cThis outcome was inevitable,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI wish it had happened sooner before it had accrued so much debt.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that all San Bruno residents subsidize CityNet through their tax dollars, even though only about 40% of households are customers of the service.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Comcast has promised it will not increase rates for at least 12 months as it begins converting the infrastructure across the city.\n\nComcast, the only company to respond to the city\u2019s request for proposals, initially offered $7 million but agreed to $8 million if certain conditions were met, including the retention of at least 5,400 CityNet customers.\n\nComcast has faced its fair share of complaints over the years from customers claiming the multibillion-dollar conglomerate charged them bogus, deceptive fees. That includes a 2016 class-action lawsuit in California, in which plaintiffs alleged they were charged $10 extra per month in \u201cbroadcast TV\u201d and \u201cregional sports\u201d fees that the company disguised as government-imposed taxes.\n\nDuring a six-month transition period after the sale has closed, San Bruno will continue operating CityNet while Comcast begins upgrades and starts transitioning customers to its service, City Manager Alex McIntyre told council members at last month\u2019s meeting. For most customers, he said, the process is expected to be fairly seamless and will likely be completed by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like selling a car where they hand over the keys,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cIt\u2019s a marriage of our technology into their technology. It\u2019s more like handing off the airplane midflight.\u201d\n\nThe city manager\u2019s team said it is working on a plan to transition CityNet\u2019s 19 employees into other city departments.\n\nIn a statement, San Bruno Mayor Rico E. Medina said that the evolving demands of maintaining and upgrading the network underscored the need for a partner with more resources and expertise.\n\n\u201cThis transition will ensure that our residents and businesses continue to have access to top-tier broadband services today and well into the future,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Hamilton, the sale is somewhat bittersweet.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a point of pride to be able to say that we have our own municipal cable enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were one of the first in the nation to have one, and now we\u2019re one of the last in the nation to give it up because the sun has set on cities being able to do this effectively.\u201d\n\nBut he said he has no reservations about the decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that this is going to be a great solution for San Bruno,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old solution wasn\u2019t working. The time had come.\u201d",

Discovery\u2019s long-term, multi-year renewal deal for its linear TV networks with Comcast\u2019s U.S. Xfinity video service in the U.S.\n\nIs this enough to counter nonstop cord-cutting anytime soon?\n\nFor its part, Comcast will distribute WBD\u2019s Max and Discovery+ streaming platforms.\n\nWhile terms were not disclosed, it will probably include some ad-share revenue efforts, according to some analysts.\n\nFor WBD, the deal continues carriage for its U.S. linear TV networks including TNT, TBS, CNN, Discovery, Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Investigation Discovery.\n\nThe distribution deal also includes carriage of those networks with Comcast's Sky UK platform, which also included Ireland.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nMichael Morris, media analyst for Guggenheim Securities, estimated WBD\u2019s highly scrutinized TNT network did not get a distribution rate increase for WBD -- partly because the network did not add NBA content for future years.\n\nStill, he estimates overall average revenues per subscriber for the entire package were higher.\n\nThis comes as similar industry deals have been made between other legacy pay TV distribution companies and media content companies -- Charter/Walt Disney and Charter/Paramount -- including future streaming platforms.\n\nBut new efforts to build business will be a long road to travel.\n\nFor example, the September 2023 Charter-Disney ground-breaking deal to have its Disney+ -- and possibly also Hulu and ESPN -- added to future bundles has yet to see any meaningful revenue uplift, according to reports.\n\nCompounding this, Charter has not yet seen a slowdown in overall industry-wide cord-cutting trends.\n\nA sizable portion of pay TV consumers still want the freedom to pick and choose individual streamers, or other video services.\n\nWhy would consumers looking to make a major change for their at-home entertainment consumption want to sign up for any new video bundles that include old-school video services?\n\nMorris projects revenue trends for both distributors and content owners will decline.\n\nFor Comcast, he says that means revenue estimates of $10.0 billion and $9.1 billion in 2025 and 2026.\n\nAnalysts are unsure whether there are any long-term -- or short term -- remedies for linear TV in deals like this.\n\nHow many more deals will continue to be structured in this way?",

            "content": "It\u2019s the $1,000 question: Should you buy your own router or rent one from your internet service provider?\n\nThat equipment fee might not seem like much when you first sign up for internet service, but fast forward a few years and you're looking at hundreds in wasted dollars.\n\nMost ISPs charge between $10 and $15 monthly for equipment -- you should be able to see the fee on your ISP's broadband nutrition label -- while you can generally get a modem and router for less than $200. Buying your own internet equipment usually pays for itself in the first year, but it often comes with some additional headaches.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about the internet for six years, and for all six of them, I\u2019ve carried around a shameful secret: I\u2019ve a rented a router from Xfinity for most of that time. Even though I've always advised readers to buy their own equipment, my rented modem and router worked fine, even though I knew in the back of my mind that it was a waste of money.\n\nThen I took a look through my old bills and added up a number that prompted me to reconsider: $873. That's how much I've spent on Xfinity's equipment fees over those six years.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWith the money I've spent renting Xfinity equipment, I could've bought the most advanced router CNET's ever tested and then bought another as a backup. I could've doubled the internet speed I was getting. I could've booked a flight to Oslo. I was finally ready to enter the world of modem-and-router ownership.\n\nAs satisfied as I was with my Xfinity gear, owning your own equipment is almost always the better option. You'll often get better performance -- my upload speeds increased by more than 2,000% -- and as I say, it'll usually pay for itself within the first year or two.\n\nThe average internet bill in the US comes in at $63 per month -- and that's before you add the extra taxes and fees. Some of these are unavoidable, but equipment rental fees don't fall into that category.\n\nYou might be perfectly content to pay a bit extra for the convenience of not having to buy and set up your own equipment. But if you're looking to save money in the long run, and are comfortable purchasing and managing your own gear, it's a far better deal to shell out for your own router and modem. (You may also be able to take advantage of any low-income discounts available in your state.)\n\nHere's what I've learned about making the switch from rented equipment to my own, and here's how you can make a similar change as painless as possible.\n\nHow to choose the right modem and router\n\nThe best internet is the internet you never notice, and I can't remember the last time my connection went out or I saw a buffering wheel in my home. And this is all with a device from 2017 that Xfinity describes as an \"old Wireless Gateway with limited speeds and functionality.\"\n\nThis goes to show how much the type of internet user you are has to do with what kind of equipment you need. I live in a 750-square-foot apartment, and my internet needs are mostly limited to video calls and TV streaming. If you live in a larger home with multiple floors, the same router likely won't cut it. Similarly, activities like online gaming hinge on split-second reactions. If this instantaneous responsiveness is important to you, it's probably worth investing in a gaming router that minimizes lag.\n\nWi-Fi routers run the gamut from entry-level models like the TP-Link AC1200 for $30 to ultra-advanced mesh systems like the Netgear Orbi 970 Series for $1,400. To test each Wi-Fi router, CNET runs three speed tests in five different rooms in our testing facility, logging results for download speed, upload speed and latency. That process is repeated six times, accounting for variations in network performance at different times of the day.\n\nRy Crist/CNET\n\nAfter consulting our picks for the best wireless routers, I decided to go with our budget pick: the TP-Link Archer AX21, of which my colleague and router connoisseur Ry Crist wrote, \"It's nothing fancy, but it offered near flawless performance for small- to medium-size homes in our tests, and it's a cinch to setup.\" I get only 200Mbps through my Xfinity plan, so the 700Mbps speed the TP-Link hits at close range is more than enough juice and only cost $85 when I bought it. (Several government agencies have since opened investigations into TP-Link for ties to Chinese cyber-attacks.)\n\nA cable modem like the Hitron CODA connects your home to your internet provider through a coaxial cable. Hitron\n\nDo you need to buy a modem?\n\nDepending on what type of internet you have, you may need to purchase a cable modem in addition to your router. Some ISPs, like Spectrum, include the modem for free but charge extra for a router.\n\nThe main thing to look for in a modem is compatibility. Your internet provider will have a page on their website that lists all the models that it works with, and you shouldn't stray from this. You may also have a choice between DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1; the newer standard provides faster speeds, but DOCSIS 3.1 modems are typically more expensive. Other things to consider are the modem's speed limits -- make sure they're equal to or above your internet plan -- and the number of Ethernet ports.\n\nXfinity doesn't provide a free modem, so I had to buy one in addition to a Wi-Fi router. I opted for the Hitron CODA Modem -- a DOCSIS 3.1 model that's one of the cheapest Xfinity-compatible models I could find for $100 at the time I purchased it. It supports download speeds up to only 867Mbps, but that's still far more than my Xfinity plan.\n\nHow to set up your new modem and router\n\nOrdering the equipment is the easy part; the ordeal of setting up third-party equipment is what keeps many customers on the hook for years. The process is largely the same whether you're starting service fresh with a new provider or swapping out old equipment. Here's everything you'll need to do.\n\n1. Activate your new modem with your ISP\n\nThe modem is the piece of equipment that brings the internet to your home through a coaxial cable connected to your internet provider's network. Before it can work, ISPs need to tie your specific modem to your account. If you're replacing old equipment, they will also turn this off as they activate the new modem. ISPs do this by logging your MAC (media access control) number, which can be found on the bottom of the modem.\n\nYou can typically do this through your internet provider's app, in a live chat or by calling a customer service number.\n\n2. Connect the coax cable to your modem\n\nAfter your new modem's MAC address is registered with your ISP, you'll be prompted to connect your modem to the cable outlet in your wall and plug it into a power outlet. You may have to wait up to 5 minutes, and your modem's lights will tell you when it's receiving the internet signal. Once the indicator lights are on, you're ready to set up your wireless router.\n\nThis TP-Link router offers wireless access to your modem's connection with the web (hence the antennas). Ry Crist/CNET\n\n3. Set up your Wi-Fi router\n\nEach Wi-Fi router has its own setup process, so you'll want to follow the instructions provided. In the case of the TP-Link Archer AX21, that meant unplugging the power to the modem, connecting the modem to the router's WAN port via an Ethernet cable, powering on the modem and then plugging the router into a power outlet. From there, I set up my new network through the TP-Link app.\n\nThat's the short version. There's a lot more to consider when setting up a wireless router, including choosing the optimal location, setting up parental controls and protecting your privacy. For my purposes, though, I was ready to start testing out my new internet connection.\n\nSpeed comparison: Which setup is fastest?\n\nI wanted to see how my new modem and router would compare with my old equipment, so I ran speed tests before and after I was connected: one from my desk next to the router and one from the furthest corner of my apartment (regrettably, the bathroom).\n\nMy old modem and router returned 164/5Mbps speeds from my desk and 143/5Mbps from the bathroom -- not bad for an internet plan that advertises 200/10Mbps speeds. But the speeds with my new equipment were eye-popping: 237/118Mbps at both my desk and my bathroom. I didn't just save money by purchasing my own equipment -- I'm actually getting a significant speed boost, too.\n\nJoe Supan / CNET\n\nI have no idea why my new equipment picked up 10 times the upload speeds of my old one. I subscribe to Xfinity's Connect More plan, which is supposed to get only 10Mbps upload speeds. In 2022, Xfinity announced that it was increasing upload speeds on my plan to 100Mbps -- but only for customers who pay for its $25-per-month xFi Complete equipment. Apparently, I'm reaping those same benefits with my new modem and router. My best guess is that the upgrade from a DOCSIS 3.0 to a 3.1 modem is the main reason for the jump in upload speeds.\n\nHow to save yourself some headaches\n\nI eventually got my modem and router set up properly, but I made plenty of mistakes along the way. Here's what I would do differently:\n\nBuy your modem and router on day one. Moving is a pain, and no one wants to make their to-do list even longer, but this is one task where the extra effort pays off (nearly a thousand dollars in my case). A technician may have to come out to your house to set up your internet no matter what, so it makes sense to have your modem and router ready to go in case there are any issues.\n\nUse your internet service provider's list of compatible modems. Routers aren't tied to specific providers, but if you have to purchase your own modem, you'll need to make sure that it works with your ISP. Don't cut corners here. I searched Amazon for a modem that said it was compatible with Xfinity and ended up having to return it a week -- and several hours of phone calls -- later. Your provider should have a page where it lists all the modems that it works with -- don't stray from this.\n\nPay for only the speed you need. Internet equipment is expensive, and there's no reason to pay for a modem certified for 2,000Mbps when you're getting only 200Mbps with your plan. The same goes for routers -- you don't need to pay top dollar for a gaming router with exceptional latency if you're just streaming TV and scrolling the internet.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt's no fun to set up a new modem and router, but is it worth it? Absolutely. Not only are my internet speeds dramatically improved, but I'm paying significantly less for them. I'm saving $15 per month on equipment, and somewhere along the line, an Xfinity agent bumped my plan price down for the next year. My monthly bill is going from $78.54 to $50. That's far more than I expected to save, and my new equipment will pay for itself within the first six months. My only regret is that I didn't make the leap sooner.",

Trump, a president for whom some of them voted, even posted an insulting meme about federal workers on his Truth Social account that showed an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob holding a list.\n\nIt read, \u201cGot done last week,\u201d an apparent reference to Musk\u2019s request of federal workers that they send an email pointing to five things they did at work. \u201cCried about Trump. Cried about Elon. Made it into the office for once. Read some emails. Cried about Trump and Elon some more.\u201d\n\nSarah Boim, a 38-year-old who was fired from her job with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said she grew so distraught that her therapist told her to find a psychiatrist and immediately get on an antidepressant. Boim said she and her husband cannot pay their mortgage on one income and she is desperately searching for work.\n\n\u201cYour career is ripped away from you, with no money to move forward,\u201d Boim said. \u201cI have bipolar. It\u2019ll mess up my life if I have an episode. So we\u2019re just trying to be really careful. I\u2019m hearing stuff like that across the agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew there would be reorganization. I wasn\u2019t expecting this level of chaos,\u201d Boim added. \u201cTaking a sledgehammer approach and having an unelected billionaire in my email is just insane. What are his qualifications for doing this? The government is not a startup; we have been in business since 1776.\u201d\n\nSome who voted for Trump said they regret believing him as a candidate when he said he rejected Project 2025, whose co-author Russell Vought said he wanted to put federal civil servants \u201cin trauma.\u201d Once in office, Trump tapped Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a powerful post.\n\n\u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\u201d Vought said in a speech in the lead-up to the Nov. 4 election. \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.\u201d\n\nSo far, they say, Vought is succeeding.\n\nOne Department of Defense employee who did two tours in Iraq said his post-traumatic stress disorder was triggered to the point that he called a suicide hotline, then visited an emergency room at a veterans hospital. The employee said he and colleagues felt unspeakable frustration and anger after relentless mocking by Musk that was supported by Trump, who he said appeared to be delighting in the distress of his own workforce.\n\nThe worker said his episode emerged the weekend Musk made a display of joyously lifting a chain saw while appearing at a conservative conference. In that same period, employees were deluged with messaging from Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, that ranged from termination notices to confusing emails that were often contradicted by supervisors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the layoffs. It\u2019s about a dehumanization of who we are and what we do,\u201d he said, noting he voted for Trump because he liked what the president did in his first stint in office. Now, he said, he carries guilt over his Trump vote after he watched co-workers and other veterans at the emergency room. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it for the applause. We do it to serve our country and serve our community. You get into public service not for the money but because you want to be part of something greater than yourself.\u201d\n\nKatherine Freeman had been working for 10 months as an administrative assistant for the CDC specializing in tuberculosis when she received a mass email saying she had been fired because of her performance. She had received only positive performance reviews and was in line for a promotion.\n\n\u201cThis really knocked me off my feet to get a generic letter that is basically a template. It didn\u2019t even have my name on it. It was just attached to an email,\u201d said Freeman. \u201cTo tell people who are performing well that they\u2019re being terminated for poor performance and you\u2019re not getting a severance package, that\u2019s just a cruel way to to handle your employees. I think that\u2019s what people are upset about.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody understands that the government needs to spend less money, and we get that. But if you\u2019re going to do a layoff, do a layoff the right way.\u201d\n\nOne VA worker who was just fired, a mother of three young kids, said colleagues all around her are sinking into hopelessness.\n\n\u201cYou wonder what is going to happen in the world, in general. What will that look like for our children?\u201d she said. \u201cFor other people\u2019s kids, they say, \u2018It\u2019s not just my life, but my children\u2019s lives. Where are we going?\u2019\u201d\n\nA different VA worker who served in the Navy for more than a decade described having dropped 20 pounds in a month and losing her hair. She, like others, described behavior from Musk and Trump as taunting and triggering a sense of powerlessness and anger. Reaching a breaking point, she called a suicide hotline for help.\n\n\u201cServing my vets is what I live for. They need me. They need an understanding person on the other end of the phone call,\u201d said the woman. \u201cI will be destroyed if they fire me.\u201d\n\nNone of the workers opposed cutting excess. But many described what they saw playing out in their agencies as chaotic and haphazard \u2014 like rushing to push boxes off a sinking Titanic without looking at what was inside. Some said their abrupt dismissal would leave programs in the lurch, like those that help farmers or facilitate trade for small businesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like so many other government employees I talked to. It\u2019s their f-----g mission in life to help veterans who are struggling. Please quote me on that,\u201d the VA suicide prevention manager said. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to have a person that can, to my face, tell me that my job is not needed. I just tell people what I do and ask them to explain to me: What part of my job is waste or fraud?\u201d\n\nThe defense employee, whose job entails refurbishing and updating technology on Navy ships, said the constant attack on federal workers has made him want to walk away, move to the private sector and draw a bigger salary. But he recalled during one of his Army tours in Iraq that his unit needed armor reinforcement on its Humvee. A federal worker came through for him in that perilous moment.\n\n\u201cI get to do that now, with sailors in the Navy. I\u2019m working to help sailors in the Navy be prepared to engage the Chinese if they go after Taiwan,\u201d the defense worker said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to quit, not going to give up. Because I\u2019m not just giving up on my country, I\u2019m giving up on the sailor and the war fighter that is going to be in immense danger if I do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of us are remembering: what we do and why we do it, and it\u2019s bigger than this stupid political stuff. This is people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or chat live at 988lifeline.org.

Orange also provides telecommunication and mobile banking services in other countries around the world.\n\nIts name is derived from Orange, which was the dominant mobile service provider in France and a major player in Great Britain when France T\u00e9l\u00e9com purchased it in 2000; the company was rebranded as Orange SA in 2013. As of 2024, the company serves more than 287 million customers.\n\nA 100-year monopoly\n\nAs telephone service became available in France in the late 19th century, several private companies operated under a license from the French government. In 1880 these companies were merged into a single network called the Societ\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Telephones (SGT). The network (i.e., the entire French telephone industry) was nationalized in 1889 and operated as a government-controlled monopoly until 1988, when the French government established France T\u00e9l\u00e9com as an independent entity.\n\nIt retained its monopoly status until January 1, 1998, when new European Union regulations mandated competition in member states\u2019 telecommunications sector. Ahead of the measure, in 1997, the government offered 20% of the company to the public. After additional sales of shares to the public in 2000 and 2001, the French government held just over 50% of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com.\n\n21st century: Orange takeover, financial difficulties, and privatization\n\nIn August 2000 France T\u00e9l\u00e9com acquired U.K. telecommunications service provider Orange plc in a deal valued at \u20ac39.7 billion ($37.7 billion). Other acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 included:\n\nGlobalOne , which started out as a joint venture between France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Sprint, and Deutsche Telekom.\n\n, which started out as a joint venture between France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Sprint, and Deutsche Telekom.

After the company\u2019s finances were stabilized, the government continued a gradual reduction in its ownership stake. By 2004, the government no longer held a majority stake, and by the time France T\u00e9l\u00e9com was rebranded as Orange SA in 2013, the French government\u2019s direct stake was about 13.5%.\n\nDuring the 2010s and early 2020s, Orange focused on growing its telecommunications presence in emerging markets, expanding its business services offerings to include cybersecurity (Orange Cyberdefense), and branching out into financial services through its mobile banking platform Orange Money, which as of 2025 hosts 37 million active users across 17 countries in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn 2017, Orange entered the retail banking market with the launch of Orange Bank. After expanding throughout France and into neighboring Spain, in 2023 it decided to pull out of the banking market and transfer its customer base to BNP Paribas.",

(NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other most undervalued large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOn March 4, David Katz, Chief Investment Officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to share his perspective on the current state of the bull market and what February\u2019s mixed action and sector rotation might signal for the rest of the year. Katz acknowledged that while people might not want to hear it, the volatility seen in February is likely to persist throughout the year, with both upside and downside movements. He emphasized that this creates opportunities for investors but also necessitates caution. Katz highlighted several positive factors supporting the market, which included a strong economy and solid corporate performance. However, he expressed concerns about certain policies from the administration, such as tariffs, immigration, and the relationship with the Fed. While these issues have been largely ignored by the market so far, Katz warned that they could eventually lead to a 3-5% correction. Despite this, he remained optimistic about the economy\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges and recommended buying into market dips rather than chasing rallies.\n\nTo support his sentiment, Katz pointed to companies that have already experienced significant corrections and are positioned to perform well regardless of broader market movements. He highlighted their strong fundamentals, attractive valuations (most trading at under 13-14 times earnings), and good outlooks. He also noted that last year\u2019s market leaders have slowed significantly, while sectors that underperformed are beginning to show meaningful improvement, a trend he expects to continue. This sector rotation suggests that investors should be prepared to adapt their strategies as different sectors gain momentum throughout the year.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks trading between $10 billion and $200 billion. We then selected stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15 and made a list of 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Companies that Just Raised their Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other companies that just raised their dividends.\n\nDividend stocks have been attracting investor interest for quite some time, consistently delivering strong performances that highlight their long-term appeal. This growing investor preference has led many major technology companies to introduce dividend payments. As a result, dividends are no longer limited to traditional value stocks, with growth-oriented firms also emerging as significant dividend payers.\n\nHistorical trends show that dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed other asset classes across various market cycles. A report from T. Rowe Price highlights that dividends have made up nearly one-third of total equity returns for US stocks since 1926. During the period from 1980 to 2019, which saw a decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the broader market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nBy the end of September 2024, approximately 80% of companies in the broader market were distributing dividends\u2014a proportion that has remained relatively steady over the past decade. Notably, the technology sector represented nearly 24% of dividend-paying companies, a significant rise from 13% ten years ago. Other industries, such as healthcare and industrials, also experienced an uptick in firms offering dividends. This broader availability of dividend-paying stocks has provided income-focused investors with more opportunities to gain exposure to high-growth and innovative businesses. Given these developments, analysts maintain a positive outlook for dividend stocks as they head into 2025.\n\nDividend growth is closely tied to a strong earnings season. In February, the broader market struggled, declining by over 2% as concerns about inflation, upcoming tariffs under former President Donald Trump, and escalating geopolitical tensions weighed on investor sentiment. On February 28, the major index briefly dipped into negative territory for 2025. However, corporate earnings reports for the fourth quarter have provided a fresh catalyst for the market.\n\nAs of February 28, nearly 97% of companies in the broader market had reported earnings, with over 75% surpassing analyst expectations, according to FactSet. Many of these companies delivered encouraging news for income-focused investors. In the week ending February 25, data from JPMorgan showed that 20 companies announced dividend increases, with no reports of dividend cuts or suspensions during that period. This is positive for income investors, as dividend growth is always a welcomed development for them.\n\nHoward Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, made the following comment about the situation:\n\n\u201cMany companies have the ability and cash-flow to increase their dividend payments, but remain concerned over the economy, government spending and taxing policy. Given the continued economic growth with lower interest rates and the relatively low unemployment rate, a clearer picture of potential policy should emerge in the first quarter, at which time more companies can better evaluate their future commitment.\u201d\n\nCompanies continued to raise their dividends throughout the fourth quarter of 2024. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices noted that 635 dividend hikes were recorded during the quarter, totaling $14.2 billion. Over the 12-month period, total dividend increases reached $71.4 billion, marking an increase from $65.1 billion in the previous year.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned the list of companies that raised their dividend payouts in 2025 so far. Then, we picked prominent companies with strong dividend histories and solid cash positions. From that group, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holders.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Meanwhile, Verizon and T-Mobile offer 5G home internet, but coverage varies -- Verizon is stronger in outlying areas, while T-Mobile covers both urban and suburban spots, though speeds may dip near tourist hotspots.\n\nOrlando may be known for its theme parks, but when it comes to internet, your options are just as plentiful.\n\nBest internet in Orlando, Florida, in 2025\n\nOrlando internet providers compared Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score AT&T Fiber\n\nRead full review Fiber $55-$245 300-5,000Mbps None None None 7.4 CenturyLink\n\nRead full review DSL $55 10-100Mbps $15 modem None None 6.7 Spectrum\n\nRead full review Cable $25-$70 50-1,000Mbps Free modem, $10 router (optional) on lower plans None None 7.2 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$55 for eligible mobile customers) 72-245Mbps None None None 7.4 Quantum Fiber Fiber $50-$95 500-2,000Mbps None None None 6.7 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 with qualifying Verizon 5G mobile plans) 50-250Mbps (varies by location) None None None 7.2 Xfinity\n\nRead full review Cable $35-$95 (varies by location) 150-2,000Mbps $15-$25 included in some plans 1.2TB on some plans 1-2 years on some plans 7 Show more (2 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available Orlando internet providers\n\nCenturyLink: DSL internet service from CenturyLink is an option throughout much of the regions surrounding Orlando to the north, west and south, but availability is scarce in the city. Service costs a flat $55 per month with no data caps or preset price increases, which are pretty appealing by home internet standards. Speeds will vary from address to address; in most parts of the coverage map, they won't exceed double digits. Unless you have your own equipment, you'll also need to spend $15 monthly to rent the gateway device that brings your home online.\n\nQuantum Fiber: With speeds that typically won't surpass double digits, CenturyLink's DSL plans are pretty ho-hum as far as home internet is concerned -- but CenturyLink's parent company, Lumen Technologies, also offers fiber internet service in the Orlando area, and that's where things get interesting. Branded as Quantum Fiber, the service offers matching upload and download speeds of 500Mbps for $50 per month, equipment rental included. A faster gigabit plan with download speeds of 940Mbps is also available at some addresses for $75 monthly. Those plans don't come with data caps or prescheduled price increases after one year, making them an excellent option -- if they're available at your address.\n\nSatellite internet: Satellite internet from Hughesnet or Viasat is available pretty much anywhere. Still, you shouldn't expect fast speeds or low latency, given that your traffic needs to go to space and back. You shouldn't expect value, either. Satellite internet often comes with steep equipment costs and tight data caps. Depending on your provider, it may also come with long-term service contracts. Your other option is Starlink, the satellite internet service from SpaceX and Elon Musk. It doesn't come with soft data caps like Hughesnet and Viasat plans do, and the speeds will likely be a bit higher than either of those competitors. The upfront equipment cost of $349 and monthly rate of $120 are tough pills to swallow.\n\nVerizon 5G Home Internet: Verizon is putting more of a focus on 5G with its service, which means that the range of potential speeds at your address is notably higher than you'll see from T-Mobile. That also means that fewer addresses will have the right kind of signal strength to even be eligible for service. If you're planning on going with 5G, Verizon's potential for faster speeds means it's worth checking to see if it's available at your address. This is especially true for existing Verizon mobile subscribers, who may be able to sign up for home internet service for $35-$45.\n\nCheap internet options in Orlando\n\nIn most cases, home internet starts at about $50 per month in Orlando, although some residents within Spectrum's footprint will be able to sign up for internet service at $25 per month if they qualify for Internet Assist, which is the most affordable starting rate in the city. Here's a look at how all of the top providers' most affordable plans compare:\n\nWhat's the cheapest plan in Orlando?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nJohn Coletti/Getty Images\n\nHow fast is broadband in Orlando?\n\nAmong US metro regions, the Orlando area ranks 59th as far as median internet speeds go, with an average household download speed of 227Mbps as per the speed-testing site Ookla.

Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Orlando FAQ\n\nHow fast is home internet in Orlando? According to 2024-2025 monthly historical data from the speed-testing website Ookla, the average home internet speeds in Orlando clock in at approximately 344 megabits per second, with AT&T topping the list of the fastest internet providers in the area. Orlando's internet speeds are 59th fastest in the country, per Ookla. Show more\n\nDoes Orlando have Google Fiber? Google Fiber is not available in Orlando or any part of Florida.

Not only can internet infrastructure be easily damaged by the fighting, but the Russian military frequently uses \u201cjamming\u201d techniques that block connections. Ukraine\u2019s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, told the FT that about 40,000 Starlink terminals are in use across the country.\n\nThe news comes after reports surfaced last month that the US had threatened to cut off access to Starlink if Ukraine failed to agree to a deal giving it access to mineral resources. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk denies it, calling Reuters, which first reported the rumors, \"legacy news liars\" in a post on X.\n\nDespite the importance of Starlink to Ukraine's infrastructure, Europe could still potentially provide a partial solution if Starlink access were cut off. The FT reports that \u201ca patchwork\u201d of European services owned by European companies could provide backup, such as for critical operations like government infrastructure or healthcare.\n\nHowever, this approach would have significant limitations. Lluc Palerm Serra, research director at consultancy Analysys Mason, told the FT that none of these possible alternatives \u201ccan offer the level of supply that Starlink has.\u201d\n\nAt present, Eutelsat is one of the small number of satellite networks that can provide functioning global internet coverage that can compete with Starlink. Its share price has skyrocketed since the high-profile public argument between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week.\n\nEurope is making headway toward creating its own satellite internet infrastructure to reduce its reliance on Starlink, but it may be a long time before these plans come to fruition. The European Union plans to launch IRIS\u00b2, its low-orbit satellite network, in 2027, but it is not expected to be operational until the early 2030s.\n\nBut it's not just European leaders who are concerned about the possibility of Ukraine losing access to vital connectivity. Grassroots efforts have emerged on social networks like Reddit and X in recent weeks, with people encouraging users to boycott Starlink if it cuts off access to the war-torn country.",

            "content": "By Peter Gregory\n\nMarch 7, 2025 ByMarch 7, 2025\n\nIn my previous blog post, I detailed the impact that the Trump administration has already had in just a few weeks on progress in achieving digital equity through its attack campaign on Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiatives. As it turns out\u2026 the FCC has not been far behind. On February 11, Newsmax obtained a letter from the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts seeking to open an FCC Enforcement Bureau investigation to \u201croot out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\u201d Yes, this sounds hard to believe\u2026 Chairman Carr, here, is saying he is actively seeking to root out diversity, equity, and inclusion across several sectors through broad federal power. In this letter, which made its way into Newsmax\u2019s hands somehow before even being seen by the public for which the FCC serves, Chairman Carr claims that Comcast/NBCUniversal\u2019s DEI initiatives are \u201cinvidious forms of discrimination [that] cannot be squared with any reasonable interpretation of federal law\u201d and therefore seeks to ensure that Comcast companies are not promoting discrimination that violates FCC statute or civil rights law.\n\nChairman Carr writes that he is starting this broad DEI-investigation effort with Comcast for two reasons: (1) there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Comcast is \u201cstill engaging in the promotion of DEI,\u201d and (2) Comcast \u201ccompanies cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC \u2014 from cable to high-speed internet and from broadcast TV stations to MVNO [mobile virtual network operator] wireless offerings.\u201d What the FCC Chair fails to do is provide a valid reason or any substantive evidence for this wasteful investigation in the first place. Only citing Comcast\u2019s website listing DEI as \u201ca core value of [its] business,\u201d reports on Comcast\u2019s \u201cDEI infrastructure,\u201d \u201cDEI day[s],\u201d and \u201cDEI training for company leaders,\u201d and NBCUniversal\u2019s similar initiatives, Chairman Carr is unable to show any evidence of \u201cillegal\u201d DEI practices (DEI is not illegal). Likely because this is a politically-fueled probe only to advance Trump\u2019s agenda to claw back progress, censor and intimidate the media, and ignore decades of precedent and the law in general.\n\nAdding more fuel to the fire, Chairman Carr is continuing his (and Trump\u2019s) anti-DEI agenda, having also initiated a similar investigation into Verizon\u2019s DEI policies as part of its ongoing merger proceeding before the FCC. Typically, Chairman Carr has used his power to hold up mergers, as he did with Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Frontier. But \u2013 as the Verizon letter points out \u2013 Chairman Carr will not hesitate to launch a spurious \u201cinvestigation\u201d to attempt to intimidate the industries he regulates. Is this just the Carr FCC\u2019s new trend?\n\nChairman Carr is starting this investigation effort with Comcast just to make a political statement.\n\nComcast, on its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion webpage, appears to have a four-pronged commitment to DEI: (1) Employees: promoting opportunities for all and a culture of diversity and inclusion, (2) Digital Equity: committing $1 billion to advance digital equity through Project UP, (3) Media, Awareness & Education: highlighting diverse voices and inclusive cultures to help shed light on inequality, and (4) Small Business: supporting small businesses with grants, technology, and marketing. While this post won\u2019t get into every detail of Comcast\u2019s DEI policies, several impacts listed below shed light on what exactly Comcast may be doing that rises to a level of importance for Chairman Carr to use taxpayer funds to launch the politically-driven investigation of what is supposed to be an independent federal agency.\n\nIn reality, there is little evidence that Comcast is doing anything \u201cinvidious\u201d and the data really just shows that Comcast is doing things that uplift communities who need support the most \u2013 what is wrong with that? I encourage the reader to view Comcast\u2019s 2024 Impact Report to learn more about Comcast\u2019s impact on closing the digital divide through Project UP, advancing DEI in the workplace, and supporting the environment. On the numbers, Comcast has a total workforce comprised of 37.1% women and 46.3% people of color \u2013 but DEI doesn\u2019t just boil down to those numbers; it is bigger than that. DEI initiatives lead to the employment of veterans and disabled or low-income workers so they are not overlooked due to their background, truly helping to level the playing field for everyone. To this extent, Comcast boasts that its commitment to DEI has increased supplier diversity, supported veterans through Hiring Our Heroes, made programming more accessible, and given $463 million through community support initiatives in 2023 alone.\n\nSo, why Comcast?\n\nThere doesn\u2019t really seem to be an explanation other than the fact that this is a politically driven witch-hunt aimed at one of the largest cable operators and internet service providers in the country for the express purpose of getting Comcast to censor itself. President Trump routinely attacks Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and Comcast-owned networks such as MSNBC, and broadcast programs such as Saturday Night Live. This is an assault on a provider that sometimes shows views opposite of the Chairman and the Trump administration \u2013 a company whose views have already been sued by Trump, whose news networks often oppose his policies, and whose DEI efforts are against the administration\u2019s oppressive agenda.\n\nIn the best light, this investigation is about discouraging inclusion that is required by law. However, it appears more likely that it is part of Chairman Carr\u2019s general vendetta against Comcast\u2019s subsidiary NBC for airing Saturday Night Live sketches that mock President Trump, or submission to Trump\u2019s disdain for news anchors challenging him on MSNBC.\n\nThis broad investigation into DEI represents a complete reversal from years of longstanding policy that supports diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nChairman Carr\u2019s action in initiating this investigation into Comcast\u2019s DEI policies conflicts with the Commission\u2019s longstanding policy and directive to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the communications sector. Tenets that are the foundation of the Communications Act of 1934, which created the FCC, promoted these ideals over 90 years ago. Over the years, Congress, the only governing body that has any control over what the Commission can and cannot do, has passed laws supporting the promotion of the D, the E, and the I of DEI. For example, in Section 60506 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress directed the FCC to make rules to facilitate equal access to broadband internet access service, leading to the Commission\u2019s promulgation of its Digital Discrimination Order. Chairman Carr\u2019s attack on Comcast\u2019s DEI policies is contrary to the law created by Congress and past policy of the Commission.\n\nTurning first to the Communications Act, the law is clear. In contemplating market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and small businesses, the Commission is instructed to promote \u201cdiversity of media voices, vigorous economic competition, technological advancement, and promotion of the public interest.\u201d Furthermore, the Commission must promote \u201cdiversity in the multichannel video programming market.\u201d Statute even created an Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth at the NTIA, which is tasked to \u201cconnect with communities that need access to high-speed internet and improved digital inclusion efforts through various forms\u2026\u201d thereby demonstrating Congress\u2019 preference for diversity and digital inclusion. And even one of the most foundational tenets of the Communications Act, universal service, cannot be contemplated without the consideration of DEI principles. How is this \u2013 universal service to all Americans \u2013 to be imagined or achieved without diversity, equity, and inclusion?\n\nIn several other laws too, Congress has made clear the national policy of diversity, equity, and inclusion in communications. In 1999, Congress determined \u201c[i]t is in the public interest to promote diversity in television programming\u2026\u201d And in 1992, Congress found there is \u201ca substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media,\u201d and even found that \u201cincreased numbers of females and minorities in positions of management authority in the cable and broadcast television industries advances the Nation\u2019s policy favoring diversity in the expression of views in the electronic media.\u201d\n\nCongress\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s more recent actions focusing on broadband further underscore the importance of DEI in achieving the goals of the Communications Act. In 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on a bipartisan basis in which \u201cequity\u201d in the telecommunications industry was specifically emphasized. Notably, this includes the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) and the Digital Equity Act, which both contain the word equity in their titles. And beyond this, the IIJA instructed the Commission to make rules related to equity, which it did according to law. This mandate includes an explicit finding that \u201cthe digital divide disproportionately affects communities of color, lower-income areas, and rural areas, and the benefits of broadband should be broadly enjoyed by all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Commission too previously blessed Comcast\u2019s adoption of the very sort of DEI practices Chairman Carr is attacking now. In 2011, when the Commission approved the merger between Comcast and NBCUniversal, it cited with approval of Comcast\u2019s \u201cDiversity Memorandum\u201d and other merger commitments to civil rights organizations and labor unions, such as workforce recruitment focused on Hispanic populations and a \u201ccomprehensive series of initiatives to continually improve diversity at all levels\u201d (emphasis added) that targeted workplace diversity. Furthermore, of relevance here, the Commission observed that overall it is the \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, along with relevant state authorities, [which] oversees the laws on workforce discrimination and diversity\u201d \u2013 not the FCC.\n\nAll of the above clearly demonstrates a long-standing policy of diversity, equity, and inclusion as it relates to advancing the communication sector. DEI does not mean that a company is hiring based on race. It means that a company is uplifting all Americans by prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion through programs that can include community investment, fair hiring practices, equal workplace support, training, and more. While these programs may focus on race, they also focus on underserved populations, low-income consumers, veterans, gender equality, supporting disabled persons, and more.\n\nChairman Carr\u2019s attempt to intimidate Comcast is wasting federal resources for a futile, likely illegal, costly, politically-driven, and even invidious \u201cinvestigation\u201d into policies that promote American ideals of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nWhat Chairman Carr is doing is against the public interest and the intended purposes and objectives of the FCC. This makes it against the law. Instead of conserving resources in a time where the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is firing federal workers left and right for the sake of \u201cefficiency,\u201d Chairman Carr is throwing taxpayer dollars at a useless cause. This hypocrisy is a shame.\n\nChairman Carr\u2019s inquiry is nothing more than a coercive threat, launching an intimidation campaign against businesses that challenge the Trump agenda. Comcast is at the forefront, being a company that has openly opposed Chairman Carr\u2019s efforts to leverage the Federal Communications Commission in support of threats against NBC from the President. It certainly won\u2019t be the last. These measures appear to be solely intended to satisfy the President, disregarding the interests of the American people and the treasured American freedoms of speech, press, and enterprise.\n\nBut what makes this even more outrageous than the other \u201cinvestigations\u201d designed to intimidate broadcasters and cow journalists into self-censoring is that the \u201cinvestigation\u201d into Comcast reverses over 90 years of Communications law and Commission policy. It takes the practices the Commission approved \u2013 even praised \u2013 and tries to turn them into an undefined crime that Chairman Carr appoints himself to enforce. Like Lewis Carol\u2019s Red Queen, Chairman Carr\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d makes a mockery of the law and turns the public interest on its head.",

The other option is to dump Comcast and pay for Marquee\u2019s stand-alone app for $20/month, which isn\u2019t a bad deal when you cancel during the offseason. The upgraded app is better now than in the past, though it\u2019s got a glitch where the audio remains on unless you go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do that first, Marquee\u2019s sound will continue even if you close the app and, yes, turn off your TV. It\u2019s the weirdest thing and I still can\u2019t remember to do it every time. And we\u2019re not talking about just a 10-second lag or something, it\u2019ll remain on in perpetuity.",

(Read it in full below.)\n\nConsisting of all of the cable networks from NBCU\u2019s portfolio except for Bravo, the new stand-alone company is aiming to complete its separation from Comcast by the end of the year. Last Friday, Deadline reported that the new company is looking at office space for its New York City headquarters and \u201cclosing in\u201d on a name.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe main hoops that Comcast and the Lazarus team will have to jump through are SEC rule compliance and various legal and financial details in establishing a separate company to be owned by Comcast shareholders. The spin is not slated to be subject to a full-fledged regulatory process, as NBC and Telemundo and local stations are remaining with the mother ship at Comcast.\n\nFasbender had been EVP, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of iHeartMedia, overseeing legal, regulatory, business affairs, compliance, and government affairs groups. She has advised the company\u2019s board of directors and senior management on a wide variety of issues and strategy including corporate governance, strategic transactions, corporate finance, digital technology, intellectual property, litigation, employment, regulation, public policy and privacy.\n\nPrior to iHeart, Fasbender had been SVP and Associate General Counsel of 21st Century Fox, where she provided strategic counsel on mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, SEC compliance and corporate governance. She helped guide the company through Disney\u2019s $71.3 billion acquisition of most of the company and the resulting spinoff of the TV-focused Fox Corp. Previously, she practiced corporate law as an associate at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP.\n\nOther hires announced in recent months for the new company include prospective CFO and COO Anand Kini, CFO Kristin Newkirk and entertainment president Val Boreland.\n\nHere is the full memo from Lazarus:\n\nTeam,\n\nI\u2019m thrilled to announce another addition to the senior leadership team of our future new company. Jordan Fasbender will join us as General Counsel towards the end of next month.\n\nJordan has been serving as the Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of iHeartMedia, where she oversaw iHeart\u2019s legal, regulatory, business affairs, compliance, and government affairs groups.\n\nShe has been with iHeartMedia since 2019, which is the largest audio company in the U.S. that includes broadcast radio, streaming digital music services, podcasting, live and virtual events, and ad tech.\n\nPrior to iHeartMedia Jordan was Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel of Twenty-First Century Fox, where she provided strategic counsel on mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, SEC compliance and corporate governance. It\u2019s worth noting that she played a leading role in The Walt Disney Company\u2019s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the spinoff of Fox Corporation.\n\nAs we continue to build our team and position ourselves to become a stand-alone publicly traded company, we are fortunate to rely on Jordan\u2019s experience and advice on a wide variety of matters from the spin itself to the business affairs of evolving media assets.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Jordan to the team.\n\n-Mark",

Astound would be the first cable competitor to Comcast in Scranton.\n\n\u201cLocal competition helps drive down the price of services for our residents, which is why we\u2019re pleased to welcome Astound to Scranton,\u201d Cognetti said, adding, \u201ca new cable provider offers new opportunities for citizens to stay informed and entertained.\u201d\n\n.\n\nInterestingly, Cognetti did not mention internet or broadband services in Wednesday\u2019s announcement. However, according to its website, Astound provides broadband internet and voice, in addition to cable TV, via fiber technology.\n\nAstound is required to obtain a franchise from the city to provide cable TV services, the terms of which include quarterly payments to the city equal to 5 percent of its gross local revenues. Broadband revenue is exempt from the 5 percent fee.\n\n\u201cScranton will receive revenues from Astound to fund capital expenditures for government and educational access broadcasting, according to legislation presented to the Scranton City Council,\u201d the mayor\u2019s announcement said.",

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.99%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.61%.\n\nThe cable provider's shares have seen an increase of 4.77% over the last month, surpassing the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 1.66% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.48%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Comcast in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.01, down 2.88% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $29.86 billion, down 0.66% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $4.35 per share and a revenue of $122.86 billion, signifying shifts of +0.46% and -0.7%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Comcast. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.06% decrease. Comcast presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Comcast currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.17. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 8.17, which means Comcast is trading at no noticeable deviation to the group.\n\nWe can also see that CMCSA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Cable Television industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.68.\n\nThe Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 162, finds itself in the bottom 36% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

This mobile testing center includes the use of a dedicated bank of laptops, enabling students to test in a location familiar to them, and eliminate the need to travel to a different testing center.\n\n\"Supporting our students involves providing them with the resources and guidance they need to succeed and fostering an environment where they can thrive and achieve their educational goals,\" said Melinda Haines, CEO of The Literacy Alliance. \"Our continued partnership and support from Comcast have transformed The Literacy Alliance's landscape to allow more students in new classrooms and expand digital skills.\"\n\nIn 2023, Comcast donated 50 laptops and granted $50,000, offering an opportunity for every student to use a computer during The Literacy Alliance's classes. With these grants and donations, students will have increased skills for interviewing, oral and written communications, critical thinking, problem-solving, job acquisition, and transferable soft skills such as time management, dependability, teamwork and adaptability.\n\n\"Our partnership with The Literacy Alliance provides essential resources and opportunities for Fort Wayne residents to succeed. At Comcast, we believe in fostering a community where everyone has the chance to thrive,\" said Craig D'Agostini, Government External and Government Affairs, Comcast Heartland Region.\n\nThe grants and laptop donations are a part of Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity and help create a future with limitless possibilities.\n\nAbout The Literacy Alliance\n\nFor more than 50 years, The Literacy Alliance has been fueled by a simple yet powerful truth: Literacy changes lives. Our mission is to empower people through education. But we are more than educators; we are catalysts for empowerment. Our free programs include, for adult learners, Project Graduate, which provides classes in Allen, Adams, and Wells Counties for those who wish to earn a high school equivalency diploma and Project Connect, an English language learners program serving individuals and employees in Allen County. Moreover, our commitment extends to our youngest learners in Allen County, who, through Project Reads, begin their inspiring journey toward reading proficiency and educational excellence.\n\nAbout Comcast Corporation\n\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

AT&T and Verizon are capitalizing on the 5G boom, with AT&T focusing on mobile 5G, fixed wireless, and edge computing, while Verizon is driving 5G adoption, expanding fixed wireless broadband, and accelerating its Ultra Wideband network rollout nationwide.\n\n\n\nDespite the competition and near-term challenges, Comcast keeps identifying new growth opportunities to strengthen its long-term prospects. As part of the company\u2019s latest investment in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Comcast has expanded its network to connect more than 18,500 homes and businesses in Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Columbia Counties, providing high-speed Internet. This expansion improves digital infrastructure, fosters economic growth, and gives the residents and businesses access to Xfinity and Comcast Business services, including Internet, mobile, entertainment, and security.\n\n\n\nThis expansion plan will potentially lead to an increase in Comcast\u2019s subscriptions and drive higher revenues. It will also help strengthen the company\u2019s market share, countering the intense competition in the market.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMCSA\u2019s first-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $1.01 per share, suggesting a decline by a penny over the past seven days. The estimate indicates a year-over-year decline of 2.88%.\n\n\n\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $29.86 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 0.66%.\n\n\n\nCMCSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 7.47%.\n\nComcast Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nComcast Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nComcast Corporation price-consensus-chart | Comcast Corporation Quote\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nCMCSA Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold?\n\nComcast reported record revenues and adjusted EBITDA in 2024. It is also actively strengthening its long-term prospects through various expansion and acquisition strategies, such as its recently announced plans to acquire Nitel. Although its strong financial performance and strategies are noteworthy, the company is facing significant competitive pressures and challenges at the moment. It persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting and its broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Comcast also faces competition in the streaming market from providers like Netflix NFLX and Disney+ because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming and solid content, which is Netflix\u2019s major growth driver. Disney+ also emerged as a dominant provider in the market, primarily driven by its subscription growth because of its content portfolio.\n\n\n\nCMCSA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

            "content": "Comcast's Xfinity is one of the country's largest cable internet providers. If you're a resident of cities such as Atlanta, Denver or San Francisco, chances are your address is serviceable for Xfinity internet. This cable giant is known for offering a variety of plan selections, including its gig and multi-gig services. Like many home internet users, I see Xfinity internet commercials promoting its speeds, particularly gigabit speeds, on a near-daily basis.\n\nThe commercials are a bit sensational, claiming \"unbeatable internet, made to do anything, so you can do anything\" on \"hundreds of devices.\" I'm here to tell you if the service truly lives up to the hype.\n\nXfinity offers a fiber-optic service, featuring maximum speeds of 10,000Mbps but even on the standard single-gig and it's other cable tiers, Xfinity leads the way with download speeds up to 1,200Mbps compared to the 940 or 1,000Mbps available from other gig providers.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThere are pros and cons to Xfinity's gig plans that could certainly prompt you to check out other, cheaper internet plans from Xfinity or another provider altogether. To better understand if Xfinity's gig or multi-gig service is right for your household, read on for more details.\n\nWhat is gigabit internet?\n\nSimply put, gigabit internet, from Xfinity or any other ISP, is an internet service that advertises max download speeds at or around 1 gigabit per second, equal to 1,000 megabits per second. Xfinity raises the gig bar a bit by also offering a 1,200Mbps plan, but it isn't a runaway victory for the cable ISP.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nCable internet doesn't boast the same upload speed potential as a fiber-optic connection. Consequently, the Xfinity Gigabit plan comes with max upload speeds of only 20Mbps, although you can find much faster speed with its fiber service, featuring symmetrical speeds of 10Gbps. That said, you won't get the symmetrical or near-symmetrical upload/download speeds with Xfinity's gig plan versus that of a fiber internet service. Additionally, gig service from Xfinity is pricier than some, and its 10Gbps plan is just too expensive.\n\nXfinity's high-speed gig internet plans (West division)\n\nPlan Starting price Standard price Max download speeds (Mbps) Max upload speeds (Mbps) Connection type Gigabit $65 $109 1,000 20 Cable Gigabit Extra $85 $116 1,200 40 Cable Gigabit x2 $85 $119 2,000 200 Cable Gigabit Pro $300 $300 10,000 10,000 Fiber Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nPlan pricing may vary by region, the prices you see above are for the West region. But for the most part, expect to pay around $65 to $75 for gig service -- factoring in a $10 discount for enrolling in autopay -- plus an added $15 if you decide to lease for equipment. That price is good for two years, after which the price jumps to $109 with the autopay discount.\n\nThere's no promotional pricing on the Gigabit Pro plan, so you'll be paying $300 per month for service right off the bat, plus up to $500 in installation fees and a higher, unavoidable equipment fee of $20 per month. Gigabit Pro also comes with a two-year contract, so be sure you're prepared to commit to that high monthly price before signing up.\n\nIn the West region, the Gigabit x2 plan offers a similar rate to the Gigabit plan and may be better value long term because of its faster speed tier.\n\nConsider Xfinity's data caps and speeds\n\nBefore signing up, consider these factors to better understand if a gigabit service from Xfinity is worth it.\n\nData caps\n\nWith great speed comes great responsibility -- if you have a data cap, that is. It's worth noting Xfinity's pricing and service terms will vary by market. But most Xfinity customers can expect a monthly data cap of 1.2TB with the Gigabit and multi-gigabit plans and lower speed tiers. However, if you live in the Northeast region you won't likely deal with any data restrictions.\n\nEither way, 1.2TB is generally a lot of data. The average home uses only half of that, approximately 698GB, according to OpenVault, so you likely won't have anything to worry about. Don't completely overlook your data use each month, though, as going over will add $10 per 50GB block you go over, with a max fee of $100 per month.\n\nThe average household might not meet and exceed that 1.2TB limit, but burning through data is much easier to do with gigabit speeds. All that speed and bandwidth make it tempting to stream in HD or 4K on multiple TVs -- that's where the bulk of most people's data usage comes from -- and add an arsenal of data-consuming smart home devices to your network.\n\nSuppose you'd rather avoid watching your data usage and potentially paying added fees. In that case, you can enroll in unlimited data for an additional $30 per month or sign up for the Gigabit Pro plan, but that'll come with a hefty price tag.\n\nGigabit Pro, priced at $300 a month, comes with unlimited data, so you can download huge video game files and stream in 4K to your heart's content without worrying about how much data you're consuming. Get your money's worth out of that 10,000Mbps connection.\n\nSpeeds\n\nI love fast internet but I'll be the first to admit that 10,000Mbps is overkill for the average home. According to OpenVault's fourth quarter 2024 report, the average US household uses downstream speeds of 569Mbps and 32Mbps upstream. Your household may not even need the fastest speeds, 500Mbps should be enough.\n\nIf I were back in college with three roommates who all had their own smart TVs, computers and smart devices (and who split the bills equally with me), I'd probably consider the Gigabit Pro plan for its speed and unlimited data. Otherwise, I'll pass. Depending on the price of the Gigabit x2 plan, I'd likely pass on 2,000Mbps as well.\n\nOn the other hand, standard gigabit service has become much more practical. As the number of connected devices in the home has risen in recent years -- the average American household now has approximately 25 connected devices -- along with more data-demanding activities such as 4K streaming, faster speeds have become increasingly necessary. The more devices you connect, the slower your average speeds to each device will be, especially when connecting over Wi-Fi. A gigabit connection ensures you have plenty of speed to go around.\n\nThat said, it's understandable if you deem speeds of 1,000-1,200Mbps faster than your home needs. Xfinity is known for having a variety of plan options, including slower and cheaper 75, 200, 400 and 800Mbps speed tiers, so don't feel like you're tied to gig service if you decide to make Xfinity your home internet service provider.\n\nHow does Xfinity's gig service compare?\n\nI've mentioned that Xfinity's gig plan is faster (considering download speeds) than some ISPs, but there's more to compare than just max download speeds. How does Xfinity's gig service compare to other ISPs?\n\nXfinity's gig plan starting rate is cheaper than what you'll find among leading gig providers. However, it's important to note that your price will increase by $44 a month in the second year. In addition, while Xfinity's download speed potential is a bit faster than others, upload speeds are dramatically slower than what you can expect from a fiber connection. Additionally, most gig providers offer unlimited data and waive the equipment fee (if they have one) with gig service.\n\nSo although Xfinity's gigabit plan is certainly impressive, you'll want to compare details from other potential providers in your area before signing up. Given the choice of gig service from AT&T Fiber versus Xfinity, for example, I'd likely go with AT&T Fiber even though the max download speeds are slower. It's cheaper when you factor in equipment fees -- and it comes with unlimited data and significantly faster upload speeds.\n\nIs Xfinity's gigabit service worth it?\n\nI can't fault Xfinity for running commercials boasting its fast speeds, but there's more to Xfinity's gigabit and multi-gig services than how fast they are. Xfinity's gig plan is decently priced compared to other providers. Still, the equipment fee and data cap (and potential fees for going over) take away some of the value the plan and its faster max speed offer.\n\nGigabit Pro is a premium fiber-to-the-home service priced at $300 per month. Its speeds of 10Gbps are much faster than most multi-gig providers and plans (AT&T and Optimum offer a max of 5Gbps and 8Gbps, respectively; Frontier and Verizon Fios currently tap out at 2Gbps). It's also tough to justify spending a third of a thousand dollars monthly (after taxes and fees) for your broadband connection. This doesn't even include the looming price increases after your promo period ends. That said, if you want faster speeds, just be ready for it to come with a hefty price tag.\n\nXfinity's high-speed gig internet FAQs:\n\nWhat is gigabit internet? Gigabit internet advertises maximum download speeds at around 1,000Mbps or 1Gbps. Xfinity offers a faster gigabit service than most ISPs, including a 1,200Mbps tier.\n\nHow fast is Xfinity? Simply put, the speeds you can expect will depend on the connection type available at your address. For example, with a cable connection from Xfinity, your upload speeds will likely only top out at 20Mbps for its gigabit tier. Compared to a fiber optic connection from Google Fiber, you can have symmetrical speeds of 1,000Mbps. When it comes to speeds, that's where cable internet falls short. Though, Xfinity does have a fiber service, offering symmetrical speeds of 10,000Mbs. However, this much speed might be an overkill for your household.",

In advance of that journey, MIT sent three research payloads up on Intuitive Machines\u2019 recent IM-2 mission on the SpaceX rocket as part of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Together, the payloads will provide data about the area to help prepare Artemis astronauts for navigating this unique terrain. MIT\u2019s To the Moon to Stay mission will demonstrate novel technology, contribute to NASA science and future missions, and through the experience developed alongside Comcast, will help to bring the world to the Moon, this time to stay.\n\nIn the coming months, Comcast plans to expand the reach of its \u201cTo the Moon\u201d experience by making it available across all its entertainment platforms, including Sky Glass, Sky Stream and Xumo devices.\n\nAbout Comcast Corporation\n\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

            "content": "Xfinity home internet users, your experience is about to get better thanks to this new Comcast upgrade. If you're a gamer, this upgrade could impact you the most. In January, Comcast announced a new technology that would significantly reduce your network latency, bringing a smoother experience for Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Valve\u2019s Steam users. Whether prepping for a FaceTime call with your friends, streaming a new show or getting ready to play Portal 2, this news might be music to your ears. Read on to learn which cities will have this upgrade first.\n\nXfinity Internet is available to more than 63 million homes nationwide. A spokesperson from Xfinity tells CNET that working latency was reduced by 78% after trials on this new technology.\n\nWhat will this technology do?\n\nXfinity\u2019s launching of a new open standard technology means that it will be for public use, but it may take some time before it\u2019s fully integrated and available across the country. According to a company press release, this new technology will significantly lower users\u2019 latency, which will be optimal for a smoother online and gaming experience.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nIn most markets, Xfinity users can expect maximum download speeds of 1,000 or 1,200 megabits per second, which is plenty for the average American household. But speeds aren\u2019t everything.\n\n\u201cModern applications are real-time and interactive and require more than just fast speeds. Xfinity Internet\u2019s lower lag times will be a differentiator for Comcast,\u201d Emily Waldorf, senior vice president of consumer products for Comcast Connectivity and Platforms, writes in a company press release.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWhat does this mean for your home internet?\n\nCNET\n\nAs you\u2019ve heard from CNET time and time again, fiber internet is generally our top pick due to its fast, symmetrical speeds and overall value for your service. But Xfinity\u2019s cable internet also features solid speeds and a wide variety of plan selections. This launch of its low-latency technology could significantly enhance its cable internet service. According to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission, Xfinity\u2019s cable internet offerings are available to over 34% of the country, so this impacts approximately one in every three households. But why is Xfinity\u2019s new working latency so important in the first place?\n\nWhat is working latency and why is it important?\n\nThis is not to be confused with traditional or \u201cidle latency,\u201d which measures how fast data is transferred from one point to another on the network. Working latency measures a connection's actual lag or delay under normal circumstances. For example, working latency is the delay you may experience while using multiple applications simultaneously. In other words, this technology could benefit videoconferencing, online gaming and virtual reality.\n\nHow does latency impact gamers?\n\nThe higher the latency, the more lag gamers can experience throughout a game. If you're playing a game with high stakes, your latency can make or break your gaming experience. According to a recent report from Liquid Web, over a thousand gamers were surveyed on the effects of latency and 95% complained about experiencing latency issues while gaming. These gamers were reported to play games on PC, Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo.\n\nHere are some of the key findings from that report that provide a better picture of how important latency is:\n\n78% of gamers rage quit due to latency issues while gaming, with Xbox gamers the most likely to do so at 85%.\n\n58% of Call of Duty gamers are most likely to rage quit due to latency issues, followed by Fortnite at 43% and Counter-Strike 2 at 42%.\n\n16% of gamers report that latency issues lead to lingering frustration or anger outside of gaming, lasting for an average of 19 minutes afterward.\n\nIt's safe to say that a low latency can benefit many gamers, ensuring less frustration and a better overall gaming experience.\n\nWhat applications can benefit from Xfinity's Low-Lag internet?\n\nCNET\n\nXfinity's Low-Lag internet is coming to these cities\n\nThis new technology will be available for different Xfinity gateway router models, such as the XB6, XB7 and XB8. But it won\u2019t be rolled out to all Xfinity cities immediately. Once this software has been fully integrated, all other modems will be equipped with this technology down the road.\n\nResidents in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Philadelphia, Rockville, Maryland, and San Francisco will soon have access to this new software upgrade. Comcast writes in a company press release that they plan on \u201cdeploying [this technology] in more locations across the country rapidly over the next few months.\u201d\n\nXfinity's Ultra Low-Lag Internet FAQs:\n\nWhat is Xfinity's Ultra Low-Lag internet? This is a new software upgrade available to Xfinity home internet users. This technology significantly lowers network latency and can improve the quality of gaming, streaming and even FaceTime calls. According to Xfinity, this technology can benefit Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Valve Steam users the most.\n\nWhat is the difference between idle and working latency? Xfinity's new Ultra Low-lag technology deals with working latency, which measures a connection's actual lag or delay under normal circumstances. For instance, working latency can show up as the delay between a user's action and the results on a system. On the other hand, traditional or \"idle latency\" measures how fast data is transferred from one point to another on the network.\n\nWhere can I find Xfinity's Ultra Low-Lag internet? At first, only a select few US cities will be able to access Xfinity's new software upgrade. Xfinity will deploy this technology first in these cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Philadelphia, Rockville, Maryland, and San Franciso. Comcast writes in a press release that they plan on \"deploying [this technology] in more locations across the country rapidly over the next few months.\"",

And there\u2019s instability. We\u2019ve pretty much focused most of the company in the U.S. There\u2019s still some external things happening,\u201d Roberts told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump imposing sweeping tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday has led to continuing market turmoil and a possible global trade war. Roberts did cite Comcast\u2019s Sky business based in Britain, but otherwise focused his remarks on the American market. \u201cMost of the businesses are here. And this is still the best country where you can grow your business,\u201d Roberts argued.\n\nThe Comcast boss also talked up the future of NBCUniversal after a coming spin-off of select cable networks. He spoke ahead of NBCUniversal putting cable channels like MSNBC, CNBC, Syfy, E!, Oxygen, Golf Channel and USA Network into a separate spinoff company.\n\nThat will leave Comcast focused on six growth drivers, including Peacock, the premium streaming service, and broadband, wireless, business services and theme parks. \u201cThese businesses, the six, have healthy margins, healthy growth, that are creative, and that\u2019s the future of our company. So I feel very good about the core of the business and the growing core,\u201d Roberts told investors.\n\nAt the same time, he argued his media conglomerate was responding to increased competition and industry disruption without complacency. \u201cI think we see places where we can improve. And there\u2019s a sense of urgency right now throughout the whole company to be thoughtful, however, and deliberate,\u201d Roberts added.\n\nThe conglomerate that owns NBCUniversal is getting set to separate its less lucrative cable networks from its film and TV studio entertainment and parks businesses to deal with a declining pay TV space. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a drum beat to more and more entertainment, and sports in particular, going to streaming,\u201d Roberts said as he looked ahead to NBCUniversal no longer being dragged down by a once-dominant cable TV business.\n\nRoberts said the spin-off transaction wasn\u2019t his idea, and instead came from Comcast president Mike Cavanagh. He argued the cable brands that are part of Spin Co. were not contributing to the Peacock streaming service to the extent expected, and needed another way to survive and thrive.\n\n\u201cThen you look at remaining NBCU, of about $40 billion in revenues, having the scale to be a strong company,\u201d Roberts added about what may emerge after Comcast splits its cable channels from the rest of its media assets. On the filmed entertainment side, NBCUniversal is operating its film and TV businesses together.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen Day of the Jackal or The Americas on NBC, there\u2019s some fantastic content, and then we sell a lot of that content off to Netflix or to Amazon or Apple or Max,\u201d Roberts said. He also addressed NBC and Peacock getting NBA rights for the first time since 2002 this year under a new deal with the pro basketball league.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the NBA and said we had a big hole in the Peacock schedule in order to slow churn and to build something for the long term,\u201d he argued.",

            "content": "\u201cI continue to be an optimist,\u201d said Comcast chairman-CEO Brian Roberts, asked at tail of a media conference Q&A why he remains so upbeat on the company\u2019s growth prospects.\n\n\u201cObviously, look at the world around us, and there\u2019s instability. We\u2019re pretty much focused, most of the company, in the U.S.\u201d With \u201csome of the external things happening, we were fortunate to [be in another] market with Sky in the U.K \u2014 but most of the businesses are here. And I think this is still the best country where you can grow your business.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t specific but, as of today, a trade war is on with Canada, with Mexico coming. President Donald Trump launched 25% tariffs overnight on the two nations and doubled import taxes on Chinese goods to 20%. China responded with tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods. All that tanked the stock market for the second day in a row and is likely to spur inflation. High interest rates, which had mostly likely been heading down, may not do that anytime soon.\n\nSeparately, FCC chair Brendan Carr announced last month the that Commission launched an investigation of the NBCUniversal parent\u2019s DEI policies amid a sweeping rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the public and private sector.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe prospect of a lighter regulatory touch and more M&A, a hope that in part helped sweep Trump into office, has not materialized yet amid economic uncertainty. Media companies, in particular, are having a rough time with the new president.\n\nAsked about M&A at the Morgan Stanley gathering, Roberts said the stock sitting at an historic low multiple makes the bar high for acquisitions. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to look at everything, and we do that. [But] the last two acquisitions have all been around business services, actually, not what everybody would have maybe predicted.\u201d\n\nThe broadband and media giant\u2019s strong balance sheet gives it the scale it needs for whatever it needs.\n\nLike a new NBA rights deal \u2014 a key for Peacock, covering \u201ca big hole\u201d in the schedule to \u201cslow churn and to build something for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have Sunday Night Football. We have the Olympics. We have, obviously, all the entertainment content. But, you know, right after New Years, the winter, and a bit of the spring \u2014 the first and second quarter \u2014 that\u2019s where the NBA has tonnage. And we are actually getting the most games of any of the three providers \u2026 That drives your subs, your ARPU, and your churn.\u201d ARPU is average revenue per user.\n\nHe called the upcoming spinoff of NBCU cable networks (except Bravo), the brainchild of President Mike Cavanagh, \u201ca very smart move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done something like this before, and it wasn\u2019t my idea, but I like to think we\u2019re open minded.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that only a small fraction of viewing (about 2%) on Peacock came from the cable networks. \u201cSo the brands that are really strong, that are our cable networks, are not getting a direct to consumer solution today. And they\u2019re great brands, and they\u2019re great businesses. So we have a very good path for them to be able to take advantage of our strong balance sheet, be spun off, be one of the first to do this. Others, I think, would like to be in our position, with the ability to do this quickly, have a first mover advantage.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is restructuring its businesses into two divisions, separating Linear Networks From Streaming & Studios in what appears to be the groundwork for its own split.\n\nRoberts said Comcast\u2019s transaction should be completed by year end and promised a great board and a name coming soon.",

            "content": "According to data from Abrdn, it was noted that between December 2002 and December 2022, companies that either increased or initiated dividends achieved a compounded return of 10.68%. In contrast, firms that reduced or discontinued their dividends saw a significantly lower return of 2.70%. In addition, it was highlighted that companies not paying dividends also lagged behind dividend growers, generating a return of 9.25% over the same timeframe.\n\nDividends are a key component of the investment market, with nearly 80% of companies in the broader market distributing payments to shareholders. However, maintaining steady dividend increases is a difficult achievement. Only about 13% of companies in the index qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) the Best Very Cheap Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American telecommunications company that offers a wide range of mobile phone and cable TV services. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company posted revenue of nearly $32 billion, up 2.1% from the same period last year. The company's strong performance was driven by achievements across its six growth businesses. Connectivity revenue saw a 5% increase despite intense market competition, while mobile services expanded with the addition of 1.2 million new lines. Business Services also reported a 5% rise in revenue.\n\nIn the media segment, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s studios secured the second spot in worldwide box office rankings, reflecting a successful year. Meanwhile, its streaming platform, Peacock, recorded a 46% surge in revenue, supported by a diverse mix of sports and entertainment content, including the highly successful Paris Olympics. In addition, the company's ongoing investment in multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds enhances its competitive edge, allowing it to keep pace with growing data consumption needs fueled by streaming and other high-bandwidth applications.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s cash position also came in strong. In the most recent quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $8 billion, up from 6 billion in the same period last year. Its free cash flow also jumped to $3.26 billion, from $1.7 billion in the prior-year period. During the quarter, the company also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.71%, as of February 27. The company has raised its payouts for 17 consecutive years.\n\nOverall CMCSA ranks 8th on our list of the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based company operates through five segments: Residential Connectivity & Platforms; Business Services Connectivity; Media; Studios; and Theme Parks.\n\nCompanies valued at $10 billion or more are generally classified as \u201clarge-cap\u201d stocks, and Comcast fits this criterion perfectly. The company is the third-largest broadcasting and cable television company in terms of revenue.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThe multinational mass media corporation declined 20.6% from its 52-week high of $45.31. Over the past three months, CMCSA\u2019s shares have dropped 16.1%, underperforming the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund\u2019s (XLC) marginal rise.\n\nIn the long term, CMCSA has fallen 4.1% YTD, trailing XLC\u2019s 4.3% gain. Additionally, shares of Comcast have dipped 15.9% over the past 52 weeks, while XLC has climbed nearly 26.2% in the same period.\n\nCMCSA has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since December last year.\n\nDespite beating Wall Street expectations with Q4 2024 adjusted EPS of $0.96 and revenue of $31.9 billion, CMCSA shares dipped 11% on Jan. 30. The company reported a larger-than-expected decline of 139,000 broadband subscribers, reflecting mounting competition from mobile providers. Additionally, Peacock\u2019s subscriber base stagnated at 36 million, raising concerns about its ability to compete in the saturated streaming market. Finally, ongoing cord-cutting trends led to a significant loss of 311,000 TV customers, further pressuring Comcast\u2019s traditional cable business.\n\nNevertheless, in comparison, its rival Cable One, Inc. (CABO) has underperformed CMCSA, with shares declining 47.1% over the last 52 weeks and falling 33.1% YTD.\n\nDespite CMCSA\u2019s weak price action, analysts are moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 30 analysts covering the stock, and as of writing, Comcast is trading below the mean price target of $43.02.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "NBCUniversal is officially pulling the plug on Universal Kids, with the cable network set to go dark on March 6, 2025, according to Variety. The company also said they \u201cremain committed to family entertainment.\u201d This move isn\u2019t all that surprising; it\u2019s just the latest example of traditional TV networks struggling to keep up as audiences shift more toward streaming. Instead of fighting to keep the network afloat, NBCUniversal is shifting its focus to digital platforms, following a trend that\u2019s been reshaping the industry for years.\n\nUniversal Kids\u2019 Rocky Journey\n\nUniversal Kids started out in 2005 as PBS Kids Sprout, a preschool-focused network created in partnership with PBS, Comcast, Sesame Workshop, and HIT Entertainment. After Comcast took full control, it rebranded the network twice (first as Sprout, then as Universal Kids in 2017) in an attempt to expand its audience beyond preschoolers and into the older kids\u2019 market.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t exactly go as planned. IndieWire indicates that viewership dropped by 30% in 2017 and then continued to shift,plummeting another 73% in 2018. With numbers like that, NBCUniversal decided in 2019 to stop producing original shows for the network, instead relying on reruns and content from DreamWorks Animation. But even with this pivot, Universal Kids never managed to find its footing among similar networks.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Cable vs. Streaming\n\nShutting down Universal Kids fits into NBCUniversal\u2019s larger strategy of moving away from traditional cable TV. In late 2024, Comcast announced plans to spin off its cable networks (like CNBC, MSNBC, USA Network, and Syfy) into a new company, tentatively called \u201cSpinCo.\u201d But Universal Kids didn\u2019t make the cut, making its fate all but sealed.\n\nThe end of Universal Kids marks another shift in the media landscape, where linear TV is losing ground to streaming at an increasing pace. It\u2019s a reminder that as audiences\u2019 viewing habits evolve, networks either have to adapt or fade away.\n\nRather than fighting for a shrinking cable audience, NBCUniversal is doubling down on streaming. Several shows will need to find a new home, including \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior Junior,\u201d \u201cThe Big Fun Crafty Show,\u201d \u201cThe Chica Show,\u201d \u201cCocomelon,\u201d and \u201cFloogals,\u201d just to name a few. Peacock and DreamWorks Animation will continue to be the company\u2019s go-to platforms for family content, targeting younger viewers where they already are; on-demand and online. Fans will have to wait and see where their favorite shows end up once Universal Kids goes dark.",

He doesn't use Comcast, but lines are run from the box to his neighbors.\n\n\"It happened in January when it was freezing 20 degrees outside. We lost power. Comcast was digging and burying lines. Water got into the broken line and cut my power off,\" Cantu said.\n\nCantu said he immediately called CenterPoint.\n\n\"(Centerpoint) said we only work 18 inches from the power box; the customer is responsible for the rest. I had to act quickly. We were freezing. Mr. Electric got me connected. Once they got the line in, CenterPoint came back out and connected us,\" he said.\n\nHe was connected with a bill of more than $2500, which Cantu believes is Comcast's responsibility. Cantu says he tried to reach Comcast for weeks, looking for a response.\n\n\"They have insurance to cover subcontractor's damage. I just need them to contact me,\" Cantu said.\n\nAfter Cantu contacted ABC13, Eyewitness News contacted Comcast.\n\nThey called Cantu, sent a crew to survey the situation, and said they would reimburse him if they found it was their fault.\n\nCantu later received a text from the survey company saying it was their fault and he could expect a check.\n\nFor more on this story, follow Bob Slovak on Facebook and X.",

            "content": "City of Wilmington Affirms Commitment to Public Access Television Amid Budget Adjustments\n\nMarch 4, 2025\n\nOfficials Address Concerns, Confirm Continued Support for Comcast Channel 28 and DETV\n\nIn response to recent discussions surrounding DETV\u2019s role as the City of Wilmington\u2019s Third-Party Operator (TPO) for Comcast Channel 28, city officials are making it clear: public access television is here to stay.\n\nDespite financial challenges faced by municipalities nationwide, Wilmington\u2019s leadership, including the City Council and the Cable, Video, and Telecommunications (CVT) Commission, remains committed to preserving public access programming. However, with declining Comcast cable subscriptions leading to a projected $2.1 million shortfall in the CVT Fund over the next five years, adjustments to operational expenses are necessary.\n\nTo address these budgetary constraints, the CVT Commission has renegotiated its agreement with DETV. Under the pending terms, DETV will retain full access to Comcast Channel 28 and continue serving as Wilmington\u2019s public access provider. The primary adjustment concerns DETV\u2019s second studio, located on the third floor of its current building.\n\nWhile the City will no longer cover rent, utilities, or equipment costs for this additional space, it has committed to fully funding the transfer of equipment to DETV\u2019s primary first-floor studio. Additionally, the Commission has agreed to reimburse DETV up to $20,000 for any unforeseen expenses related to the transition.\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that DETV\u2019s operational funding remains unchanged. Like many public access stations across the country, DETV has developed independent revenue streams to sustain its operations. This funding model aligns with industry standards, ensuring long-term sustainability in an evolving media landscape.\n\nFurthermore, city officials stress that Wilmington has never directly funded DETV but has historically covered facility-related expenses for the organization\u2019s secondary studio. During contract negotiations, DETV acknowledged that while the additional studio was beneficial, it was not essential to their operations. This affirmation provided the CVT Commission with confidence to reallocate resources while maintaining public access television services.\n\nFor those seeking further clarity, the full, unedited Wilmington Cable, Video, and Telecommunications Commission Meeting from February 28, 2025, is available for public viewing on WITN 22\u2019s YouTube page. To watch the meeting in its entirety, visit: https://youtube.com/live/AkWeN3f59ww\n\nCity officials encourage residents to stay informed and engage in constructive dialogue. Wilmington remains steadfast in its commitment to public access programming, ensuring that community voices continue to be heard while maintaining responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources.",

In the past year alone, he appeared on MSNBC more than 100 times and has guest-hosted programs for the network, including \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d He first joined the channel in 2021 and previously worked as a Senior Political Analyst.\n\nAs well as serving as MSNBC\u2019s Washington correspondent, Daniels will also be a co-host of \u201cThe Weekend\u201d on Saturdays and Sundays from 7 to 10 a.m. ET. He will host the show alongside Jonathan Capehart and another co-anchor whom Brzezinski said is \u201csoon-to-be named.\u201d As for the evening edition of the program, Ayman Mohyeldin will host that alongside two new hosts.\n\nDaniels\u2019 hiring is a big one as it marks the first correspondent hired during this new era of MSNBC. In November, Comcast announced it will be spinning off its cable networks, a decision that many have taken to mean that the MSNBC and NBC News teams will no longer work together. MSNBC is currently working to build out a Washington operation that will be independent from NBC News, an insider familiar with the matter told TheWrap. MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler is also in the process of hiring a head of talent, head of newsgathering, a Washington bureau chief and a head of content strategy, as well as a team of both domestic and international correspondents.\n\nPrior to his latest MSNBC role, Daniels served as the Chief Playbook Correspondent and White House Correspondent for Politico. He also worked as a Political Reporter at Newsy and is currently the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association.\n\nMSNBC is also planning to change up its programming around late April. After President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d will return to Mondays, and Jen Psaki will anchor the weekday 9 p.m. hour from Tuesdays through Fridays.

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Comcast's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership\n\nalong with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Comcast Corporation ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Comcast.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nComcast already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Comcast, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.8%. With 8.0% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO Brian Roberts is the owner of 0.9% of the company's shares.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Comcast\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Comcast Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.2b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Comcast. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the .\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The Comcast-owned company told their staff that they could apply for new roles at the network or accept a severance payout.\n\nLast week, Maddow took to the air to blast the network for firing Reid . The network insists that the shakeup resulted from a reallocation of resources to support its evolving priorities and that affected employees can apply for the newly available positions before roles are opened to external candidates.\n\nDespite the reassurances, the changes have raised concerns. MSNBC has previously found ways to move staff around without cuts. The new approach marks a major departure from previous practices, especially at a difficult time for the cable news industry. The restructuring coincides with financial pressures at MSNBC due to being spun off from NBCUniversal.\n\nOther networks\u2019 search for cost-saving measures includes CNN\u2019s recent move to lay off 200 employees under new chief executive Mark Thompson , who was previously reported aggressively pushing for a more potent digital strategy.

(AP) \u2014 Jake Knapp knew he was on the verge of something special early on Thursday, with a run of five straight birdies to open his round at the Cognizant Classic.\n\nIn the end, he joined one of golf\u2019s most elite clubs.\n\nKnapp \u2014 the No. 99 player in golf\u2019s current world rankings \u2014 joined the PGA Tour\u2019s sub-60 club on Thursday, shooting a bogey-free 59 in the opening round at PGA National. It was the 15th time that someone has broken 60 in a PGA Tour event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those days where everything was kind of clicking,\u201d Knapp said.\n\nKnapp finished one shot off the tour scoring record of 58, done by Jim Furyk in the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship. Knapp became the 14th player to shoot a sub-60 round; it has been done 15 times, with Furyk the one who has carded such a round twice.\n\nKnapp had a putt for eagle at the par-5 18th that would have tied Furyk\u2019s mark of 58 \u2014 18 feet, 8 inches was the measurement given by the PGA Tour. The eagle putt didn\u2019t have the speed and he tapped in for 59.\n\nAnd yes, he was thinking about 58 \u2014 especially after a long birdie putt at the 15th put him at 11 under for the round.\n\n\u201cI stepped up on the 16 tee and just kind of told my caddie, \u2018Let\u2019s play 2 under in the last three,\u2019\u201d Knapp said. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s do what we\u2019re supposed to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe had to settle for 59, if a 59 can ever actually be settled for.\n\n\u201cI thought I played well,\u201d said Daniel Berger, who had a bogey-free round of 8-under 63, highlighted by a par on the par-5 10th \u2014 after his tee shot was lost in a tree and he played a provisional. \u201cBut then someone shot 59.\u201d\n\nKnapp\u2019s 12-birdie round on the par-71 course also broke the previous Cognizant scoring record of 61, first done in 2012 by Brian Harman and matched in 2021 by Matt Jones. There are three rounds of 62 in tournament history \u2014 Tiger Woods in the final round in 2012 on his way to a tie for second, Brandon Hagy in the second round in 2021 and eventual winner Chris Kirk in the second round of the 2023 event.\n\nThere was barely any wind, which is rare for South Florida, and PGA National was largely defenseless in the morning session. The closest there was to any trouble was the seventh hole, where Billy Horschel \u2014 a Florida Gator from his college days \u2014 used a club to poke at an actual alligator that was catching some sun near the green and got it to retreat back to its watery home.\n\nEven wildlife didn\u2019t deter scoring in Round 1. Berger, Russell Henley and Sami Valimaki all shot 63s, Rickie Fowler was among those with opening-round 64s, Jordan Spieth \u2014 continuing his comeback after wrist surgery \u2014 shot 65, while Horschel, Zach Johnson and Camilo Villegas were some of the players who opened with a 66.\n\nBut nobody had an easier time than Knapp, who finished no better than a tie for 17th in any of his first seven starts of 2025 \u2014 and then played his way into golf history in Round 1 at PGA National, a course that players have said has been less punitive in recent years. He needed to make only 98 feet of putts, a tribute to a day of excellent ball-striking.\n\n\u201cYou still have to hit shots. You have to make putts,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cYeah, 59 anywhere is hard to do. I don\u2019t care if you go play from 6,500 yards. You still have to make putts. You still have to hit it close enough to have those opportunities. With this place, we\u2019ve seen some low scores, guys get after it when the conditions are right. But obviously no one has shot 59 before out here.\u201d\n\nKnapp has one PGA Tour win, that coming at last year\u2019s Mexico Open. He\u2019s played the Cognizant only once before and did well, tying for fourth last year after shooting three rounds of 68 or better and finishing at 13 under.\n\nAnd this year, so far, he\u2019s even better.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to tip your hat to him,\u201d Horschel said. \u201cHe shot a 12-under par 59 at PGA National, which no one ever thought.\u201d\n\nHorschel and Knapp crossed paths after the round, and Horschel \u2014 offering congratulations \u2014 told him he would have wagered \u201ca lot of money ... like, a lot of money\u201d on nobody ever shooting 59 at PGA National.\n\n\u201cI feel like I shot 4 over after seeing what you shot,\u201d Horschel told Knapp as he walked away.\n\nKnapp started Thursday with five straight birdies, that stretch highlighted by a 60-foot chip-in at the par-4 second hole. The birdies kept coming in bunches; three in a row on holes 9 through 11, three more coming on holes 13 through 15 \u2014 the last of those a big breaking putt from 31 feet, going across the green before dropping dead center into the cup.\n\nMike Stephens, Knapp\u2019s caddie, said they were not afraid to talk about the chances that awaited on the final three holes.\n\n\u201cI think if anything, maybe your playing competitors try to give you a little distance or whatnot, but he likes to talk,\u201d Stephens said. \u201dSo, we\u2019d kind of go over things on the last couple (holes), to try to fill the time. Just to keep it the same. ... Just another day.\u201d\n\nWell, not quite. A 59 is not just another day.\n\n\u201cWhether I shot 89 or 59, I\u2019m going to come back out and do my job tomorrow,\u201d Knapp said.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

            "content": "Earlier this week I posted this article examining whether the Cubs flagship channel Marquee Sports Network would have any issues staying on Comcast/Xfinity systems in the Cubs market territory. Comcast is the largest provider in the area, covering about 55 percent of all cable/satellite homes.\n\nJeff Agrest of the Chicago Sun-Times says never fear, Comcast isn\u2019t dropping Marquee \u2014 but it will likely cost you more:\n\nThe Cubs\u2019 Marquee Sports Network expects Comcast to move it to a higher-priced tier on its Xfinity cable system soon and does not anticipate being dropped, the Sun-Times has learned. A Comcast spokesperson had no update, and Marquee and broadcast partner Sinclair had no comment.\n\nThis is something that\u2019s been widely forecast by observers of the situation, including me in that linked article above. So, Cubs fans who are Comcast/Xfinity subscribers \u2014 this writer included \u2014 won\u2019t have any interruption in watching Cubs games when the season begins.\n\nIt will cost more, however, on Xfinity\u2019s higher tier, which in some markets is called \u201cUltimate TV.\u201d At this time I don\u2019t know what that higher price will be, though the Sun-Times article says in some other markets it\u2019s been $20 a month. Comcast recently moved the Giants channel NBC Sports Bay Area onto its higher tier in that market, and I don\u2019t know the extra cost there either. The Agrest article notes:\n\nWhen Comcast moved Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, home of the Nationals and Orioles, a year ago, it offered the Ultimate tier for free for three months followed by $10 per month for the next three months before charging full price. It\u2019s unknown whether such a promotion will be available in the Chicago market.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk for Comcast. They could wind up with more cord-cutters than people who want to pay the premium, and lose money in the balance.\n\nThere\u2019s one other important note about Marquee in the Sun-Times article, about the Cubs\u2019 partnership with Sinclair Broadcasting. The broadcaster and the team each own 50 percent of Marquee.\n\n... the partnership between Marquee and Sinclair has soured. Sinclair\u2019s joint venture with Marquee hasn\u2019t been nearly as successful as the media company hoped, and it\u2019s looking to get out of its contract, which could prompt a legal fight, sources said. Sinclair declined to comment. Though Marquee has lost viewers to cord-cutting since launching in 2020, Sinclair is still obligated to pay rights fees despite losing money. The situation didn\u2019t come up on Sinclair\u2019s earnings call Wednesday, and, strangely, Marquee isn\u2019t listed on the company\u2019s website with its other sports holdings, Tennis Channel and YES Network, home of the Yankees, which was the model for Marquee.\n\nSo if that\u2019s the case, the Cubs could look for another broadcast partner, or perhaps buy out Sinclair\u2019s half and become the sole owner. As you likely know, Marquee hasn\u2019t produced the revenue that the Cubs had hoped for when the channel was announced in 2019. And that\u2019s not just a Cubs thing, either:\n\nThere\u2019s irony in Sinclair\u2019s desire to leave Marquee behind. It played a part in exacerbating RSNs\u2019 demise after buying Fox\u2019s 21 RSNs from Disney in 2019. Sinclair put the networks, then valued at $10.6 billion, under subsidiary Diamond Sports Group and watched their value plummet as the coronavirus pandemic expedited cord-cutting in 2020. DSG went on its own in 2022 and in 2023 filed for bankruptcy, from which it emerged in January as Main Street Sports Group.\n\nAs I noted in this article about a month ago, seven teams remain with Diamond/Main Street in 2025: Angels, Braves, Cardinals, Marlins, Rays, Royals, and Tigers. I\u2019d bet that number shrinks next year.\n\nAll of this is related to Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s desire to get all of MLB TV rights under one umbrella, local and national. Good luck getting teams like the Dodgers and Yankees give up their local revenue to help the smaller market teams.\n\nAs always, we await developments.",

            "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Comcast is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.10 = US$23b \u00f7 (US$266b - US$40b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThus, Comcast has an ROCE of 10%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 10.0%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Return on Capital Employed March 1st 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Comcast's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Comcast .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Comcast's ROCE Trend?\n\nOver the past five years, Comcast's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Comcast doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, Comcast isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And with the stock having returned a mere 1.1% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.\n\nIf you want to know some of the risks facing Comcast we've found 2 warning signs (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhile Comcast isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "Last week MSNBC host Joy Reid got fired, one of many outcomes as a result of the network\u2019s disastrous ratings collapse following the election of President Donald Trump. It was long overdue, as are several other steps the network should take. Following the news the President called attention to the failings of the Chairman/CEO of MSNBC\u2019s parent company Comcast, as reported by The Wrap:\n\nPresident Donald Trump mocked longtime MSNBC anchor Joy Reid for losing her show on Sunday, saying the \u201cmentally obnoxious racist\u201d should have been \u201ccanned\u201d years ago. The president also had digs ready for Comcast boss Brian Roberts (pictured above), Rachel Maddow, Al Sharpton and Alex Wagner, who is also set to lose her job as an MSNBC anchor, during a late night Truth Social post on Sunday. \u201cLowlife Chairman of \u2018Concast,\u2019 Brian Roberts, the owner of Ratings Challenged NBC and MSDNC, has finally gotten the nerve up to fire one of the least talented people in television,\u201d Trump said about Reid. \u201cBased on her ratings, which were virtually non-existent, she should have been \u2018canned\u2019 long ago, along with everyone else who works there.\u201d\n\nRoberts has allowed the value of MSNBC and other networks including CNBC, USA Network and Oxygen to diminish to pennies on the dollar, to the point of wanting to spin off the formerly respectable cable staples into their own company. Collectively the channels have become a drag on the parent company\u2019s bottom-line.\n\nMSNBC is the most high-profile of the properties that are planned for divestment, and had Roberts exercised proper oversight, it could have remained a valuable contributor to Comcast\u2019s portfolio. Instead he allowed partisan personalities with Trump Derangement Syndrome to dominate its programming, reporting hoax after hoax as truth, and destroying its credibility in the process. With its roots (and significant news gathering partnership) tied to the over-air NBC Network, the taint has splattered onto its more mainstream counterpart, devaluing that property also (although that will stay under Comcast\u2019s umbrella). Meanwhile Fox Corporation makes money hand-over-fist from Fox News, so the routine whining about \u201ccord-cutting\u201d in the cable industry rings hollow.\n\nIn a couple of months NLPC will present a shareholder proposal at Comcast\u2019s annual meeting that will call for Roberts\u2019s power to be reduced by separating the roles of Chairman and CEO. Last year we sought greater disclosure on the part of the company\u2019s leftist board to disclose members\u2019 political and charitable donations before votes are held at the company\u2019s annual meetings, but the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Comcast to exclude our proposal. So instead we disclosed their campaign contributions ourselves, based on public records at the FEC, in our own filing with the SEC.\n\nNLPC\u2019s proposal won\u2019t get the boot this year.",

They were kind of floppy and messy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it sparked an interest in baking that I\u2019ve never had before.\u201d\n\nPeople across America are watching the results of Yang\u2019s growing interest in baking. She\u2019s one of the 12 contestants on the current season of Food Network\u2019s \u201cKids Baking Championship.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s made it to the top 4, the semifinals, and the season\u2019s final two episodes that are scheduled to air Monday night. (The competition show airs Mondays at 6 p.m. Mountain time on DirecTV and Dish, and 9 p.m. Mountain time on Comcast. It streams on Max, starting the following day.)\n\nUpdate, Mar. 3: Yang excelled in the semifinals, landing in the top 2 with her cookie birdhouse. In the finals, her chocolate cake \u2014 decorated with bears, forests and mountains \u2014 came up short behind the series winner, Micah Parsons of Stephenville, Texas.\n\n(Rob Pryce | Food Network) Arielle Yang of Sandy, Utah, is one of the contestants on season 13 of Food Network's \"Kids Baking Championship.\" The final two episodes of the season are scheduled to air Monday, March 3, 2025.\n\nEach week, Yang \u2014 a sixth grader at Waterford School \u2014 and the other contestants are given challenges to create a tasty and visually appealing baked confection. One by one, contestants are eliminated if their work isn\u2019t up to the standards set by hosts and judges Duff Goldman and Kardea Brown. The season winner gets a prize of $25,000.\n\nThe challenges this season are all animal-related, prompting the contestants to make macarons with creature faces, desserts with paw prints and a layered trifle meant to look like a terrarium \u2014 with icing decorations of insects and flowers.\n\nYang won the first week\u2019s challenge, wowing the judges with a lime tart made to look like a chameleon, with a peanut butter-cookie tail.\n\n\u201cI was a little surprised,\u201d Yang said about the win in an interview this week. \u201cIt gave me a confidence booster, and it showed me that I can bake and I deserve to be on the show.\u201d\n\nThe following week, on the macaron challenge, Yang was one of the two contestants on the bottom, because her macarons were underbaked. The third week, she and another contestant won a team challenge to make a cake inspired by the movie \u201cDog Man.\u201d (The product tie-ins are abundant. Other challenges have been inspired by the Disney Cruise Line, Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d and the upcoming \u201cSmurfs\u201d movie.)\n\nYang said her favorite among the first eight challenges \u2014 the network won\u2019t let her talk about shows that haven\u2019t aired yet \u2014 was in episode 7, where the young bakers were tasked with making cakes that resembled a pet\u2019s favorite food. (The challenge took a page from one of Yang\u2019s favorite baking shows \u2014 the Netflix series \u201cIs It Cake?,\u201d where bakers create cakes that are disguised to look like common objects.) Yang\u2019s cake, made to look like a slab of Swiss cheese, landed her in the top two that week.\n\n(Food Network) Arielle Yang, left, from Sandy, Utah, works with fellow contestant Ella Hayek on a team challenge \u2014 making a cake that looks half like a dog and half like a human \u2014 in an episode from season 13 of Food Network's \"Kids Baking Championship.\" The final two episodes of the season are scheduled to air Monday, March 3, 2025.\n\nIn last week\u2019s episode, Yang was one of the two contestants on the bottom, because her trifle didn\u2019t have enough cake layers \u2014 and Brown said the cake\u2019s chocolate flavor didn\u2019t mesh well with the lemon and passionfruit flavors of her cream layers.\n\nThe competition is fierce, and the young bakers show techniques that most home bakers don\u2019t usually encounter. For example, Yang\u2019s trifle included a layer of \u201cdiplomat cream,\u201d a mix of pastry cream and stabilized whipped cream.\n\nOne of the things Yang likes about baking, she said, is \u201cit\u2019s really precise. You have to get the exact measurements.\u201d\n\nUnlike competition shows with grown-up contestants, where there\u2019s lots of yelling and sometimes swearing, the competitors on \u201cKids Baking Championship\u201d are nice to each other, she said.\n\n\u201cWe all kind of just became friends as soon as we met,\u201d Yang said of her fellow contestants, who were between the ages of 10 and 13 during filming last June. \u201cI think we all bonded over baking, and some of us also shared different hobbies.\u201d For example, Yang said she and another contestant both took dance lessons.\n\n(Food Network) Arielle Yang, right, from Sandy, Utah, and fellow contestant Piper Lowe confer about dome cakes, in an episode from season 13 of Food Network's \"Kids Baking Championship.\"\n\nThe judges, Goldman and Brown, are \u201creally nice,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey\u2019re really funny, and they\u2019re also really talented. They\u2019re people to look up to. I think you just really want to impress them.\u201d\n\nEven surrounded by nice people, though, baking on television can be tough. \u201cIt certainly is really nerve-wracking,\u201d Yang said. \u201cYou have a lot of cameras following you, and the time limit is also really stressful. But I think, actually, baking calmes me down. So if I ever feel stressed, I just keep baking, and then I\u2019ll feel calm.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s mother, Grace Dong, said that \u201cduring filming, I actually feel like she dealt with stress better than I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watching her was a lot more stressful than her just doing the thing that she loves,\u201d she said. \u201cI was super-impressed by how she deals with any obstacles that come her way, and then finds a way to solve it.\u201d\n\nYang isn\u2019t the first Utahn to compete on \u201cKids Baking Championship.\u201d In 2019, in season 7, Sophie Tate of Stansbury Park made it all the way to the finals. Last season, Henry Muranaka of Bountiful was one of the contestants.\n\nYang said she and her family have seen the finished episodes as they\u2019ve aired, along with everybody else \u2014 so even though they know how the final challenges turn out, they\u2019ll be watching Monday night along with the rest of America.\n\n\u201cJust seeing myself on TV is really cool,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just cool to see how everything pans out and turns out OK. When I\u2019m baking on the show, I\u2019m usually focused on myself and what I\u2019m baking, right? I don\u2019t really focus on what the other people are doing. \u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always judging myself when I\u2019m baking,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, I should have done this,\u2019 or \u2018I should have done that.\u2019 But in the end, I\u2019m really proud of what I did.\u201d",

As for the TV, DirecTV's Entertainment package includes the Gemini Air streaming device and access to popular channels such as AMC, ESPN, HGTV, TNT and others, including your local networks, and costs $90 a month for the first two years. If you want your regional sports networks (the primary reason many have a traditional TV subscription, myself included), you'll need to upgrade to the Choice package. It starts at $90 a month for the first two years ($123 thereafter). However, be prepared for a regional sports fee that will add up to $18 or more to your bill.

CNET's Ty Pendlebury says YouTube TV has \"the best channel selection bar none.\" Your subscription comes with an assortment of at least 100 channels and includes your locals as well as channels you'll actually want to watch, like AMC, ESPN, HGTV, TBS and USA. Many regional sports networks aren't included, so you may want to consider bundling Frontier internet service with the DirecTV Choice package, if those are must-haves.

While the Spectrum Internet and TV Select Plus bundle is nothing fancy, it will fit the needs of many households with download speeds up to 500Mbps and 160 TV channels, including regional sports networks, starting at $105 per month.

But combined with a TV bundle, it's a service worth remembering. Verizon Fios and Fios TV Test Drive are unique in that you get to experience all 425-plus channels for 60 days. The Most Fios TV (which is the most expensive TV plan) also comes with unlimited streaming on your devices. After 60 days, Verizon will custom-create a channel lineup of 125 or so networks based on your selections. That's a pretty cool feature. Compared with other internet and TV bundles, Verizon Fios is on the steeper end when it comes to pricing. Still, the starting price of $145 for internet speeds up to 300Mbps and around 425 channels is an excellent value. Read full review . . .

For that, you'll need to upgrade to the More Fios TV package, which could even be more costly, starting at a bundled price of $169 a month when paired with Verizon Fios 300. Compare Check with Verizon Show more details Show more details Compare\n\nCox Bundle Internet Essential and Contour TV Preferred Our take - Cox internet service starts at $50 per month, but when you add an actual TV service (not its TV separate streaming service, which is a little more than your average TV package for a one-time charge of $60), the price jumps to $175 for the first year for the Contour TV Preferred package. That price will bring you a channel lineup with 170 or more networks like ESPN, HGTV, PBS, CBS, NBC and more. The price will also include your regional sports channels. Even better, this bundle also comes with additional channels and DVR service. Read full review . . .

Compared to Cox's internet and TV bundles, you can use more apps and save more money with the Xumo Streaming box. Compare Check with Cox Show more details Show more details Compare\n\nOptimum Bundle Fiber Internet 300 and Basic TV Our take - If you're looking for just TV service, you're better off looking elsewhere as Optimum requires you to bundle with internet to get TV service, so discounts don't really apply here. Still, you can expect competitive prices for these bundles. The cheapest internet and TV bundle, Optimum Fiber Internet 300 and Entertainment TV(with a stream box) starts at $65 ($40 for internet, $25 for TV) per month for download speeds up to 300Mbps and a channel lineup that includes around 45 networks. Additional perks include a prepaid MasterCard if you sign up online. The reward amount will depend on the speed tier you choose. Read full review . . .

The Everything TV bundle will cost you a fair bit more, around $120 per month plus taxes and fees, but the added cost is well worth it. The package comes with more than 150 additional channels and includes regional sports channels such as MSG and Yes Network. The Extra TV package comes out to $125 monthly. On the bright side, select addresses that sign up online may be eligible for discounts, lowering your monthly bill in the first year. Compare Check with Optimum Show more details Show more details Compare\n\nMediacom Bundle Prime Internet 100 and Local TV Our take - Like Optimum, Mediacom doesn't sell stand-alone TV services. To get TV, you have to sign up for internet, which means there are technically no discounts for bundling because there are no TV-only plans to compare the pricing to. Mediacom's rates can get pretty steep for the premium TV packages. For instance, the Internet 250 and Local TV start at just $61 per month. Read full review . . .

That deal is decent if you're considering just the local channels. But if you want more channel variety, it'll cost you more. You can upgrade to Essential TV, which has 125-plus channels starting at $156 per month when bundled with Internet 250, not including a broadcast fee of around $20 to $25. If you want regional sports networks, or any sports networks at all, including ESPN, you'll need to upgrade to the Variety TV package starting at $197 a month when bundled, plus the broadcast fee and a regional sports fee. Mediacom does not offer any internet and streaming TV bundles, but if you plan to stream using your Mediacom internet service, be mindful of the data cap. The Internet 250 plan comes with a data cap of 400GB per month and a fee of $10 for each 50GB block needed to compensate for your overage. Faster Mediacom internet plans come with more data, up to 2TB.

Starting at around $50 to $59 a month plus broadcast fees (which can easily add $20 or more to the cost), this Xfinity bundle offers speeds up to 150Mbps and a cable package that includes mostly just your local channels. For $30 or more per month, you can upgrade to the Xfinity Popular TV package, which comes with over 125 channels including your regional sports networks. Upgrading your internet plan may also be worth the added cost -- Xfinity has five faster speed tiers, up to gig service with maximum speeds of 1,200Mbps in select locations -- but if 150Mbps and local channels are all you need, you can't go wrong with Xfinity Connect and Choice TV.

It could also save you money upfront and on your monthly bill via discounts or cheaper rates.\n\nBundling YouTube TV with Frontier Fiber, for example, could get you $10 off the monthly TV subscription for one year. In most locations, Xfinity offers a $10 monthly discount for each bundled service. Other bundle savings may include free installation and more generous signup bonuses, such as higher-value gift cards.\n\nSigning up for TV and internet from the same provider may also present equipment and compatibility features not available with standalone services. Combination router and TV devices, like Optimum's Altice One box, can conserve space and potentially save you money on equipment rental costs but are only available to customers who sign up for both internet and TV.\n\nHowever, a general rule of thumb is to sign up only for the services you need to avoid falling into internet pricing traps.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nTips for choosing the best internet and TV bundle\n\nAs you can see in the list above, not all bundles are the same. Not only will internet and TV bundles vary by provider, but you'll also likely have multiple bundle combinations to choose from with each provider. Here's how to select the best one for your home.\n\nUnderstand your speed and entertainment needs\n\nBefore comparing available bundles, get an idea of what internet speeds you need and which TV channels you'd like to have. Selecting the bundle that most closely matches your needs is the best way to ensure you aren't paying for services you won't use, or paying for services that can't meet your household demands.\n\nIf you wouldn't sign up for gigabit internet by itself, you probably don't need it in a bundled package. Similarly, if you wouldn't sign up for a TV package with just your local channels, you can pass on any bundles with a locals-only channel lineup.\n\nCompare internet connection types\n\nWhen comparing bundles between providers, or possibly even different bundles from the same provider, consider the internet connection type.\n\nFiber is ideal for home internet, but few providers -- AT&T, Quantum Fiber and Frontier included -- offer a fiber TV service. Unless you're bundling with Verizon Fios, expect your fiber internet provider to offer a streaming TV service, if any at all.\n\nCable internet providers typically build bundles with standard cable TV packages, though some, such as Spectrum, may also have live TV streaming packages. There are pros and cons to each.\n\nStandard cable packages often come with better reliability and more recording storage, although equipment and broadcast fees tend to be higher. Streaming can be cheaper, but the savings may come with sacrificing storage space for recording shows.\n\nSome internet providers, especially those of the DSL and satellite variety, bundle with satellite TV providers like DirecTV. Such bundles require mounting a satellite dish somewhere in your home and will likely come with a two-year contract for TV service.\n\nConsider the fees, the fine print and other extras\n\nFor the most part, what you pay for internet each month will run fairly true to the advertised price. Renting a router may add to the cost, as will taxes and other minor fees, but that's about it.\n\nTV service is a bit different. Expect a broadcast fee to add anywhere from $15 to $25 to your monthly bill, plus an additional Regional Sports Fee if you have local sports networks. Equipment can also get pricey, with added fees for each TV box you rent, plus potential charges for DVR service. Be aware of these fees when comparing and signing up for a bundle package.\n\nAlong with added fees, you'll want to consider any service terms or contractual obligations. Does the internet come with a data cap? Does that satellite TV service require a two-year contract and a significant price jump after the first year?\n\nLastly, look for any special promotions or bonus offers that come with your bundle. I say \"lastly\" because special offers are the least significant factor when choosing a bundle -- pricing, speeds, channel selection and service terms are more important. If you're debating between bundles and one comes with a $200 gift card and the other doesn't, the decision becomes a bit easier to make.\n\nDecide if bundling is necessary\n\nKeep in mind that you don't always have to bundle. There may be times when selecting internet service from one provider and TV from another is more cost-effective than bundling. For instance, Verizon Fios internet is generally a better deal than Spectrum's internet service, but Spectrum is cheaper when it comes to TV service.\n\nHow we evaluated the top internet and TV bundles\n\nHands-on testing is central to CNET's reviews and recommendations of various products and services, but such a process is impractical if not impossible when it comes to home internet. Even if we could physically test each ISP, external and unavoidable factors such as the equipment (which will vary by provider and connection type), interference from nearby networks, the local infrastructure and even the time of day could affect the results.\n\nInstead of hands-on testing, we perform frequent, in-depth evaluations of national and regional ISPs and the bundles they offer. To start, we explore a provider's availability, technology and speed details using the most recent data from the Federal Communications Commission. Next, we look into all available plan options, including the number of plans to choose from, upload and download speeds, TV channel lineups and promotional versus standard pricing.\n\nPlans can vary by region, so we run multiple serviceability checks in various service areas to provide more informed speed, channel and pricing details. We also reach out to the providers directly to verify plan and pricing information.\n\nFinally, we look at service details such as data caps, added fees, contracts, price increases and other considerations to be aware of before signing up for an internet or TV service. When available, customer satisfaction reports like those from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, not to mention a look at what real customers have to say on sites like Reddit and Downdetector.com, provide further insight into evaluating an ISP. (Downdetector is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nAfter examining the applicable providers in a given category (in this case, \"best bundles\"), we determine which providers and plans we feel should be considered among the \"best.\" If you'd like to learn more about how we evaluate internet providers, check out our breakdown of how we review ISPs.\n\nInternet and TV bundle overview\n\nBundling internet and TV together is a convenient way to sign up for multiple services, and could even save you some money versus signing up for individual services.\n\nBundles will vary by provider, and each provider is likely to offer different bundles, so be sure to explore all your options to get the best bundle for your needs and your budget. Speeds, channel selection and pricing are important considerations, but pay attention to added fees and service terms when comparing bundles. Remember, you don't have to bundle internet and TV together if it makes more sense to get internet from one provider and TV from another.\n\nInternet and TV bundle FAQs\n\nWhat is the best bundle for TV and Internet? Cable providers often have the simplest and most cost-effective internet and TV bundles. Cable ISPs such as Cox, Mediacom, Optimum, Spectrum and Xfinity, for example, have multiple internet and TV bundles to choose from with varying speeds and channel lineups. Few fiber internet providers also offer a TV service, so bundles may include a streaming service. AT&T Fiber and DirecTV Stream bundles are popular, as are Frontier Fiber and YouTube TV bundles. Show more\n\nIs it better to bundle internet and TV? If you plan on getting internet and TV anyway, you might as well bundle them. Before you do, make sure you're getting the internet speeds you need and the channels you want without a cheaper option available elsewhere. Signing up only for services that you need will protect you from pricing traps. Signing up for a $70 cable package just to watch AMC, ESPN and TBS, for example, could have you paying more than necessary. Live TV streaming services offer similar channels to cable and often cost less -- Sling TV, for example, has those three channels and costs just $40. Additionally, many providers sell a \"basic\" or \"locals only\" TV package that charges you for channels you can get over the air for free with a digital antenna. On the other hand, if you want regional sports networks, a cable TV package may be your best (and sometimes only) option. To make things just a little more complicated, many internet providers now offer an internet and streaming bundle with streaming services such as YouTube TV, Sling TV or their own exclusive streaming service in addition to traditional TV. When cheap, we've included those bundles in the list above. Show more\n\nIs it cheaper to bundle internet and TV? Bundling internet and TV together may come with a monthly discount depending on the provider. Spectrum and Xfinity offer a bundle discount, but others including AT&T, Cox and Verizon Fios currently do not. Even if there is no discount available, bundling services may still save you money by cutting or combining installation and equipment costs. Show more\n\nCan I bundle internet and TV with different providers? Many DSL and fiber providers, such as CenturyLink and Frontier, do not offer stand-alone TV service and instead partner with national providers like DirecTV and Dish or streaming services to offer bundles. In these cases, you'll be bundling internet and TV with different providers, and possibly get a discount for doing so. If you just want internet from a fiber provider and TV from your local cable provider, however, a bundled package, especially one with a discount, is doubtful. There are no bundles, for example, that combine internet from AT&T Fiber and TV from Xfinity. Show more",

Comcast\u2018s \u201cSpinCo\u201d is scouting locations for a new Manhattan headquarters, which will incorporate groups of workers, some entertainment teams and MSNBC, including its NY studio space and a production facility.\n\nThe new entity teased last year and formally announced in November is led by NBCUniversal Media Group\u2019s Mark Lazarus, who updated staff this week on early plans in a memo obtained by Deadline. Several potential HQ locations are under consideration, sources indicate.\n\nEnglewood Cliffs, NJ, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, will remain home to CNBC as well as serving as the new company\u2019s technical operations hub. SpinCo is also securing dedicated space at 400 North Capitol, which will continue to be the DC Bureau for MSNBC and CNBC.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe new entity doesn\u2019t have a permanent name yet, with SpinCo used since the plan was first unveiled last fall. Lazarus said that should change soon \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re closing in\u201d on one, he wrote in the memo.\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable television networks USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel will join the new entity along with digital assets Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine, via a tax-free spin-off. Comcast shareholders will also have stock in the new public company, but its results will not be part of the mother ship\u2019s. Bravo, as well as NBC and streaming flagship Peacock will remain at Comcast alongside Telemundo and the broadband business, theme parks and experiences, and film and TV studios.\n\nThe spinoff is one of the most significant efforts yet in the television business to try to reckon with steep declines in linear TV subscribers, distribution fees and advertising revenue. It will give the cable network company, with projected annual revenue of about $7 billion, the option of engineering acquisitions or other deals in the challenged pay-TV sector.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery appears to be moving along a similar path. It is restructuring into two divisions, Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. Speaking with Wall Street analysts Thursday on WBD\u2019s quarterly earnings call CEO David Zaslav said the new structure would allow the company to \u201cwe\u2019ll be better able to respond to this generational disruption.\u201d WBD and Paramount Global last summer took a combined $15 billion in write-downs on the value of their cable networks, sending a clear signal to the industry about the extent of the decline.\n\nComcast, led by Chairman-CEO Brian Roberts with President Mike Cavanagh, said last November that they were aiming to complete the spinoff within one year.\n\nHere\u2019s the full memo:",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other stocks.\n\nFrom a certain perspective, domestic equities are off to a strong start this year. Despite a large selloff on February 21, the S&P 500 has gained a healthy 2.2% in less than two months, and the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are not far behind. If they can keep this momentum going, they're probably in for another successful year. Looking at the market in detail however, US stock indexes appear to be riding the coattails of the significant lead they built up after Trump's election on November 5 last year, much unlike their overseas competitors. According to JPMorgan, the relative underperformance of US stocks this year represents a 10% - 20% reversal of the pro-US investment pattern seen from April 2023 until the end of last year. Furthermore, the current excitement around Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has caused investors to reconsider US equity values, making Chinese tech stocks more tempting in the short term.\n\nInflation expectations have also risen, with the one-year projected inflation rate for US consumers rising to 4.3% in February from 3.3% in January. This increase in inflation expectations, along with a slowing economy, has sparked fears about stagflation, which is characterized as stalled growth and rising prices. According to a Bank of America poll of global fund managers published on February 18, the number of investors expecting stagflation in the coming year has hit a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, perceiving a trade war as a low-probability risk.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to rule out US stocks completely, given that US shares outperformed their international counterparts from the 2008 financial crisis to the end of 2024. Although international markets appear to be the hot place to be right now, analysts have much to like about US equities, particularly as S&P 500 companies report their most profitable quarter in years, with Wall Street projecting double-digit profit growth this year. According to Richard Ward, Chief Investment Officer of Curated Wealth Partners, overseas companies have performed better recently because stock pickers are seeking for bargains, not because of their fundamentals. Ward believes that investors should stay in US markets and look towards lower-cost sectors such as small caps and financials instead. He added:",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr opened an investigation into the diversity, equity and inclusion programs at telecommunications giant Verizon. In his letter informing Verizon of the probe, Carr invoked the company\u2019s proposal to purchase Frontier Communications, a deal the agency is reviewing.\n\n\n\nVerizon\u2019s website describes its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as including \u201cexecutive mentorship for women\u201d and \u201cexploring the impact of workplace bias.\u201d The site also notes that Verizon provides a nondiscriminatory work environment by \u201ccelebrating diversity across all spectrums, including but not limited to race, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, veteran/military status, and age.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Carr sent a similar letter to Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. Carr ordered the agency\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to investigate Comcast and NBCUniversal out of an alleged concern about their DEI initiatives. Earlier this week, NBCUniversal cancelled MSNBC programs hosted by Joy Reid, Alex Wagner, Katie Phang and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart. Reid is Black, Wagner and Phang are Asian, and D\u00edaz-Balart is Latino. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, who is Black, also announced this week that he\u2019s moving to a more limited role at the network.\n\n\n\nThis week, Paramount, which has its own merger with Skydance under FCC scrutiny, informed its staff it planned to scrap its DEI programs to comply with Trump-administration demands. Paramount owns CBS \u2014 which the FCC has also attacked for airing coverage the Trump administration dislikes.\n\n\n\nFree Press Co-CEO Jessica J. Gonz\u00e1lez said:\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a reason that President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr resort to using the acronym DEI when they attack diversity and inclusion efforts. DEI is just a collection of letters, a convenient bogeyman for their propaganda campaign against the growing diversity of the United States. This is part of their desperate attempt to maintain white dominance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear-eyed about what attacks on DEI really are: an attempt to legitimize discrimination against people of color, women, people with disabilities, religious minorities, LGBTQIA+ people and others who have faced bigotry in the United States. This is morally and legally wrong. Congress created the FCC to regulate our communications sector without discriminating on the basis of one\u2019s protected status. Preventing discrimination is right there in the statute, in Title 47 of the U.S. Code, Section 151.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrendan Carr\u2019s continued attacks on diversity and inclusion programs at private companies are not only racist and sexist, they almost certainly are a dereliction of his duty to carry out the FCC\u2019s mission. Carr is trying to twist the law to claim that measures designed to increase equality are in and of themselves discriminatory. This is a disingenuous and morally reprehensible position.\n\n\n\n\u201cCarr is abusing his power by threatening to hold up mergers or otherwise punish companies with government investigations for failing to fall in line with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda. In doing so, he is eroding equal opportunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cMedia owners need to resist this unjust incursion and defend their commitments to employing a diverse workforce. Companies like Comcast, Paramount and Verizon should not capitulate or comply with Carr\u2019s witch hunt. And Congress needs to intervene and do its job overseeing the FCC, whose pursuit of censorship, discrimination and cronyism is appalling.\u201d",

A Real Pain\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Jesse Eisenberg\n\nStars: Jesse Eisenberg, Kieran Culkin, Will Sharpe, Jennifer Grey, Kurt Egyiawan, Liza Sadovy, Daniel Oreskes\n\nRating: R\n\nWhen we meet cousins David (Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) it\u2019s in an airport as they prepare to embark on a trip of great ancestral significance, traveling to Poland to participate in a Jewish historical tour in honor of their recently deceased grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who played an outsized role in their family hierarchy, having been particularly close with Benji until her passing. The latter has since clearly fallen into depression, something etched in the fatigue lines of Culkin\u2019s face from the moment we first see him on an airport bench, desultorily scanning the unfamiliar faces as they swirl around him. Both cousins likely see the trip as some kind of conduit for emotional outpouring or transformation, but the relative lack of it ultimately afforded to them is seemingly part of Eisenberg\u2019s thesis: We plan for events like a vacation to change who we are as people, but we\u2019re naive to view change as something so transactional. Throughout, A Real Pain resists the gravitational pull of storytelling convention that insists upon clean character arcs and affirming revelations, opting for a more realistic journey in which it\u2019s difficult to say what, if anything, has truly changed. This both makes the film interesting as a narrative experiment and no doubt frustrating to a subset of the multiplex audience weaned on weepy dramedies of this sort, in which everyone ultimately learns the specific lesson their character requires to unlock growth, like an RPG character earning XP. \u2014Jim Vorel\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nStars: Zendaya, Josh O\u2019Connor, Mike Faist\n\nRating: R\n\nThere\u2019s no need to know, or even enjoy, anything about the sport of tennis to find enjoyment in director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Challengers. Still, tennis is inextricably knotted to its sensuous love triangle, which evolves over the course of 13 tumultuous years, climaxing with a match between two estranged players whose love story eclipses the more overt romance between the pair and Zendaya\u2019s tennis prodigy, Tashi Duncan. But it is a story of desire, love, power and co-dependency between three gifted young athletes who all hold that nagging fear, even in their early 30s, that their best years are behind them. The only thing that can reinvigorate their lost sparks is base, animalistic competition, like that which fueled their chaotic threesome over a decade prior to the lowly Fire Town challenger tournament in New Rochelle, New York. We first meet Tashi and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist), married and with a mostly neglected young daughter, after Tashi\u2019s best tennis-playing days are behind her (due to a consequential leg injury) and Art is all but bereft of his mojo. In an effort to get his head back in the game and out of early retirement, Tashi enrolls him in a challenger: A small, U.S. Open qualifier that should be beneath an athlete whose face adorns ads the size of building facades. The goal is to have Art compete against players who are obviously below him in order to loosen him up and regain his confidence. The only problem is, it\u2019s the same kind of minor sporting event that attracts a hard-up guy like Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor). Thirteen years earlier, Patrick and Art were both just two young tennis studs who once jerked off together (what guys can\u2019t say the same?), in love with the same beautiful woman. Thirteen years later, one of them got the girl, the other is cosplaying as poor, and the former two haven\u2019t spoken to the latter in years. The film is just as dynamic as its stars. Rapid cuts give the film a cohesive, kinetic rhythm that keeps the story in a near-constant state of momentum, and none of the frames the camera cuts to are superfluous compositions. This is matched by the occasionally dizzying camerawork from Gudagnino\u2019s Suspiria cinematographer (also Apichatpong Weerasethkul\u2019s on Memoria) Sayombhu Mukdeeprom. Challengers surprised me. It\u2019s a grandiose, propulsive, erotic follow-up to the dull, Tumblr-core emo of Bones and All, and I found myself enthralled by Guadagnino\u2019s latest, in which three of our hottest young actors convincingly, tantalizingly explore alternating dynamics of power and sexuality. Challengers isn\u2019t really a film for tennis fans\u2014it\u2019s a film for fans of guys being a little gay for each other, and also fans of the kind of explosive yearning that\u2019s even hotter than the sex scenes we all like to complain don\u2019t exist anymore.\u2013Brianna Zigler\n\n3. Bad Boys: Ride or Die\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirectors: Adil El Arbi, Bilall Fallah\n\nStars: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Joe Pantoliano, Rhea Seehorn\n\nRating: R\n\nThis is the buddy-cop dynamic this franchise has codified thus far: Marcus spends much of his character arc convincing Mike to tone down the bodycount, while Mike slowly comes to realize the consequences of a life beset on all sides by the endless death he\u2019s wrought. If the Bad Boys movies are mostly about the war raging in the soul of America\u2019s ideal psychopath supercop, then Bad Boys: Ride or Die paints that war with big and shameless Fast & Furious ambition, no longer questioning if Mike should kill, but why he does. Is he a Bad Boy, or a Good Boy who is so Good at doing Bad things that he\u2019s cosmically aligned with the nature of the Bad Boy? Is he the monolithic Good-Bad Boy, a true representation of punitive justice in its purest form? Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a genuine crowd-pleaser, just undeniably captivating, funny and raging, neon-pink copaganda. It serves as both a fitting end to the franchise, while leaving room to make one more. And if that happens, I will be seated. \u2014Dom Sinacola\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Kelsey Mann\n\nStars: Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Paul Walter Hauser, Yvette Nicole Brown, Ron Funches\n\nRating: PG\n\nInside Out 2, the sequel to the Oscar-winning film, revisits Riley (now voiced by Kensington Tallman) in the full-blown throes of adolescence. Thirteen-year-old Riley is about to graduate from eighth grade. In the first movie, Riley was adapting to life in California. Now Riley is adapting to leaving middle school behind for high school. Parents of teens will be charmed (and definitely feel validated) by how accurately the movie captures this period of time.\u201cFamily island\u201d is blocked by \u201cfriendship island\u201d in Riley\u2019s brain. A construction crew comes through her mind and posts a \u201cPardon Our Dust. Puberty is Messy.\u201d sign. That\u2019s when all the new emotions descend on Riley. There\u2019s Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) and my personal favorite, Ennui (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos). With her head constantly bent over, Ennui, who is obviously French, is too exhausted to even get up off the couch and controls Riley\u2019s console from her phone. Exarchopoulos\u2019 droll delivery is one of the film\u2019s many highlights. The script by Meg LeFauve (who also wrote Inside Out) and Dave Holstein perfectly captures our complex minds. Nostalgia (June Squibb) humorously keeps trying to make an appearance. Suppressed emotions, brainstorms, dark secrets and streams of consciousness are all brought to life. As in the first movie, Inside Out 2 is vibrant and full of color with fun, tongue-in-cheek visuals. (Sarcasm literally causes a chasm). And these new emotions have a darker spin: Anxiety is bright orange, a pulsating bundle of nerves; Envy is green, naturally; and Embarrassment gets more pink with each passing humiliation. Director Kelsey Mann keeps the action zipping along, while Amy Poehler brings that same determined effervescence to Joy. And Hawke, as the increasingly frantic emotion who thinks she\u2019s helping until she realizes too late that she\u2019s not, plays Anxiety just right. I took my very own Riley to the screening. After the movie, which she enjoyed, she told me she felt \u201ccalled out\u201d by much of what she had seen. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she responded. \u201cAt least now you know what\u2019s going on in my head.\u201d\u2014Amy Amatangelo\n\n5. The Substance\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Coralie Fargeat\n\nStars: Demi Moore, Margaret Qualley, Dennis Quaid\n\nRating: R\n\nIn terms of sheer dominance over The Discourse, there can be no doubt that 2024 belonged body, mind and soul to Coralie Fargeat\u2019s The Substance. A quantum leap forward in terms of ambition and sophistication after her slick but streamlined 2017 debut thriller Revenge, The Substance is an ode to self-destruction and bruised egos, greed and blindness to cycles of perpetuated avarice.\n\nMuch of the film\u2019s success comes down to the incredible willingness that Fargeat taps into in its performers to make themselves as reprehensible\u2013and yes, \u201cugly\u201d\u2013as possible, becoming portraits of desperate individuals who have long since abandoned common decency or a shred of empathy. That of course includes Demi Moore\u2019s Elisabeth, who pathetically clings to the faintest shreds of vicarious achievement despite the fact that she can\u2019t really enjoy them, addicted to the rush of seeing her avatar succeed even as she resents herself and physically drains herself dry. It includes Dennis Quaid\u2019s not-so-subtly named Harvey, a slavering psychopath who treats his talent with no more respect or tact than he puts into masticating an entire plate of shrimp in a sequence that rivals any of the other stomach-churning sights of The Substance. And the willingness to tap into the depraved side of human nature even applies to Margaret Qualley\u2019s pristine Sue as well, a woman so eager to debase and objectify herself just to live up to the archaic standards of success set by Elisabeth, never once considering that her unique circumstances could afford her a second chance to live life different than Elisabeth previously did \u201cin her prime.\u201d The tragedy of The Substance is that Sue can\u2019t even conceive of a more fulfilling alternative than willingly throwing herself into the exact same meat grinder that chewed up Elisabeth and spit her out, except Sue is apparently determined to speedrun the entire process.\n\nOn a thematic and visual level, The Substance has perhaps been given more credit at times for its outrageousness or uniqueness than it necessarily demands, which mostly serves to illustrate how this kind of boundary stepping body horror has become a rarity to see on a big screen in recent years. Reactions to the film almost serve as a litmus test for whether any prospective horror geek has ever gotten around to seeing Brian Yuzna\u2019s Society from 1989\u2013if you have, then you probably find Fargeat\u2019s film a bit less shocking. But the sheer, unapologetic gusto with which The Substance tackles its squelchy, bone-cracking delights makes its combo of visceral transformation and misanthropic satire into a vital piece of modern horror filmmaking, anchored by some of the best performances the genre has seen in recent memory. \u2014Jim Vorel\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Rose Glass\n\nStars: Kristen Stewart, Katy O\u2019Brian, Jena Malone, Anna Baryshnikov, Dave Franco, Ed Harris\n\nRating: R\n\nLove Lies Bleeding is, in actuality, a far more effective horror film than Saint Maud. Filmmaker Rose Glass excels at crafting horrific images, moments of pure grotesquery and terror, and she pushes the boundaries of an otherwise grounded thriller-crime drama into something that resembles a gorgeous night terror. Sensuality oozes from every frame for a film that isn\u2019t even terribly gratuitous during its sex scenes. But the physical act of sex between bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O\u2019Brian) and gym manager Lou (Kristen Stewart) equals otherwise non-sexual scenes, such as Lou jabbing a syringe into Jackie\u2019s butt cheek, or Lou Sr. (Ed Harris) whispering in Jackie\u2019s ear before she fires a gun\u2014or even Jackie\u2019s roid rage-fueled murder of JJ (Dave Franco), which plunges Jackie and Lou\u2019s passionate neophyte romance into an explicitly gay Thelma and Louise, where the two lovers must flee the wrath of Lou\u2019s criminal family. The connection between the two women is desperate, carnal and overwhelming, if simultaneously toxic and even a little superficial. Suddenly, nothing matters to Lou quite as much as her ripped new girlfriend, whom she\u2019s more than happy to continue supplying with body-enhancing drugs that cause Monstar-like eruptions under her skin in sequences of heightened surrealism. As the walls close in on Jackie and Lou, Glass amps up the tension with tight, suffocating shots, propulsive editing and an absorbing score by Clint Mansell. At the center of it all is Jackie and Lou\u2019s cacophonous romance. By all accounts, the gay Romeo and Juliet were doomed from the start. Stewart and O\u2019Brian have incredible chemistry, and Stewart\u2019s understated naturalism really shines. Love Lies Bleeding is easily one of the best of 2024 so far: A thorny, thrilling narrative about two fucked-up women that is\u2014most importantly\u2014genuinely, scintillatingly hot. The film is also very obviously about the myriad, terrifying ways human beings express love to one another, and on the surface seems to question which ones are more or less valid.\u2013Brianna Zigler\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Pascal Plante\n\nStars: Juliette Gari\u00e9py, Laurie Babin, Elisabeth Locas, Maxwell McCabe-Lokos, Natalie Tannous, Pierre Shagnon, Guy Thauvette\n\nRating: NR\n\nRed Rooms is a movie fixated on a single performance, itself fixated on a serial killer. The performance is that of Juliette Gari\u00e9py, fantastic as the unblinking Kelly-Anne. The serial killer is the Gollum-like and dead-eyed Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos), accused of butchering three young girls live on a pay-per-view stream. This dark web snuff stream is a Red Room, and it\u2019s unclear what aspect of the case Kelly-Anne is obsessed with as she stares intently in the background of the film\u2019s gripping courtroom scenes.\n\nIs she another romanticizing rubbernecker here to ogle real deaths as true-crime entertainment? Or is it darker? Is she\u2014like her trial-observing counterpart Cl\u00e9mentine (Laurie Babin, excelling at a more emotive, girlish foil)\u2014a hybristophilic fangirl, a prison groupie who\u2019d send a love letter to Ted Bundy? These questions, and the complexity that lies underneath, drive Red Rooms beyond the effectively daunting way writer/director Pascal Plante reveals the details of the central crimes. And, without ever showing too much, Plante has crafted one hell of a stomachache. He doesn\u2019t show, and he barely tells. The little we do glean only adds to the dreadful realism. Less than two hours, yet feeling like an eternity thanks to some well-planned and executed long takes (featuring some particularly engaging monologues from Natalie Tannous, playing the prosecutor), Red Rooms traps us in the mindset of its intense lead as we get ever more involved with the case. \u2014Jacob Oller\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Mike Cheslik\n\nStars: Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, Olivia Graves, Wes Tank\n\nRating: NR\n\nHundreds of Beavers is a lost continent of comedy, rediscovered after decades spent adrift. Rather than tweaking an exhausted trend, the feature debut of writer/director Mike Cheslik is an immaculately silly collision of timeless cinematic hilarity, unearthed and blended together into something entirely new. A multimedia extravaganza of frozen idiocy, Hundreds of Beavers is a slapstick tour de force\u2014and its roster of ridiculous mascot-suited wildlife is only the tip of the iceberg. First things first: Yes, there are hundreds of beavers. Dozens of wolves. Various little rabbits, skunks, raccoons, frogs and fish. (And by \u201clittle,\u201d I mean \u201csix-foot stuntmen in cheap costumes.\u201d) We have a grumpy shopkeeper, forever missing his spittoon. His impish daughter, a flirty furrier stuck behind his strict rage. And one impromptu trapper, Jean Kayak (co-writer/star Ryland Brickson Cole Tews), newly thawed and alone in the old-timey tundra. Sorry, Jean, but you\u2019re more likely to get pelted than to get pelts. With its cartoonish violence and simple set-up comes an invigorating elegance that invites you deeper into its inspired absurdity. And Hundreds of Beavers has no lack of inspiration. The dialogue-free, black-and-white comedy is assembled from parts as disparate as The Legend of Zelda, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s The Gold Rush, JibJabs, Terry Gilliam animation, Guy Maddin and Jackass. Acme is namechecked amid M\u00e9li\u00e8s-like stop tricks and Muppety puppetry, while its aesthetic veers from painting broad violence upon a sparse snowy canvas to running through the shadowy bowels of an elaborate German Expressionist fortress. Guiding us through is Tews. He\u2019s a wide-eyed mime with a caricatured lumberjack body, expertly gauging his expressions and sacrificing his flesh for the cause. His performance takes a little from the heavy-hitters of the form: The savvy romanticism of Harold Lloyd, the physical contortions of Buster Keaton, the underdog struggles of Charlie Chaplin, and the total bodily commitment of all three. You don\u2019t get great physical comedy accidentally. Just as its intrepid idiot hero forges bravely on despite weathering frequent blows to the head, impaled extremities and woodland beatings, Hundreds of Beavers marches proudly towards the sublime transcendence of juvenilia. In its dedication to its own premise, Hundreds of Beavers reaches the kind of purity of purpose usually only found in middle-school stick-figure comics or ancient Flash animations\u2014in stupid ideas taken seriously. One of the best comedies in the last few years, Hundreds of Beavers might actually contain more laughs than beavers. By recognizing and reclaiming the methods used during the early days of movies, Mike Cheslik\u2019s outrageous escalation of the classic hunter-hunted dynamic becomes a miraculous DIY celebration of enduring, universal truths about how we make each other laugh.\u2013Jacob Oller\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Josh Margolin\n\nStars: June Squibb, Fred Hechinger, Richard Roundtree, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg, Malcolm McDowell\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEvery good action hero knows you\u2019ve got to stick to your guns. Ethan Hunt is a marathon-running master of disguise. John Wick has never lost count of his remaining bullets. Jackie Chan\u2019s various inspectors and agents view the world as their personal set of monkey bars. When writer/director Josh Margolin\u2019s debut Thelma keeps its sights trained on its rogue granny on a mission (June Squibb), its hilarious geriatric reframe of action-movie tropes has a game champion. Like its absentminded hero, the film can sometimes get sidetracked right when things are getting good, wandering down schmaltzy or twee narrative paths. But when it lets Thelma (and Squibb) do her thing, the comedy is perfectly cute and a stellar showcase for what an actor\u2019s late career can offer.\n\nIn fact, much of Thelma is about adjusting our ideas around aging. There\u2019s novelty in the comedic turns from the 94-year-old Squibb and her 81-year-old co-star, Richard Roundtree (in his final film role). These actors get to tap a well that\u2019s unique to their age and the genre without sticking them into the boxes that generally contain old performers. They\u2019re not utterly dignified, wisdom-dispensing elders. They\u2019re not tragic victims of time. And they\u2019re certainly, blessedly not the dreaded \u201crapping grannies\u201d who are more punchline than performer. As the pair abscond on their quest to retrieve Thelma\u2019s stolen savings, solicited from her cookie jar and mattress by phone scammers, they\u2019re clearly complex, pulling off warm humor, endless charm and impressive stunts. A 94-year-old doesn\u2019t have to ride a motorcycle off a cliff to make you gasp. \u2014Jacob Oller\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nStars: Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Alyla Browne\n\nRating: R\n\nIf you ever took a class on the Greek classics, you might remember that the epics of Homer are defined by their first words. The Odyssey is the story of a \u201cman,\u201d while the Iliad is a story of \u201c\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2,\u201d which is often translated as wrath, rage\u2026or fury. The epics of George Miller barely need words at all, yet Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the Iliad to Fury Road\u2019s stripped-down Odyssey. The latter\u2019s elegant straight-line structure is replaced with lush chapters, documenting the interconnected systems of post-apocalyptic nation-gangs through the years. Through it all, a Dickensian hero clings to this world\u2019s seedy undercarriage. Reducing Furiosa down to a single word does it as little justice as it does the sagas it scraps, welds and reuses like its countless Frankenstein vehicles. But understanding George Miller\u2019s Fury Road prequel as the story of war\u2014of sprawling futility, driven by the same cyclical cruelty that turned its deserts into Wastelands\u2014makes it far more than a satisfying origin story. (Though, it\u2019s that too). Furiosa speaks the language of epics fluently, raging against timeless human failure while carrying a seed of hope. What we learn, we learn through the eyes of Furiosa, from the moment she\u2019s ripped from the Green Place of Many Mothers as a child, to the second before she tears out of Immortan Joe\u2019s Citadel, smuggling Fury Road\u2019s stowaways. As Furiosa grows from traumatized child (Alyla Browne) to damaged adult (Anya Taylor-Joy), she survives the slave-labor bowels of the Citadel, claws her way into a position aboard a trade caravan and waits for the perfect moment to enact revenge upon her initial captor, the chaotic, power-hungry biker warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). Pushing back on the various men who hunt them, Browne and Taylor-Joy\u2019s performances work in stunning tandem, steadily heating the steely young girl\u2019s resolve until it turns molten. When you match the most powerful eyes in the business with Miller\u2019s evocative framing (Furiosa is shot a bit like Galadriel\u2019s brush with evil in Lord of the Rings\u2014somewhere between avenging angel and Frank Miller cover), you get all the character you need. Each action scene, whether another amazing chase or a desperate rescue mission deep in enemy territory, is driven just as deeply by visual logic as by spectacle. These stunning visions of neo-medieval torture in Hell\u2019s junkyard only work if we can make sense of it all. Furiosa is a film well-planned and deeply dreamed. Miller\u2019s movies strip folkloric epics down to their basic mechanical parts, functional skeletons that run on raw emotion like the war machines running on piss and guzzolene. \u2013Jacob Oller\n\n11. Twisters\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Isaac Chung\n\nStars: Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Anthony Ramos, Brandon Perea, Maura Tierney, Sasha Lane, Kiernan Shipka\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nA follow-up to his poignant, Oscar-nominated autobiographical drama Minari, Twisters might seem like an odd fifth feature for director Lee Isaac Chung. Odd, yes, to those with little knowledge of the film industry and a lot of straightforward common sense\u2014why hand a filmmaker by all accounts concerned with small, personal features the keys to a blockbuster franchise sequel? But that\u2019s just Hollywood de rigueur, seen with the likes of Jurassic World and the MCU, often to, shall we say, mixed results. Studios like to slap an indie up-and-comer\u2019s name on a feature while allowing them little to no real creative leeway, giving the illusion of artistry and progress while the suits at the studio pull all the strings. And while there is no outwardly auteurist stamp on Twisters to make it feel like anything other than that Chung was a hired hand, Twisters certainly isn\u2019t Eternals. On the contrary, Twisters is, at best, pretty fun\u2014a decidedly breezy two hours. It has thrills, and chills, and Glen Powell doing his darndest to bring the concept of \u201cmovie star\u201d back into the year 2024. The tornado effects are impressive (special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher was also in charge of the VFX on Oppenheimer), especially on an IMAX screen. And there is a not insignificant push of focus onto the casualties of tornadoes in contrast to the original 1996 film, which gives the sequel a more present sense of scale and tragedy. \u2014Brianna Zigler\n\n12. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nStars: Jenna Ortega, Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Monica Belluci, Justin Theroux, Willem Dafoe\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice takes Burton back to what he does best: silly-scary horror-comedy that at once feels lovingly homespun and vibrantly realized. His ambitions aren\u2019t high with this 35-years-later sequel, but they don\u2019t have to be. In returning to a world with a solid foundation but relatively unexplored fringes, mysterious enough to expand on the rules of the afterlife or make them more pliable to his liking, Burton seems keen to let loose. His work isn\u2019t bogged down like so many of his later films. It\u2019s a trifling diversion, but it\u2019s also Burton\u2019s most comfortable, freewheeling and satisfying movie in years.\n\nAs implied, this is a Beetlejuice sequel through and through, bearing all the meaning that may have to you depending on your relationship to the original material. To me, it means a thinly sketched-out story with broad ideas of characters that exist to deliver an assembly line of clever, gross and funny sight gags which, to be fair, the film is packed to the brim with. This sequel\u2019s existence harkens back to a time where something like this was released out of Hollywood without much in the way of pomp, nor circumstance. Though, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice acts as something of an inverse to its predecessor: Whereas the first film follows a relatively simple throughline of small-town domesticity coming crashing down under the sudden cognizance of life after death, its sequel is defined by an excess of storylines, all vying for their claim to a meager slice of the 100-minute runtime. \u2014Trace Sauveur\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Oz Perkins\n\nStars: Maika Monroe, Nicolas Cage, Alicia Witt, Blair Underwood, Kiernan Shipka\n\nRating: R\n\nThe first thing I wanted to do after seeing Longlegs is take a shower. Some horror movies have you looking over your shoulder on the way out of the theater, jumping at shadows in the parking lot. These are the horror movies that follow you. Longlegs doesn\u2019t follow you. You\u2019re drenched in Longlegs. It\u2019s all over you\u2014in your hair, on your clothes\u2014by the time the credits roll. Its fear is less tangible than a slasher or a monster, even less than a demon. It\u2019s just something in the air, in the back of your mind, like the buzz of a fluorescent lamp. Oz Perkins\u2019 Satanic serial killer hunt is his most accessible movie yet, putting the filmmaker\u2019s lingering, atmospheric power towards a logline The Silence of the Lambs made conventional. Precisely crafted and just odd enough to disarm you, allowing its evil to fully seep in, Longlegs is a riveting tale of influence and immersion. After FBI agent Lee Harker (Maika Monroe) successfully, and mysteriously, locates a killer on little more than a hunch, her charming boss, Agent Carter (Blair Underwood), assigns the quiet savant to a long-dormant investigation into a suspect known only by how he signs the coded letters found at the crime scenes: Longlegs (Nicolas Cage). Only, the mystery to be solved isn\u2019t Clue. You\u2019re not filling in weapon, location, suspect. The question crawling under Longlegs\u2019 skin is how grounded this case actually is, whether it\u2019s a truly by-the-book procedural or whether that book is bound in skin and filled with spells. Lee is tight-lipped and uneasy in her own skin, a child\u2019s soft voice wrapped in a blue FBI windbreaker. But she doesn\u2019t balk at corpses, or head for the hills once she realizes she\u2019s on Longlegs\u2019 radar. Longlegs could also feel like familiar territory for Cage, at first glance. And that\u2019s all we get at first, glances. Like any good monster movie, we\u2019re denied a close look at Longlegs for a decent chunk of the movie\u2019s three segments, but once we see him, that\u2019s all you can think about. You see how a demonic seed has been planted and left to its own devices, down in some forgotten cellar, festering in the dark. As Perkins\u2019 story progresses, you wonder where else those seeds have spread. It\u2019s rotten Americana, every god-fearing Bible-thumper\u2019s fears proven right. Longlegs contains a handful of impressively controlled performances, a dilapidated aesthetic rich with negative space, a queasy score, a methodical but always gripping pace, and one of the most original and upsetting horror villains in a long while. Perkins\u2019 haunted vision is so convincing, you also might feel like scrubbing it off of you after you\u2019ve hustled back to the safety of your home.\u2013Jacob Oller\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson\n\nStars: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Issa Rae, Jason Schwartzman\n\nRating: PG\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse webs its way into a far more jaded world, one overstuffed with superhero sequels, and specifically, multiverse storytelling. And yet Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings in and, yet again, wipes the floor with its genre brethren by presenting a sequel that is both kinetic and deeply emotional. The script by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Dave Callaham (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) smartly builds upon the foundation of its already established characters, their relationships and the ongoing consequences from the first film to further explore the lives of secret teen superheroes Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) a year after the first film. The writers do so with a clear agenda to not only best themselves visually, but by upping the game of the now-familiar multiple-timeline tropes. Together with the talents of directing team Joaquim Dos Santos (The Legend of Korra), Kemp Powers (Soul) and Justin K. Thompson (Into the Spider-Verse), Across the Spider-Verse\u2014across the board\u2014swings for the cinematic fences in the rare sequel that feels like every frame has been crafted with the intention of wringing every bit of visual wonder and emotional impact that the animators, the performers and the very medium can achieve. The hybrid computer-animation meets hand-drawn techniques established in the first films returns with a more sleek execution that\u2019s a bit easier on the eyes, which affords the animators to get even more ambitious with their array of techniques and character-centric presentations. The depth and breadth of the animation and illustration styles are jaw-dropping. There are frames you just want to fall into, they\u2019re so beautifully rendered and conceived. If there\u2019s any critique, it\u2019s that the more action-centric sequences are almost too detailed, so that the incredible work of the animators moves off-screen so quickly that you feel like you\u2019re not able to fully appreciate everything coming at you. As a middle film in the trilogy (Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is due in theaters in 2024), it\u2019s a joy to be able to say that Across the Spider-Verse stands well on its own, based on the merits of its story and stakes. There\u2019s also a killer cliffhanger that sets the stage for a third chapter that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cheating its audience like some other recent films have done (cough Dune cough). In fact, repeat viewings of Across the Spider-Verse to bridge the gap until the final installment next year sounds like a great way to savor this film as it so richly deserves.\u2014Tara Bennett\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nStars: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Jerrod Carmichael\n\nRating: R\n\nYorgos Lanthimos\u2019 off-kilter, pastel-drenched Poor Things opens with static shots of silken embroidery. It is hard to ascertain the images themselves, threaded so neatly in a near-identical gray. But the slippery, elusive texture is integral to the film, which weaves together something thick and rich with detail. What follows is narrow in its focus and big and engulfing in its scale: The story of a young woman who must overcome the experiments enacted against her while embracing her changing body and irrepressible urges. As such, this adaptation of Alasdair Gray\u2019s book of the same name is difficult to summarize, loosely following Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) as she grows to embrace adulthood despite the overbearing tutelage of her de facto father God (Willem Dafoe). Once introduced to the dashing and cocky Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), Bella recognizes the pitfalls of her sheltered life and endeavors to travel around the world, experiencing life anew before marrying her father\u2019s sweet and bumbling assistant Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef). Lying in the genre gulf between science fiction and straightforward drama, Poor Things also finds time to unleash Stone\u2019s ability as a physical comedian, building a sticky, entrancing bodily language that lives somewhere between twitchy, childlike enthusiasm and mystical knowingness. She wanders through their eclectic family home with an unsteady gait, crashing into delicately hung porcelain displays and cackling rather than cowering at the destruction which follows. It is a deliciously amoral journey, the kind that has already secured Lanthimos ample praise over the course of his career. But this is perhaps the filmmaker\u2019s most garish and confident endeavor, using Bella\u2019s naive perspective to design a world so heightened that it exists somewhere between a nightmare and a dream. Somewhat surprisingly, Poor Things feels like it is in conversation with Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, right down to Stone\u2019s robotic, doll-like physique. Where Barbie feels shallow and tentative in its understanding of what it means to physically grow up, Poor Things is bold and radically (at times uncomfortably) honest. It will satisfy fans of Lanthimos\u2019 previous work and perhaps win over new viewers who are desperate to engage in the kind of coming-of-age stories that propel the genre forward. \u2014Anna McKibbin\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Chad Stahelski\n\nStars: Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown, Laurence Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rina Sawayama, Lance Reddick, Scott Adkins\n\nRating: R\n\nEarly in John Wick: Chapter 4, our titular Baba Yaga\u2014played by Keanu Reeves after a decade as a near-mute terminator monk, his monastic frock a fine three-piece bulletproof suit and his tonsure a greased-down mane the color of night\u2014is still in hiding following Chapter 3\u2019s cliffhanger. Of course, an ever-increasing bounty on his head hasn\u2019t stopped him from continuing to murder a lot of people, including the Elder (George Georgiou), who\u2019s not the same Elder from Chapter 3, because, as this new Elder explains, he killed the last guy and took over, as the Elder did before that guy, and the Elder before that guy did to the guy before that guy. The convoluted hierarchy of the John Wick Murderverse exists only to multiply and grow more convoluted: In Chapter 2, no one sat above the High Table, except for, as introduced in Chapter 3, the Elder, who sits above and also beside it, but apparently has his share of problems. Just as the membership of the High Table is susceptible to sociopathic sibling rivalry (see Chapter 2), there will always be another Elder to kill, another personal war to wage, another henchman to shoot repeatedly in the face. \u201cNo one, not even John Wick, can kill everyone,\u201d we hear said in an awed tone. But no, he must kill everyone. This is what we want and this is how this ends, how John Wick can be free: He kills the whole world. If Chapter 3 began immediately following Chapter 2, rarely letting up from its videogame formula as levels grew more difficult and bad guys became more immune to John Wick\u2019s superpower (murder), then Chapter 4 is the franchise\u2019s most deliberate entry yet. With three movies worth of stakes and worldbuilding behind it, Chad Stahelski\u2019s latest hyper-violent opus is a modern masterpiece of myth-making indulgence and archetypal action cinema. Stahelski and Reeves know that their movie must inhale genres, superstars, models, singers, Oscar winners and martial arts icons, DTV and prestige alike; consume them and give them space to be sacrificed gloriously to a franchise that values them. Behold Donnie Yen\u2014who feels absolutely at home in the Murderverse\u2014but also Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama and Clancy Brown and Scott Adkins, the latter given a lengthy neck-snapping set piece that\u2019s both scene-chewing madness and an expected physical display from Adkins. It\u2019s all patient and omnivorous and beyond ridiculous. Stahelski wields bodies to push them to god-like ends. Everything on screen is stupendous. This is what we want, to watch John Wick murder the whole world, forever and ever amen.\u2014Dom Sinacola\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nStars: Jesse Plemons, Emma Stone, Margaret Qualley, Willem Dafoe, Hong Chau\n\nRating: R\n\nYorgos Lanthimos is sorry that his movies won all those awards. He hasn\u2019t said as much, but that feels like the subtext buried not so far beneath the warmly shot, chilly-affect surface of Kinds of Kindness \u2013 perhaps easier to excavate than the movie\u2019s actual thematic concerns. The triptych of dark, minimalist fables that comprise Kindness share actors, an unnerving Twilight Zone tone, and a series of rhymes and echoes that sometimes feel like a chorus repeatedly transposed into different keys. But they most immediately, obviously share a lack of interest in being liked. At times, it more resembles the kind of untoward poking, prodding, libidinous-yet-grotesque project Bella Baxter herself might wind up writing and directing. So call it Sad Jesse Sad, because the movie keeps reincarnating recessive everyman Jesse Plemons. First, in \u201cThe Death of R.M.F,\u201d he plays a man who strives to serve his boss (Willem Dafoe) to a maniacal degree of absurdity, surrendering control of every aspect of his life, until he finally reaches a line that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable crossing. In \u201cR.M.F. Is Flying,\u201d a new Plemons character becomes fanatically devoted to his own idea: the conviction that when his wife (Emma Stone) returns after being lost at sea, she is not actually who she claims to be. Finally, the cultish behavior of the first two segments becomes more explicit in \u201cR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,\u201d where Plemons takes a secondary role to Stone \u2013 both playing cult members looking for someone with the power to resurrect the dead. The stories in Kinds of Kindness, by virtue of appearing in quick and cast-linked succession, feel more like poking, sometimes poky, conspicuously constructed experiments \u2013 even though, if anything, the characters speak with somewhat less hushed, formalized detachment. Maybe this is his weird, Martian version of a cinema of sensations, where characters pursue their beliefs relentlessly, and the filmmaker indulges a kind of kindness by letting them, no matter how destructive. Or maybe it\u2019s just a series of elaborate reminders that awards, in whatever form, aren\u2019t everything.\u2013Jesse Hassenger\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett\n\nStars: Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Alisha Weir, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand\n\nRating: R\n\nThe filmmaking collective led by directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett and producer Chad Villella are more than great shoppers for the ingredients; they can also really cook. The ingredients are assembled again for the group\u2019s latest feature, Abigail, a new take on Universal\u2019s classic Dracula\u2019s Daughter story, albeit one with an entirely different story dreamed up by writers Stephen Shields and Guy Busick. As with their previous major releases, Radio Silence brings the right atmosphere, the right blend of horror and comedy, and a great ensemble cast led by some seasoned horror performers. It\u2019s a beautifully set table, but Abigail really comes alive when Radio Silence flips that table and sprays it with gore, transforming a high concept into a chaotic, gleefully gruesome piece of popcorn horror. The girl of the title, played by Alisha Weir, looks like a cute young ballerina with a rich father. But, as every trailer for the film has informed us, she\u2019s actually a vicious and clever vampire, which spells lots of troubles for the sextet of kidnappers who\u2019ve been hired to abduct her for a hefty ransom. It\u2019s only supposed to take about 24 hours of keeping Abigail at a spooky old country house before the ransom money pours in, so everyone \u2013 Frank (Dan Stevens), Dean (Angus Cloud), Sammy (Kathryn Newton), Joey (Melissa Barrera), Peter (Kevin Durand), and Rickles (William Catlett) \u2013 decides to get a little drunk, try to relax, and wait for the long day to end in piles of cash. Right away, though, Joey senses something is wrong, particularly when Abigail starts to peel back her scared little girl persona just enough to let some not-so-veiled threats slip through. Soon, intrigue, paranoia, and sheer brutality emerge, as the kidnappers begin to realize they\u2019re in way, way over their heads. While it\u2019s certainly not the most frightening horror film you\u2019ll see this year, Abigail might end up holding the title of the goopiest, goriest mainstream studio release of 2024. Bettenelli-Olpin and Gillett, no strangers to over-the-top violence, keep building and building on every injury, every kill, every new piece of vampire lore they lace into the narrative, until by the end there\u2019s blood on every surface, bodies popping like grapes, and a sense of seat-of-your-pants joy that will have fans of gore effects cheering. For seasoned horror fans, it\u2019s that sense of gory fun that will shine through most. Abigail is a brutal, bloody blast.\u2013Matthew Jackson\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Wes Ball\n\nStars: Owen Teague, Freya Allan, Kevin Durand, Peter Macon, William H. Macy.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nIt should have never been a surprise that the Planet of the Apes franchise would rear its head again, though Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is content to build off the goodwill of the reboot trilogy rather than attempt another full reinvention. Wes Ball (director of the Maze Runner trilogy) takes charge from Matt Reeves, but continues to follow the legacy of science-project-turned-war-captain Caesar. Caesar\u2019s quest for ape liberation, amid humanity\u2019s downfall to the Simian Flu pandemic, and heroic death have afforded him martyrdom\u2014legend status further down the timeline; as the film puts it, \u201cmany generations later.\u201d That\u2019s where we meet up with Noa (Owen Teague), a young ape whose main character traits are that he is young and an ape. He lives with his clan at a small, remote outpost where they have developed a pocket of peaceful habitation following the many years over which apes have slowly grown to be the dominant, more intelligent species compared to the ever-rare vestiges of humanity. Noa doesn\u2019t even know what a \u201chuman\u201d is\u2014all he knows is that his clan refers to those things as \u201cEchos\u201d and that he\u2019s occasionally seen a small one scavenging for food from their stock. That becomes the least of Noa\u2019s problems when a rival ape tribe storms his home, killing his father and taking most of his family and friends hostage for someone calling themselves Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). With that, Noa hops on his horse and sets out into the mysterious world beyond his encampment, and quickly learns how much his elders kept from him. Ball and writer Josh Friedman veer away from the suffocatingly bleak and dour tone that fueled Dawn of and War for the Planet of the Apes, and more towards traditional action-adventure blockbuster spectacle. Though the immediate plot machinations of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes are more directly of the \u201cape vs. ape\u201d variety than before, this dichotomy of human and ape coexistence is one carried over from the previous trilogy and, indeed, one inherent to the franchise itself. It\u2019s compelling to see how the growth of the ape population, as humans have continued to shrink into the shadows, affects this dynamic so many years later. But the big problem here is that Kingdom feels like table-setting for a more interesting movie that could come later down the line.\u2013Trace Sauveur\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: David Leitch\n\nStars: Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt, Winston Duke, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Hannah Waddingham, Stephanie Hsu\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nThe deceptive difficulty of action movies, comedies, and their intersection is being able to do something completely stupid with total straight-faced commitment. Like so many easily dismissed parts of film production, a punchline delivered with invested emotion is just as hard to pull off as a pratfall performed with total abandon. If either misses its mark by a hair, you fall flat on your face and leave the audience hating your smug performance or hyperactive flailing. It\u2019s all the more impressive, then, that Ryan Gosling does it all in The Fall Guy. He plays stuntman Colt Seavers, living bruise, returning to action One Last Time in order to help his old flame Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) on her first directorial effort, Metalstorm. That\u2019s the simple set-up, designed to showcase the jock rock of filmmaking: A stunt spectacular combining the technical prowess and meathead charm of the dirtbag daredevils behind every awesome car crash and killer fight scene. And, thanks to Gosling\u2014playing his role like his schmuck detective from The Nice Guys accidentally found himself in a Mission: Impossible\u2014the film breezily flits between a savvy behind-the-scenes pastiche and a committed action rom-com. Ok, The Fall Guy owes its success to far more people than its leading man. That\u2019s kind of its point. Directed by longtime stuntman David Leitch (with this film, distancing himself from solely being the less impressive half of the John Wick team) and written by Drew Pearce (one of Leitch\u2019s Hobbs & Shaw scribes), The Fall Guy works best as an anti-blockbuster. It wants to blow shit up and wow us with its ballsy choreography, but it also wants to take the shine off these feats of movie magic. Funnier and more effective than most movies built upon a foundation of car chases and fistfights, The Fall Guy is smart enough to showcase its dumb action in a new and exciting way. Its affection is infectious, whether that\u2019s for the art of filmmaking, the haywire pleasures of being on set, the adrenaline rush of a well-made gamble, or for finding someone special to share your simple corner of the world. The ambitious meta-film overcomes the baggage of trying to be both the movie of the summer and the movie that comments on those kinds of movies, hitting a cinematic sweet spot and singing the praises of stunt performers everywhere.\u2013Jacob Oller\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nStars: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Stephen McKinley Henderson, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Souheila Yacoub, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nSet aside the complicated calculus of food, shelter and family needs. It\u2019s time to shell out the big bucks and head to the local IMAX. To borrow from Kidman\u2019s AMC commercial more explicitly, though you might not be \u201csomehow reborn,\u201d there will be \u201cdazzling images,\u201d sound you can feel and you will be taken somewhere you\u2019ve \u201cnever been before\u201d (at least, not since Dune). As befits a Part Two, Villeneuve\u2019s film picks up in medias res, with Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and the Fremen encountering and dealing with a murderous Harkonnen hunting party while trying to reach the Fremen stronghold. From this encounter, Villaneuve nimbly guides the narrative from one key moment to the next, a veritable dragonfly ornithopter of plot advancement (with a few slower moments to allow the burgeoning relationship with Paul and Zendaya\u2019s Chani to breathe). If the outcome of each narrative stop feels very much fated, that in turn feels appropriate given the messianic prophecy undergirding the entire tale. Dune: Part Two\u2019s production design is as much center stage as its star-studded cast. Villaneuve pummels the viewer with the sheer scale and brutal, industrial efficiency of the Harkonnen operation\u2014well, it would be efficient if not for those pesky Fremen\u2014yet all of it is engulfed in turn by Arrakis itself. Meanwhile, the sound design and throbbing aural cues evoke the weight and oppressiveness of a centuries-spanning empire, the suffocating cunning of \u201c90 generations\u201d of Bene Gesserit schemes and the inescapable gravity Arrakis and its spice-producing leviathans exert on both. For those torn on whether it\u2019s worth venturing forth to the multiplex, consider Dune: Part Two a compelling two-hour-and-forty-six-minute argument in the \u201cfor\u201d column. And that \u201cindescribable feeling\u201d you get when \u201cthe lights begin to dim?\u201d That\u2019s cinematic escape velocity, instantly achieved. Next stop, Arrakis.\u2013Michael Burgin\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirector: Tilman Singer\n\nStars: Hunter Schafer, Jan Bluthardt, Marton Csokas, Jessica Henwick, Dan Stevens\n\nRating: R\n\nCuckoo is a twisty, giallo-inspired, semi-body horror mystery that double acts as an impressive lead showcase proving that Schafer is more than just an \u201cit girl.\u201d Gretchen, a moody American teen grieving the recent loss of her mother, is forced to move in with her father Luis (Marton Csokas), his much younger English wife Beth (Jessica Henwick), and their mute daughter Alma (Mila Lieu). Luis and Beth have relocated from the States to the Alps, where they had once honeymooned at a lavish resort and subsequently conceived Alma. Both architects, the couple has been solicited by the resort\u2019s owner, the overly pleasant Herr K\u00f6nig (Dan Stevens) to build him a new resort. Thus, their project leaves them, and now Gretchen, with an indefinite stay in Germany. This is much to Gretchen\u2019s chagrin, to put it lightly. She resents her stepmother and half-sister in what is customary for this archetypal character dynamic: a new mother has laid eggs in Gretchen\u2019s nest, stealing resources. So, too is Gretchen\u2019s relationship with her father strained. She had previously been under her mother\u2019s welcomed custody, but in the wake of her untimely passing, Gretchen is now required to encroach upon her father\u2019s new, younger family whom he had willingly abandoned her for.\n\nOne could argue that Cuckoo\u2019s chief failing is that it doesn\u2019t allow its tone to lean into the pure, visceral absurdity of its narrative. But I\u2019d argue back that the seriousness adds to a certain charm, in a way where it\u2019s clear that Singer isn\u2019t trying to be overly self-serious; certainly, Argento characters are still taking the graveness of their stakes to heart. That K\u00f6nig is so dead-set in his absurd goals is delightful, because there\u2019s still a little twinkle in his eye, and Cuckoo manages to imbue this vibe with an earnest terror that makes for an exceedingly entertaining horror film. \u2014Brianna Zigler\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nStars: Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Liev Schreiber, Hope Davis, Steve Park, Rupert Friend, Maya Hawke, Steve Carell, Matt Dillon, Hong Chau, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Tony Revolori, Jake Ryan, Jeff Goldblum\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWhile The French Dispatch crammed an impressive amount of narrative into its kinetic structure, Asteroid City\u2019s journey to the intersection between California, Arizona and Nevada feels positively placid. The film is a story within a story, structured as a television show about a playwright trying to put together a production called \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d We bounce back and forth from the TV movie about the creation of the play, to a production of the play itself using the same characters, switching between black-and-white sequences narrated by a Rod Serling-like Bryan Cranston, and the Kodachrome splendor realized in the desert setting on the virtual stage. Thus, we have actors being actors playing actors, the kind of narrative playfulness that\u2019s too often ignored when focusing on Anderson\u2019s iconic visuals and soundtrack choices. The result is a meta-narrative constantly folding back on itself (in one of the film\u2019s more playful moments, Cranston\u2019s character accidentally appears in the color sequence, and quickly sees himself out), an alien invasion adventure story and family drama wrapped within the setting of a classic Western, where offramps literally lead nowhere and the seemingly regular shootout down the main street is the only interruption to what otherwise bucolic setting. From the opening moments, the immaculate production design explodes off the screen, the onscreen filigrees and dynamic color scheme a feast for the eye. There\u2019s a mix between the stagey and the decidedly down to earth, with hand-painted signs advertising milkshakes dwarfed by background rock formations that are as theatrical as any Broadway flat. It\u2019s but one way the film toys with our perception of the characters, both believing in their small and intimate moments, but always made aware of the artifice. There are of course many cinematic references, from the schlock of \u201850s sci-fi to more than a hint of Close Encounters that also fueled last year\u2019s Nope. There are also echoes to many of Anderson\u2019s own films. There\u2019s so much joy on screen, so much playfulness, that it\u2019s perhaps churlish to complain about any missteps. While not as deeply moving as some, or downright thrilling as others in Anderson\u2019s filmography, it\u2019s a journey to the desert well worth taking.\u2014Jason Gorber\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Kevin Greutert\n\nStars: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund, Steven Brand, Renata Vaca, Joshua Okamoto, Octavio Hinojosa\n\nRating: R\n\nAlexander Payne takes us back to school in order to satirize the larger American political landscape in The Holdovers, but his once-acidic tone has undoubtedly taken a shift toward the sincere since newcomer Reese Witherspoon first hit our screens as know-it-all Tracy Flick in Election nearly 25 years ago. Now, with the early 1970s-set holiday drama The Holdovers, his indictment of the American Dream may burn more slowly, but the gut punch Payne packs is no less severe, so long as you aren\u2019t put off by a healthy dose of nostalgia. Stinky, sweaty, disgruntled Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti with a lazy eye), a hardass Ancient Civilizations professor who makes no attempt to hide how much he despises his \u201cvulgar\u201d students, is put in charge of babysitting the students whose parents don\u2019t want to deal with them over the Christmas holiday break. \u201cAnd I thought all the Nazis had left for Argentina,\u201d quips the smartass leader of the gang, Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), when Paul harshly disciplines the boys for fighting. Angus and Paul are not alone, as they are joined by Mary Lamb (Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph), the head of the school cafeteria, who recently lost her beloved son Curtis, himself a Barton alum, in the Vietnam war. If this sounds like the trappings of an \u201cunlikely family of outsiders finds understanding during the holidays\u201d kind of movie, it\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what The Holdovers is. Neither Payne nor screenwriter David Hemingson are afraid to lean into the romantic notion that three disparate people with vastly different circumstances can briefly come together as a family, especially during Christmastime, for Christ\u2019s sake. All three of the protagonists are hiding deeply held secrets and desires that are slowly revealed over the course of their time together, to the point that they truly come to rely on each other for trustworthy companionship. All of this is only plausible thanks to Hemingson\u2019s well-developed screenplay, strong performances from all three leads and The Holdovers\u2019 refined, cozy vibe. The syrupy soundtrack and softly glowing photography set the snug tone. If Election is a shot of tequila, The Holdovers is a slow succession of sips of bourbon that you don\u2019t realize have affected your spatial awareness until you get out of your armchair.\u2014Katarina Docalovich\n\nYear: 2024\n\nDirectors: Toby Poser, John Adams\n\nStars: John Adams, Toby Poser, Petar Arsi\u0107, Aleksandar Trm\u010di\u0107, Marko Filipovic, Anders Hove, Max Portman\n\nRating: NR\n\nThe filmmaking collective known as the Adams Family has spent the last decade or so establishing themselves among the best indie creators in the horror genre, cultivating an ever-expanding fanbase while doing it all Their Way. The minds behind Where the Devil Roams (one of the best horror films of 2023) and Hellbender (one of the best horror films of the last decade, bar none), to name just a couple, have proven remarkably versatile in terms of tone, craft and sheer ingenuity, simultaneously upping their ambition with each project and holding onto the DIY qualities that made them into scrappy fan favorites to begin with. With Hell Hole, their latest feature, the filmmaking family has constructed their biggest horror sandbox yet, packing every frame with as much production value as their small budget can muster and riding a fascinating tonal line between black comedy and sincere character drama. The results are mixed, but while Hell Hole is not the family\u2019s best film, it is proof that they\u2019re still among the most fascinating and consistently entertaining players in the horror game. \u2014Matthew Jackson",

Green is also a psychology professor at East Stroudsburg University. She's been with NSF since 2020, first as a program officer and then as an expert for the agency\u2019s Directorate for STEM Education. Green is private about whom she voted for, but says that she runs politically conservative and that many of her friends voted for Trump. She learned about her termination while administering an exam.\n\n\u201cI was giving an exam. My cellphone was sitting there and I got the vibrations. The texts were coming in. But I\u2019m thinking, \u2018This is weird. I normally don't get texts.\u2019 So I opened up my phone to take a look, and I'm getting texts from NSF colleagues saying, \u2018I'm so sorry. Are you OK?\u2019 \u2026 They said, \u2018Log in to your email.\u2019 So I did \u2026 At five minutes to 11, I received an email saying that my position was ending, and I had until 1 o'clock until my emails and everything were done. \u2026\n\nIn my head, I'm saying, \u2018Grab your evaluations, grab your evaluations, get your W-2s.\u2019 Because they're all on the system, and it's going down at 1 o'clock, and my students need me, and I'm like, \u2018What do I do?\u2019 And I picked NSF over my students [said through tears]. \u2026 All of my systems are shutting down. I pick whatever files I can, send them to the administrative assistant and I do this as much as I can, and then I have to get back to my students. I am so disgusted. I loved NSF. I gave them everything. \u2026 I was working a full-time job on a half-time pay without benefits. I gave them everything, and they couldn't even give me the common courtesy of a mild heads-up. \u2026\n\nMost people who know me consider that I run conservatively. I certainly have very strong views regarding issues of fiscal prudence. We cannot waste taxpayer dollars, and I feel very, very strongly about that in tremendous ways. I am concerned about the debt. \u2026 And I know that there is waste in the federal government, and I think that it should be ferreted out and cut. \u2026 But these particular cuts have been done without reason. \u2026\n\nMany of my friends voted for Trump, and one of the things that they have said to me specifically is that it was not their intention for things to be carried out this way. It was their intention for the economy to get under control, for the debt to get under control. \u2026 I don't believe that anybody who voted for Trump was expecting us to be weakened in this way.\u201d",

A Comcast spokesperson had no update, and Marquee and broadcast partner Sinclair had no comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago Sports Network, the Sox\u2019 new home, remains off Comcast but is hopeful that baseball season will prompt its carriage, though it also expects to land on a higher tier.\n\nComcast has moved regional sports networks across the country to its Ultimate TV programming tier, which costs about $20 more per month than the Popular tier. The company moved its own RSNs in California and Boston in January.\n\nWhen Comcast moved Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, home of the Nationals and Orioles, a year ago, it offered the Ultimate tier for free for three months followed by $10 per month for the next three months before charging full price. It\u2019s unknown whether such a promotion will be available in the Chicago market.\n\nThe Cubs are working on communicating the expected move to fans, many of whom have run the gamut of watching Cubs games for free on WGN to paying more money than ever to watch. The club expects to lose viewers who choose not to upgrade their cable package. It likely will direct those fans to other means of receiving Marquee, such as its direct-to-consumer service.\n\nComcast, which has about 1 million subscribers in the market, has continued to carry Marquee on short-term agreements with Sinclair. The latest deal was set to expire Thursday. But the partnership between Marquee and Sinclair has soured.\n\nSinclair\u2019s joint venture with Marquee hasn\u2019t been nearly as successful as the media company hoped, and it\u2019s looking to get out of its contract, which could prompt a legal fight, sources said. Sinclair declined to comment. Though Marquee has lost viewers to cord-cutting since launching in 2020, Sinclair is still obligated to pay rights fees despite losing money.\n\nThe situation didn\u2019t come up on Sinclair\u2019s earnings call Wednesday, and, strangely, Marquee isn\u2019t listed on the company\u2019s website with its other sports holdings, Tennis Channel and YES Network, home of the Yankees, which was the model for Marquee.\n\nViewers dropping cable for streaming services has upended the RSN business model, which is behind Comcast\u2019s push to move expensive sports programming to a higher-priced tier. The days of non-sports viewers subsidizing sports programming are over.\n\nSkyrocketing baseball salaries also have played a part. Teams\u2019 reliance on other people\u2019s money to foot the bill is coming home to roost as TV providers push back against higher costs. Cable companies are allowed to make money, too, and streaming has not been the savior.\n\nThere\u2019s irony in Sinclair\u2019s desire to leave Marquee behind. It played a part in exacerbating RSNs\u2019 demise after buying Fox\u2019s 21 RSNs from Disney in 2019. Sinclair put the networks, then valued at $10.6 billion, under subsidiary Diamond Sports Group and watched their value plummet as the coronavirus pandemic expedited cord-cutting in 2020. DSG went on its own in 2022 and in 2023 filed for bankruptcy, from which it emerged in January as Main Street Sports Group.\n\nSinclair could be starting another painful journey with a different partner.\n\nRemote patrol\n\nThe Cubs are scheduled to make 10 appearances on Fox Sports this season, seven on Fox and three on FS1. Fox will carry the season opener March 18 against the Dodgers in Tokyo, and FS1 will air the second game. Marquee will carry both locally. The Cubs\u2019 first Fox broadcast stateside is April 26 against the Phillies at 3 p.m. The White Sox aren\u2019t scheduled for any Fox appearances.\n\n\u2022 Beloved former Blackhawks broadcasters Pat Foley and Eddie Olczyk will reunite for the Sports USA radio call of the Red Wings-Blue Jackets game at 5 p.m. Saturday at Ohio Stadium.

            "content": "- Advertisement -\n\nAs baseball season approaches in Chicago, there is still some uncertainty surrounding how consumers will be able to watch the Cubs and White Sox. Marquee Sports Network, a regional sports network owned by both the Chicago Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group, expects to be moved to a higher-priced tier by Comcast on the Xfinity cable system, according to a report by Jeff Agrest of the Chicago Sun-Times. This would align with a pattern exhibited by Comcast in recent years with RSNs around the country, including the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, New England Sports Network and NBC Sports-branded regional channels as well.\n\nComcast has about 1 million subscribers in the Chicago marketplace and is among the largest cable television providers in the United States. The company has had various disputes surrounding retransmission fees, one of which was recently resolved in a deal with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, the owner of Altitude Sports. The Cubs had previously been televised on the WGN-TV broadcast network for 72 consecutive seasons before moving to Marquee Sports Network ahead of the 2020 campaign. Agrest also reports that Sinclair is looking to get out of its contract with Marquee, something that could portend legal proceedings in the future.\n\nChicago Sports Network has been unable to reach a deal with Comcast, but there is reportedly hope from the RSN that the two sides will come to terms on an agreement. Since the network made its debut in October, the companies have not reached a deal amid regular-season broadcasts of Chicago Bulls basketball and Chicago Blackhawks hockey. The entity is entering its first season as the broadcast home of the White Sox, who had previously been televised on NBC Sports Chicago before it officially shuttered last September.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Cubs and White Sox both have direct-to-consumer streaming functionalities surrounding live game broadcasts that allows viewers to tune into games without a traditional pay television subscription. Both teams have ownership stakes in their respective regional sports networks and are among the 15 most-valuable franchises in the league, according to valuations by Forbes.\n\nBarrett Media produces daily content on the music, news, and sports media industries.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other best stocks to invest in for retirement.\n\nIt is common knowledge that retirees with private sources of income, pension, or alternate employment are faring better than those relying only on social security. According to the Federal Reserve, Americans in the workforce were rather confident about their retirement savings in 2023. That year, 27% of adults had already retired in the United States, with 15% of them still working in some capacity. Retirees were working part-time rather than full-time. However, those with disabilities or low education were less prone to finding employment after retirement. 51% of adults retired to pursue passion projects or spend time with family, and 46% attributed their decision to retire to health issues, caregiving roles, or downsizing at work.\n\nWhile social security remained the primary source of income for retirees, 80% of them had private sources of income as per the Fed\u2019s 2023 report. 56% of them had pensions, 48% relied on investment income \u2013 which includes interest, dividends, or rental income, and 33% had labor income to fall back on. 92% of retirees in this 12-month survey were in the age bracket of 65 or above.\n\nOver the last few decades, private companies have largely eliminated pension plans, shifting the onus of retirement savings to employees via 401(k)s. In 2022, only 15% of private industry workers had access to a pension. Retirement satisfaction has also dropped, with only 48% of retirees aged 62-75 commenting that they are very satisfied in 2023, down from 62% in 2020. Rising inflation has cut into retirees\u2019 spending power, and 68% of them are burdened with credit card debt, up from 43% in 2020.\n\nSam Dogen, a millionaire who retired early and founded Financial Samurai, told CNBC that dividends are a source of reliable income. He commented:\n\n\u201cStock dividends are my favorite passive income strategy because it is 100% passive.\u201d\n\nWhile young investors tend to reinvest dividend payouts, retirees can very well use it as a source of steady income. Dogen pointed out the consistent stock market growth over time and stated that dividend stocks are thus a dependable source of income over the long run.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 2% and dividend payout ratios under 30% as of February 19. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth over the years, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment as of Q4 2024.",

            "content": "The latest cohort for Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech marks the fifth-year milestone for a program that\u2019s morphed during its existence, from startup accelerator to a support anchor of growth for companies at various maturity levels.\n\nSome of this year\u2019s group (see chart above) are companies that have already found significant sports traction, such as Satisfi Labs\u2019 early sports success turning into a pool of 450-plus clients in the entertainment sector, or LiveLike, with connections to some of the world\u2019s largest sporting events (Olympics, Super Bowl, FIFA World Cup). I\u2019d also be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out the appearance of Camb.ai, one of SBJ\u2019s 10 Most Innovative Sports Tech Companies and participant in Tennis Australia\u2019s AO Startups and the MLS Innovation Lab.\n\nThe 10 newest SportsTech entrants signal that the two-way value exchange this program continues to materialize at a higher scale, according to Jenna Kurath, VP/startup partnerships and head of Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech. \u201cWe almost call them \u2018scaleups\u2019 versus \u2018startups\u2019 because they are so far along,\u201d Kurath told SBJ. \u201cThere are times where I\u2019m like, \u2018Really, they applied? They want to be in this program?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been an intentional shift from the early days of the then-accelerator, which started in 2020 just before COVID-19 shut down the world. It initially debuted as a three-month experience before expanding to six months starting with the 2023 installment. Now branded as more of a research-and-development program, there\u2019s an opportunity to fast-track the trajectories of businesses that have weathered their first waves of fundraising and built some running lanes.\n\nKurath pointed out that the extra program time combines for an enhanced experience working with Comcast NBCUniversal partners, a collection that features industry stalwarts such as NBC Sports, Peacock, NASCAR, the Premier League, PGA Tour, Notre Dame, Comcast Spectacor, GolfNow/Fandango, Sky Sports and Universal Parks. Those collaborators, Kurath said, also provide a combined perspective on the problems and use cases that need to be solved in the sports industry right now.\n\n\u201cThe one unique aspect of the companies that we\u2019re choosing is technology that adds value across a diverse set of sports, organizations, teams, [all] types of sports,\u201d Kurath said. \u201cOftentimes, you\u2019ll find if you are able to break your way into the world of sports -- because it\u2019s not the easiest market to break into -- we\u2019re opening a lot of those doors, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re just getting the door open for tennis (Kurath\u2019s favorite sport). ... We\u2019re looking for things that can scale across all of those which ultimately is a better investment for us.\u201d\n\nThe next six months will play out like so: the kickoff for cohort No. 5 started this week in Atlanta for sports-specific learning sessions. They\u2019ll also have a combine-like experience halfway through the program in Philadelphia before carrying out more pilots for the participating tech companies to carry out with the sports partners.\n\nThe extended time for SportsTech has yielded increased results for both participants and collaborators. Last year\u2019s cohort participated in 15 pilots, partnerships and commercial deals. StellarAlgo secured two pilots through the program with the Premier League, its clubs and its broadcast partners for fan insights. I just wrote about the Canadian-based company and its rollout with all MiLB teams ahead of this baseball season.\n\nThe consideration of a wide-ranging group of companies (at different points of their growth journeys) means more interest. SportsTech received more than 1,600 applications this year. Kurath said the rigorous breakdown of potential participants is an exercise for Comcast NBCUniversal and its operation partner of SportsTech, Boomtown Innovation, to understand what types of technology can impact the sports industry -- whether that\u2019s right now or a few cohorts down the road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that, yes, they\u2019re not all applicable, and they\u2019re not all far enough along, so we nurture those relationships, but that top of the funnel gives us a really wide and deep lens into emerging technology that will change sports,\u201d Kurath said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have a good pulse of that, we\u2019ll lose that competitive edge.\u201d",

We love reader mail!\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Latest Target Is Comcast CEO Brian Roberts\n\nIf I were Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, I\u2019d be feeling a little nervous right now, as he\u2019s raised the ire of Bully In Chief \u2014 sorry, make that President \u2014 Donald Trump.\n\nComcast-owned MSNBC is considered by many to be left-of-center. And in a post on his social network platform Truth Social this week, Trump slammed Comcast, naming Roberts personally more than once. In reference to Comcast, Trump wrote: \u201cThe corrupt operation is nothing more than an illegal arm of the Democrat Party\u2026 They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they\u2019ve done to the country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attack comes just a couple of weeks after the chair of the FCC made it clear that the agency is investigating Comcast. Why? \u201cI am concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations,\u201d the FCC\u2019s head wrote in a letter to Comcast \u201cFor instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is \u2018a core value of our business.\u2019\u201d\n\nComcast hasn\u2019t publicly commented on the mess other than to confirm that the company did receive the letter from the FCC. Something tells me we\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about this in the days, weeks and months to come.\n\nIronically, Comcast-owned NBC was the network that aired The Apprentice, the TV show that catapulted Donald Trump to superstardom. Would he be president without said superstardom? Seriously doubt it. Thanks, NBC.\n\nThe End of the Brotherly Shove?\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have asked the league to ban the tush push, the play so favored by the Eagles. You may remember what our first touchdown in the Super Bowl this year was thanks to the tush push, which we tend to call the Brotherly Shove. Supposedly, there are concerns about the tush push leading to injury. But I smell something more like Sore Loser Syndrome here. Keep in mind that we beat the Packers the last two times we played them. Including in the playoffs.\n\nFrom the Department of Fake News\n\nThere\u2019s a story going around (mainly via memes) claiming that the Philadelphia Eagles have rejected Donald Trump\u2019s invitation to visit the White House, an invitation commonly extended to Super Bowl winners. It\u2019s utterly fake news. He hasn\u2019t even invited them. But the team will reportedly accept if invited. We\u2019ll see.\n\nYou Can All Rest Easy Now\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all been so stressed out about the Philly Portal being inoperable for weeks due to some needed repairs and upgrades. It\u2019s apparently coming back in March.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n$2 billion: Federal grants and loans for Pennsylvania that President Trump froze during his earliest days in office. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro sued the feds earlier this month and spent the weekend in D.C. pressing the issue. And on Monday, Shapiro announced that the administration unfroze the funds.\n\n24,000: Grams of fentanyl authorities say they\u2019ve seized in Kensington since Mayor Parker\u2019s crackdown started nine months ago. Shootings are also down, though it\u2019s worth noting that this is a citywide trend, not just in Kensington. Definitely some progress there, but all you have to do is take a quick drive around the neighborhood, as I recently did, to see that plenty of people are still living on the streets and that open-air drug use remains rampant.\n\n62 degrees: Forecasted high for Tuesday. About the same on Wednesday. (Don\u2019t worry: We\u2019re back to the 30s by this weekend.) I hope your plans for early this week include getting outside.\n\nLocal Talent\n\nTariq Trotter \u2014 aka Black Thought from the Roots \u2014 is a gifted rapper. So it shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise that the guy can write. The city just selected his The Upcycled Self: A Memoir on the Art of Becoming Who We Are as the \u201cOne Book, One Philadelphia\u201d pick for 2025. The idea is that we all read the book, but then there are also seven weeks of events surrounding it, beginning on April 11th. You can borrow the book from your local library, of course. Or buy it here.\n\nEdit note: This story has been updated.",

            "content": "Two European sports tech startups are heading to the US for an R&D programme run by media giant Comcast.\n\nIreland\u2019s Orreco will cross the Atlantic with a trove of athletic performance software, while Iceland\u2019s Oz Sports will bring an AI-driven camera system.\n\nOn arrival, the duo will join Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech, a six-month accelerator.\n\nDuring the programme, the companies will tap into expertise from various industry leaders. Among them are Comcast broadcasting networks NBC Sports, Sky Sports, and the Golf Channel from Comcast\u2019s broadcasting empire. Further support will come from a star-studded squad of partners, including the Premier League, the PGA Tour, and NASCAR.\n\nThe diverse lineup of experts is a key selling point.\n\nOn a video call from Comcast\u2019s headquarters in Philadelphia, Jenna Kurath, Head of Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech, said the programme is \u201cpowered by partnerships.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy bringing the best of innovation into our organisation, forging those strategic relationships with emerging startups, and working alongside some of the most elite sports organisations in the world, we\u2019re able to really push us beyond the status quo,\u201d Kurath told TNW.\n\nThe collaborative approach has one overall target: cultivating a new generation of sports tech. But for the teams involved, the attractions are varied.\n\nThe selected teams receive new routes to accelerate product development, forge industry relationships, and refine commercial strategies. Their partners gain access to emerging technologies that could enhance future broadcasts and sporting events.\n\nComcast, meanwhile, can get an edge on market trends, strengthen partnerships, unlock new revenue streams, and enhance customer experiences. The company is also investing in startups selected for the programme.\n\nInside the programme\n\nThe potential benefits have proved alluring for startups. Over 1,600 teams applied to this year\u2019s programme. The cohort was then whittled down to just 10 companies.\n\nKurath breaks down the selection process into three key criteria. \u201cThe first is, is it a problem we\u2019re solving? The second is, do we have a line of sight on how we\u2019ll test and pilot that technology over the six-month programme and beyond? But probably most important of all is, is this the team that we believe can do it \u2014 and is this the team we want to work alongside?\u201d\n\nOrreco impressed the selectors with an AI sports analytics platform. The software interprets camera data, blood biomarkers, GPS, and other data sources. It then provides personalised insights on performance, nutrition, training, sleep, and recovery.\n\nOZ Sports, meanwhile, earned a spot on the roster after developing an AI-driven, multi-camera 4K60p HDR production unit for broadcasting. The system offers remote sports coverage in top-notch quality \u2014 at a fraction of the price.\n\nWith Comcast recently winning new rights to NBA and Premier League games, the system could support the expanded coverage. \u201cThis is a really cost-effective, efficient way for us to do that and make it the best broadcast experience,\u201d Kurath said.\n\nOrreco and Oz Sports join a range of European companies that have entered the programme.\n\nEurope\u2019s sports tech roster\n\nOne recent European graduate is the UK\u2019s Kymira, which developed infrared-infused recovery apparel for the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team. The gear was initially built for the players, but the benefits have also been tested on front office staff.\n\nAnother alumnus is Manchester-based Dizplay, meanwhile, makes sports fans active participants in the spectator experience. In partnership with Sky Sports, the startup introduced a \u201cViewer\u2019s Verdict\u201d for boxing broadcasts, allowing audiences to share real-time opinions and enhance social commentary. This technology could also expand beyond sports, bringing interactivity to live news, talk shows, and other broadcasts.\n\nA third British graduate, Tickets for Good, provides a platform that offers discounted tickets to tailored audiences. That could mean sports fans, but it could also serve teachers or first responders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for companies that are proving themselves in the grand stage of sports, but when they have extensibility into other areas of our business, it\u2019s just all the more powerful,\u201d Kurath said.\n\nFor European members of the programme, the accelerator offers a springboard to the world\u2019s biggest market.\n\n\u201cA lot of the international companies are very strong within their own specific country, but are looking to break into the US market,\u201d Kurath said.\n\n\u201cIt is huge, it is nuanced. It is not an easy market. The sports industry is not an easy one to break into, so we\u2019re opening doors for them and giving them really deep customer insights on what it means for your technology to succeed in the US market.\u201d\n\nEnterprise innovation is one of three key themes at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

The high-profile nature of these relationships has also been beneficial when securing deals with other sports properties or adjacent industries.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s cohort has developed a diverse range of cutting-edge technologies poised to impact the future of sports, including in the areas of fan experience, athlete performance, and venue operations,\u201d said Jenna Kurath, vice president of startup partnerships and the head of Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech.\n\n\u201cBy investing in and supporting their growth, Comcast NBCUniversal SportsTech is driving key business outcomes for both our portfolio and our partners by offering a unique lens into the latest in sports innovation while shaping a more dynamic and engaging experience for fans and athletes worldwide.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s programme will launch in Atlanta through an \u201cimmersive kickoff event\u201d in Atlanta.

            "content": "Last July, I wrote about a looming issue for many regional sports networks, perhaps including the Cubs channel Marquee Sports Network. You can read the entire issue at that link, but the short version is: Comcast/Xfinity wants to put RSNs on its higher-priced \u201cUltimate\u201d tier. Teams, of course, resisted that because it would cost fans more money to watch their games.\n\nThe July article noted that the now-former Diamond Sports RSNs were being put on Comcast\u2019s Ultimate tier. I also included this quote from Cubs President of Business Operations Crane Kenney:\n\n\u201cOn the one side, it\u2019s a true serious moment on the distribution side. On the other side, the programming side, Marquee, our friends there, they just won RSN of the Year nationally for a second straight year in a row. They\u2019ve won (lots) of Emmys. They\u2019re doing a great job on the programming side, but I think distribution is going to be a challenge. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to be asking me \u2026 in September, you\u2019re going to go, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s going on now?\u2019 Because it\u2019s going to be bumpy.\u201d\n\nThis brief appearance by Jesse Rogers on ESPN 1000 last week hints at that \u201cbumpy\u201d ride:\n\n\"I don't know if Marquee is gonna be on Xfinity come Opening Day.\"@JesseRogersESPN tells @WaddleandSilvy and @sheanorling that the Cubs may be headed towards a dispute with Comcast ahead of the start of the season pic.twitter.com/JRfzBOWVRE \u2014 ESPN Chicago (@ESPN1000) February 20, 2025\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? In January, I posted this article with all 30 MLB teams\u2019 TV deals for this year. Take a look at what happened with the Giants:\n\nTheir games are on NBC Sports Bay Area, which is co-owned by NBCUniversal and the Giants. It provided $92 million of revenue to the Giants in 2022. One important thing to Cubs fans \u2014 earlier this month Comcast in the Bay Area moved this channel to a higher tier, meaning subscribers will have to pay more to continue to watch the Giants. Comcast likely wants to do the same thing with Marquee, and that channel and Comcast are on a month-to-month deal. Stay tuned.\n\nWell. I would think that Cubs fans would, grudgingly if necessary, pay that extra amount for the higher tier to continue to be able to watch Cubs games. I will, if needed, as I am a Comcast/Xfinity subscriber. Maybe you wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a bit of a dangerous game Comcast is playing here, because Marquee does offer an in-market streaming app option, if you choose to cut the cord.\n\nIn the end, in my view it makes sense for both Marquee and Comcast to come to an agreement by Opening Day. Comcast covers about 55 percent of the market, the largest single cable provider in the Cubs market territory. So that\u2019s a lot of Cubs fans. If they don\u2019t make a deal with Marquee, they risk more cord-cutters.\n\nThere\u2019s one further note of interest related to this. As you likely know, Chicago Sports Network, the new channel carrying White Sox, Blackhawks and Bulls games, has also not reached an agreement with Comcast/Xfinity for carriage. They, too, have an in-market streaming app option. Granted that those three teams haven\u2019t really much been worth watching, they do still have some fans who would certainly like to watch.\n\nTo that end, I have learned that the White Sox have offered their season-ticket holders 30 days of free streaming of CHSN through their app beginning on Opening Day. This hints that the Sox don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll have a deal with Comcast by Opening Day.\n\nIf the Cubs find themselves in that situation it would be a good idea to do the same thing for their season-ticket holders. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that and that Marquee and Comcast/Xfinity come to a deal before Opening Day. It just makes sense for both parties.",

            "content": "President Trump took sharp aim at Comcast, claiming that the media giant \u2014 because of MSNBC\u2018s editorial content \u2014 should have to \u201cpay vast sums of money for the damage they\u2019ve done\u201d to the U.S. Trump also railed against Comcast chief Brian Roberts, MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid and others in a post shared Sunday on social media.\n\nIn the post, Trump insulted Roberts as \u201cChairman of \u2018Concast'\u201d and a \u201clowlife.\u201d The U.S. president also called Reid a \u201cmentally obnoxious racist\u201d who \u201cshould have been \u2018canned\u2019 long ago, along with everyone else who works\u201d at MSNBC.\n\nThe trigger for Trump\u2019s tirade was the news that Comcast-owned MSNBC is removing Reid and Alex Wagner from its primetime lineup.\n\n\u201cThis whole corrupt operation is nothing more than an illegal arm of the Democrat Party,\u201d Trump, referring to MSNBC, wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday night. \u201cThey should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they\u2019ve done to our Country. Fake News is an UNPARDONABLE SIN!\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIt is unclear who or what Trump is suggesting Comcast be forced to pay \u2014 or what authority exists for demanding such payment.\n\nComcast reps did not respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s rant.\n\nIn a separate broadside launched at Comcast and NBCUniversal, Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed FCC chairman, this month notified Roberts that the agency\u2019s Enforcement Bureau was opening an investigation into the company over diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Carr said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d that Comcast and NBCU are \u201cpromoting invidious forms of DEI that do not comply with FCC regulations & civil rights laws.\u201d Comcast, in response, said it would cooperate with the FCC probe and that, \u201cFor decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d\n\nTrump has long had a contentious relationship with the media \u2014 but he\u2019s stepped up his attacks in recent months.\n\nTrump sued CBS News over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with former VP Kamala Harris that aired Oct. 7, alleging the news program deceptively edited the video. Earlier this month he amended his lawsuit against CBS to demand damages of $20 billion. Last year Trump sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos after the anchor inaccurately stated on-air that Trump had been found liable for rape; in December, Disney and ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential foundation and museum.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump White House has banned the Associated Press from access to the Oval Office and Air Force One because the AP is referring to the Gulf of Mexico by that name (rather than using the Trump-decreed Gulf of America). The AP, citing the First Amendment, sued to force the White House to rescind the ban.\n\nHere is Trump\u2019s unedited comment about Comcast and MSNBC shared Sunday on Truth Social, the Twitter-style social network operated by his company Trump Media & Technology Group:\n\nLowlife Chairman of \u201cConcast,\u201d Brian Roberts, the owner of Ratings Challenged NBC and MSDNC, has finally gotten the nerve up to fire one of the least talented people in television, the mentally obnoxious racist, Joy Reid. Based on her ratings, which were virtually non-existent, she should have been \u201ccanned\u201d long ago, along with everyone else who works there. Also thrown out was Alex Wagner, the sub on the seriously failing Rachel Maddow show. Rachel rarely shows up because she knows there\u2019s nobody watching, and she also knows that she\u2019s got less television persona than virtually anyone on television except, perhaps, Joy Reid. Then there\u2019s, of course, the LOW IQ Con Man, Al Sharpton, who has, perhaps, the lowest TV ratings in the history of television. What is he doing to Brian Roberts to stay on the air? This whole corrupt operation is nothing more than an illegal arm of the Democrat Party. They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they\u2019ve done to our Country.

            "content": "There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces at Comcast right now and a big wild card is its former NBC The Apprentice host Donald Trump.\n\nAs the NBCUniversal owner looks to spin off many of its cable channels \u2014 including MSNBC \u2014 into a separate untitled holding company (aka \u201cSpinCo\u201d), the President is stepping up attacks on the company, weeks after his Federal Communications Commission chair also targeted Comcast.\n\nIn a post on his social platform that mentioned Comcast CEO Brian Roberts by name twice, Trump disparaged the company, claiming: \u201cThe corrupt operation is nothing more than an illegal arm of the Democrat Party. They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they\u2019ve done to our Country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Truth Social post, in keeping with his running commentary on cable news hirings and firings, was ostensibly a dig about MSNBC canceling anchor Joy Reid\u2019s show amid incoming president Rebecca Kutler\u2019s planned series of changes to shake up the lineup at the left-of-center cable news channel. Expected among the moves: a panel show with Symone Sanders, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez is set to replace Reid\u2019s hour.\n\nIf the deal closes later this year, other NBCU brands making the move to SpinCo alongside MSNBC will be CNBC, USA Network, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and the Golf Channel. The company, to be led by veteran NBCU exec Mark Lazarus, touts that its brands reach 70 million homes and generate $7 billion in revenue annually.\n\nThe second such missive about MSNBC in the past few days isn\u2019t a new refrain for the President, but also comes at a moment of transition for the cable channel. When the brand is spun off from Comcast into SpinCo, it will move from a vast telecommunications and media empire to a much smaller company that also is plotting out how it will change its editorial strategy.\n\nEarlier this month, FCC chair Brendan Carr wrote a letter to Comcast on Feb. 11 to open an investigation in to the company, as well as NBCUniversal, over its diversity, equity and inclusion policies. \u201cI am concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations,\u201d Carr wrote, adding: \u201cFor instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is \u2018a core value of our business.'\u201d\n\nThe move followed Trump\u2019s executive order in January titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\u201d which has caused a scramble among companies to evaluate their inclusion initiatives to comply.\n\nCarr explained that he targeted Comcast, in part, because \u201cyour companies cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC \u2014 from cable to high-speed Internet and from broadcast TV stations to MVNO wireless offerings. Therefore, I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\u201d",

            "content": "James Martin/CNET\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum: Which is better for your home?\n\nXfinity and Spectrum are the biggest cable internet providers in the country. Each ISP is available to over 100 million Americans -- with a combined footprint covering about a third of the population -- so there's a good chance you'll be eligible for service from one of these providers.\n\nCable internet, the most broadly available wired internet type, is a popular option for home internet. With speeds that typically reach a gigabit, bundling opportunities and competitive introductory rates, cable internet is a solid alternative to 5G, DSL or satellite internet and a good second-best option if fiber isn't available at your address.\n\nOf the two most widely available cable internet providers, we like Spectrum Internet because it offers unlimited data, no contracts and better overall value in the long term. However, if Spectrum is unavailable at your address, Xfinity is a decent alternative, featuring a wide range of plan offerings and competitive introductory rates. Here's the full rundown.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nXfinity A smorgasbord of cable internet choices Our take - Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Internet is the largest cable internet provider in the U.S. and offers more plans than any other ISP. While options are often a huge advantage, you'll need to sweat the details a little -- some plans have data caps, others don't. Some plans may also require a one- to two-year term agreement. You have the option to use your own router or lease one for an additional $15 to $20 a month, but this fee may be waived for certain addresses. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the service terms will vary by region and address. You'll have to read the terms of service closely to know what to expect. To find out more, check if your address is serviceable. Read full review . . . Or call to learn more: (844) 766-0640 Check with Xfinity Show more details Compare\n\nSpectrum Keeping cable internet simple Our take - After Charter Communications acquired Time Warner in 2016, Spectrum Internet became the second-biggest cable internet provider in the country. Spectrum keeps its plans straightforward -- there are only two plans and no data caps or contracts. Your modem is included in the monthly fee, and although a router rental is extra, there's a minimal $10 charge for the starting plan. Read full review . . . Or call to learn more: (877) 678-6745 Check with Spectrum Show more details Compare\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum: Coverage and availability\n\nThe latest data from the FCC's broadband maps shows the often overlapping, extensive coverage of cable internet providers Xfinity (purple) and Spectrum (purple). FCC\n\nAccording to the most recent data, the Federal Communications Commission reports that Xfinity and Spectrum's services combined cover around 63% of households nationwide. Both providers' coverage is most concentrated in the Northeast, the Midwest and the South. You'll also find Xfinity and Spectrum plans available in parts of the West, Southwest and mountainous regions of the US. Spectrum even offers internet service throughout the majority of Hawaii.\n\nDespite the large swaths of coverage, there's less overlap between the two providers' footprints than you might think. Though you'll find both available in several metro regions across the country, including Atlanta, Indianapolis, Knoxville, Minneapolis and Orlando, the two providers each tend to stick to whatever parts of the map they've managed to wall off for themselves, with one often claiming a city's central, downtown area and the other planting its flag in many of the adjacent suburbs.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThat means you aren't likely to find Xfinity and Spectrum available at the same address -- but moving across town might mean switching from one provider to another.\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum: Plans and prices\n\nComparing Xfinity and Spectrum pricing side by side isn\u2019t easy. While Spectrum keeps it simple with two consistent plans across its coverage area, Xfinity offers multiple plans with varying terms and fees across its three service regions.\n\nSpectrum home internet plans\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Spectrum 500 Internet\n\nRead full review $50 500Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Modem free; $10 for router (optional); no data caps or contracts Spectrum Gig Internet\n\nRead full review $70 1,000Mbps download, 35Mbps upload Modem and router free; no data caps or contracts Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nLet's get the easy one out of the way first. With Spectrum, you have two plans to choose from, with max download speeds of 500 megabits per second or 1,000Mbps. Depending on your choice, your monthly bill will range from $50 to $70 during your promo period. After that, your monthly rate will increase by $30, meaning you'll pay $80 to $100 each month. The good news is that no contracts or data caps are associated with either of those plans.\n\nXfinity home internet plans (West division)\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Connect $20 ($64 after 12 months) 150Mbps download, 20Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Connect More $40 ($76 after 24 months) 300Mbps download, 20Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Fast $60 ($86 after 24 months) 500Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit $70 ($106 after 24 months) 1,000Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit Extra $85 ($116 after 12 months) 1,200Mbps download, 40Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit X2 $80 ($116 after 12 months) 2,000Mbps download, 200Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit Pro (fiber) $300 10,000Mbps download, 10,000Mbps upload $20 gateway rental (required), unlimited data, 2-year contract Show more (2 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nXfinity home internet plans (Central division)\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Connect $35 ($66 after 12 months) 150Mbps download, 10Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Connect More $35 ($86 after 12 months) 300Mbps download, 10Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental ($10 for 22 months), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Fast $55 ($96 after 24 months) 500Mbps download, 10Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 2-year contract Gigabit $75 ($116 after 24 months) 1,000Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 2-year contract Gigabit Extra $95 ($126 after 24 months) 1,200Mbps download, 35Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months), 1.2TB data cap, 2-year contract Gigabit X2 $95 ($126 after 24 months) 2,000Mbps download, 200Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2 TB data cap, 2-year contract Gigabit Pro (fiber) $300 10,000Mbps download, 10,000Mbps upload $20 gateway rental (required), unlimited data, 2-year contract Show more (2 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nXfinity home internet plans (Northeast division)\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Connect More $35 ($90 after 12 months) 300Mbps download, 10Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental, No data cap, 1-year contract Fast $50 ($105 after 24 months) 500Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental, No data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit $60 ($115 after 12 months) 1,000Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental, No data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit Extra $75 ($120 after 12 months) 1,200Mbps download, 35Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), No data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit X2 $95 ($120 after 12 months) 2,000Mbps download, 200Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), No data cap or contracts Gigabit Pro (fiber) $300 10,000Mbps download, 10,000Mbps upload $20 gateway rental (required), unlimited data, 2-year contract Show more (1 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nXfinity offers a wider variety of plans, with prices and details varying across markets. Most Xfinity plans come with a 1.2TB data cap (more on that in a bit), and in certain regions, some plans come with a one- or two-year contract. In all regions, max download speeds range from 150Mbps to 10,000Mbps. Select parts of the footprint may have access to an Xfinity fiber connection. That said, per the FCC, fiber is available to less than 0.5% of Xfinity subscribers. For most Xfinity addresses, a 2,000 or 1,200Mbps cable plan will be the fastest speed available.\n\nPricing is where Xfinity gets complicated. For starters, let's pull out that top-tier Gigabit Pro plan, which is only available at addresses with access to Xfinity fiber. It costs a hefty $300 per month and comes with a two-year agreement in all three regions. You'll also need to request a site survey to verify that your address is serviceable for the plan.\n\nAs for the standard cable internet plans, available everywhere with download speeds of up to 1,200Mbps and occasionally up to 2,000Mbps, monthly prices range from $20 to $95 during the promo period and from $64 to $126 after that. Just pay attention to those price jumps because, in some regions, they can get awfully steep.\n\nHow steep? Things aren't so bad in the West, where the average price increase on those cable plans is around $30. This is also the case for the Central region, where most customers will probably be required to sign a one- to two-year contract. For the Northeast, the average jump is also $30 a month, with a few surprises. The Connect More plan jumps from $35 monthly to a staggering $90 monthly.\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum: Which offers the better value?\n\nThe easiest way to get a quick sense of value with an internet plan is to look at the monthly cost per Mbps. Spectrum's average cost across its two plans during the first year promo period is 9 cents for each Mbps of download speed. After year one, that average goes up to 13 cents per Mbps. Both are decent figures -- the only cable provider that does better is WideOpenWest, or WOW, which charges an average of 7 cents per Mbps during the first year and 21 cents per Mbps after that.\n\nWith Xfinity's smattering of cable plans, you'll pay an average of 17 cents per Mbps during the first year and 39 cents per Mbps after your promo ends and your bill goes up. (The Gigabit Pro fiber plan does come in at 3 cents per Mbps, but again, you're paying an unrealistic $300 each month for it.) That's still better than many other competitors, including cable internet rival Cox Communications, which charges an average of 15 cents per Mbps during year one and 26 cents per Mbps after that.\n\nWith more plans and three separate regions, there's a lot of variance in the Xfinity value proposition, and some plans offer better value than others. Overall, though, you'll be paying a bit more than you will with Spectrum.\n\nWhen you factor in Xfinity's contracts, data caps and price hikes, it's pretty clear that Spectrum wins on value.\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum: Service terms and fees\n\nNeither provider goes overboard with extra fees, and both give you the flexibility to skip them whenever possible. Here's the breakdown:\n\nInstallation\n\nXfinity charges $100 for in-home, professional installation of your home internet service. Spectrum charges $65. You can skip the fee with both providers by using a self-install kit and plugging everything in yourself, though Spectrum charges $30 for its self-install equipment and Xfinity charges $40.\n\nIt's also pretty standard for internet providers to waive the fee for professional installation to help entice you into signing up, so it's worth asking for that if you're trying to negotiate the best deal.\n\nYou'll need to pay $14 monthly to rent the Xfinity xFi Gateway, but you can skip that fee by using your own modem and router. Comcast\n\nEquipment rental\n\nBoth providers charge a monthly equipment fee for renting a gateway or router, but you can skip that fee by using your own gear in both cases. It's a little easier with Spectrum, which provides a modem at no cost and then charges $10 per month if you rent a router -- just get a router of your own and kiss that $10 fee goodbye. The gigabit plan comes with the router and modem at no extra cost.\n\nWith Xfinity, you'll be charged $15 per month for renting a combination modem/router gateway device for most plans, so you'll need both a modem and a router of your own (or a combo device of your own) to skip the fee. In some cases, Xfinity waives the fee for that gateway for 12 months.\n\nData caps\n\nHere's where Spectrum and Xfinity start to part ways. None of Spectrum's internet plans have a data cap, so you can browse, stream, Zoom and download all you like without the fear of going over your data limit and incurring extra charges. On the other hand, Xfinity enforces a data cap of 1.2TB (1,200GB) for most of its plans. You'll see extra charges on your bill if you burn through more data in a given month.\n\nSpecifically, Xfinity will charge a $10 fee for every 50GB of data over the cap, up to a maximum charge of $100 monthly. The good news is that 1.2TB should be more than enough for most households. In fact, according to the latest OpenVault 2024 report, the average American household uses 590GB of data. That's a little over a third of the size of Xfinity's data cap, so many homes should be in a safe zone, so to speak.\n\nStill, if you're a heavy user of home internet -- someone with lots of family members or roommates online, or someone who regularly games online, downloads or uploads lots of large files, or spends most of the day tied up in video calls -- then a data cap might rightly give you pause. In that case, you might want to consider signing up for Xfinity's unlimited data offer, which will add $30 to your monthly bill. But remember that it's only really worth it if you would otherwise incur at least three overage charges per month.\n\nHow do Xfinity and Spectrum fare in customer satisfaction?\n\nEnlarge Image In 2022, Xfinity scored just above the average among all ISPs from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, while Spectrum came in just below. ACSI\n\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index released its 2024 scores for the ISP category, and the overall rating among non-fiber internet providers increased two points from the previous year to 68 out of 100. Spectrum's score met the overall average among non-fiber ISPs, whereas Xfinity scored a point below at 67. Both Xfinity and Spectrum trailed behind T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T and cable internet rival Cox. Xfinity scoring below the industry average might have something to do with its hike in prices, which can get pretty steep after a year.\n\nJ.D. Power also ranks internet providers for customer satisfaction. Its 2024 report is divided across four regions -- Xfinity outscored Spectrum in all of them and beat the overall category average. Out of a 1,000-point scale, Xfinity received scores of 532 in the East region, 530 in the North Central region, 565 in the South region and 531 in the West region. That comes to an average score of 539, scoring below the overall ISP average of 618.\n\nSpectrum's overall average with J.D. Power rings in at 522, 96 points below the overall ISP average. The company's strongest finish was a 561 in the South; its weakest was a 492 in the East.\n\nOur overall verdict: Spectrum wins\n\nIt's a close one. Both providers are huge, but Xfinity has a slightly larger footprint, and boasts a better variety of plans than Spectrum. Still, I say Spectrum wins out for offering much better value than Xfinity. You'll pay less per Mbps with Spectrum, and you won't have to put up with data caps, contracts or severe price hikes like Comcast's customers experience. What's more, Spectrum's plans and prices are more straightforward to understand than Xfinity's.\n\nAs cable providers, neither will offer upload speeds that are anything close to fiber. But if fiber isn't an option, they're your next best bet for a fast, reliable connection at home. Between the two, I give the edge to Spectrum.\n\nXfinity vs. Spectrum FAQs\n\nIs Spectrum better than Xfinity? That depends on the service that's available at your address. Xfinity's service will vary by region. Spectrum's service terms are pretty straightforward nationwide. While Xfinity offers a wider range of plans across its footprint, CNET recommends Spectrum Internet for its overall value for the long term. Both ISPs increase their prices after a year, but Spectrum offers a cheaper cost per Mbps down the line at 13 cents vs. 39 cents with Xfinity. In addition, some markets may be required to sign a one to two-year contract with Xfinity, whereas Spectrum doesn't tie down its customers to term agreements.\n\nIs Xfinity faster than Spectrum? Yes. Xfinity has significantly more speed tiers available, usually up to seven. On the other hand, Spectrum only offers two speed tiers: 500Mbps and 1,000Mbps. For certain markets, customers may be eligible for Xfinity's Gigabit Pro fiber plan (10,000Mbps), but most addresses will see a top-end plan of 1,200Mbps and 2,000Mbps with Xfinity, which is faster than what you'll get with Spectrum.",

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Comcast's current trading price of US$36.24 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Comcast\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Comcast?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. we find that Comcast\u2019s ratio of 8.46x is below its peer average of 16.39x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Media industry. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Comcast\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Comcast?\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Earnings and Revenue Growth February 23rd 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Comcast, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -10%, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although CMCSA is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the negative profit outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. We recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to CMCSA, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.",

Wagner will instead shift into a contributor role, with a new anchor stepping in to fill the slot. Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary for the Biden administration, is being considered for the role.\n\nKutler, a former senior executive at CNN, is credited with recruiting and executive producing such anchors as John King, Van Jones, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo. She previously hinted at changes coming to the network following the news of her new role.\n\n\"Our jobs are hard on a normal day, and these are not normal times,\" Kutler told MSNBC leaders in February. \"I think it's important that we all share in the exciting parts of what the year ahead is going to mean in terms of getting to build a new news organization\u2026 It\u2019s going to be hard, but it's also going to be exciting and interesting and a really important time to do what all of us do.\u201d",

            "content": "Universal unveiled theming for a new park in Texas aimed at families and an opening date for an attraction in Nevada focused on horror fans. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\n\u201cHow high is up?\u201d\n\nWhen Mr Mark Woodbury became Universal\u2019s theme park chief in 2022, he pressed his lieutenants to answer that question. The former architect was not referring to a roller-coaster incline.\n\nUniversal\u2019s parks had already become a surprise growth engine for NBCUniversal, but Mr Woodbury saw an even bigger opportunity to lift the business firmly out of Disney\u2019s shadow. \u201cHow do we become the destination of choice in each of the markets that we operate in and in all of the markets that we choose to expand into?\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nMr Woodbury, 67, is starting to unveil the answers.\n\nThis week, Universal unveiled theming for a new park in Texas aimed at families and an opening date for an attraction in Nevada focused on horror fans. Those come on top of an expansion in Los Angeles and a massive theme park development in Orlando, Florida, that will open this spring. It is considering Wicked attractions and a major park for Britain, too.\n\nComcast, which owns NBCUniversal, has not disclosed budgets for the projects, but analysts say the Orlando project alone cost roughly US$7 billion (S$9.4 billion).\n\nAs businesses, theme parks come with numerous risks. They are vulnerable to swings in the economy. Visitor safety is a constant battle. Attractions require costly upkeep. Escalating labour costs threaten margins.\n\nBut those challenges are outweighed by the potential for added profit, Comcast has decided. \u201cI could not be prouder of the trajectory and growth strategy,\u201d Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said in an e-mail.\n\nSome of the projects are designed to bring Universal-style thrills to audiences in new markets. On Feb 19, the company announced that a year-round attraction called Universal Horror Unleashed will open in Las Vegas in August, with tickets priced from US$59 to US$149. The 100,000 sq ft attraction will include four haunted houses pegged to movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist: Believer. It will also serve alcohol.\n\nOn Feb 21, Universal announced that its first Universal Kids Resort \u2013 focused on children aged three to eight and under construction near Dallas \u2013 would offer rides and play areas themed to movie franchises like Shrek, Trolls, Minions, Puss In Boots and Jurassic World. The 13ha \u201cstarter\u201d park is expected to open in 2026.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to roll these out across the country and the world,\u201d Mr Woodbury said. (They\u2019re relatively cheap; Mr Woodbury said at a 2023 conference that the first Horror Unleashed and Universal Kids Resort would cost \u201cseveral hundred million\u201d combined.)\n\nOn April 25, Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles will introduce Fan Fest Nights, an evening-hours, separately ticketed event built around Star Trek, Back To The Future and Dungeons & Dragons cosplay that runs until May 18. It represents another of Mr Woodbury\u2019s growth strategies: Find ways to make older Universal parks work harder. Tickets start at US$74 and reach US$373 for a VIP offering.\n\nAnd then comes Epic Universe, a 304ha development in Orlando that includes a theme park and three hotels. When it opens on May 22, Epic Universe will become Florida\u2019s first major new park in a generation \u2013 and, Universal hopes, a property that will reverse a longstanding business dynamic with Walt Disney World to the south. Mr Woodbury wants families to view the Universal Orlando Resort as a week-long destination and not just a one- or two-day add-on to a Disney vacation.\n\n\u201cWe want people to think of us first,\u201d he said. The Universal Orlando Resort currently includes two theme parks (Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure), a shopping and dining district, and a water park called Volcano Bay.\n\nThe park will attract roughly 10 million visitors in its first full year of operation, according to MoffettNathanson.\n\nSo far, Epic Universe tickets for the general public have been sold only as multi-day packages; the least expensive option for non-Floridians is US$352 to US$521, with the cost fluctuating based on the calendar, and provides one-day entry to Epic Universe and two days at the older parks.\n\nDisney has watched Universal\u2019s insurgency with a clenched jaw. In 2014, when the Universal parks broadened their focus to families with young children \u2013 Disney turf \u2013 Mr Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, questioned whether Comcast was serious about the theme park business.\n\n\u201cI think the jury is still out to see just how much they\u2019re willing to invest and what kind of creativity they have to invest in,\u201d Mr Iger said at the time.\n\nIn the years that followed, Comcast spent billions to open a park in China, expand in Japan and add attractions in Florida.\n\nMore recently, Disney has dismissed the threat of greater competition from Universal in Florida, contending that a rising tide lifts all boats. \u201cThe Universal guys will gain a little bit of share, but we\u2019ll see more category growth than we see share loss,\u201d Disney\u2019s chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said at a December conference. \u201cNet-net, it sort of works out okay.\u201d\n\nMoffettNathanson estimated that Epic Universe would siphon one million visitors from Disney World from mid-2025 to the end of 2026.\n\nIn 2023, the most recent year for which attendance numbers were available, Universal parks attracted about 61 million visitors worldwide, a 70 per cent increase from a decade earlier. (Disney parks had 142 million, up 7 per cent.)\n\nUniversal\u2019s momentum has come, in part, from closer collaboration with a corporate sibling, Universal Pictures.\n\nIn 2023, Universal Studios Hollywood opened a major Mario Bros attraction in lockstep with the release of The Super Mario Bros Movie by Universal Pictures. Epic Universe will open in May with rides themed to the How To Train Your Dragon franchise. Universal Pictures will release a big-budget How To Train Your Dragon reboot in June.\n\nNBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios chairwoman Donna Langley said: \u201cWe\u2019ve cultivated a creative and commercial shorthand across our teams, and that ease and comfort with one another allows us to pull levers across the company to amplify our respective strategies.\u201d\n\nMr Woodbury has still-secret plans for significant attractions themed to Wicked, another Universal movie. \u201cWhen I saw it, my first reaction was, \u2018This is a theme park waiting to happen\u2019,\u201d he said.

            "content": "MSNBC\u2019s new chief isn\u2019t wasting any time in figuring out where she wants to take the progressive-leaning network as it prepares to be spun off from NBCUniversal and its corporate parent, Comcast.\n\nRebecca Kutler, who was named president of MSNBC earlier in February, is considering expanding the on-screen presence of Jen Psaki, who currently anchors hours on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings, as well as the trio of personalities who lead \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d the roundtable show that airs Saturday and Sunday mornings and is led by Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez and Michael Steele, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nMSNBC declined to make Kutler available for comment. Puck previously reported discussions around the aforementioned personnel moves.\n\nThe changes, none of which have been formally announced, show Kutler moving quickly to steer MSNBC in a tricky moment. With Comcast splitting off the bulk of its cable assets into a separate, publicly-traded company, MSNBC is likely to have to navigate a future cut off from the newsgathering resources of NBC News. At present, a group of traditional news anchors, including Katy Tur and Chris Jansing, fill MSNBC\u2019s weekday hours, offering reporting and journalism that isn\u2019t as dipped in blue as the outlet\u2019s primetime opinion programs. Veteran Andrea Mitchell recently signed off from the noon hour she anchored for decades, and an official replacement has not been unveiled.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Kutler may have to find new ways to fill those daytime hours. The executive is already at work on finding new Washington correspondents and a Washington bureau chief, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, and recent discussions have centered on the possibility of hiring journalists from outlets such as The Washington Post and Politico; bringing in names from other networks; and elevating current MSNBC contributors to anchor roles.\n\nLike other cable networks, MSNBC is facing significant business challenges. More of the viewers who settle in each evening to watch a few hours of commentary on MSNBC are migrating elsewhere. MSNBC is projected to shed approximately 10.5% of its subscribers between the end of 2023 and the end of 2025, according to estimates from Kagan, a market-research firm that is part of S&P Global Intelligence. Rivals Fox News Channel and CNN are seen experiencing similar erosions in that period. MSNBC could be left with an average of 61.3 million viewers at the end of 2025, compared with 68.5 million in 2023 \u2014 and this with an election year, typically an event that brings viewers back to news, between the two milestones.\n\nMSNBC has been working to bring viewers back after the results of the 2024 presidential election. Both MSNBC and CNN saw significant erosion following Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and the national conversation, and both have unveiled programing shake-ups in recent weeks. At MSNBC, Rachel Maddow returned to hosting the 9 p.m. hour Monday through Friday, compared to the Monday-only schedule (with various special appearances) she has enjoyed in recent years. But Maddow is supposed to return to Mondays-only after Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, a move that would have also accommodated the return of Alex Wagner, who has been hosting Tuesdays through Fridays.\n\nBoth Psaki and \u201cThe Weekend\u201d are close to Kutler\u2019s heart. She developed both the trio and \u201cInside With Jen Psaki.\u201d \u201cThe Weekend\u201d has seen a spike in viewership in its time slot since it launched in January of 2024. Executives at MSNBC have clearly been taken with Psaki, a former Biden White House press secretary, since she launched a Sunday hour in March of 2023.\n\nGiving both of those programs new space suggests MSNBC is eager to maintain its progressive stance, rather than trying to tack towards middle ground. And the moves would add diversity to the network\u2019s weekday lineup.\n\nBut for those two shows to get more space, others may have to get less. Kutler is no doubt juggling her choices.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.",

            "content": "Comcast Boosts Coral Springs Community With Major Investment Significant financial commitment set to transform infrastructure and stimulate local economy.\n\nComcast's recent investment marks a significant boost to the Coral Springs community, underscoring the company's commitment to infrastructure modernization and local engagement. Speaking to the importance of this initiative, John Smith, Regional Director of Comcast, stated, \"Comcast is committed to empowering communities through strategic investments.\" The company aims to directly address the wants and needs of the residents, fostering growth and innovation.\n\nWith the local economy rapidly transforming, Comcast's initiative reflects both foresight and responsiveness to community challenges. According to community leaders, this infusion of resources is expected to spur modernization across various sectors. Maria Gonzalez, the President of the Coral Springs Chamber of Commerce, echoed these sentiments, asserting, \"This initiative will have lasting impacts on our local economy.\" This palpable excitement can be felt across Coral Springs as local businesses and leaders anticipate the anticipated economic uplift.\n\nWhile specific financial figures have yet to be disclosed, the intentions behind Comcast's investment reveal the company's genuine effort to partner with the community. Notably, investment strategies focus not only on infrastructure but actively engage local leaders and organizations to align development with community interests. This approach fosters collaboration, which many believe is key to the initiative's success.\n\nCommunity members have also expressed optimism about the investment, viewing it as more than just economic growth. Residents hope for improved connectivity options, paving the way for educational and professional avenues previously hindered by limited access to technology. This aspect of the investment resonates powerfully, particularly with young professionals and families who advocate for educational advancements.\n\nLocal businesses, too, are eager to see the tangible effects of Comcast's investment. Higher connectivity and enhanced technological infrastructure are poised to yield fruitful opportunities for partnerships and innovation. Many entrepreneurs believe this investment will provide the necessary support to launch new ventures and technologies, fueling economic activity and vibrancy.\n\nLeaders within the community are already working on plans to integrate these funds effectively, emphasizing the importance of crafting projects aligned with the local workforce's needs. By ensuring projects cater to the unique composition of the Coral Springs populace, Comcast stands to forge lasting relationships and establish trust, which could yield dividends far beyond the immediate financial benefits.\n\nMoving forward, collaborative forums between Comcast and local organizations are scheduled, allowing stakeholders to contribute ideas and innovations. Such engagement is not only welcomed but seen as integral to tailoring the initiatives to meet the dynamic requirements of the community.\n\nResidents and leaders alike are poised to witness the direct benefits of Comcast\u2019s investment; the anticipation is palpable. Should the plans come to fruition as hoped, the community could evolve rapidly, setting new benchmarks for technological engagement and economic resilience.\n\nIndeed, the significance of such investments cannot be overstated. Comcast's commitment to the Coral Springs community is seen not just as corporate responsibility but as pivotal for long-term community empowerment. By enhancing local facilities and providing modernized communication infrastructures, Comcast aims to positively affect the day-to-day lives of residents, fostering not just growth but also strengthening community ties.\n\nMoving forward, the residents of Coral Springs and business owners will be keeping their eyes peeled for updates and detailed plans on how Comcast intends to leverage this investment for community benefit. With the right execution, Comcast's initiative has the potential to serve as a model for similar companies aiming to achieve impactful community partnerships.",

A franchise agreement allows a provider to install and operate a cable system in a municipality and use its public rights-of-way.\n\nThe city's franchise agreement with Comcast runs from 2022 to 2027, according to a city document and City Administrator Scott Nicewarner.\n\nUnder the deal, according to a November 2022 letter from Comcast, the company was to pay the city a $25,000 application fee for an initial cable franchise agreement.\n\nThe city gets 5% of Comcast's gross local subscriber revenues, according to Nicewarner through an email from the city's public relations office. The city also receives 70 cents per month per residential subscriber for education/government access capital costs.

A sports and news TV package that includes more than 50 broadcast and cable news and sports channels, plus Peacock, costs $70 a month.\n\nIf Comcast is available in their area, customers can order a router box online, through a Comcast retail store, or have a technician install it, Fox said. If the customer's home is by a utility pole, the service is installed with a line to the house. If there is no utility pole nearby, an Xfinity crew might need to bury a line in front of the house.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other best very cheap stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe stock market had a mixed start to 2025 as the Chinese Deepseek AI model has put the U.S. AI giants on the back foot. However, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index made a recovery after taking a hit and has surged over 5% year-to-date. In addition, the S&P 500 index has gained just over 4% so far in 2025.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Cheap Technology Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nGoldman Sachs Research\u2019s chief US equity strategist, David Kostin, expects the US tariffs to negatively impact the S&P 500 EPS in 2025. Kostin cited that every five-percentage-point increase in the US tariff rate will reduce S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1-2%.\n\nIf the U.S. administration continues with the proposed tariff rates, a 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China would reduce S&P 500 EPS forecasts by approximately 2-3%, as per Goldman\u2019s Research.\n\nWith the potential market risks and tariff threat from the Trump administration, cheap stocks with strong fundamentals can be a good option for investment.\n\nAt first glance, the market may seem overvalued, with the S&P 500 trading close to all-time highs, driven by tech giants and leading consumer stocks. However, some stocks have missed the broader market rally amid temporary challenges. These stocks have attractive forward P/E ratios and proven growth records.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Finviz screener to compile a list of 30 cheap stocks with a forward P/E ratio of under 15. We shortlisted the 10 best very cheap stocks to buy now based on the highest potential upside according to average analyst estimate, as of February 17. The very cheap stocks are ranked in ascending order of the average analyst upside.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) the Best Very Cheap Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nP/E Ratio: 8.35\n\nAverage Analysts Upside: 21.50%\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational mass media and technology corporation that specializes in telecommunications, entertainment, sports, and news. The company is exploring the separation of the cable networks business, addressing the broader challenges from cable TV cord-cutting and boosting profitability for the Peacock streaming service.",

            "content": "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has taken the Trump administration\u2019s war on diversity, equity and inclusion to a new target: Comcast and NBCUniversal.\n\nCarr said he sent a letter Tuesday (Feb. 11) to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts \u201cto let him know that I\u2019ve asked the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to open an investigation into Comcast & NBCUniversal.\u201d\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cI am concerned that his companies may be promoting invidious forms of DEI that do not comply with FCC regulations & civil rights laws,\u201d Carr said in a post Wednesday on X, the social network owned by Elon Musk. \u201cDespite DEI\u2019s rapid emergence in recent years, these forms of discrimination have long been condemned by America\u2019s civil rights laws. As the Supreme Court has written, the classifications drawn by extreme DEI policies stigmatize individuals by reason of a group identity and are, by their very definition, odious to a free people whose institutions are founded on a commitment to equality.\u201d\n\nThe FCC \u201cwill be taking steps to ensure that every company the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act and agency rules,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe are starting with Comcast for the reasons set forth in my letter.\u201d\n\nIn the letter to Roberts, Carr said Comcast \u201cstates on its website that promoting DEI is \u2018a core value of our business\u2019 and public reports state that Comcast has an entire \u2018DEI infrastructure\u2019 that includes annual \u2018DEI day[s],\u2019 \u2018DEI training for company leaders,\u2019 and similar initiatives. NBCUniversal has similar DEI initiatives, including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\u201d Carr also wrote in the letter that because Comcast companies \u201ccover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC,\u201d including cable TV, broadband, broadcast TV and wireless, \u201cI expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Comcast spokesperson Sena Fitzmaurice said, \u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d\n\nCarr, who was named to head the FCC by Trump, also wrote, \u201cThankfully, President Trump has taken quick and decisive action to root out the scourge of DEI. Following President Trump\u2019s executive actions, we have ended the FCC\u2019s promotion of DEI.\u201d\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s election to the White House for a second term, multiple companies have scaled back or eliminated DEI initiatives. Those include Meta, Amazon, Google, PBS, Accenture, Walmart and McDonald\u2019s. On Tuesday, Disney told senior execs it was updating its DEI approach to replace the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d factor in its executive compensation program with a new \u201ctalent strategy\u201d performance factor (which assesses how leaders uphold company values, \u201cincorporate different perspectives to drive business success\u201d and cultivate an environment \u201cwhere all employees can thrive\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, from his perch at the FCC, Carr has also taken aim at \u201cmedia bias,\u201d including through an investigation into alleged \u201cnews distortion\u201d by CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview last October with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump is suing CBS over the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Harris interview, alleging the news program deceptively edited the video, and last week amended his lawsuit to demand damages of $20 billion.\n\nIn its 2024 proxy filing, Comcast says, \u201cWe embrace diversity of background, culture, skills and experience throughout our business. Our ongoing efforts in this regard are reviewed and discussed by our Board and/or its committees, our senior leadership teams, our rotating Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (\u2018DE&I\u2019) Employee Advisory Council and our external DE&I Advisory Council.\u201d\n\nComcast supports nine employee resource groups with approximately 36,000 members in 250 chapters that are \u201cvoluntary, employee-led organizations open to all across our business\u201d dedicated to developing the careers of our employees, contributing to community service and building on an inclusive and collaborative workplace and culture. In addition, the company offers a variety of training programs and initiatives focused on \u201ccreating a more inclusive workplace culture, including company-wide forums like our DE&I speaker series, along with an enterprise-wide learning catalog.\u201d\n\nRegarding NBCU, the Comcast proxy filing says, \u201cWe strive to have diverse perspectives that resonate with a wide range of audiences in our programming at NBCUniversal and in the content we distribute on our media platforms. Through our platforms, we share culturally representative stories and educate our viewers on diverse and inclusive cultures, perspectives and experiences, including through a vast ecosystem of diverse content on Xfinity (including curated On Demand destinations) and NBCUniversal\u2019s \u2018The More You Know\u2019 series of public service announcements.\u201d\n\n(Pictured above: FCC\u2019s Brendan Carr, Comcast\u2019s Brian Roberts)\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Read more\n\nStart your day with the Philly news you need and the stories you want all in one easy-to-read newsletter\n\nHi, Philly. Nearly a quarter-million households in the region lost power during the weekend\u2019s wind storm. As for this week, the threat of snow may not be as strong as expected.\n\nIn 2020, corporate America made sweeping pronouncements about its commitment to racial equity. Now, companies are navigating a political backlash to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the results are in for our reader poll on whether LoMo, Newbold, B3, and others are real neighborhoods. Plus, Phillies season is upon us, complete with 18 theme nights in 2025.\n\n\u2014 Julie Zeglen (morningnewsletter@inquirer.com)\n\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed executive orders to end DEI in the federal government soon after taking office in January, framing such policies as undermining \u201ctraditional American values.\u201d He also took aim at the private sector, directing federal regulators to discourage \u201cillegal discrimination\u201d there.\n\nExperts caution that federal law hasn\u2019t changed for private-sector employers, and Trump\u2019s orders do not specify what makes a DEI program illegal. Still, Philly corporations are left scrambling to navigate the new orders.\n\nThe backlash may have hit Center City-based Comcast the hardest, as it faces a federal investigation over its policies. Other companies seem to be trying to avoid scrutiny, including Conshohocken drug distributor Cencora, which removed mention of DEI efforts from its website.\n\nIt\u2019s a sharp diversion from 2020, when corporations and other institutions emphasized their commitment to racial equity in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nBusiness reporter Andrew Seidman has the story on corporate America\u2019s response to attacks on DEI.\n\nIn other federal policy news:\n\nThe Trump administration has begun firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees, just weeks after the fatal mid-air collision in D.C. Activists in Philadelphia and Bucks County spent Presidents\u2019 Day rallying against Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s attempted overhaul of the federal government. The local protests coincided with other demonstrations nationwide.\n\nIn a city of neighborhoods, not all names are created equal.\n\n\ud83d\udccd The Inquirer\u2019s interactives team put forth a poll last month to see whether Philadelphians agree about what a dozen areas of the city should really be called. Does anyone besides real estate developers really say \u201cNewbold,\u201d for instance?\n\n\ud83d\udccd As it turns out, yes \u2014 22% voted that it\u2019s the proper name for the neighborhood between Washington and Passyunk Avenues and Broad and 18th Streets. Meanwhile, 55% said absolutely not.\n\nHow did your picks compare? See the results of our survey of a dozen dubious names.\n\nWhat you should know today\n\nWith the triumphant end of Eagles season comes the hope for a championship win from another Philadelphia sports team.\n\nMaybe just as anticipated? Discounted hot dogs.\n\nAlas, Dollar Dog Night remains dead and gone. But $5 BOGO Dog Night returns \u2014 this year, during the same game when health-care workers can get an exclusive Phillies scrub top. Nurses Night comes soon after Teacher Appreciation Night (free mugs for educators!) followed by Citizens Weather Education Day, and not long before Salute to Service Night.\n\nThat\u2019s just a sample of the 18 theme nights of the coming baseball season. Read the details on them all.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Trivia time\n\nWonder, a billion-dollar restaurant idea, is planning 10 food halls and delivery hubs in the Philly area. Which is not one of the company\u2019s planned locations?\n\nA) West Chester\n\nB) Fishtown\n\nC) Mount Laurel\n\nD) University City\n\nThink you know?

The idea is to allow more small businesses to use performance and premium TV advertising.\n\nA+E, AMC Networks, DirecTV, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Paramount, Roku, TelevisaUnivision, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Xumo were named as the launch partners.\n\nComcast executive James Grant will lead the Universal Ads initiative. Former Snap executive James Borow -- who helped Snap, Reddit and Discord launch their ad businesses -- has been hired to lead the Universal Ads\u2019 product and engineering teams, in collaboration with the FreeWheel product and technology team.\n\nThe platform, announced at CES 2025, is set to debut in the first quarter of this year. It is powered by FreeWheel technology that supports video advertising for a variety of premium U.S. publishers.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe Manager for the free self-service TV ad-buying tool works similar to the way that Google, Microsoft, and Meta drove ad buying from some of the smaller companies on their respective platforms.\n\nMark Marshall, chairman of NBCUniversal Global Advertising & Partnerships, believes TV has always been a \u201cperformance vehicle for brands,\u201d and that Universal Ads will put the reach of premium content TV is known for into the hands of more marketers.\n\nComcast describes Universal Ads as its first cross-industry collaboration for this type of scale to simplify access for small and medium-sized businesses looking for performance-type formats.\n\nJames Rooke, President, Comcast Advertising, believes the platform was built in in response to what advertisers have been asking for\u2014to make TV ads simple to buy and measure. Something for the needs of performance marketers.\n\nA 2024 study of 250 performance-based advertisers conducted by Comcast Advertising showed 50% of advertisers who have never advertised on TV or only done so minimally felt that their return on investment (ROI) from social media had peaked or lessoned. Eighty-nine percent of them indicated they were willing to try TV advertising.\n\nThe network was built on a shared technology infrastructure across publishers, performance advertisers, who were previously limited in their ability to purchase premium, brand-safe inventory from some of the top TV publishers. This platform, Comcast believes, changes the buying landscape.\n\nComcast also plans to offer free, automated AI creative production of TV commercials, and a marketing API that will enable developers to build reporting, measurement, creative generation, and other applications.",

Large companies in Philadelphia and beyond are navigating political backlash to DEI programs. Comcast, which did not mention diversity in its most recent annual report, is facing an FCC investigation over its DEI policies. Read more\n\nCencora Inc., a Conshohocken-based wholesale drug distributor, scrubbed a diversity, equity, and inclusion page from its website. Its chief DEI officer no longer works there, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nComcast made no mention of diversity in its latest annual report, departing from past practice, but that didn\u2019t stop a federal regulator from opening an investigation last week to \u201croot out invidious forms of DEI discrimination.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd after a conservative nonprofit accused American Airlines of using discriminatory practices to increase its \u201crepresentation of black professionals,\u201d the company in December acknowledged that government contracting regulations \u201cdo not permit quotas, preferences, or set-asides.\u201d\n\nPublicly traded companies in the Philadelphia region and across the U.S. are trying to navigate a political backlash to diversity initiatives that was punctuated by President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The president has so far followed through on campaign promises to dismantle federal DEI programs and push back against \u201cwokeness\u201d in society more broadly.\n\nSoon after taking office, Trump signed executive orders to end DEI in the federal government, rescind affirmative-action requirements for federal contractors, and direct federal law enforcement and regulators to discourage \u201cillegal discrimination\u201d in the private sector. The president instructed agencies to identify the \u201cmost egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\u201d for possible enforcement.\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 21 order said illegal DEI policies \u201cnot only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this month directed her department to outline steps for \u201cenforcing federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences.\u201d That could include proposals for criminal investigations, Bondi\u2019s memo said.\n\n\u2018Hysteria\u2019\n\nCorporate lawyers at the prominent New York firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP \u201cstrongly\u201d recommended \u201cthat private sector employers carefully monitor the changing landscape as we expect further developments in this area,\u201d according to a memo published Feb. 10 by the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance.\n\nFederal law has not changed for private-sector employers, and Trump\u2019s order does not \u201cprovide any guidance on what makes a DEI program illegal,\u201d according to an analysis by labor and employment lawyers at the firm Cozen O\u2019Connor.\n\nProponents of diversity initiatives in the workforce are pushing back against the \u201chysteria,\u201d as DEI consultant and employment lawyer Natalie Norfus put it.\n\nThe meaning of DEI \u201chas been completely mangled,\u201d she said. Employers use DEI initiatives to attract the best talent, including people who have different experiences and viewpoints; retain that talent by treating employees fairly; and help employees feel valued, Norfus said.\n\nThe notion that a company might have criminal liability because of its DEI policy is \u201csilly,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThat, to me, also becomes like a dog whistle to get people scared,\u201d said Norfus, founder of a Miami-based consulting firm. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a headache to get investigated, but when you\u2019re looking at the legal basis of it, as of today, there aren\u2019t really laws on the books that, at least on the federal level, would prevent a company from having a DEI program.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s DEI-related executive orders are already being challenged in court by the City of Baltimore and other plaintiffs, she noted.\n\nBig companies scale back DEI policies\n\nYet some big companies \u2014 including Google, Target, Walmart, and Meta \u2014 aren\u2019t waiting to see how such litigation might unfold before scaling back or ending their DEI policies.\n\nBoeing Co., which produces military helicopters at a plant in Ridley Park, recently dismantled its DEI department, Bloomberg reported in November. Still, the company told Bloomberg that it \u201cremains committed to recruiting and retaining top talent and creating an inclusive work environment.\u201d\n\nSome corporations, such as Costco, have said they\u2019re standing by their programs. Costco shareholders in January overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to evaluate risks associated with its DEI policies, and the wholesale retailer\u2019s board said its \u201ccommitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nLocally, even companies that continued to celebrate DEI on their websites as of Feb. 17, such as food and facilities provider Aramark and drugmaker Merck & Co., were tight-lipped about the matter. Neither firm responded to requests for comment about their DEI policies.\n\nTrump\u2019s anti-DEI agenda is rippling out across other local institutions, too. K-12 schools are reviewing a Trump order that aims to eliminate funding \u201cfor illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination\u201d in the classroom. The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s medical school plans to dissolve committees involved in DEI efforts, The Inquirer reported.\n\nIt all amounts to whiplash after corporations and other institutions made sweeping pronouncements about their commitment to racial equity in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police in 2020.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promoted those principles in his administration, signing executive orders \u201cadvancing racial equity and support for underserved communities.\u201d He also sought to embed equity in everything from budgeting and procurement to policy implementation, such as by directing climate investments to polluted communities.\n\nBacklash reaches Comcast\n\nBut the backlash didn\u2019t come overnight. Over the last few years, some GOP-led states enacted laws aimed at restricting DEI in the workplace, though courts found at least one such statute, in Florida, was unconstitutional.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision prohibiting colleges from using race-conscious admissions energized conservative activists who have since filed lawsuits challenging corporate diversity programs.\n\nIn 2022, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty sued Comcast over a grant program the company had pitched two years earlier as a way to boost Black-owned small businesses. The suit, filed on behalf of four small-business owners, alleged the program violated an 1866 federal law that the institute said \u201cprohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.\u201d\n\nThe parties ultimately reached a confidential settlement, the institute said, and Comcast later expanded the program to applicants from all backgrounds.\n\nComcast has continued to promote DEI, calling it \u201ca core value of our business\u201d on its website, which includes a breakdown of its workforce\u2019s demographics by race and gender.\n\nBut there have been subtle shifts. Comcast did not mention diversity in the annual report it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month \u2014 a change from the prior two years. Instead, the company wrote: \u201cWe promote a culture that embraces equal opportunity for all.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, the Federal Communications Commission last week said it had opened a probe into Comcast and its subsidiary NBCUniversal over their DEI practices. A Comcast spokesperson said the company \u201cwill be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers,\u201d Comcast said.\n\nScrubbed website\n\nOther companies are seemingly racing to head off potential scrutiny.\n\nCencora, the drug distributor formerly known as AmerisourceBergen, since 2021 has highlighted in annual reports a \u201clong-term DE&I strategy\u201d focused on \u201cfour critical dimensions \u2014 people, culture, progress, and community.\u201d\n\nThe company, which counts 46,000 \u201cteam members,\u201d has tracked the demographic makeup of its workforce, board of directors, and executive management committee. It has touted its \u201cscore of 100\u201d in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, which grades corporate policies pertinent to LGBTQ employees. And it has promoted its partnerships with diverse suppliers.\n\nCencora \u2014 which last year had $6.1 billion in binding agreements with the federal government \u2014 included similar information in its most recent annual report in September.\n\nAnd as recently as last month, the company\u2019s website featured a statement from its senior vice president and chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer, Ann Anaya: \u201cOur DEI journey will guide our path forward by uniting our global culture of inclusion, serving as a catalyst for health equity with our partners, and amplifying diverse perspectives to advance innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nThat page has since been taken down. Anaya \u2014 hired in 2022 when, Cencora said, \u201cinvesting in our people and fostering a culture that is purpose-driven and inclusive is an integral part\u201d of the company\u2019s strategy \u2014 stopped working there in November, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nCencora declined to say whether it had changed its DEI strategy. \u201cCencora has and will continue to make decisions that we believe will best support our business and meet the needs of our organization\u2019s numerous stakeholders including our team members, customers, partners, investors and the communities in which we operate,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe believe that fostering an engaged and inclusive workforce drives our performance and best enables us to support global access to medications,\u201d the statement said, adding that the company works diligently to comply with laws and regulations.\n\nLawsuits from activists\n\nAmerican Airlines, in a since-deleted July 2020 news release, advocated for using \u201cour voices within the business community to encourage and support corporate efforts to eliminate systemic racism in America.\u201d\n\nThe airline, one of Philadelphia\u2019s biggest for-profit employers, pledged to increase \u201crepresentation of Black professionals in our senior leadership\u201d and \u201cassist Black youth in developing job skills and expanding access to well-paying careers.\u201d\n\nLast year, America First Legal, a nonprofit founded by Trump aide Stephen Miller, asked the U.S. Labor Department to investigate the airline for allegedly violating federal contracting requirements that prohibit discrimination in hiring. American Airlines had received more than $140 million in federal contracts since 2008, the complaint said.\n\nCiting the airline\u2019s 2020 news release, America First Legal wrote in its complaint that the company \u201cimplemented overtly discriminatory hiring practices based on the race or color of the individuals involved.\u201d\n\nIn December, the Labor Department held an \u201cinformal compliance conference\u201d with the airline and wrote in a letter to America First that if the company fails to meet a hiring benchmark, it will \u201cassess its employment practices\u201d and \u201cremedy any unlawful discrimination,\u201d according to a copy of the letter the nonprofit posted on its website.\n\nSuch remedies could include broadening recruitment to \u201cincrease the diversity of applicant pools\u201d and establishing programs to increase promotion opportunities for \u201cunderrepresented groups,\u201d said the letter, which did not specifically use the terms \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d or \u201cDEI.\u201d\n\nDEI departments often already use those practices.\n\nAmerica First declared victory, saying the airline \u201cacknowledged that recruiting and hiring based on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) violates federal laws and equal employment opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican companies must return to using merit \u2014 not the desire to check a DEI box \u2014 to select the most skilled and qualified employees,\u201d America First Legal counsel Will Scolinos said in a statement.\n\nThe airline didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Its website says the company is \u201cproud to be a place where people of diverse generations, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, religions and other backgrounds are genuinely included and valued.\u201d",

The company has invested in furthering inclusion across its workforce, as its website states that it has spent US$18bn on \u201cdiverse Tier 1 suppliers\u201d since 2010.\n\nIt also offers 100 diverse networks on Xfinity platforms and has given over 18,000 hours of diverse on-demand and online programming since 2018. \u201cDiversity, equity, and inclusion are a core value of our business. Our commitment to diversity and mission to champion inclusivity and equality starts at home\u201d the company states.\n\nImage: Jonathan Newton / Associated Press",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Why These Dividend Stocks Are Underperforming in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other dividend stocks that are underperforming in 2025.\n\nConsistent returns from dividend stocks have long attracted many investors, becoming the cornerstone of many investment portfolios. However, significant changes have been recorded a month and a half into 2025 among these dividend stocks. Some of the most historically reliable dividend-paying companies have struggled to maintain attractiveness. As the market concentrates heavily on innovation and growth, the performances of many of the dividend stocks have begun to decline. The list in this article contains significant stocks, some of which may also be in your portfolio.\n\nAre you curious to find out which? Stick around as we count from 10 to 1 and uncover the names falling behind this year.\n\nReasons matter as much as knowing the performance level of stocks. The reallocation of capital is a significant reason for the underperformance. Heavy investments have always favored sectors with high-growth potentials, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and technology space, as of 2025. Funds are being pulled from traditional dividend-paying industries like utilities, consumer staples, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) to invest in these sectors. Though major tech companies have been struggling recently, with the advent of DeepSeek\u2013a Chinese AI model\u2013their anticipated growth trajectories continue to be more than that of many dividend stocks. These changes in the market have consequentially depressed the performance of dividend-heavy sectors.\n\nEven with these yield-wise underperformances, dividend stocks have become more attractive. When funds are pulled to invest in high-growth AI stocks, dividend stocks become undervalued, resulting in higher dividend yields. Investors who prefer consistent income are taking this opportunity to acquire quality dividend stocks at favorable valuations. This trend has provided a balancing effect for some sectors.\n\nAI can be a significant reason for the underperformance of the stocks on our list, but it cannot be the sole reason. In our article, we will also look at other factors that led to the underperformance of these 10 dividend stocks. Interest rates, for instance, are among the vulnerabilities of many dividend-heavy sectors like utilities and REITs. With the Federal Reserve continuing to maintain higher interest rates, the attractiveness of dividend stocks may decline further compared to their income-generating counterparts. On the other hand, many tech giants make dividend payments, closing the gap between high growth and income investing. The entry of more AI-driven companies into the dividend-paying territory might cause some of the existing dividend stocks to lose their footing in the competition.",

            "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Comcast ( ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Comcast:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.10 = US$23b \u00f7 (US$266b - US$40b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, Comcast has an ROCE of 10%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Comcast compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nThere hasn't been much to report for Comcast's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Comcast to be a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Comcast's ROCE\n\nIn a nutshell, Comcast has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 12% in the last five years. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.\n\nOne more thing: We've identified , and understanding these would certainly be useful.\n\nWhile Comcast may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Comcast's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nThe top 22 shareholders own 50% of the company\n\nInsiders have sold recently\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Comcast, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Ownership Breakdown February 15th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nComcast already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Comcast's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Earnings and Revenue Growth February 15th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.8%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.0% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Brian Roberts directly holds 0.9% of the total shares outstanding.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

            "content": "Make NFL streaming prices customizable\n\nRe: \u201cFans still losers in Comcast/Altitude deal,\u201d Feb. 12 letter to the editor\n\nThe letter regarding the high cost of watching Avalanche and Nuggets games through Comcast is similar to my desire to watch the Broncos games in Texas, where I now live. I\u2019m stuck with YouTube and their outrageous cost of paying $349 to catch all the Broncos games.\n\nI wrote a letter to the NFL asking if they would consider a two-tiered pricing system \u2014 one for the sports bars and others who want to carry all the games and a lower price for fans like me who only want to follow their favorite team. I\u2019m not hopeful \u2014 the NFL is more concerned about enriching the owners at the expense of the fans.\n\nAt least the Denver Broncos have good owners who know how to make good decisions. The Dallas Cowboys are a clown show.\n\nPaul Leinhos, Lantana, Texas\n\nLife saved by NIH, NSF and federal funding\n\nAs a two-time survivor of advanced cancer, I owe my life to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the numerous cancer researchers who have worked tirelessly on cancer and cancer treatments.\n\nI have been called a superhero for surviving cancer. The truth is that the superheroes are the scientists funded by the NIH and NSF. This funding is under threat from the Trump administration. The agencies fund critical research in diseases such as diabetes, cancer and dementia. Funding only the researcher isn\u2019t enough. Scientists could accomplish nothing without all the infrastructure and support staff that are needed to solve the complex health problems facing society today.\n\nPlease contact your representatives and support continued full funding for NIH and NSF. Your life might depend on it. Mine did.\n\nCheryl Wells, Leadville\n\n155-acre park should be accessible to all\n\nRe: \u201cDenver\u2019s fight to preserve the Park Hill conservation easement rewarded with 155-acre park,\u201d Jan. 16 news story\n\nThe new 155-acre park needs to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 everything, with no exceptions. This can be done and needs to be done for the sake of everyone.\n\nAs the mother of children with disabilities, I know how sad it is for children and now adults to have to watch others enjoy activities they cannot due to a lack of planning on the part of those designing the facility. Wheelchairs, walkers, canes, different-sized and shaped bodies, sensitivity to noise, balance, vision, and hearing need to be considered. Do the homework. Heighten the joy.\n\nVirginia Ward, Thornton\n\nProtect Dolores River land\n\nRe: \u201cAdvocates still hoping to protect canyonlands,\u201d Feb. 9 news story\n\nThank you for your coverage of the ongoing efforts to protect the Dolores River canyonlands. The Dolores River is one of our state\u2019s last, best wild places \u2014 home to diverse wildlife, vital water resources, and cherished outdoor recreation.\n\nWhile the Biden administration did not designate the area as a national monument, given that Coloradans overwhelmingly support public lands and their protection, a reclassification of this land in the near future makes sense. Efforts to strip federal protections from public lands in neighboring states underscore the urgency of this work.\n\nOur lawmakers should push forward with a national conservation area designation to ensure it remains protected, regardless of shifting political tides in Washington. Whether the government chooses to designate the canyon as a national monument or a national conservation area, permanent protections are necessary to preserve its beauty and ecological importance for future generations.\n\nHenry Stiles, Lafayette\n\nA \u201cwin-win\u201d education tradition\n\nRe: \u201cSupport for first-generation students its \u2018best-kept secret\u2019,\u201d Jan. 18 news story\n\nWhile admiring the article celebrating first-generation college students, I want to point out that first-generation students aren\u2019t limited to just immigrant families, although they can benefit even more from an extra boost along the way. It\u2019s true.\n\nTo highlight the role of the CU Denver campus: I encountered many first-generation-in-their-family scholars there, including myself, when I attended long ago. It\u2019s a proud tradition.\n\nThe promise of America is that effort can be rewarded. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\nHarry Puncec, Lakewood\n\nSign up for Sound Off to get a weekly roundup of our columns, editorials and more.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by email or mail.",

            "content": "As avian flu drives egg prices to record levels and increasingly poses a risk to humans, moves by the White House to cut spending and restrict communications have hobbled public health officials\u2019 response, with the new administration yet to outline a clear strategy on how it plans to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nState and local public health officials have gone weeks without regular updates on avian flu from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after President Donald Trump froze nearly all external communications from the agency, said a person familiar with the situation. It wasn\u2019t until this week that some of those communications began to resume, the person said.\n\nWidespread funding cuts across the government and new restrictions on funding for National Institutes of Health grants have also created uncertainty among infectious disease researchers and local health officials, who are unsure about what resources they will have to work with going forward. Meanwhile, cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development have limited monitoring of the virus overseas.\n\n\u201cWhen you add that uncertainty, it plays into what health departments can do when their entire funding situation is at risk,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cIt makes it even harder to do more when you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have the resources or they might get pulled out from under you.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, key positions in the Trump administration central to responding to the threat of a pandemic have remained unfilled. And the secretaries running the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments weren\u2019t confirmed until this week, though bird flu was one of the first items on Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins' agenda after her confirmation.\n\nThe disruptions come at a potentially perilous time. The virus has been decimating poultry flocks, causing egg prices to more than double. It has been showing signs it can evolve to more easily thrive in a variety of species, including a new strain detected among dairy cattle this month. While there are no indications the virus can be transmitted among humans, at least 68 people in the U.S. have contracted avian flu and one person has died, according to the CDC. Researchers worry that the more the virus replicates, the more opportunities it will have to develop a mutation that would enable it to spread easily from human to human.\n\n\u201cThis is getting more and more dangerous and urgent, and the scientific community is setting off alarm flares,\u201d said Stephen Morrison, who directs the global health policy center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut are they translating into the government moving at a faster pace or with a different resolve? No. Instead, we\u2019re in a period of confused transition that\u2019s been made worse by the disruptions in government function and the normal slowness of getting the new team in.\u201d\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on its strategy for addressing avian flu and what additional steps it planned to take to address the spread of the virus.\n\nRollins, who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday, told reporters that she had a briefing in the Oval Office Thursday night and would be announcing more on the department\u2019s plan to address egg prices \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking at every possible scenario to ensure that we are doing everything we can in a safe, secure manner, but also to ensure that Americans have the food that they need,\u201d Rollins said when asked about the price of eggs. \u201cAnd as a mom of four teenagers, actually, I fully understand and feel the pain of the cost of these eggs.\u201d\n\nWhite House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an interview on MSNBC Thursday that the Trump administration would soon have a strategy now that Rollins has been confirmed.\n\n\u201cIt turns out, President Biden\u2019s team didn\u2019t have an avian flu strategy, and now we\u2019re about to have one, as soon as Brooke Rollins is at the Department of Agriculture,\u201d said Hassett.\n\nIn a statement on egg prices earlier this week, the White House said Rollins would take \u201cbold, decisive action to address the crisis\u201d by refocusing the agency tasked with stopping the spread of the virus among animals \u201con its core mission: protecting the health of the United States\u2019 plants, animals, and natural resources while simultaneously lowering costs.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, public health officials say the White House has created more confusion than clarity.\n\nIn West Virginia, Michael Kilkenny, head of the Huntington Health Department, said he hasn\u2019t been getting regular updates from the CDC for the past several weeks.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening right now. We don\u2019t know if this is expanding into our area if we aren\u2019t getting that communication from the CDC,\u201d said Kilkenny. \u201cIn more rural areas, there are small health departments that, without the information they need coming from the CDC, they\u2019re not going to be able to inform their small-flock farmers, poultry farmers or higher-risk agricultural workers that depend on the local health department for information or services.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of potential federal funding cuts have also caused his and other health departments he works with to begin contingency planning and put hiring and new projects on hold.\n\n\u201cWe are holding on hiring and we are holding on planning while we are waiting to see that there is clear evidence that things are going to be funded before we can spend our work time planning or even submitting for a project,\u201d said Kilkenny. \u201cThat is how this disrupts us.\u201d\n\nAlong with limiting CDC communications with local health officials, the World Health Organization has also been receiving limited information on the spread of avian flu in the U.S. since Trump signed an executive order to withdraw from the global health organization, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a Feb. 12 press conference.\n\nThe \u201cnear-total communication freeze\u201d at public health agencies \u201cis deeply unprecedented, and that alone scares me more than anything else,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the pandemic center at the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nNearly a month in, Trump has yet to name an official to head the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, which was created in 2022 by Congress to coordinate pandemic response across agencies. During the campaign, Trump said he would likely get rid of the office and criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to prepare for another pandemic.\n\n\u201cHe wants to spend a lot of money on something that you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna be 100 years or 50 years or 25 years,\u201d Trump said of Biden in a July interview with Time magazine. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a way of giving out pork.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not watching out for it all the time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to predict what\u2019s coming because there are a lot of variations of these pandemics.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s key Cabinet officials who will be overseeing the federal response have given little insight into their strategy.\n\nRollins said during her Senate confirmation hearing last month that one of her top four priorities would be to put a team in place to stem the spread of avian flu, though she didn\u2019t say what changes she would like to see the Agriculture Department make.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot that I have to learn on this, and if confirmed, this will be, as I mentioned in my opening statement, one of the very top priorities,\u201d Rollins said when asked about her response to avian flu. \u201cWe are hyperfocused on finding the team right now. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already working. I have, obviously, respected the process and not gotten too involved. I know that the current team and the future team will be working hand in hand to do everything we can on animal disease.\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday, said during his confirmation hearing that he would focus more on tackling chronic disease, like heart disease and diabetes, and less on infectious diseases. When asked about devoting resources to avian flu during his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he \u201cintends to devote the appropriate resources to preventing pandemics. That\u2019s essential for my job.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Kennedy has said the currently available vaccines for avian flu that the U.S. has stockpiled may be dangerous and ineffective. Researchers are working on developing a new generation of avian flu vaccines based on the same mRNA technology used to develop the Covid vaccines, which Kennedy called the \u201cthe deadliest vaccine ever made,\u201d though studies have shown it to be safe.\n\nKennedy has also been a proponent of drinking raw milk, which can put people at risk of foodborne illness, including avian flu. The CDC has warned that it might be possible to contract bird flu from drinking raw milk and urged Americans to drink only pasteurized milk.\n\nAgriculture industry officials and infectious disease researchers have been calling on the federal government to significantly ramp up its response with greatly expanded testing, funding for research to better understand the virus and develop new treatments, and more assistance for dairy farmers to encourage them to test their cattle.\n\nThe United Egg Producers, an advocacy group for the egg industry, is urging the federal government and Congress to devote more resources to researching how the virus is spreading and evolving and to develop more effective and widespread vaccinations for animals. The industry group has also been calling for more rules and enforcement around the testing and movement of animals, and additional funding for local laboratories to provide quick and accurate test results.\n\n\u201cOur industry needs more from our state and federal government animal health partners \u2014 and we need it fast,\u201d the United Egg Producers said in a statement.\n\nThe organization says its industry has lost more than 100 million egg-laying hens since 2022, including more than 29 million over the past four months. Once a flock of birds is infected with the highly pathogenic strain of the avian flu, the virus quickly spreads and is fatal in the vast majority of birds. When a flock becomes infected, farmers and veterinarians are supposed to notify the USDA, which will kill the entire flock and decontaminate the facilities. The federal government reimburses the farmers for the live birds that are culled in the process.\n\nPublic health researchers have said the Biden administration didn\u2019t react quickly enough to stop the spread of the virus among dairy cattle after it was first detected in herds in March. It wasn\u2019t until December that the Agriculture Department rolled out a national milk testing program, and three of the country\u2019s top milk-producing states still aren\u2019t a part of that federal surveillance effort.\n\nThe Trump administration will have to work with officials in states that still aren\u2019t regularly testing their milk to try to get them on board, said Morrison. Texas\u2019 state agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, told NBC News that surveillance milk testing was unnecessary in Texas since there weren\u2019t any active cases of bird flu in the state\u2019s commercial cattle or poultry.\n\n\u201cFrom April until the end of the Biden administration, the response was slow and sluggish,\u201d said Morrison. \u201cWe are still not testing animals and humans at the level that is needed, we still don\u2019t have a coherent strategy and a system of accountability, and we still don\u2019t have in place the kind of compensation mechanisms needed for those dairy farmers who suffer losses because of infections in their herds.\u201d\n\nResearchers worry the U.S. is running out of time to strengthen its response.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, we\u2019re only giving the virus more opportunity to continue to adapt and potentially evolve into something more dangerous in a human population,\u201d said Erin Sorrell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cNow is the time to act.\u201d",

            "content": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 14, 2025 \u2013 FCC Chairman Brendan Carr\u2019s investigation into Comcast\u2019s promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs fueled controversy within the Federal Communications Commission this week, with Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks warning the move likely exceeds the FCC\u2019s regulatory authority.\n\n\u201cFrom what I know, this enforcement action is out of our lane and out of our reach,\u201d Starks said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cI have asked for a briefing to understand the Enforcement Bureau\u2019s theory of the case, the authority relied upon, and any prior precedent. This gives me grave concern.\u201d\n\nThe probe was part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on DEI programs across the public and private sectors. On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to root out corporate DEI policies he labeled as discriminatory.\n\n\"The FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act... including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\u201d Carr wrote in the letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts.\n\nCarr said he was opening the probe beginning with Comcast, the owner of NBC, Peacock, and Universal Pictures, because there was \"substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI\" and that Comcast covers numerous sectors regulated by the FCC including cable, high-speed internet, broadcast TV stations and wireless offerings.\n\nDemocratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez also criticized Carr's investigation into Comcast. \"Stoking partisan culture wars is not the FCC\u2019s job. It is time we return to our core mission \u2013 closing the digital divide, fostering innovation, and protecting consumers\" she said.\n\nGomez warned during her keynote speech at State of the Net 2025 Tuesday that the FCC was increasingly being \u201cweaponized\u201d to pressure broadcasters and online platforms to bend to Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe probe has already drawn backlash from civil rights organizations, legal experts, and media industry groups, who warn that it could have a chilling effect on corporate diversity efforts.\n\nFor decades, the FCC has enforced Equal Employment Opportunity rules, which require broadcast license holders to follow diverse hiring practices. The agency has also supported programs such as the Minority Tax Certificate Program (1978-1995) and Designated Entity Rules for Spectrum Auctions to increase minority and women-owned businesses\u2019 participation in the telecom sector.\n\nBut under the Trump administration, DEI programs in telecommunications, along with other industries, have been targeted for elimination. Carr has already moved to rescind the FCC\u2019s 2022 Equity Action Plan, disband the Communications Equity and Diversity Council, and strip DEI priorities from the agency\u2019s budget, strategic plans, and advisory directives.\n\nFormer FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler under President Obama called Carr\u2019s investigation part of a larger pattern, in a recent interview with New York Times reporter Ben Mullin.\n\n\"How can [Carr] use the coercive authority of regulation to accomplish the goals of your master and mentor, Donald Trump?\" Wheeler questioned.\n\nHe pointed to what he viewed as apparent hypocrisy by Republican regulators.\n\n\u201cWhen I was chairman, Republicans were constantly complaining about regulatory overreach. Now? They're into content, they're into corporate practices.\u201d\n\nWheeler and telecom analysts see Carr\u2019s investigation as more political than legal. In a note, New Street Research policy advisor Blair Levin wrote that Carr\u2019s past investigations into tech and media companies have not led to enforcement action, and that \"if Comcast is willing to litigate, we believe it will be exonerated.\"\n\nIn a statement, Comcast acknowledged it received Carr's letter and said it \"will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\" adding: \"For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\"",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nTh e Federal Communications Commission enforcement bureau has begun investigating Comcast, the provider of internet and cable television and parent of broadcaster NBC, for possibly \u201cpromoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations,\u201d according to a letter from the agency\u2019s new chairman , Brendan Carr, to Comcast\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s potential enforcement action stems from President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 21 executive order ending DEI programs and practices across the federal government, which also instructed U.S. agencies \u201cto encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\u201d\n\nComcast, which also owns Universal theme parks, said it will cooperate with the FCC to address any questions. \u201cFor decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers,\u201d a Comcast spokesperson said Thursday in an email to Legal Dive.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Comcast investigation is the latest action Carr, a former FCC general counsel, has taken against broadcasters since he assumed leadership of the agency last month.\n\nIn his letter Tuesday, Carr wrote that he wants the FCC to ensure \u201cthat your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\u201d Carr referred to DEI programs as \u201cinvidious\u201d forms of discrimination five times in his 10-paragraph letter to Comcast.\n\nHe said the DEI investigations were beginning with Comcast because of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d the company continues to promote DEI across its businesses. Secondly, because Comcast\u2019s companies cover areas the FCC regulates, including broadband internet, cable TV and broadcast television, Carr said the Comcast investigation \u201cwill aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\u201d\n\nThe implicit threat in the enforcement probe, if Comcast does not properly satisfy the agency\u2019s DEI wishes, is various actions the FCC could take as one of the company\u2019s primary regulators, including jeopardizing NBC\u2019s broadcast licenses.\n\nSeparately, PBS said Tuesday that it was closing its DEI office, following the advice of legal counsel, and that two staff members working there would leave the broadcaster. \u201cWe will continue to adhere to our mission and values,\u201d PBS said in a statement to National Public Radio. \u201cPBS will continue to reflect all of America and remain a welcoming place for everyone.\u201d\n\nFCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said Wednesday in a statement that the agency\u2019s enforcement action falls outside its purview and \u201cgives me grave concern.\u201d Starks said he had requested a briefing to understand the agency\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case, the authority relied upon, and any prior precedent\u201d for the Comcast probe. \u201cFrom what I know, this enforcement action is out of our lane and out of our reach,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Starks did not immediately respond to a message seeking further comment.\n\nFCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez said in a statement to Legal Dive that \u201cstoking partisan culture wars is not the FCC\u2019s job. It is time we return to our core mission \u2013 closing the digital divide, fostering innovation, and protecting consumers.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order on DEI also told Attorney General Pam Bondi to compile a list of \u201cthe most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern\u201d and specific measures \u201cto deter DEI programs or principles.\u201d\n\nEach executive agency was told to identify as many as nine \u201cpotential civil compliance investigations\u201d of publicly traded companies, large non-profits, associations or foundations.\n\nPreviously, the FCC under Carr has begun investigating CBS for possible \u201cnews distortion\u201d over its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has sued CBS and its parent, Paramount Global, over the interview in a Texas federal court.\n\nBeyond its Xfinity internet and mobile phone service business and NBC, Philadelphia-based Comcast also owns the Universal chain of theme parks, the Peacock TV streaming service, cable channel MSNBC and Sky, the UK-based television, mobile phone and internet company.",

As an independent federal agency, the FCC issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations rather than networks.\n\nIn January, Reuters reported that Carr reinstated complaints concerning ABC News\u2019 handling of the pre-election debate between former President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Additionally, another complaint was reinstated regarding NBC\u2019s decision to feature Vice President Kamala Harris on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d ahead of the election.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2025\u2014the first day of his second term\u2014Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\u201d one of many aimed at dismantling DEI programs across the United States.\n\nThe order mandates the coordination of terminating all discriminatory programs, including eliminating \u201cillegal\u201d DEI and DEIA mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities within the federal government, regardless of their labeling.\n\n\u201cThe Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military,\u201d the order read.\n\n\u201cThat ends today,\u201d it added. \u201cAmericans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.\u201d\n\nComcast has confirmed receiving an FCC inquiry and intends to cooperate and answer questions.\n\n\u201cFor decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers,\u201d the company said in a statement, per Reuters.",

            "content": "Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr has let Comcast know in writing that the agency will investigate the company\u2019s DEI practices.\n\nSince Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal Local and Telemundo, the impact could reach local stations across the US.\n\n\u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\u201d a Comcast spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company is a more innovative and successful one. Across our workforce, products, and content, we embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture, and experience, and together with our partners, we are working to fight injustice against any race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, disability, or veteran status.\u201d Comcast website says on its DEI initiatives\n\nBelow is Carr\u2019s letter to Comcast chair and CEO Brian Roberts as published by THR:\n\nDear Mr. Roberts,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I have asked the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to open an investigation into Comcast and NBCUniversal. In particular, I want to ensure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\n\nAs you know, the Communications Act and Commission rules prohibit regulated entities\u2014like Comcast and NBCUniversal\u2014from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or gender.1 Indeed, the FCC\u2019s longstanding Equal Employment Opportunity or EEO rules set forth specific requirements that both Comcast and NBCUniversal must adhere to.\n\nNonetheless, I am concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations. For instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is \u201ca core value of our business\u201d and public reports state that Comcast has an entire \u201cDEI infrastructure\u201d that includes annual \u201cDEI day[s],\u201d \u201cDEI training for company leaders,\u201d and similar initiatives. NBCUniversal has similar DEI initiatives, including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\n\nBut promoting invidious forms of discrimination cannot be squared with any reasonable interpretation of federal law. It can only deprive Americans of their rights to fair and equal treatment under the law.\n\nDespite the emergence of DEI initiatives in recent years, these forms of discrimination have long been condemned by America\u2019s civil rights laws. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c\u2018[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\u2019\u201d Likewise, the Supreme Court has written that racial classifications \u201cthreaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.\u201d For this reason, the Supreme Court has stated that, in the government context, \u201caction based on race\u2014a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\u2014 should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump took quick and decisive action to root out the scourge of DEI. In his first week in office, President Trump issued an Executive Order that will end the radical and wasteful DEI programs that have spread across the federal government.\n\nLikewise, President Trump issued an Executive Order to end illegal discrimination and restore merit-based opportunity across the private sector.6 In that latter Executive Order, President Trump wrote that illegal DEI policies \u201cundermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\u201d President Trump\u2019s Executive Order also tasked federal agencies with combatting illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\n\nAt my direction, the FCC has already taken action to end its own promotion of DEI. As a next step, the FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act and the agency\u2019s EEO rules, including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination.\n\nI am starting this broader effort with Comcast and NBCUniversal for two reasons. First, as noted above, there is substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI. Second, your companies cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC\u2014from cable to high-speed Internet and from broadcast TV stations to MVNO wireless offerings. Therefore, I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\n\nAs Chairman of the FCC, it is important to me that the entities the Commission regulates fully adhere to the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations. In order to aid the FCC\u2019s investigation into these matters, please provide the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau with an accounting of Comcast\u2019s and NBCUniversal\u2019s DEI initiatives, preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities\u2014 including DEI activities that are ongoing but may be operating today under different labels. The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau will be following up with more specifics.\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation and attention to these important matters.\n\nSincerely, Brendan Carr",

But the case for bringing together different voices and perspectives, ensuring each team member is heard, and supporting those who need support, is as strong as ever.\n\n\u201cNowhere is this more true than in tech, where the tools of the future are being created. These tools must be shaped by all of us if they're to serve all of us.\u201d\n\nJoin the emPOWERED Network\n\nFollowing his appointment by President Trump, Carr has sought to route out DEI practices at the agency, seeking to purge the agency\u2019s related practices as part of a wider cost-cutting effort.\n\nCarr isn\u2019t alone in the DEI purge. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta have all scaled back projects and initiatives in the wake of Trump's election victory.\n\nEarlier this week, Google defended its purge of DEI initiatives, arguing that as a government contractor, it had to comply with orders on federal agencies and contractors to dismantle any DEI work.\n\nWhile some leaders are using the political shift to oust practices that don\u2019t align with their worldview, some are using it to shift DEI to a new concept: FAIR, which stands for Fairness, Access, Inclusion, and Representation.\n\nFAIR is a concept created by Lily Zheng, a leading diversity strategist. The idea is to replace jargon-heavy initiatives with diversity and inclusivity programmes that encourage change.\n\nBut as Jeffery-Morrison suggests, replacing one acronym for another is more akin to a \u201crebrand that distracts from what matters\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome might find a shiny new acronym helpful. But my view always has been that the most important thing is to focus on the practical steps that make a concrete difference for women in STEM, or women who want to work in STEM fields.\n\n\u201cWomen are underrepresented, often underpaid, and frequently overlooked in these fields, and that's true at every level. Those of us who recognise that this is bad for business and for wider society need to direct our energy and attention towards changing that.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n5 tech companies abandoning DE&I targets in 2025",

As the Supreme Court has written, the classifications drawn by extreme DEI policies stigmatize individuals by reason of a group identity and are, by their very definition, odious to a free people whose institutions are founded on a commitment to equality.\u201d\n\nThe FCC \u201cwill be taking steps to ensure that every company the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act and agency rules,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe are starting with Comcast for the reasons set forth in my letter.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the letter to Roberts, Carr said Comcast \u201cstates on its website that promoting DEI is \u2018a core value of our business\u2019 and public reports state that Comcast has an entire \u2018DEI infrastructure\u2019 that includes annual \u2018DEI day[s],\u2019 \u2018DEI training for company leaders,\u2019 and similar initiatives.

For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d\n\nCarr, who was named to head the FCC by Trump, also wrote, \u201cThankfully, President Trump has taken quick and decisive action to root out the scourge of DEI. Following President Trump\u2019s executive actions, we have ended the FCC\u2019s promotion of DEI.\u201d\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s election to the White House for a second term, multiple companies have scaled back or eliminated DEI initiatives. Those include Meta, Amazon, Google, PBS, Accenture, Walmart and McDonald\u2019s. On Tuesday, Disney told senior execs it was updating its DEI approach to replace the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d factor in its executive compensation program with a new \u201ctalent strategy\u201d performance factor (which assesses how leaders uphold company values, \u201cincorporate different perspectives to drive business success\u201d and cultivate an environment \u201cwhere all employees can thrive\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, from his perch at the FCC, Carr has also taken aim at \u201cmedia bias,\u201d including through an investigation into alleged \u201cnews distortion\u201d by CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview last October with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump is suing CBS over the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Harris interview, alleging the news program deceptively edited the video, and last week amended his lawsuit to demand damages of $20 billion.\n\nIn its 2024 proxy filing, Comcast says, \u201cWe embrace diversity of background, culture, skills and experience throughout our business. Our ongoing efforts in this regard are reviewed and discussed by our Board and/or its committees, our senior leadership teams, our rotating Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (\u2018DE&I\u2019) Employee Advisory Council and our external DE&I Advisory Council.\u201d\n\nComcast supports nine employee resource groups with approximately 36,000 members in 250 chapters that are \u201cvoluntary, employee-led organizations open to all across our business\u201d dedicated to developing the careers of our employees, contributing to community service and building on an inclusive and collaborative workplace and culture. In addition, the company offers a variety of training programs and initiatives focused on \u201ccreating a more inclusive workplace culture, including company-wide forums like our DE&I speaker series, along with an enterprise-wide learning catalog.\u201d\n\nRegarding NBCU, the Comcast proxy filing says, \u201cWe strive to have diverse perspectives that resonate with a wide range of audiences in our programming at NBCUniversal and in the content we distribute on our media platforms. Through our platforms, we share culturally representative stories and educate our viewers on diverse and inclusive cultures, perspectives and experiences, including through a vast ecosystem of diverse content on Xfinity (including curated On Demand destinations) and NBCUniversal\u2019s \u2018The More You Know\u2019 series of public service announcements.\u201d\n\n(Pictured above: FCC\u2019s Brendan Carr, Comcast\u2019s Brian Roberts)",

The Philadelphia cable and television giant said in a statement that it would be \u201ccooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.\u201d\n\nThe move comes less than a month after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr took the helm of the agency that oversees communications policy and broadcast licenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarr, who was elevated to the top role by President Trump, immediately dismantled the agency\u2019s DEI programs, pulling the plug on budget expenditures and staff members dedicated to promoting inclusion.\n\nIn a letter to Comcast Chairman Brian Roberts on Tuesday, Carr wrote that his goal was to \u201censure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\u201d\n\nThe landmark Communications Act and FCC rules forbid companies from \u201cdiscriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or gender,\u201d Carr reminded Roberts in the letter. The FCC chief acknowledged the probe was part of a broader effort to scrutinize workplace incentives within the companies he regulates to end \u201cthe scourge of DEI.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEliminating DEI efforts has been a top priority of the Trump administration. Trump has signed an executive order to demand merit-based opportunity across the private sector.\n\nThis week, Walt Disney Co. acknowledged softening some of its DEI policies, including retiring a \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d performance factor in its executive compensation calculations.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr, left, and FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, right, in a file photo. (Jonathan Newton / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FCC review is starting at Comcast.\n\nThe FCC has tremendous sway over Comcast\u2019s businesses, including the company\u2019s core cable and high-speed internet service, its wireless phone offerings and NBC-owned television stations, which require FCC licenses to operate. Carr said that was part of his motivation to start with Comcast and NBCUniversal.\n\n\u201cI expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates,\u201d Carr wrote.\n\nHollywood Inc. Disney softens DEI efforts with Trump back in office Walt Disney Co. said it would change an internal performance standard focused on diversity and inclusion for executive compensation, saying it would focus on how the initiatives helped the business.\n\nCarr took aim at Comcast\u2019s statements about its embrace of diversity programs.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is \u2018a core value of our business\u2019 and public reports state that Comcast has an entire \u2018DEI infrastructure\u2019 that includes annual \u2018DEI day[s],\u2019 \u2018DEI training for company leaders,\u2019 and similar initiatives,\u201d Carr wrote. \u201cNBCUniversal has similar DEI initiatives, including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\u201d\n\nComcast has a page on its website that outlines its philosophy on inclusion:\n\n\u201cWe believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company is a more innovative and successful one,\u201d the company said. \u201cAcross our workforce, products, and content, we embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture, and experience, and together with our partners, we are working to fight injustice against any race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, disability, or veteran status.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd in 2020, senior NBCUniversal executive Cesar Conde set a goal of having a 50% nonwhite workforce within NBC News.\n\n\u201cWe want to increase diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the camera, and earn the trust of every community in America that relies on us for exceptional journalism,\u201d Conde said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Carr revived complaints that alleged liberal media bias at CBS, NBC and ABC. Throughout the campaign, Trump railed against certain broadcasters, saying the FCC should yank their broadcast licenses.\n\nOne of the complaints targeted NBC for featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit four days before the November election, saying the network wasn\u2019t providing equal access to Trump. A second complaint took issue with ABC News\u2019 handling of the September Trump-Harris debate. Trump complained that ABC anchors were unfair to him.\n\nThe FCC inquiry has raised the stakes in a separate dispute between Trump and CBS. Trump and his supporters cried foul over the Harris \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in October, pointing to discrepancies between Harris\u2019 answers in the two interview segments. CBS has defended its edits, saying they routinely condense quotes.\n\nTrump has sued CBS for $20 billion. Paramount Global Chairwoman Shari Redstone has advocated settling the Trump lawsuit. The issue has clouded Paramount\u2019s proposed $8-billion sale to David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media firm, a deal that hinges on the approval of the FCC\u2019s Carr.",

The order calls for each federal agency to \"identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" among publicly traded companies, as well as nonprofits and other institutions.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican who was recently appointed by Trump, said he was starting his investigation with Comcast and NBCUniversal because they \"cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC.\"\n\n\"We have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\" a Comcast spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\"\n\nCarr said in the letter sent to Comcast that he was \"concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to say that \"Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is 'a core value of our business' and public reports state that Comcast has an entire 'DEI infrastructure' that includes annual 'DEI day[s],' 'DEI training for company leaders,' and similar initiatives.\" The letter says NBCUniversal has similar initiatives, \"including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\"\n\nLater on Wednesday, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks issued a statement condemning the investigation and requesting to receive more information. He noted that when Carr was a commissioner himself, he \"blasted the prior administration for acting in a way that 'gives the FCC a nearly limitless power to veto private sector decision.'\"\n\n\"From what I know this enforcement action is out of our lane and out of our reach.

            "content": "Brendan Carr, Donald Trump's pick to head the Federal Communications Commission, is investigating Comcast.\n\nCarr says he's concerned about Comcast's embrace of DEI.\n\nThis is just one of several media companies Trump and his administration have either sued or investigated.\n\nAfter this past fall's election, Brendan Carr \u2014 Donald Trump's choice to head the Federal Communications Commission \u2014 said he'd be going after big media companies.\n\nHe is keeping his word.\n\nOn Tuesday, Carr told Comcast \u2014 the giant cable and broadband company that also owns media properties including NBC, Peacock, and the Universal film and TV studio \u2014 that he's going to start investigating the company to make sure it's not promoting \"discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\"\n\nWe can get back to Carr's letter in a minute. But the big picture here is most important: In the fall, Carr, who at the time was an FCC commissioner, announced that he'd be scrutinizing big media companies once he started running the agency.\n\nNow he's doing that.\n\nEarlier this month, his agency compelled CBS to hand over transcripts and video from a \"60 Minutes\" interview it ran with Kamala Harris in October, ostensibly because it's concerned about \"news distortion.\" This is the same interview that's the focus of a lawsuit Donald Trump filed against CBS's owner, Paramount, which Paramount is now trying to settle. That lawsuit is theoretically separate from the FCC approval Paramount's owner, Shari Redstone, needs to sell her company to David and Larry Ellison. In the real world, the two seem very intertwined.\n\nNow Carr has added Comcast to the list of big media companies that need scrutiny. It's worth noting that Trump, while a private citizen, already went after Disney, via a lawsuit he filed last year \u2014 and got Disney to settle once he'd been elected. At this point, the only media company I'd be surprised to see Trump and his administration target would be Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp., which owns Fox News, Trump's favorite channel.\n\nIn theory, Carr is scrutinizing Comcast because he thinks it may be violating civil rights laws as \"there is substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI,\" the letter he sent to Comcast this week said. (I've asked Carr for comment, as well as the full text of the note, which was summarized by Newsmax.)\n\nWhy does the head of the FCC, which is supposed to enforce communications law, get to weigh in on whether a media conglomerate does or doesn't promote diversity, equity, and inclusion? Carr has an answer: The FCC has oversight of several of Comcast's businesses, from \"cable to high-speed internet and from broadcast TV stations\" to \"wireless offerings.\" (Carr did not mention Comcast's plan to spin off most of its cable networks, which shouldn't require FCC approval \u2014 but could conceivably get held up by a different Trump-appointed regulator.)\n\nIn theory, this may be connected to a Trump executive order instructing his agencies \"to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences,\" and for each agency to find \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" at places like publicly traded companies, nonprofits, and colleges. (Last week, on her first day on the job, US Attorney General Pam Bondi put her office to work on the same task and said she would also look at \"criminal investigations\" to stop DEI.)\n\nIn a statement, Comcast acknowledged it received Carr's letter and said it \"will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\" adding: \"For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\"\n\nBut it would be naive to think that Carr is going after Comcast because he has a problem with the company's HR practices alone.\n\nRight before the election, for instance, Carr was complaining about the way Comcast's \"Saturday Night Live\" used Kamala Harris in a cameo, which he said violated the agency's \"equal time\" rules. Carr said that could conceivably put the broadcast licenses Comcast owns at risk: \"In my view, every single remedy needs to be on the table, at least as an initial matter.\"\n\nIn other words, there seem to be lots of things a big media company can do that will earn the ire of the Trump administration. Maybe it's an interview. Maybe it's a comedy skit. Maybe it's the way they hire and promote people.\n\nAnd if you're worried that the next thing you do could upset the president of the United States, maybe you'll think carefully before you do that thing. No matter what it is. Which seems to be the point.",

Indeed, the FCC\u2019s longstanding Equal Employment Opportunity or EEO rules set forth specific requirements that both Comcast and NBCUniversal must adhere to.\u201d\n\nIn what seems to be an emerging practice at the agency, the FCC did not immediately make the documents easily findable or available on its public website. Instead, Carr posted the letter and details about the investigation on X.\n\nYesterday, I wrote Comcast\u2019s CEO Brian Roberts to let him know that I\u2019ve asked the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to open an investigation into Comcast & NBCUniversal.I am concerned that his companies may be promoting invidious forms of DEI that do not comply with FCC regulations &\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MM4soFprrxFebruary 12, 2025\n\nIn the letter to Roberts, Carr referenced Trump\u2019s executive orders banning DEI efforts at federal agencies.\n\n\u201cAt my direction, the FCC has already taken action to end its own promotion of DEI,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a next step, the FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act and the agency\u2019s EEO rules, including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination.\u201d\n\nCarr added: \u201cI am starting this broader effort with Comcast and NBCUniversal for two reasons. First, as noted above, there is substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI. Second, your companies cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC\u2014from cable to high-speed Internet and from broadcast TV stations to MVNO wireless offerings. Therefore, I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\n\n\u201cAs chairman of the FCC, it is important to me that the entities the Commission regulates fully adhere to the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn order to aid the FCC\u2019s investigation into these matters, please provide the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau with an accounting of Comcast\u2019s and NBCUniversal\u2019s DEI initiatives, preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities\u2014including DEI activities that are ongoing but may be operating today under different labels.

            "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the media and entertainment sector has turned its attention on Comcast.\n\nThe media conglomerate has confirmed that Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr has notified Comcast in writing that his agency is to investigate the company\u2019s DEI practices. \u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\u201d a Comcast spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday in a statement.\n\nComcast on its corporate website says of its DEI initiatives: \u201cWe believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company is a more innovative and successful one. Across our workforce, products, and content, we embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture, and experience, and together with our partners, we are working to fight injustice against any race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, disability, or veteran status.\u201d\n\nThe pressure from the U.S. government to end diversity programs has prompted several companies to retreat from efforts to boost inclusion from underrepresented communities in their ranks. To fall into line with a new FCC policy to rein in media and entertainment companies, Disney in a regulatory filing said it has scrubbed references to its \u201cReimagine Tomorrow\u201d initiative, which launched in 2021 with the purpose of amplifying underrepresented voices.\n\nAnd PBS, which faces its own investigation by the FCC, has closed its DEI office to comply with a recent executive order from President Donald Trump. \u201cIn order to best ensure we are in compliance with the President\u2019s executive order around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion we have closed our DEI office. The staff members who served in that office are leaving PBS,\u201d read a statement from a PBS rep on Feb. 10.\n\nFCC Chair Carr, a Trump appointee, has said he will investigate PBS and NPR, which both receive government funding, to see if government rules around the naming of financial sponsors on the air has been violated.\n\nAnd in January, a day after Trump\u2019s executive order titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\u201d Carr directed the FCC to end its own DEI effort. \u201cPromoting invidious forms of discrimination runs contrary to the Communications Act and deprives Americans of their rights to fair and equal treatment under the law. It also represents a wasteful expenditure of taxpayer resources,\u201d he wrote in a statement.\n\nCarr\u2019s letter to Comcast chair and CEO Brian Roberts follows:\n\nDear Mr. Roberts,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I have asked the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to open an investigation into Comcast and NBCUniversal. In particular, I want to ensure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\n\nAs you know, the Communications Act and Commission rules prohibit regulated entities\u2014like Comcast and NBCUniversal\u2014from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or gender.1 Indeed, the FCC\u2019s longstanding Equal Employment Opportunity or EEO rules set forth specific requirements that both Comcast and NBCUniversal must adhere to.\n\nNonetheless, I am concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations. For instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is \u201ca core value of our business\u201d and public reports state that Comcast has an entire \u201cDEI infrastructure\u201d that includes annual \u201cDEI day[s],\u201d \u201cDEI training for company leaders,\u201d and similar initiatives. NBCUniversal has similar DEI initiatives, including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\n\nBut promoting invidious forms of discrimination cannot be squared with any reasonable interpretation of federal law. It can only deprive Americans of their rights to fair and equal treatment under the law.\n\nDespite the emergence of DEI initiatives in recent years, these forms of discrimination have long been condemned by America\u2019s civil rights laws. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c\u2018[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\u2019\u201d Likewise, the Supreme Court has written that racial classifications \u201cthreaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.\u201d For this reason, the Supreme Court has stated that, in the government context, \u201caction based on race\u2014a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\u2014 should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump took quick and decisive action to root out the scourge of DEI. In his first week in office, President Trump issued an Executive Order that will end the radical and wasteful DEI programs that have spread across the federal government.\n\nLikewise, President Trump issued an Executive Order to end illegal discrimination and restore merit-based opportunity across the private sector.6 In that latter Executive Order, President Trump wrote that illegal DEI policies \u201cundermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\u201d President Trump\u2019s Executive Order also tasked federal agencies with combatting illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\n\nAt my direction, the FCC has already taken action to end its own promotion of DEI. As a next step, the FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act and the agency\u2019s EEO rules, including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination.\n\nI am starting this broader effort with Comcast and NBCUniversal for two reasons. First, as noted above, there is substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI. Second, your companies cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC\u2014from cable to high-speed Internet and from broadcast TV stations to MVNO wireless offerings. Therefore, I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the Commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\n\nAs Chairman of the FCC, it is important to me that the entities the Commission regulates fully adhere to the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations. In order to aid the FCC\u2019s investigation into these matters, please provide the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau with an accounting of Comcast\u2019s and NBCUniversal\u2019s DEI initiatives, preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities\u2014 including DEI activities that are ongoing but may be operating today under different labels. The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau will be following up with more specifics.\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation and attention to these important matters.\n\nSincerely, Brendan Carr",

In particular, I want to ensure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\"\n\nComcast told Fierce in an emailed statement: \u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d\n\nIn a note on Wednesday morning, Blair Levin of New Street Research listed a number of investigations launched by Carr since he took the chairman post: Disney, NPR, PBS, and the so-called \"tech censorship cartel.\" Of these, Levin noted that while Carr is asserting his investigatory powers in a variety of circumstances, so far, \"it has not resulted in anything resembling a legal case.\"\n\nThe telecommunications industry has long promoted DEI initiatives to increase innovation and recruit a diverse workforce so that it could compete against hyperscalers and their fast-moving, Silicon Valley-like culture club \u2014 which was more attractive to younger workers starting out in their careers.\n\nWith approximately 200,000 workers needed to deliver broadband across the U.S., and a growing skills gap in fields like fiber technicians, cyber security, tower climbers, customer service and construction, DEI is an integral part of the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. It\u2019s right there in the name, New Street Research\u2019s Blair Levin told Fierce Network last week.\n\nAs Fierce reported then, federal efforts to slash DEI initiatives come as the broadband industry braces for a worker shortage ahead of BEAD rollouts. A study commissioned by the Fiber Broadband Association warned of an expected shortage of 28,000 workers on the construction side and 30,000 on the technician side between now and 2030.\n\nRelated Some Republican senators are concerned about a pause to BEAD\n\nComcast's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion webpage reads, \"We believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company is a more innovative and successful one. Across our workforce, products, and content, we embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture, and experience, and together with our partners, we are working to fight injustice against any race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, disability, or veteran status.\"\n\nFierce reached out to AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile last month asking if they planned to change their DEI policies at the start of the Trump 2.0 administration. An AT&T spokesman said there was no plan to change their policy. Neither Verizon nor T-Mobile responded.\n\nLast year during a panel discussion hosted by Fast Company, Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said focusing on diversity is \u201ccommon sense\u201d as a business decision. Nearly 60% of Verizon\u2019s U.S. workforce are women or people of color, a share that\u2019s held fairly steady since at least 2016, when the mobile carrier devoted a section of its website to the company\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts, the publication reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stronger when we embrace diversity,\u201d T-Mobile states on its website, noting that 63% of T-Mobile U.S. employees identify as members of traditionally underrepresented racial or ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we believe that inclusivity fuels creativity, drives innovation, and strengthens our connection to the communities we serve,\u201d AT&T states on its website.\n\nThis story was updated on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025, at 9:29 AM ET, to include information from Blair Levin's research note.",

Tuning first to the Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers, the current reading is neutral at 5.73, but just below the bearish zone that starts at 6.00. Two weeks ago, the reading was a more-worrisome 10.25. The bouncy one-week data has left the broader Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio at 5.37 and in a neutral range that runs from 2.00 to 6.00; the reading has sported a 'five handle' since November. On an exchange basis, the current NYSE one-week ratio is 4.57 and has been moving from neutral to slightly bearish for over a month, resulting in a softly improving eight-week reading (currently neutral at 4.37). The Nasdaq has been the problem child of late, but the current one-week reading is 6.53 and has been stable for two weeks after hitting a troubling 14.06 two weeks ago and 15.57 two weeks before that. The eight-week reading currently at 6.50 and has been flat for three weeks. End of day, current insider sentiment is not worrisome but neither is it optimistic. More-meaningful signals may well develop as earnings season ends and insider-transaction volume returns to normal levels.

Comcast\u2019s wireless phone and cable TV services are also regulated as public utilities.\n\n\u201cI expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the commission\u2019s broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates,\u201d Carr wrote in his letter.\n\nCarr noted that Comcast\u2019s website continues to promote DEI initiatives throughout its company, from new employee hiring to worker training \u2014 and even the programming carried on Comcast\u2019s cable TV and streaming services.\n\nOn a corporate website reviewed by The Desk, Comcast said it aims to \u201cinfuse diversity and inclusion (D&I) into all aspects of our culture and our business,\u201d adding that \u201cD&I is not a program \u2014 it is a central element of our credo and our DNA.\u201d\n\nComcast said it spent $18 billion with \u201cdiverse Tier 1 suppliers\u201d since 2010, offers more than 100 \u201cdiverse networks on Xfinity platforms\u201d and has over 18,000 hours of \u201cdiverse on-demand and online programming\u201d offered since 2018.\n\nWith respect to its corporate operations, Comcast said its DEI initiatives permeate across its employment and culture. In an equity report reviewed by The Desk, Comcast said its total workforce was 37 percent female as of 2023. Nearly one out of every two employees at Comcast was a person of color, and 16 percent of employees identify as Black or African-American, the report said.\n\nAmong its executive leaders, Comcast said 38 percent are women, 23 percent are people of Color and nearly 2 percent identify as mixed race. At NBC Universal, 55 percent of its on-air news talent are women and 52 percent are people of color, while 52 percent of people who work in behind the scenes roles within Comcast\u2019s newsrooms are women and 39 percent are people of color.\n\nComcast\u2019s diversity report showed year-over gains across all above-mentioned categories in the period between 2021 and 2023.\n\nCarr noted the uptick in DEI-related hires and promotions in his letter on Tuesday, saying Comcast\u2019s initiatives included executive roles that were \u201cspecifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut promoting invidious forms of discrimination cannot be squared with any reasonable interpretation of federal law,\u201d he concluded.\n\nA Comcast spokesperson affirmed the company received Carr\u2019s letter and intends to cooperate in the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email to The Desk on Tuesday. \u201cFor decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d\n\nThe letter, first reported by Newsmax, comes at a time when the FCC, under Carr\u2019s leadership, has taken a critical look at the role of broadcasters and public utilities since President Donald Trump was sworn into a second, non-consecutive term in office last month. Carr, who was appointed as a commissioner during Trump\u2019s first term, was immediately promoted to serve as the chairman of the agency.\n\nEarlier this month, Carr re-opened investigations against a local Comcast-owned TV station in New York, WNBC (Channel 4), for alleged election-related interference, as well as two similar investigations against a Disney-owned ABC station in Philadelphia and a Paramount-owned CBS station in New York along similar political lines.\n\nIn news interviews, Carr posited those investigations and others as necessary to enforce the FCC\u2019s broadcast and public utility regulations, and suggested that some broadcasters may lose their license to transmit on public air waves if they are found to violate the FCC\u2019s rules.\n\nTrump has been an ardent opponent of DEI initiatives, signing numerous executive orders over the past few weeks that have led federal agencies to wind down DEI programs and lay off thousands of workers.\n\nSome private sector groups have also walked back DEI initiatives, fearing retaliation from the Trump administration if they do not do so. Earlier this week, PBS said it was closing down a unit dedicated to DEI initiatives, with two employees leaving the organization. Paula Kerger, the CEO of PBS, specifically cited Trump\u2019s executive orders on DEI as the reason for the decision.",

The company\u2019s delivery business benefits from robust online order volumes. The company\u2019s efforts to expand its delivery operations through successive acquisitions are encouraging. Continued recovery in Mobility operations is also aiding the company. Apart from the recovery in Mobility operations and solid performance of the Delivery unit, Uber's focus on financial discipline is encouraging as well. For first-quarter 2025, adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $1.79 billion and $1.89 billion. Despite the positives, the Zacks analyst advised investors not to buy Uber now as it continues to witness high costs and expenses, owing to a rise in sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenues. High debt levels are bothersome as well. We advise investors to wait for a better entry point.

The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Comcast benefited from growing domestic wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 holds promise. The technology will expand it much faster and at a lower cost compared with its competitors. Decreasing marketing and promotional expenses bode well for CMCSA's profitability.\n\n\n\nIts streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Recovery in the theme park and movie business bodes well for bottom line growth. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\n\nShares of Gilead have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+38.2% vs. -7.0%). The company\u2019s flagship HIV therapy, Biktarvy, continues to maintain its strong growth, fueling the top line. The company\u2019s efforts to develop better HIV treatments are commendable. Recent data validate lenacapavir\u2019s potential to prevent HIV.\n\n\n\nThe successful development and approval of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV should be a significant boost for Gilead, given its advantages over existing treatments. Strong quarterly results and encouraging data on lenacapavir data.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Zacks analyst, estimated sales for Biktarvy indicate a CAGR of around 5.8% over the next three years. Gilead's efforts to bolster its oncology and virology franchises through internal pipeline development and collaborations are impressive as well. However, recent pipeline setbacks weigh on the stock.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Gilead here >>>)\n\nOnfolio\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+164.5% vs. +38.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $6.51 million have seen revenues jumped 53% year over year, driven by acquisitions like RevenueZen and DDS Rank. Operational efficiency improved, with cash burn declining 68% year over year.\n\n\n\nThe Eastern Standard acquisition boosted digital marketing. Intangible assets grew 31% year over year, supporting recurring revenues. Operating in high-growth digital sectors, Onfolio benefits from regulatory exemptions and a flexible capital structure for M&A.\n\n\n\nHowever, net losses reached $1.91 million in the first nine months of 2024, with rising selling, general and administrative expenses pressuring margins. Liquidity remains tight, with cash declining 63% year to date and debt rising to $4.39 million. High amortization and impairment risks threaten earnings, while weak organic growth and potential compliance costs post-emerging growth status add concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Onfolio here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

If you think this article succeeded, please consider supporting our mission and making more stories like this one possible.\n\n\n\nNew York is an incongruous state. We\u2019re home to fabulous wealth \u2014 if the state were a country, it would have the tenth largest economy in the world \u2014 but also the highest rate of wealth inequality. We\u2019re among the most diverse \u2013 but also the most segregated. We passed the nation\u2019s most ambitious climate law \u2014 but haven\u2019t been meeting its deadlines and continue to subsidize industries hastening the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nAs New York\u2019s only statewide nonprofit news publication, our journalism exists to help you make sense of these contradictions. Our work scrutinizes how power works in the state, unpacks who\u2019s really calling the shots, and reveals how obscure decisions shape ordinary New Yorkers\u2019 lives.\n\n\n\nIn the last two decades, the number of local news outlets in New York have been nearly slashed in half, allowing elected officials and powerful individuals to increasingly operate in the dark \u2014 with the average New Yorker none the wiser.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re on a mission to change that. Our work has already shown what can happen when those with power know that someone is watching, with stories that have prompted policy changes and spurred legislation. We have ambitious plans for the rest of the year and beyond, including tackling new beats and more hard-hitting stories \u2014 but we need your help to make them a reality.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re able, please consider supporting our journalism with a one-time gift or a monthly gift. We can't do this work without you.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

            "content": "In the last year, many Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Comcast\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman & CEO, Brian Roberts, sold US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$42.80 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$34.37. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.\n\nIn the last year Comcast insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Insider Trading Volume February 9th 2025\n\nI will like Comcast better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nComcast Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Comcast. Specifically, insiders ditched US$21m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$1.2b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Comcast Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Comcast makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Comcast. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Comcast you should be aware of, and 1 of these shouldn't be ignored.",

            "content": "Regarding football traditions, few statements capture the glory days like this: three yards and a cloud of dust. For a quick rundown for anyone unfamiliar with the sport, each team has four attempts or downs to reach 10 yards before they turn control of the ball to the opposing team.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a reason why you play the game \u2014 anything can happen. Here\u2019s the other big matchup breakdown ahead of the enticing Super Bowl showdown set to take place on Sunday night in the U.S.\n\nOn the other hand, Kansas City-based AMC Entertainment plays the role of a scrappy underdog who\u2019s already won some titles. AMC has become a movie theater dominator, stomping in with the largest foot span in the U.S. and the world, with approximately 900 theatres and 10,000 screens worldwide. It\u2019s ironic because AMC stock is trading like how the Chiefs played back several years before the Mahomes era, as in very poorly. Now, shares trade hands for around three bucks, with a market cap of around $1.3 billion.\n\nFor Wall St. analysts focusing on the entertainment sector, the Philadelphia-based Comcast owns practically all the bragging rights. With a market capitalization north of $130 billion, Comcast is a bona-fide media powerhouse. The company\u2019s massive footprint encompasses media channels, broadband communications, and theme parks.\n\nSports commentators unanimously agree that the Chiefs are the favorites and wield a grander footprint in the NFL than the Eagles. However, the roles are reversed when we turn the page to Wall Street as a giant headquartered in Philly (Comcast) stands tall over a rambunctious up-and-comer headquartered in Kansas (AMC).\n\nLed by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs represent a dynasty in the making, the juggernaut that no one enjoys matching up against. On the opposing side, the Philadelphia Eagles provide more than enough competence through Jalen Hurts. However, they haven\u2019t quite reached the same level of sustained brilliance.\n\nSuper Bowl LIX is almost here. On Sunday night at the iconic Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs will clash in the 59th rendition of America\u2019s most popular sports event. But two other giants from these two great cities are already clashing on Wall St: Comcast (CMCSA) and AMC Entertainment (AMC).\n\nStory Continues\n\nA team can quickly eat up the game clock by running for three yards at a time. In addition, one yard isn\u2019t a big risk for a fourth-down conversion (especially if you\u2019re consistently pushing the opposing defense by multiple yards). It\u2019s boring and unimaginative, yet feeding the running back from the I-formation with the ball can yield significant long-term rewards (as in winning games and, ultimately, championships).\n\nThat\u2019s essentially the Comcast story. By no means does it offer an exciting narrative. However, there\u2019s beauty in its predictability, much like a running back just driving his legs for a few yards. Those yards can mean the difference between winning and losing. In the case of Comcast, it broke the plane for a big fourth-quarter earnings beat.\n\nAdjusted for non-recurring items, the media giant posted earnings per share of 96 cents, beating the consensus view of 86 cents. On the top line, revenue rose 2% to $31.92 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 target of $31.64 billion.\n\nGraph showing Comcast (CMCSA) valuation metrics.\n\nHowever, the predictability of Philadelphia\u2019s Comcast also makes it one-dimensional. It will probably get those three yards, but that\u2019s about the best to be hoped for. In fact, analysts are calling for FY2025 sales to land at $122.6 billion, which would be almost 1% down from last year\u2019s tally of $123.7 billion.\n\nSo, why bother with CMCSA stock? It\u2019s reliable, predictable, and offers a dividend yield of 3.74%. Plus, with a price-to-sales ratio of only 1.05 times trailing-year revenue, Comcast could be an attractive deal.\n\nIs Comcast Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, CMCSA stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buy, 11 Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average CMCSA price target is $43.08 per share, implying a 28.41% upside potential.\n\nBased on 22 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Comcast in the last 3 months. The average price target is $43.08 with a high forecast of $58.00 and a low forecast of $35.00. The average price target represents a 24.98% change from the last price of $34.47.\n\nAMC Entertainment: The Immaculate Investment?\n\nIn football lore, the \u201cImmaculate Reception\u201d is one of the most miraculous, game-changing plays of all time \u2014 a bizarre deflection turned what was indeed a Steelers loss into an iconic victory. In the investing world, AMC Entertainment offers some parallels.\n\nBack during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, AMC was left for dead. Frankly, it would not have surprised anyone to see the enterprise crumble. At the time, no one was going to movie theaters due to the severe public health risks. However, the worst possible event \u2014 a raging global pandemic \u2014 turned AMC into an iconic meme stock, thus representing a symbol of market defiance.\n\nStill, you shouldn\u2019t get too ahead of yourself. AMC is very much what most people would regard as a penny stock. Moreover, it\u2019s a poorly performing one, with shares down almost 21% year-to-date. Backed up into their endzone, circumstances don\u2019t seem particularly auspicious for the Cineplex operator.\n\nChart showing AMC Entertainment (AMC) valuation metrics\n\nIt\u2019s all in the numbers. For FY2024, analysts are projecting sales of only $4.6 billion, implying a loss of around 4% against the prior year\u2019s result. For FY2025, sales could rise to $5.1 billion, up modestly from 2023\u2019s haul of $4.8 billion. On paper, the security is super-cheap, trading at 0.22x trailing-year revenue. Despite this valuation, it suffers from significant bouts of volatility.\n\nNevertheless, AMC stock attracts attention because it\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s version of the razzle-dazzle or the trick play. For example, a flea flicker can be good for a dramatic score if the offense catches the opposing secondary snoozing. An excellent parallel is the high short interest against AMC.\n\nCurrently, 11.41% of the equity\u2019s float is held short. If AMC stock suddenly rises, overexposed short traders may be forced to cover their positions. Covering a short involves buying the target security, which could create an upward panic.\n\nHowever, if the defense is disciplined, a flea flicker might send the quarterback to the hospital. It\u2019s a stock to be traded sparingly, if at all.\n\nIs AMC a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, AMC stock has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buy, four Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average AMC price target is $3.63 per share, implying a 17.10% upside potential.\n\nBased on 4 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for AMC Entertainment in the last 3 months. The average price target is $3.63 with a high forecast of $4.00 and a low forecast of $3.25. The average price target represents a 17.10% change from the last price of $3.10.\n\nAMC for the Thrill, Comcast for the Win\n\nSometimes, you need a quick score \u2014 and AMC stock offers the mobility necessary to get into position. Unfortunately, the issue with the Cineplex operator is that it\u2019s not consistently reliable. The razzle-dazzle might work for one play, but it cannot be the staple of a title-winning team.\n\nIn contrast, what Comcast lacks in pizzazz, it more than makes up for with its consistency. While you\u2019re not going to see CMCSA beat the free safety for a 70-yard touchdown reception, it will be bulldozing defensive linemen for a few yards here or there. Those yards throughout the season can lead to a championship, maybe even a dynasty.\n\nDisclosure.",

            "content": "Because this is how the great minds work over in the Grading The Week offices, the scrum between Kroenke Sports & Entertainment and Comcast always reminded us a little of this old Bugs Bunny routine.\n\nIn this particular gag, our man Bugs is getting Yosemite Sam all worked up again. The long-eared galoot draws a line in the sand and dares Sam to cross it. Sam does. He does it again. Sam crosses it again. Bugs keeps drawing lines and backpedaling out of town, through the desert southwest, and eventually up a slope. Eventually, Bugs draws a line that will clearly leave Sam\u2019s right foot dangling over a cliff and send him careening from great cartoon heights into a deep gorge below. Sam crosses the line anyway and, sure enough, falls.\n\nSix years ago, KSE said that it was balking at Comcast\u2019s attempts to move it to a separate, premium sports-related tier and away from the basic cable package to which it had so long been stationed.\n\nFive years ago, same line. Same complaint. Four years ago, same line. Same complaint.\n\nThen three years. Then two.\n\nThis past Tuesday, Altitude held a news conference to triumphantly announce its return to Xfinity customers \u2014 on a separate, premium, sports-related tier. Sam crossed that line after all.\n\nKSE-Comcast dispute finally ending \u2014 A-minus\n\nNow it\u2019s not a letter-perfect comparison, and any deal that makes the best two teams in town \u2014 the Nuggets and Avalanche \u2014 available to a majority of Front Range television homes is better than no deal.\n\nAlthough, did we mention that all sides also announced, as part of the agreement, that the said separate, premium sports-related tier, was increasing in price in April from $9.99 per month to $15.95? Just in time for the playoffs.\n\nThe RSN model is fading, yet the over-the-air ratings for the Nuggets and Avs were reportedly solid enough to keep Comcast at the bargaining table. These are good things. But to the scorekeepers in the GTW crew, there was only one winner in the Altitude-vs-Comcast standoff, ultimately \u2014 and it was the latter. By a nose.\n\nSadly, the victory was largely symbolic. Because there was a heck of a lot of losers. Denver fans, some of whom missed one of the greatest seasons in Nuggets history (\u201922-23) and the Avs\u2019 first title-winning team (\u201921-22) in roughly two decades, were chief among them.\n\nNecas vs. Mikko \u2014 B\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to the biggest trade of the winter, the deal that sent Avalanche star Mikko Rantanen to Carolina, the only fair judgment will come after the Stanley Cup Playoffs for both Colorado and the Hurricanes. That said, Team GTW can\u2019t deny that the cat-quick, 26-year-old Necas has come out of the gate faster than the Moose in his new digs. From Jan. 31-Feb. 7, the new Avs forward piled up four goals and an assist in five games \u2014 and the burgundy and blue won four of those five heading into the 4 Nations break. Rantanen, meanwhile, put up a goal and two points over his first six games since joining Carolina. And the \u2018Canes, as of Saturday morning, were 2-4 since the trade. Time will tell, but maybe there\u2019s something to this whole \u201cNathan MacKinnon Effect\u201d after all.\n\nCalvin Booth \u2014 D\n\nThe trade deadline came. The trade deadline went. Zeke Nnaji and Dario Saric are still here. The Nuggets general manager threw his bench under the bus. He threw their contracts under the bus. But how come he didn\u2019t find room under said bus for the guy who gave out those deals to begin with? Booth caught lightning in a bottle in helping the Nuggets win their first NBA championship two years ago. Too bad he never found a cork.",

But after a 1,984-day impasse that blacked out two championship runs and morphed into a national referendum on cable TV tiers, the deadlock ended when cooler (or newer) heads prevailed.\n\nJust under a year ago, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment asked Kevin Demoff, newly appointed president of team and media operations, and Steve Smith, president of KSE Media Ventures, to reconcile an irreconcilable relationship \u2014 complete with antitrust lawsuits and corporate finger-pointing. With Comcast ensconced in roughly 75% of area homes and the Avalanche and Nuggets winning roughly 75% of their games in their championship seasons of 2022 and 2023, fans were actually losing amid all the confetti.\n\nSaid KSE\u2019s Kevin Demoff: \u201cIt was probably time heals most wounds.\u201d Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nThat led to give and take \u2014 from both sides \u2014 that could be a template for solving future cable riffs. \u201cThere was probably a general thawing of the relationship that started pretty much a year ago when Steve and I took our new roles,\u201d Demoff said. \u201cI expected it to be so much quicker than it was, and maybe that\u2019s my unrealistic, non-media hat. But it was good to push across. I think it was probably time heals most wounds.\u201d\n\nTime and the 21st century local TV landscape. To work around the impasse this season, KSE had launched Altitude+ for streamers and placed 20 Avalanche and Nuggets games apiece on over-the-air KUSA Channel 9 and KTVD Channel 20. Ratings exceeded projections, which possibly got Comcast\u2019s attention.\n\nAlways preferring to make a deal, Demoff said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we were accepting our fate a little bit, but we had the understanding we weren\u2019t going to get back to where we were when we left Comcast in 2019.\u201d So he and KSE gave in, conceptually, by allowing Comcast to place Altitude on its premium \u201cMore Sports and Entertainment\u201d tier as an add-on package for $15.95, starting April 8. In addition, Comcast subscribers would gain access to Altitude+ without paying Altitude\u2019s $19.95 monthly streaming subscription.\n\nIn return, Comcast would still be paying a premium price for content that was no longer exclusive \u2014 a channel it would have to share two times a week with local TV and also with streamers. Altitude, cognizant of growing their fan base in Denver and throughout the region, also insisted on expanded distribution into New Mexico, Kansas and Arizona, especially since the Coyotes have left Phoenix. In concert with the NBA and NHL, Comcast acquiesced, and, with all those elements combined, they struck a deal.\n\nWith the Avalanche and Nuggets currently in fourth place in their respective conferences, virtually guaranteeing playoff runs, the timing is prescient.\n\n\u201cThe Avalanche lost our first game back on Comcast Tuesday night \u2014 so maybe not the debut I\u2019d been hoping for after all that,\u201d Demoff said. \u201cBut people can watch now, and I think that\u2019s a great first step. It might be more relief than euphoria, but we\u2019ll take whatever emotions come with it.\u201d",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD), as well as a micro-cap stock Onfolio Holdings, Inc. (ONFO). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company\u2019s delivery business benefits from robust online order volumes. The company\u2019s efforts to expand its delivery operations through successive acquisitions are encouraging. Continued recovery in Mobility operations is also aiding the company.\n\n\n\nApart from the recovery in Mobility operations and solid performance of the Delivery unit, Uber's focus on financial discipline is encouraging as well. For first-quarter 2025, adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $1.79 billion and $1.89 billion.\n\n\n\nDespite the positives, the Zacks analyst advise investors not to buy Uber now as it continues to witness high costs and expenses, owing to a rise in sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenues. High debt levels are bothersome as well. We advise investors to wait for a better entry point. Our thesis is supported by our Neutral recommendation on the shares.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Uber here >>>)\n\n\n\nComcast\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (-13.8% vs. -7.6%). The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Comcast benefited from growing domestic wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 holds promise. The technology will expand it much faster and at a lower cost compared with its competitors. Decreasing marketing and promotional expenses bode well for CMCSA's profitability.\n\n\n\nIts streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Recovery in the theme park and movie business bodes well for bottom line growth. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Gilead have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+38.2% vs. -7.0%). The company\u2019s flagship HIV therapy, Biktarvy, continues to maintain its strong growth, fueling the top line. The company\u2019s efforts to develop better HIV treatments are commendable. Recent data validate lenacapavir\u2019s potential to prevent HIV.\n\n\n\nThe successful development and approval of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV should be a significant boost for Gilead, given its advantages over existing treatments. Strong quarterly results and encouraging data on lenacapavir data.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Zacks analyst estimates sales for Biktarvy indicate a CAGR of around 5.8% over the next three years. Gilead's efforts to bolster its oncology and virology franchises through internal pipeline development and collaborations are impressive as well. However, recent pipeline setbacks weigh on the stock.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Gilead here >>>)\n\n\n\nOnfolio\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+164.5% vs. +38.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $6.51 million have seen revenues jumped 53% year over year, driven by acquisitions like RevenueZen and DDS Rank. Operational efficiency improved, with cash burn declining 68% year over year.\n\n\n\nThe Eastern Standard acquisition boosted digital marketing. Intangible assets grew 31% year over year, supporting recurring revenues. Operating in high-growth digital sectors, Onfolio benefits from regulatory exemptions and a flexible capital structure for M&A.\n\n\n\nHowever, net losses reached $1.91 million in the first nine months of 2024, with rising selling, general and administrative expenses pressuring margins. Liquidity remains tight, with cash declining 63% year to date and debt rising to $4.39 million. High amortization and impairment risks threaten earnings, while weak organic growth and potential compliance costs post-emerging growth status add concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Onfolio here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Northrop Grumman Corp.

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

Additionally, the game will be available in its entirety on the Tubi app. However, Comcast\u2019s inclusion of Dolby Atmos sound may offer a more immersive viewing experience for fans with the right equipment.\n\nLocal Sports Partnerships in Denver\n\nComcast also made waves in Denver, where it struck a deal with Altitude Sports to bring back Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche games to Comcast subscribers.

This sponsorship comes at a timely moment as NASCAR\u2019s Cook Out Clash has already kicked off, and the Daytona 500 is just around the corner.\n\nNew Features: Comcast will introduce the \u201cXfinity Fastest Lap\u201d initiative, awarding points to the driver with the fastest lap time during each race, adding a new layer of excitement for fans.\n\nIs Comcast Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nComcast stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, with 11 Buy ratings and 11 Hold ratings over the past three months.

Inspired by his upbringing and relationship with his father, he is committed to fostering a sense of community and a responsibility for giving back. Learn more about Oluseyi in the interview below.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your role as a Director of Product Management at Comcast?\n\nMy current role is the most exciting product manager role that I\u2019ve had because I get to leverage AI for entertainment experiences like Sports Highlights \u2013 which detects major plays in a game and enables fans to catch highlights they\u2019ve missed, Smart Resume, and other features of Xfinity\u2019s X1 Platform. Every day is different, from managing stakeholders to delivering presentations to conducting sales. Then there are times when I\u2019m doing more product management \u2013 conducting research, making sure the team is meeting organization goals, and figuring out how to create all-new experiences.\n\nAs part of leading VideoAI product management, my responsibilities also extend beyond sports and entertainment. I get to work on the commercialization of our technologies externally through Comcast Technology Solutions and collaborate closely with Sky and NBCUniversal on AI-powered interactive and advertising opportunities.\n\nYou were recently featured in Comcast\u2019s \u201cDesigned with Love\u201d campaign. How did that opportunity come about?\n\nWhen we were rolling out Sports Highlights for the Men\u2019s World Cup, my dad was visiting from Nigeria. He doesn\u2019t truly know what I do, but AI is a big enough buzzword to excite him in general \u2013 and he loves soccer. I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to show my dad some of the amazing technology at Comcast and to give him a sneak peek into something we\u2019re rolling out for the World Cup.\n\nSeeing his face light up over my work is part of the reason I do it. It\u2019s really cool to be able to engage the people you love with your work, especially when it\u2019s something that they love too.\n\nWhat does \u201cDesigned with Love\u201d mean to you?\n\nIt means bringing my personal experiences to work and having a responsibility not only to myself, but to the customers and the teams that I work with.\n\nIt also means deeply caring about the products we deliver, almost as if it is our baby, in a sense. We pour our hearts into a product, and we want it to succeed.\n\nWhen it doesn\u2019t do as well as intended, we make improvements for it to do better. At the end of the day, I can\u2019t wait to get up in the morning and talk about it.\n\nHow has AI influenced your journey and work?\n\nWhen I applied for a job at Comcast, I had no idea it was with AI \u2013 it was just a luck of the draw. When I was hired, I was stoked to be able to work in this space, and from there on, it became a passion of mine. Every year something new comes out, and that\u2019s exciting to me.\n\nAs we look to productize AI as an organization, we know that there needs to be more representation from the folks that build the technology for it to be a product that all our customers can use. With that in mind, it takes on a mission. Every day, I have the privilege of collaborating with some of the most brilliant and innovative technologists in AI to create experiences that delight millions of customers. Our work is fun and there\u2019s also a lot of intentionality behind it.\n\nHow would you describe Comcast\u2019s commitment to DE&I? And why is that important to you?\n\nComcast is intentional about DE&I. People can show up as their authentic selves and bring their perspectives into the conversations that we have. I find that to be a breath of fresh air. I can share my own experiences knowing that it affects how we build our products.\n\nAre there other experiences in your life that have shaped who you are as a technologist and as a leader today?\n\nMy faith shaped a lot about what it means to be a leader. I value other folks first, which I think can be disarming to those who are on my team, but it also helps to build trust.\n\nI also take pride in my upbringing. My parents were strict growing up, but I now look back and appreciate the discipline they instilled in me. It has helped shape my ability to focus, to never give up, and to always want to learn. It is my dedication to learning that has helped me become a better technologist.\n\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self?\n\nBe patient. Take your time \u2013 the right opportunity will come your way. When I was younger, I liked to draw and write, but I also felt pressure from my Nigerian parents to find a career that promised financial stability.\n\nWhen I graduated college, I wanted to become an advertising copywriter. But as time went on, I got into graphic design and then learned how to code websites. That\u2019s where I started the journey into technology and discovered product management as a career path. My understanding of code and my creative mind were brought together in this role. I never dreamed I could take my creativity and apply it to something other than art or writing.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working at Comcast?\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I love working at Comcast is because it\u2019s based in Philly. My family moved to the area from Nigeria in 1992, and it has been my home ever since.\n\nComcast makes an intentional effort to serve its local community, and I love that. When I look at what I can do for my adopted city and how I can help other folks, I look to Comcast. There are always opportunities to give back to the community and to speak to other people like me and to let them know that there is a space for them here.",

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.\n\nFrom a presentation standpoint, Super Bowl LIX will largely be sticking to the status quo on Sunday. Fox Sports is capturing the game in 1080p HDR and upscaling that to 4K for its own networks and the free Tubi live stream. Comcast just announced that it\u2019ll be airing the game in Dolby Vision, which it has done before, but now with Dolby Atmos for the first time. The latter is certain to be a virtualized surround signal, but it could still lend some extra atmosphere to the game if you\u2019ve got a nice home theater setup.\n\nComcast says the Dolby Vision / Atmos broadcast of Super Bowl LIX will be available to Xfinity TV customers as part of its Enhanced 4K offerings, which \u201cprovides customers with an unmatched viewing experience with the best picture and audio quality, delivered to the home in the fastest way possible so the action customers see in their living room is only seconds behind the game unfolding in New Orleans.\u201d If you\u2019re an Xfinity Stream subscriber, you can also watch it there as well.\n\nIt\u2019s still upscaled 4K, though Comcast says its \u201cenhanced\u201d feed has very low latency. Image: Comcast\n\nThe game\u2019s picture quality will be similar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent years, but you might notice some unique shots as the Eagles and Chiefs face off. Fox Sports says it\u2019s using a Super Slowmo / 4K SkyCam, which is a first for the Super Bowl, so I\u2019ll be curious to see when and how that\u2019s used.\n\nI\u2019ve got friends who still insist on the OTA antenna method of watching the Big Game for the \u201cpurest\u201d feed, but I definitely prefer the HDR experience over that \u2014 wherever you can find it. The wider color gamut makes a real difference, and the upscaled 4K image apparently meets the \u201cgood enough\u201d bar for the enormous audience that will be watching on Sunday if we\u2019re still doing it this way. For reference, last year\u2019s game tallied 123.4 million average viewers across all platforms, according to the NFL.\n\n(Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.)",

Comcast is scoring a touchdown as, for the first time, the provider will broadcast Super Bowl LIX with Dolby Atmos sound.\n\nBest of all, it\u2019s alongside Dolby Vision, which isn\u2019t a first, but it\u2019s kind of the perfect pairing and made possible by a partnership between Comcast and Dolby. You\u2019ll need to be subscribed to Xfinity X1 to enjoy this \u2018Enhanced 4K\u2019 presentation, which Comcast describes as \u201can unmatched viewing experience with the best picture and audio quality delivered to the home in the fastest way possible so the action customers see in their living room is only seconds behind the game unfolding in New Orleans.\u201d\n\nThat feed will end up on the big screen through a Comcast X1 equipment box or the Xfinity Stream app running on one of the best streaming boxes or sticks. The app is also compatible with iOS and Android, so you can watch it on your phone or tablet.\n\nA look at the Comcast Xfinity X1 interface on a TV from one of the X1 cable boxes. (Image credit: Comcast)\n\nEven so, the best way to experience the Super Bowl in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos would be on a big screen \u2013 like one of TechRadar\u2019s picks for the best TV \u2013 and with one of the best soundbars or home theater setups. This way, you can feel the immersion as the audio from the game gets presented in a full Dolby Atmos mix.\n\nPaired with a big, crisp 4K TV, you\u2019ll likely get the feel you\u2019re inside the Superdome in New Orleans. Of course, Fox Sports will still present the game in 4K through Comcast and other providers, including for free on Tubi. You\u2019ll also want your TV \u2013 and streaming box \u2013 to support the Dolby Vision visual format and the Dolby Atmos audio format. So yes, some specific hardware beyond being an X1 subscriber is required. You'll need either the Xi6, XiOne, or XG1v4 Comcast box, but with the latter Dolby Vision isn't yet supported.\n\nThe whole idea with Comcast\u2019s Enhanced 4K product, though, is the best possible resolution \u2013 aka 4K \u2013 delivered with super low latency in both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Previous Super Bowls streamed on X1 were broadcast with Dolby Vision, but Dolby Atmos at the 2024 Paris Olympics checked off all the Dolby boxes. This won\u2019t be the first sport presented in Dolby Atmos either; Apple also regularly streams all MLS Season Pass matches on Apple TV Plus with a Dolby Atmos mix.\n\nStill, this is an exciting test for Comcast\u2019s Enhanced 4K product, as the Super Bowl will be one of the most-watched events of the year. And if you have the proper setup at home, you\u2019ll be in for a treat as the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philidelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

According to the agreement, Xfinity customers will now have access to all live game broadcasts of the KSE-owned Nuggets and Avalanche.\n\nThe agreement begins Tuesday night with the broadcast of the Avs game as they take on the Vancouver Canucks at 8 p.m. and continues with all subsequent games moving forward, including Wednesday as the New Orleans Pelicans take on the Denver Nuggets at 7 p.m. at Ball Arena.\n\n\"We are thrilled to once again make Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche games available on Comcast and Xfinity platforms in Colorado and the surrounding region,\" said KSE Vice Chairman Josh Kroenke in a statement. \"This is the best possible outcome for Nuggets Nation and Avs Faithful, who now have a straightforward way to see every game on one service.\"\n\n\"Xfinity delivers the sports and entertainment customers love,\" said J.D. Keller, Senior Vice President of Comcast's Mountain West Region, in a statement. \"We're excited to give fans more ways to watch the recent world-champion Avalanche and Nuggets through this new agreement with Altitude.\"\n\nThe years-long dispute began when a deal between the two entities ended in 2019. As a result, all Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets games have been blacked out since that time for Comcast customers, who at the time made up about 92% of cable subscribers in the market, Altitude has stated in court documents.\n\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA - FEBRUARY 01: DaQuan Jeffries #3 of the Charlotte Hornets guards Nikola Jokic #15 of the Denver Nuggets in the first quarter during their game at Spectrum Center on February 01, 2025 in Charlotte, North Carolina. / Getty Images\n\nTwo years ago, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb got involved in the fight between Altitude Sports and Comcast. Webb, who served as mayor from 1991 to 2003, called on the state attorney general to investigate and bring an end to the dispute.\n\nAltitude had previously sued Comcast over alleged antitrust violations in 2019. In the complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, the Denver sports network claimed Comcast wanted to \"extinguish competition from Altitude,\" and \"strengthen its control over multichannel television distribution in the Denver DMA and around the country.\"\n\nDENVER, COLORADO - FEBRUARY 02: Noah Cates #27 of the Philadelphia Flyers skates against Nathan MacKinnon #29 of the Colorado Avalanche at Ball Arena on February 2, 2025 in Denver, Colorado. Michael Martin/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nComcast had denied those allegations and called the suit \"meritless,\" saying at the time it remained willing to distribute Altitude's content in a way that wouldn't raise rates for virtually all customers. The two sides reached a settlement for the federal antitrust lawsuit in March 2023 but the blackout continued.\n\n\"The real winners today are the fans,\" said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston in a statement. \"In 20 years we'll tell our children and grandchildren what it was like to watch Nathan MacKinnon and Nikola Joki\u0107 in their primes. This agreement gives fans more options on how to easily access games and ensures they won't miss a second of the action. I'm thankful that Altitude and Comcast came to the table and worked together to close this deal. Their teamwork will benefit the fans, the players, and the city.\"\n\nXfinity internet-only customers also will be able to subscribe to live-game streaming via the Altitude+ app.",

The number of Comcast video subscribers declined nearly 12% last year, per Statista data.\n\nBut Comcast is also an internet service provider, one that had 29.4 million US households set up with its broadband service in the fourth quarter of 2024. And one of the most popular ways to stream TV shows is via broadband.\n\nThe company believes at least some Super Bowl streamers will be leaning on its internet product, Xfinity, to support streaming bandwidth and its stream box, Xumo, to access the Tubi app.\n\nAnd despite the telecom companies\u2019 ability to profit massively on the Super Bowl \u2014 especially by selling ad space \u2014 it\u2019s really the NFL that pulls in the big bucks. Broadcasting companies are set to pay the league at least $125.5 billion through 2033 for rights to show the games. That\u2019s close to Comcast\u2019s entire market cap of roughly $129 billion.\n\nFor example, ViacomCBS is spending $2.1 billion a year on an 11-year contract to show the Sunday afternoon games and broadcast the Super Bowl for three seasons.\n\nComcast has several other, more direct ways its customers can watch the game that pulled in 123.7 million viewers last year, audience measurement org Nielsen reported.\n\nComcast told Technical.ly that customers can watch and record the game through its TV service X1, the Xfinity Stream app and its newly launched $70 per-month sports and news video package.\n\n\u201cWhether customers prefer to stream all of their entertainment via Xfinity Internet or select from a variety of video packages,\u201d VP Bonelli said, \u201cComcast has all of the options.\u201d",

While Yaghi noted this could dilute ARPUs, management is optimistic that broadband ARPU growth will remain healthy in 2025. Additionally, the company highlighted a continued focus on network upgrades to support more potent, integrated products across mobile and broadband. Management emphasized offering simplified bundles and pricing structures, a previous pain point, for new and existing customers.\n\nComcast reported 139K in domestic broadband losses during the quarter (versus -34K previous year), worse than Yaghi\u2019s -105K and consensus of -95K. As management highlighted in the previous quarter, weak loading was likely due to impacts from the two hurricanes, which have adversely affected their cable systems and the seasonal tailwind of viewers returning to the Southeast.\n\nBroadband continues to operate in a very competitive market as it competes with fiber and FWA offerings. Still, the company expects the new broadband/mobile converged strategy, as discussed above, to help acquire new customers and retain existing ones. The offering has yet to be rolled out nationwide, so Yaghi does not expect the first half of 2025 net adds to show any material improvement.\n\nYahi noted that Comcast is growing faster than many peers due to three of its profitable and growing business units. The analyst also noted that fiber competition from incumbents is unlikely to cause significant pain in the short to medium term in the U.S. and that wireless could be the biggest driver for the stock in the medium to long term.\n\nHe also noted that its theme parks and media assets are cyclical and exposed to U.S. economic weakness. However, considering the relatively small size of these assets, Yaghi mentioned that Comcast has already priced in some risks, given the stock\u2019s currently low multiples.\n\nComcast bleeds broadband customers due to Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and increasing fiber competition.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other most buzzing stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nEconomist Expects Prices to Rise in 2025\n\nData for the gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2024 came out at 2.3%, slightly under economist expectations of 2.6%. On January 31, Lauren Saidel-Baker, an economist at ITR Economics, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share her outlook on the economy ahead of 2025.\n\nBaker suggested that the economy is growing slower, which is rather a normalization of the economy and, therefore a very normal circumstance. She added that the economy is still feeling the ripple effects of the pandemic and we are now finally seeing the economy getting back to its \u201cfeat.\u201d Baker also shared her optimistic approach towards the economy suggesting that the fundamentals point towards stable economic growth. She added that most of the growth has been driven by the consumer, meaning that the average consumer in the United States is strong and has showcased resilience.\n\nOn the flip side, the economist did share concern over government spending, exceeding its means, which has been a \u201clong-going problem\u201d in her opinion. Baker also shed light that government spending beyond its means may spiral in the very near term, especially with relatively higher interest rates pushing a much larger debt burden.\n\nShe highlighted that it is very important for individuals to read the economy through the noise. She added that the market has heard a lot of noise about the impending tariffs and the supposed growers and shrinkers of the economy, which she believes risk higher inflation rather than economic growth. She emphasized that there is no optimal number at which the economy is supposed to grow, and the economy is likely expected to operate in waves.\n\nBaker believes that the economy may grow between 2-3% by the end of the year, and expects to see a slight acceleration by 2026. She also added that while the consumer is feeling higher prices, the general trend is in fact \u201cdisinflation,\u201d which means a positive rate of inflation but slightly lower. She explained that while the consumer is bearing the brunt of higher prices, the prices are not rising fast enough to be a concern. She also added that while she does expect prices to rise further, the balancing act of \u201cdisinflation\u201d may be good news for wages.\n\nThe consumer continues to show resilience towards the volatile and uncertain economic conditions, which is reflected in the performance of the stock market.",

            "content": "The board of Comcast Corporation ( ) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.33 on the 23rd of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield 3.9%, which is above the industry average.\n\nComcast's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, Comcast's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 8.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nComcast Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $0.45, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.32. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Comcast has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.1% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nComcast Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other best communication and media stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nThe communication and media sectors play a crucial role in connecting people and distributing information. These sectors are becoming increasingly significant in the modern economy and society. As technology advances, both the communication and media industries are expected to experience strong growth in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to a report by The Business Research Company, the global media market alone was valued at $2.61 trillion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% during 2025-2029 to reach a value of $2.83 trillion by the end of the forecast period. In 2024, North America was the largest region in the global media market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best 5G Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts and 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAnother report from The Business Research Company shows that the global telecommunication market was estimated to have a value of $2.98 trillion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2025 to 2029 and reach above $3.93 trillion by the end of this period. In 2024, Asia-Pacific held the largest share of the global media market while North America was the second largest region.\n\nRecent trends indicate a shift towards new and advanced technologies like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT). According to PwC\u2019s Global Telecom Outlook 2023-2027, telecom companies are expected to make significant investments in the infrastructure to better serve customers. As the shift towards 5G technology progresses and the demand for new technological standards rises, telecom companies are projected to invest $342.1 billion in their networks in 2027 alone.\n\nPwC\u2019s inaugural Global Telecom Outlook notes that telecom companies might need to change their strategies in a competitive environment and look for new growth opportunities in areas such as IoT solutions, private 5G networks for business customers, and fixed wireless home broadband for households. In some markets, these companies can also provide digital infrastructure, data, content, and platform services customized to the needs of various industries like entertainment and media, healthcare, and manufacturing. To stay competitive in this changing market, telecom companies must become more comfortable operating within broader ecosystems and looking beyond traditional services.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 11 best communication and media stocks to buy according to analysts, we looked for the largest media and communication companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, and various online resources to compile a list of the best communication and media stocks. Next, we focused on the top communication and media stocks that analysts believe have the most potential for growth. We ranked the 11 best communication and media stocks to invest in based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts as of January 29, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nAverage Price Target Upside Potential According to Analysts: 28.48%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational mass media and technology corporation that specializes in telecommunications, entertainment, sports, and news. Through its brands Xfinity, Comcast Business, and Sky, the company provides broadband, wireless, and video services. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also produces and distributes leading entertainment, sports, and news through brands like NBC, Telemundo, Universal, Peacock, and Sky. CMCSA is one of the best communication and media stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nThe company offers extensive wireless coverage and it is strategically focused on investing in growing and enhancing its network. To fund the largest network upgrade in the US, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has invested more than $20 billion since 2018. In December 2024, the company shifted its 5G wireless core to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This move from on-premise infrastructure to a cloud-based network will allow Xfinity Mobile and Comcast Business Mobile to offer customers more scalable, secure, and cost-effective 5G wireless services using Comcast\u2019s licensed spectrum across the country.\n\nThe company is also making moves to enhance its media and cable services. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced an 11-year deal to present NBA and WNBA games starting with the 2025-26 season. The company also announced its plans to spin off select cable television networks.\n\nOverall, CMCSA ranks 9th on our list of best communication and media stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of communication and media companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Meta, Comcast, And Credit Acceptance Report Q4 Earnings Diverse financial outcomes reflect varying stock market reactions and investor confidence among top companies.\n\nMeta Platforms, Comcast, and Credit Acceptance Corporation took the spotlight recently as they released their fourth-quarter earnings for 2024. Each company had its own story to tell, with earnings performance influencing stock market reactions and showcasing the varied fortunes of leading players across technology and finance.\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, surprised analysts with revenue exceeding Wall Street expectations, leading to initial optimism. Reported revenue for the last quarter stood at $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion, slightly below the analysts' average estimate of $41.72 billion. After their earnings report, stocks remained flat but showed signs of life as CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out bullish AI initiatives. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an open source standard globally,\u201d he expressed, emphasizing the importance of American standards for technology. Despite reservations on capital spending for 2025 expected to reach between $114 billion to $119 billion, Zuckerberg suggested potential cost savings if AI projects were refined, saying, \"There are several advances we hope to implement from competitors like DeepSeek,\u201d referring to the recently launched AI project from China.\n\nOn the other side of the stage was Comcast, whose stock jumped 1.23% after its earnings report disclosed solid financial health. Comcast's fourth-quarter EPS hit $0.96, exceeding forecasts by $0.10, whereas revenue reached $31.92 billion, beating projections by $310 million. CEO Brian Roberts stated, \u201cOur team is executing in industries... going through rapid and exciting transformation,\u201d which spurred investor confidence. Comcast\u2019s overall annual results were impressive, totaling record revenue of $124 billion for 2024. The gains, though tempered by the loss of 139,000 broadband subscribers, highlighted the company's strength, especially with their wireless department growing from continued demand.\n\nNot to be left behind, Credit Acceptance Corporation reported impressive figures, reporting earnings of $10.17, significantly above the expected $7.93, with total revenues totaling $565.9 million against the anticipated $522.6 million. Despite these strong results, the company's stock fell by 1.22% after the announcement, closing at $507.77. CEO Ken Boothe commented, \u201cWe are a jump start in their new lifejourney,\u201d underlining the importance of their role in subprime vehicle financing, which is seeing heightened competition and decline from previous year\u2019s projections. Credit Acceptance also noted its market share increase to 6.1% in the used vehicle subprime segment, managing to add 902 new dealers this quarter alone.\n\nThe stock reactions across these three firms tell vividly different stories, ranging from Comcast's post-earnings surge to Credit Acceptance's unexpected decline, highlighting investor sentiments influenced by trends, leader comments, and overall financial health. Investors\u2019 responses reflect their confidence, or lack thereof, based on the clarity of future strategies aligned with each company's earnings performance.\n\nThe contrasts come at a time when market dynamics are especially pertinent, with rising competition and technology investments driving strategic decisions. Zooming out, Mark Zuckerberg's foresight concerning AI investments may prove pivotal for Meta Platforms\u2019 long-term viability, especially amid competitive pressures from new entrants like DeepSeek. Conversely, Comcast\u2019s ability to expand its wireless business through strategic growth assets demonstrates potential resilience against broadband competitors. For Credit Acceptance, maintaining strong liquidity and effective management strategies will be key as it navigates the uncertainties tied to the broader economic environment.\n\nConclusively, as we head forward through 2025, the earnings trends highlighted suggest shifting landscapes for these companies. Investors will remain focused on how these giants adapt to economic fluctuations and technological advancements, with the stakes higher than ever for delivering sustainable growth.",

            "content": "So much time is spent on curbing utilities like gas and electricity in Illinois but the real problem is the skyrocketing costs of cable TV.\n\nOne of the worst in Illinois is Xfinity Comcast cable, which, for a typical household, can cost as much as $350 a month to have strong internet, a home phone and basic cable TV service.\n\nMy cable costs jumped more than $35 last month simply because Xfinity changed my contract (which I have had with them for more than two decades) asserting I suddenly was using too much data.\n\nThey threatened me saying that if I didn\u2019t pay more each month $25 plus taxes, the excess data costs would be 10 times higher.\n\nI spoke with them several times realizing that I have no control over their system, which has increased in costs more than 20 times since I first subscribed to their service.\n\nWorse is I realized that I had no place to go to complain about Xfinity Comcast, except to my local government in Orland Park, which happens to be in an utter shambles anyway because of the incompetence of Orland Park\u2019s uncaring and beleaguered Mayor Keith Pekau.\n\nIf this were a gas, water or electric company, I could complain to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) or to the Citizens Utility Board.\n\nBut for some reason, Xfinity Comcast is allowed to set up special monetary agreements that benefit local governments. Pekau\u2019s has made a financial mess in Orland Park and he\u2019s not going to jeopardize what he receives from the cable company.\n\nThere\u2019s no place to go.\n\nBesides going to non-responsive local government officials, you could wade into the bloated bureaucracy of the Washington D.C. swamp of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nMany of our legislators like to rail against the gas companies, the water companies and the electric companies, doing little other than yelling. Those legislators just want cheap headlines but rarely do anything to bring about change.\n\nWorse is that customers of the gas, water and electric companies force customers to pay the costs for the lawyers and lobbyists they hire to fight against consumer rights.\n\nIn February 2024, WTTW did a report on how \u201cIllinoisans pay tens of millions of dollars each year to utilities to cover costs they accrue for lawyers, belonging to trade groups, making charitable contributions and purchasing advertisements meant to boost utilities\u2019 public image.\u201d\n\nAnd, imagine this. Illinois is one of the few states that allow utilities to charge customers for charitable contributions.\n\nComcast has a huge lobbying operation in Illinois. With no real monitoring in place, it\u2019s hard to get precise data, but back in 2014, Politico reported Comcast donated nearly $500,000 to local candidates to support their interests to turn their backs on the cable company\u2019s outrageous abuses of customers and even more outrageous cost increases.\n\nIf it was $500,000 in 2014, you can bet they\u2019re spending more than $1 million today.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen how the cable company monster has grown since the 1980s when it first began offering services. It cost $35 back then, and the selling point was that you pay the monthly subscription and you got all the movies for free. Nothing is free on Xfinity Comcast any more.\n\nWe pay for the service and we pay for the movies and shows, including many of the old ones.\n\nToday, not only do you pay $350 for cable TV \u201cservice\u201d \u2013 and I use that word \u201cservice\u201d with skepticism \u2013 but we are forced to pay for all these movie channels. Nothing is free.\n\nIf there ever was an industry that deserves more scrutiny, it is the cable TV industry.\n\nInstead, our Governor \u201cDaddy Warbucks\u201d Pritzker spends all his time yelling about national policies and attacking Trump\u2019s politics, hoping to deflect our attention away from his incompetence and lack of real public service.\n\nBut don\u2019t waste your time writing to our congress members. Congressman Sean Casten, for example, puts out releases on every topic, except those that address the issues middle class Americans in his district need answered.\n\nThere are many free services out there and monthly premium channels to subscribe to, but cancelling Xfinity Comcast dooms our local TV broadcasts.\n\nWe should have known back in the 1980s that cable TV was a scam waiting to happen.\n\nRead more on this at Hanania.com",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.9%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Comcast\n\nComcast's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, Comcast's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 8.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nNasdaqGS:CMCSA Historic Dividend February 2nd 2025\n\nComcast Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $0.45, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.32. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Comcast has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 8.1% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nWe Really Like Comcast's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, Comcast has 3 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the \"Lagnificent 7\" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown.

            "content": "Comcast Faces Subscriber Losses And Stock Decline Amid Strategic Shift The telecom giant announces disappointing fourth-quarter results, sparking investor concerns and prompting new bundling strategies.\n\nComcast Corp faced significant challenges in its fourth-quarter financial performance, reflecting shifts in consumer behavior and fierce market competition. Publishing their earnings on January 30, 2025, the telecom giant disclosed alarming figures: the loss of 139,000 broadband subscribers during the quarter and stagnant growth for its streaming service, Peacock.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock took a noticeable hit, plummeting more than 10% after the announcement, eclipsing the estimated subscriber loss of 100,000 predicted by Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson last month. This loss of subscribers exceeded expectations, highlighting the increasing struggle Comcast faces within the broadband sector.\n\nFactors influencing this downturn were manifold. Increased competition from mobile providers such as Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T has lured away many lower-income consumers with flexible pricing plans. Comcast President Michael Cavanagh indicated these pressures have led to strategic shifts within the company.\n\n\u201cWireless is a meaningful differentiator as our converged offers provide great savings to the consumer,\u201d remarked Cavanagh. The company's strategy is to bundle mobile services with its higher-tier broadband products to cater to both new and existing customers. They aim to navigate the competitive waters by attracting users to their converged offers.\n\nComcast's broadband sector, operating under the Xfinity brand, reported total domestic broadband customers had dropped to 31.8 million, with the overall company experiencing losses across its television service as well. The total TV subscribers fell by 311,000 during the same quarter, exacerbated by consumers rejecting traditional cable options for more affordable streaming solutions.\n\nWhile cable remains part of Comcast\u2019s strategy, its blueprint for the future includes adjustments to its streaming service, Peacock. Despite maintaining the same number of paying subscribers at 36 million for the quarter, Peacock\u2019s profitability saw improvement but not without cost concerns. The service reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $372 million, which, though down from $825 million during the same period last year, still raises eyebrows among industry watchers.\n\nAnalysts are wary, with Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson commenting positively on avoiding substantial subscriber drops after the Summer Olympics but maintaining caution about Peacock's competitive position. Ross Benes, from eMarketer, expressed concerns about the financial burden associated with competing across streaming platforms, noting, \u201cPeacock is finding out it\u2019s expensive to compete in the streaming wars and gains are becoming more difficult to come by.\u201d\n\nAlongside subscriber metrics, Comcast reported improved financial metrics overall. Their total revenue increased by 2% year-over-year to $31.92 billion. Revenue from the Connectivity & Platforms division exhibited notable growth as well, rising 5% to $11.5 billion. Recent adjustments to Peacock's revenue also indicated growth, totaling $1.3 billion\u2014up 28% year-over-year, albeit positioned against steep competition.\n\nBlame for subscriber declines was partly placed on the discontinuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which ended last February. Cavanagh highlighted during the earnings call, \u201cCompetitive conditions remain intense, dynamic, and varied across our footprint and customer segments,\u201d showcasing the stark realities Comcast faces.\n\nDespite these impediments, Comcast remains optimistic about future strategies, including spinning off much of its cable properties, leading to the formation of the new entity dubbed SpinCo. This will include major cable television networks, allowing Comcast to focus more on its core strengths. Cavanagh emphasized confidence, asserting, \u201cSpinCo will be well positioned to lead in the changing cable and digital media environment.\u201d\n\nBank of America (BofA) analysts have sounded alarms, adjusting their estimates following Comcast\u2019s performance review. They downgraded Comcast shares from $50 to $38, citing increased competition due to the growing availability of fixed wireless access and fiber services as detrimental to Comcast's market share. Analysts expect substantial losses of subscribers will continue to affect their revenue, forecasting 525,000 fewer residential broadband subscribers by 2025, up from their earlier estimate of 225,000.\n\nReflecting on their predictions, BofA analysts anticipate challenges for Comcast\u2019s broadband growth as they continue to contend with intensified competition. \u201c2025 will be a reset year as the company looks to improve its broadband results,\u201d said analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich, showcasing the tough road ahead, informed by the industry\u2019s changing nature.\n\nNonetheless, Comcast's commitment to the connectivity business and its ability to adapt under pressure remains significant. The company is positioning itself to respond to the rising demand for internet usage, especially brought on by the streaming boom, and they appear determined to combat subscriber losses with new offerings.\n\nSuch adjustments, packaged with mobile services and enhancements to existing broadband options, may prove pivotal as Comcast navigates the competitive fray, balancing subscriber retention strategies with operational improvements. The future remains uncertain, but the company is undertaking necessary steps to restore its standing among consumers.",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

            "content": "Comcast Launches Revolutionary Low Latency Internet Service The new L4S technology aims to transform gaming and video calls across major U.S. cities.\n\nComcast is stepping up its game with the launch of ultra-low latency internet technology, promising drastically improved connectivity for users engaging with online applications. This innovative service, named L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput), aims to significantly reduce lag, making activities such as gaming, video conferencing, and virtual reality smoother than ever before. The announcement was made on January 31, 2025, with the company stating its intent to roll out this technology to customers soon.\n\nJason Livingood, Comcast\u2019s Vice President of Technology, Policy, Product and Standards, revealed during the announcement, \"Our connectivity is the key to unlocking a world of entertainment, sports, news, and information, and we\u2019re constantly pushing the limits of network innovation to create an experience...\" His remarks reflect the company\u2019s commitment to enhancing internet experiences for consumers.\n\nThe new L4S technology builds upon Comcast\u2019s existing infrastructure and will initially be available to users located in major cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Colorado Springs, and Rockville (Maryland). Trials for the low-latency technology began back in June 2023, with promising results indicating reductions of approximately 78% in working latency compared to previous systems.\n\nBut what exactly makes L4S stand out? Traditionally, internet data is transmitted through packets, which can become congested, delaying the transfer significantly. L4S introduces enhancements to this system by allowing the network to identify and manage congested packets more effectively, meaning data can flow freely and with far less delay. Therefore, video calls might feel as seamless as chatting over coffee, and gaming experiences could become vastly more immersive.\n\nComcast is collaborating with major tech players including Apple, Meta, and Nvidia to implement L4S across selected applications, such as FaceTime and Nvidia\u2019s cloud gaming software, GeForce NOW. This means users can expect enhanced performance when utilizing these platforms, making real-time communications and interactive entertainment smoother and more responsive than ever.\n\nThe rollout of L4S is not without its challenges, as the new technology requires adoption beyond just Comcast\u2019s services. Developers of applications compatible with L4S must also enable support, ensuring users can fully utilize the advantages offered. Only select applications are available with L4S at launch, but Comcast is optimistic and will continue working toward wider compatibility.\n\nEmily Waldorf, Comcast\u2019s Senior VP of Consumer Products, emphasized the long-term benefits: \"We believe our latest technologies will be a differentiator for Comcast\" when it came to promoting Xfinity Internet. The potential for improved service is notable, particularly as internet usage matures and demands for speed and efficient connections continue to grow.\n\nWhile L4S is being touted as the future of internet connectivity, it's important to acknowledge its limitations. For example, if you're on video call with someone who has slower internet service\u2014say, DSL from rural Indiana\u2014no amount of low-latency magic on your end will resolve the issue. Likewise, if you're trying to play games with friends who aren\u2019t on L4S, their existing connections might still create surges and delays within the session.\n\nStill, many users are expressing excitement about this swiftly advancing technology. Comcast's rapid approach to deploying L4S across more locations could mark the beginning of smoother online interactions, particularly as other internet service providers, like Verizon, are also exploring low-latency options through their networks. While the L4S rollout is just starting and may be considered optional at the moment, its adoption could herald the next phase of internet experience for countless users.\n\nThis latest initiative from Comcast reflects broader trends within the industry, striving to meet the growing demands for more efficient and reliable internet services. With constant pressures on connectivity and speed, the development of L4S is likely to play a pivotal role for Comcast and its customers moving forward.",

            "content": "This growth in broadband has not been nearly enough to offset the losses in its cable services segment which have left revenues stagnate over the last 8 years. This stagnation in Comcast's revenue and sales growth has led to a steep decline in its Net Profit Margins. In 2018, the company boasted net profit margins of 27.34%, but this figure plummeted to just 4.42% by 2023. While margins showed some recovery in Q1 2024, reaching 12.66%, they have since stagnated and fallen below 12% as the year progressed.\n\nThis industry trend has been mirrored in Comcast's own figures. Between 2018 and Q3 2024, Comcast reported a 41.63% decline in its Video Customers (TV Subscribers), falling from 21.98 million to 12.83 million. The Voice Segment was cut nearly in half dropping from 11.5 million to 7.5 million customers. While its Broadband Internet Segment on saw a 17.48% growth during the same period, increasing from 27.22 million to 31.98 million customers;\n\nComcast's financial trajectory has been hindered by several issues, most notably the steep industry-wide decline in cable subscriptions over the past several years. According to data from eMarketer (formerly Insider Intelligence), U.S. households with paid traditional TV subscriptions fell from 90.3 million in 2018 to 62.8 million in 2023, representing a 30.5% decrease. Meanwhile, households without traditional TV subscriptions rose 84.2% from 37.3 million to 68.7 million during the same period with further substantial declines in cable subscribers being projected for the future.\n\nIn order to get a grasp of these downward probabilities It is worth exploring the financial, economic, and competitive factors driving this shift and why these pain points could lead to Comcast's continued decline.\n\nToday, Comcast provides a wide range of services, including broadband internet, cable TV, and streaming through Xfinity and Peacock. Historically, its significant stake in the broadband and media markets made it a formidable player. However, the landscape has shifted dramatically in recent years. The growing dominance of streaming services and increased competition from both traditional cable companies and tech firms have placed immense pressure on Comcast. These challenges have led to stagnation in market valuation and are poised to drive a significant downturn in the company's future stock performance.\n\nComcast Corporation (:CMCSA), has long been a dominant force in the telecommunications and media industries. Starting as a regional cable provider through the purchase of American Cable Systems in 1963, Comcast rose to become a global powerhouse. The company continually adapted to the evolving market landscape for decades, establishing itself as a staple for millions of consumers worldwide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: MacroTrends.net\n\nThese declines are closely aligned with the broader industry trends of cord-cutting and the rise of non-subscribing US households, which grew to over 60% by 2023 with forecasts putting this number near 80% by 2026.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: Julia Stoll, Statista\n\nCompetitive Pressures: The Rise of Streaming and 5G Alternatives\n\nComcast faces fierce competition from streaming services such as Netflix (:NFLX), Hulu (:DIS), YouTube TV (:GOOGL), and FuboTV (:FUBO). These platforms offer consumers greater flexibility, more content, and often lower costs compared to traditional cable packages. Despite Comcast's efforts to counteract this trend through its own streaming service, Peacock, the company has struggled to keep pace according to data gathered by Nielsen Research, Peacock has only managed to corner 1.5% of the streaming market share while YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and others remain exponentially higher with YouTube becoming the first streaming platform to break above 10% as of July, 2024.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: Nielsen\n\nFurthermore, Comcast's Internet and Voice segments face increasing competition from 5G providers like T-Mobile (:TMUS) and Verizon (:VZ). These companies offer cheaper and more flexible alternatives to Comcast's broadband services as according to a 2024 study done by Broadband Search, Price was cited as the number one reason by consumers for cutting the cord:\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nThis recent trend of consumers seeking lower prices and more flexible offers has contributed to the stagnation and decline of Comcast's market share in the Voice and Internet Segments just as it has the Video Segment;\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nThis triple-fronted competitive threat from streaming services on one end and 5G providers on the others has exacerbated Comcast's struggles to maintain growth and profitability.\n\nThe Sky Group Acquisition: The Snowballing of Mistakes\n\nIn 2018, Comcast acquired Sky Group Limited, Europe's largest TV provider, for $40 billion in an auction Comcast won against 21st Century Fox in a 3-round auction. To finance the deal, Comcast raised approximately $31 billion in long-term debt through revolving credit facilities, bridge loans, and term loan agreements. As a result, the company's reported net debt surged by over 80%, from $60 billion in Q3 2018 to more than $107 billion in the following quarter.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: MacroTrends.net\n\nThe acquisition also added $4.5 billion in annual interest expenses to Comcast's income sheet, further straining its bottom line.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThis acquisition had added approximately 23 million customers to Comcast's international subscriber base and was intended to bolster its global presence.\n\nIn the Q4, 2019 report Comcast confirmed Sky's numbers neared 24 million.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nHowever, this strategy for international growth has not held strong and has delivered weaker the expected results; as of Q3 2024, Comcast's international customer base has declined to 17.716 million, representing a 21% drop since the acquisition.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nTotal Operating Expenses have continued to rise as well, increasing from $75 billion in 2018 to over $100 billion on a trailing twelve-month (TTM) basis and has steadily been closing the gap between Operating Expense and the Total Revenue which has remained stagnate:\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThese factors combined with the declining performance of Comcast's 2018 investment Sky, have contributed to the company's declining profit margins and constrained its ability to generate sustainable growth. The Sky acquisition was intended as a growth driver, but has instead amplified Comcast's financial pressures and operational challenges.\n\nThe economic environment has further compounded Comcast's struggles. Rising interest rates have made debt servicing more expensive, while rising inflation has increased expenses, reducing profitability and limiting the company's ability to invest in smarter growth initiatives. Additionally, inflationary pressures have weighed on consumer spending, particularly for discretionary services like cable TV. This macroeconomic condition has exacerbated the challenges already posed by shifting consumer preferences and increased competition and is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nLooking ahead, Comcast will have to rethink its strategies to remain competitive while optimizing its cost structure, improving its streaming offerings, and finding ways to compete effectively in the broadband market. Comcast will have to find a way to do all this as discretionary spend contracts, and the impacts of inflation and higher rates hit the market. Without decisive action, Comcast's current trajectory suggests continued stagnation and if left undone, a significant decline in stock valuation.\n\nFinancial Metrics:\n\nLooking at this table of Comcast's Cash Flows we can see that the company has failed to grow its Free Cash Flow on a non-adjusted basis, with the current TTM reading at $2.35B which is around the same as it was in 2014 in between that time FCF only expanded for one year which was during 2020 but it has since contracted back down to the mean, further confirming Comcast's inability to stray away from its trend of stagnation.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: Arthur\n\nIn addition to falling Cash Flows, CMCSA's Debt to EBITDA remains on the higher end of the industry sitting in at 2.69x putting it 0.295 points above the industry median of 2.395x.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile it is normal to see high debt to EBITDA in this industry I find it quite concerning that CMCSA manages to have a worse debt ratio than the better 54.4% especially considering their general inability to grow their profit margins over the last 10 years.\n\nLastly, we have CMCSA's PE Ratio, currently trading at 10.11x which right now looks deceptively good when compared to the industry median of 16.17x making Comcast's PE ratio appear better than 74.21% of the industry, but it must be noted that CMCSA at its 10 year highs were trading at 33.59x and at the lows it was just a 6.38x.\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: GuruFocus.com\n\nAt its highs were around the 2018 period which was when CMCSA still had high growth prospects but the PE Multiple has been contracting and making the company appear to be a value as the market has contracted and priced out that growth, so the main concern here would be that the PE ratio has not gotten lower because Earnings have caught up with Price but that its only gone down because the price is now mean reverting back down to the EPS as the company fails to keep investors engaged. This action here seems to be indicative of a Value Trap and I personally wouldn't feel too good about investing in that value until Comcast trades back near the 10 year PE lows at around 6.38x as that is what it was prior to 2018 and prior to the major declines in customers. With EPS currently sitting at $3.75 that would put CMCSA's price target at approximately $23.73 per share before it could then be seen as a value opportunity relative to its history.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nComcast Erodes as Streaming Giants and 5G Competitors Disrupt the Industry\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nCMCSA after topping out at $56.05 in 2021, attempted a rally in 2024 which met resistance at the High to Low, 0.618-0.786 Fibonacci Retracement zone aligning with $44-$50, upon hitting this resistance and getting rejected the first time, it tried to break above it a second time but was rejected again, it then tried one last time and got rejected a third time, this time even faster than the lasts followed by breaking below the 21-month EMA. This activity can be viewed as an early confirmation of a Shortening of the Thrust, signaling distribution at a resistance zone. If CMCSA continues down and breaks the previous swing low of $26.55 the 0.618 tests would be confirmed as a lower Swing High. We would then typically extrapolate out the price action from here and start looking to project a technical Harmonic AB=CD movement downwards which would likely take price down to the next support between the 0.786-0.886 Low to High Fibonacci support zone between $9.90 and $15.15.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Charter CEO Chris Winfrey acknowledged the \u201cchatter\u201d in the media business and on Wall Street about a potential merger with Comcast, but said such a megadeal is not \u201ccore\u201d to his company\u2019s strategy.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts to discuss Charter\u2019s better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, Winfrey was asked directly about a Comcast tie-up and his view of M&A more broadly. The top exec didn\u2019t completely rule out dealmaking, but said closing a transaction with another major player won\u2019t necessarily be any easier during the Donald Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of chatter out there\u201d about Comcast, Winfrey said. But Charter\u2019s strategy, he continued, \u201chas never been dependent on M&A. In fact, it\u2019s really been moving purely from an organic growth perspective, and how do we create value for shareholders from that perspective? You do that by being a great operator. You do that by saving customers lots of money, providing great service.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm TD Cowen this month promoted the combination in a note to clients. \u201cWe believe a Comcast/Charter merger could make industrial logical sense given the scale and subsequent massive synergies,\u201d they wrote. The two companies already participate in a joint venture on connected-TV service Xumo.\n\nMajor Charter shareholder John Malone has advocated for industry consolidation, saying regulators have allowed the tech industry to \u201crun wild\u201d while handcuffing traditional sectors like cable. \u201cCharter should be allowed to merge with Comcast or Cox or anybody, to reduce costs and improve quality of the service they provide,\u201d he said at Liberty Media\u2019s investor meeting last November. Comcast\u2019s decision last fall to spin off most of its cable networks into a new stand-alone company was interpreted as clearing the way for a pay-TV merger.\n\nRunning a business well, Winfrey acknowledged, \u201copens acquisition opportunities over time.\u201d Still, he said combining with a large-scale peer won\u2019t be as straightforward as it was a decade ago when Charter bought Time Warner Cable, vaulting to the top of the market-share charts. \u201cThe rest of the cable industry, if you sit back and think about it, it\u2019s all family-owned or family-controlled,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s in the hands of these families or family-controlled businesses that get to decide when\u2019s the time that they\u2019d like to combine.\u201d\n\nCable television began as an industry led by maverick entrepreneurs like Malone, Charles Dolan, John Rigas and Comcast founder Ralph Roberts creating what would become multi-generational empires. Roberts\u2019 son, Brian Roberts, is CEO of the media giant that started out as a small, regional cable outfit.\n\nBeyond the family control element, Winfrey said, is the complicated matter of regulatory review. Charter and Comcast are the top two pay-TV operators in the U.S., but their footprints are steadily shrinking due to cord-cutting. A similar combination of major distributors \u2013 satellite operators DirecTV and Dish \u2013 fell apart last November when creditors of Dish parent EchoStar objected to terms of the proposed merger.\n\nWhile the Charter-connected CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav, and other media bosses have predicted a surge of M&A under Trump, Winfrey is not convinced. The first Trump administration saw some deals travel a smooth and efficient path through regulatory review, but personal grievances also threw a wrench in at times. Trump\u2019s friction with CNN was understood to have motivated an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice to try to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner. A judge sided against the DOJ and the deal ultimately closed after nearly three years of red tape.\n\n\u201cThe door for M&A, there\u2019s also a lot of chatter that it\u2019s wide-open,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wide-open. I think any M&A transaction that you do under any administration has to be good for customers, has to be good for jobs. And when you think of our organic operating strategy that drives growth, that\u2019s been helpful in that respect in the past with our ability to get things done. But it\u2019s a potential add-on to our strategy, but it\u2019s not the core of our strategy and it\u2019s not the only way that we can create value.\u201d\n\nFavorable opinion of a combination is not unanimous on Wall Street, of course. Craig Moffett, the veteran media analyst who asked Winfrey the question during the call, has taken a dim view of the scenario. \u201cCool your jets,\u201d he advised merger boosters in a recent research note, noting the difficulties of pooling cable and broadband businesses rooted in local, not national markets. \u201cThe economic and political considerations argue against the deal, not for it.\u201d",

            "content": "SALT LAKE CITY (KSL.com) \u2014 As the University of Utah navigated the turbulent waters of an ever-changing landscape of conference realignment, several external factors resulted in the school\u2019s athletic program reporting a $17 million deficit for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe department, which had made a profit the last two years after a $31 million loss during COVID, was met with challenges not totally within its control for the fiscal year ranging from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024.\n\nThe biggest disruptor? The Pac-12 fiasco that resulted in Comcast overpaying conference members for several years. An internal audit by Comcast in the summer of 2022 unearthed the overpayments that were known internally within the Pac-12 since late 2017.\n\nAs a result, each school was forced to take a cut of its 2024 fiscal year revenue following a settlement. And in Utah\u2019s case, that resulted in a nearly $10.4 million swing in revenue from the fiscal year prior, according to the most recent revenue and expense form that was recently published.\n\nThe university went from receiving approximately $2.5 million in conference (non media and non football bowl) distributions in the 2023 fiscal year to owing nearly $7.9 million a year later as the largest single contributor to the deficit to the year\u2019s athletic budget.\n\nAdditionally, the university did not receive revenue payments previously owed to the university as part of a separate settlement with Oregon State and Washington State after Utah and other schools exited the Pac-12 to join the Big 12, Big Ten and ACC.\n\nAs part of that settlement, at least $5 million was withheld as part of a $50 million deal, with an additional $1.5 million owed in \u201csupplemental contribution\u201d to the conference.\n\nIn an addendum published by the university, officials with the university said outside of the previously mentioned external factors, in addition to legal fees, \u201ctravel costs and a significant year-over-year increase in the university\u2019s published cost of attendance were other major contributing and uncontrollable factors\u201d to the year\u2019s deficit.\n\nThe deficit, the university said, was covered by athletics reserves from previous years.\n\nUniversities across the country have experienced major deficits this past year, including Ohio State ($37.7 million deficit), Michigan State ($16.7 million), UCLA ($51.8 million) Missouri ($15.2 million) and Alabama ($28 million), among others.\n\nThough the deficit for Utah was compounded by the Comcast overpayments and its departure to the Big 12, the university said other \u201ckey revenue performance indicators,\u201d which included ticket sales and donations, improved from the previous year. To that point, the university made just over $14.8 million in ticket sales between all sports, which is just shy of a $2 million increase from the previous fiscal year.\n\nAs is the case most years, football and men\u2019s basketball were the only profitable sports for the university, which is consistent with most Power Four programs across the country.\n\nEven with the nearly $8 million owed back in the Comcast settlement, the football program brought in $79 million in revenue and had just over $52 million in expenses, equating to approximately $27 million in profit. Men\u2019s basketball recorded approximately $12.9 million, while having just over $10.3 million in expenses.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the football program reached a university record $92.5 million in revenue and $51.8 million in expenses, for a $40.7 million profit. Men\u2019s basketball brought in approximately $16.6 million, while having nearly $12.8 million in expenses.\n\nEvery other sport, outside of lacrosse and volleyball, had a larger deficit than the previous fiscal year report.",

            "content": "\"In short, competitive conditions remain intense, dynamic and varied across our footprint and customer segments,\" Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said on Thursday's investor call. \"And we see no signs of this changing in the near term.\"\n\nThe stagnation stems from a number of factors, primarily the rise of wireless providers such as Verizon and T-Mobile offering home broadband options.\n\nCompany executives said during Thursday's earnings call with investors that the company will shift its strategy to package mobile with broadband in a bid for more customers.\n\nBroadband has long been the growth engine of the cable industry, especially after the exodus of cable TV customers. Although broadband segment revenue remains stable, Comcast, like its cable peers, has been in the midst of a slowdown in customer growth, which has concerned investors in recent years.\n\nComcast executives said Thursday the company will shift its focus to its mobile business after reporting a loss of 139,000 residential broadband customers during the fourth quarter.\n\nCable giant Comcast is looking to the wireless business for growth.\n\nIn 2022, Comcast and fellow cable giant Charter Communications each reported their first quarterly decline in broadband subscriber growth.\n\nExecutives have cited reasons such as the slowdown in buying and selling of homes \u2014 noting there are fewer people signing up for cable when they get a new home \u2014 as well as a drop-off in additions following robust growth at the height of the Covid pandemic, when lockdowns sent Americans home to work and learn.\n\nBut the rise of fixed wireless offerings from Verizon and T-Mobile has significantly ramped up competition. In December, Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson called out the dynamic and warned of a fourth-quarter loss of 100,000 customers. Thursday's announcement amounted to deeper-than-projected subscriber losses.\n\nThe so-called overbuilding of fiber internet has contributed to the competition, as has fixed wireless, a 5G high-speed broadband offering that is an alternative to cable broadband. Comcast in the past has dismissed fixed wireless as \"an inferior product.\"\n\nOn Thursday CFO Jason Armstrong said the expectation is that fixed wireless, and likely satellite companies, will be \"carving out a permanent part of the market.\" He also noted cable's increasing broadband speeds as an advantage.\n\nIn response, Comcast is looking to mobile to both grow and maintain its customer base.\n\n\"While we are the incumbent in the $80 billion U.S. residential broadband market, we are the challenger in the far larger $200 billion U.S. wireless market,\" said Armstrong. \"Wireless is an integral part of our broadband strategy.\"\n\nComcast now counts more than 7.8 million mobile lines, or 12% penetration of its residential broadband customer base, giving it a \"long runway ahead.\"\n\nComcast launched Xfinity Mobile in 2017, while Charter started offering mobile in 2018. The two biggest cable companies in the U.S. have touted consistent quarterly gains of mobile lines since then. Smaller operators such as Altice USA and Cox have also added the offering.\n\nComcast and its cable peers' mobile offerings rely on the wireless network of Verizon, as well as customers' home broadband networks and Wi-Fi hotspots. Only broadband customers of Comcast can sign up for mobile service through the company.\n\nCable companies have said their mobile businesses reduce so-called churn, or the loss of customers, and have been key to gaining new subscribers and driving revenue growth.\n\nCavanagh on Thursday said the company would push to simplify its bundles, following the lead of Charter's mobile and broadband offerings. In September, Charter unveiled a series of changes to its plans, including bundles with mobile, with CEO Chris Winfrey telling CNBC the company \"wanted to make a bold statement.\"\n\nDisclosure: Comcast owns CNBC parent company NBCUniversal.",

Of that, 131,000 were residential subscribers and 8,000 business subscribers.\n\nLast month, Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson warned that the firm expected to see a loss of 100,000 broadband customers.\n\nQ4 Results Top Estimates\n\nThe news offset strong fourth-quarter results.

The escalating losses reflect competitive challenges as mobile providers like Verizon (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS), and AT&T (T) have been able to attract lower-income consumers with more flexible offerings.\n\nStill, the company said it remains committed to its connectivity business and announced strategic changes to \"play to [its] strengths\" as internet traffic rapidly expands amid the streaming boom.\n\n\"Wireless is a meaningful differentiator as our converged offers provide great savings to the consumer,\" Comcast president Michael Cavanagh said on the earnings call. \"And so you will see us shift our strategy to package mobile with more of our higher-tier broadband products, both for new and many of our existing customers.\"\n\nComcast's broadband struggles come as the company also reported a decline of 311,000 TV consumers as more consumers cut the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. The company recently announced a new sports and news TV package, which includes Peacock, for a price of $70 a month. To note, that's less than virtual competitor YouTube TV (GOOGL, GOOG).\n\nOn the earnings call, the company continued to stress the importance of Peacock, although it did not add or lose any subscribers in the quarter, with total paying users remaining at 36 million.\n\nComcast did improve profitability, reporting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $372 million compared to a loss of $825 million in the same period last year. Losses are expected to improve throughout the course of the year, according to management.\n\nAnd as MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett pointed out, \"There was no fall-off in subscribers after the end of Summer Olympics. That\u2019s a win.\"\n\nStill, others on Wall Street have remained cautious about the streamer's bumpy path relative to other streaming giants.\n\n\"Peacock is finding out that it's expensive to compete in the streaming wars and gains are becoming more difficult to come by,\" Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, wrote in reaction to the report. \"As cord-cutting continues unabated, the decision to sell off TV networks continues to make sense, but buyer prospects of these assets will be limited.\"",

It added 307,000 mobile subscribers \u2013 the company offers the service through a deal with Verizon \u2013 for a total of 7.8 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s new converged packages are set to launch \u201cin the coming months\u201d in upgraded areas where Comcast can offer fixed broadband speeds more on par with fiber, about half of its footprint. Cavanaugh said the plans would be \u201csimplified,\u201d aimed at reducing friction for subscribers, and that the company would aim to grow revenue from those customers at a faster clip.\n\nThe big mobile carriers and Charter are already leaning into convergence, which appears to be better at keeping customers around than mobile or fixed broadband products alone.\n\nComcast executives said they\u2019re still seeing headwinds on the fixed broadband front: stiff competition from fixed wireless offered by the mobile carriers and fiber overbuilding, plus the June 2024 shutdown of the low-income broadband subsidy that supported more than million households.\n\nNew Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin wrote in an investor note that he expects those losses to get better in 2025, but not reverse.\n\n\u201cWe and others had expected a return to growth at some point over the next two years, but that expectation started to evaporate as we gained a better understanding around the impact of immigration on household growth,\u201d Chaplin wrote in an investor note after the call. \u201cSince early January, we have been warning that Cable adds would likely stay negative for the next four years.\u201d\n\nBut negative adds might not be so bad, as long as they don\u2019t get worse, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. He noted that the wireless carriers are pushing convergence offerings, but cable giants like Comcast are the ones with large national wireline footprints \u2013 the company counts more than 31 million total subscribers and more than 60 million passings.\n\n\u201cThe TelCos\u2019 focus on convergence, if successful in training customers to buy broadband and wireless together, would only supercharge Comcast\u2019s growth,\u201d he wrote in a research note. \u201cFor the market to begin focusing on the wireless opportunity, broadband subscribership doesn\u2019t need to grow. It only needs to stabilize.\u201d\n\nMoffett agreed subscriber losses have peaked, but that 2025 \u201cwon\u2019t be great,\u201d just not as bad as 2024.",

The changes in Adjusted EBITDA margins are presented as year/year basis point changes in the rounded Adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nRevenue for Residential Connectivity & Platforms was consistent with the prior year period, driven by increases in domestic wireless, international connectivity, domestic broadband and advertising revenue, offset by decreases in video and other revenue. Domestic wireless revenue increased due to an increase in the number of customer lines and device sales. International connectivity revenue increased due to increases in broadband revenue from higher average rates and in wireless revenue, primarily reflecting higher sales of wireless services, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency. Domestic broadband revenue increased due to higher average rates. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to higher domestic political advertising, partially offset by lower domestic nonpolitical and international advertising. Excluding political advertising, advertising revenue decreased about 6%. Video revenue decreased due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an overall increase in average rates. Other revenue decreased primarily due to lower residential wireline voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of customers.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased 3.2%, including $291 million of severance in the quarter and $380 million of severance and other in the prior year period. Excluding these charges as well as the impact of foreign currency7, Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4%, including the modest negative impact associated with Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Programming expenses decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of domestic video customers, partially offset by rate increases under our domestic programming contracts. Excluding severance and other, non-programming expenses increased primarily reflecting an increase in direct product costs and marketing and promotion costs, which were reduced in the prior year period by one-time items in our international business. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 36.0%. Excluding severance and other and the impact of foreign currency7, Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points.\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n\n($ in millions) Constant\n\nCurrency\n\nChange5 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Revenue $2,448 $2,361 3.7% 3.7% Operating Expenses 1,085 1,057 2.6% 2.5% Adjusted EBITDA $1,363 $1,303 4.6% 4.6% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 55.7 % 55.2 % 50 bps 50 bps Change percentages represent year/year growth rates. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA margins are presented as year/year basis point changes in the rounded Adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nRevenue for Business Services Connectivity increased due to an increase in revenue from enterprise solutions offerings and an increase in revenue from small business customers driven by higher average rates.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Business Services Connectivity increased 4.6%, including $39 million of severance in the quarter and $42 million of severance in the prior year period. Excluding severance7, Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.3%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily due to increases in direct product costs and marketing and promotion expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 55.7%. Excluding severance7, Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points.\n\nContent & Experiences\n\n($ in millions) 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Content & Experiences Revenue Media $7,222 $6,979 3.5 % Studios 3,269 3,064 6.7 % Theme Parks 2,374 2,371 0.1 % Headquarters & Other 17 19 (9.2 %) Eliminations (804 ) (933 ) 13.8 % Total Content & Experiences Revenue $12,078 $11,500 5.0 % Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA Media $298 $108 175.2 % Studios 569 308 84.7 % Theme Parks 838 872 (3.9 %) Headquarters & Other (189 ) (337 ) 43.9 % Eliminations (26 ) (20 ) (28.9 %) Total Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA $1,491 $932 60.0 %\n\nRevenue for Content & Experiences increased compared to the prior year period primarily driven by Media and Studios. Adjusted EBITDA for Content & Experiences increased 60.0%, including $101 million of severance in the quarter primarily in Media and $101 million of severance in the prior year period primarily in Headquarters and Other. Excluding severance7, Adjusted EBITDA increased 54.2%, primarily due to increases in Studios and Media, partially offset by a decrease in Theme Parks.\n\nMedia\n\n($ in millions) 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Revenue Domestic Advertising $2,645 $2,635 0.4 % Domestic Distribution 2,885 2,747 5.0 % International Networks 1,090 1,047 4.1 % Other 603 550 9.6 % Total Revenue $7,222 $6,979 3.5 % Operating Expenses 6,923 6,871 0.8 % Adjusted EBITDA $298 $108 175.2 %\n\nRevenue for Media increased primarily due to higher domestic distribution revenue. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers compared to the prior year period. International networks revenue increased primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency and an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports networks. Domestic advertising revenue was consistent primarily due to an increase in revenue at Peacock, offset by lower revenue at our networks.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Media increased due to higher revenue and consistent operating expenses. The consistent operating expenses reflect consistent programming and production costs and lower marketing and promotion expenses, offset by higher other expenses, primarily due to severance this quarter. Programming and production expenses were consistent due to a combination of lower programming costs at Peacock and lower domestic sports programming costs at our networks, offset by an increase in content costs at our entertainment television networks, which were impacted by the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild work stoppages in the prior year period. Media results include $1.3 billion of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $372 million related to Peacock, compared to $1.0 billion of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $825 million in the prior year period.\n\nStudios\n\n($ in millions) 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Revenue Content Licensing $2,383 $2,375 0.3 % Theatrical 515 343 50.0 % Other 371 345 7.6 % Total Revenue $3,269 $3,064 6.7 % Operating Expenses 2,700 2,756 (2.0 %) Adjusted EBITDA $569 $308 84.7 %\n\nRevenue for Studios increased primarily due to higher theatrical revenue. Theatrical revenue increased due to the successful performance of recent releases, including Wicked and The Wild Robot. Content licensing revenue was consistent as higher content licensing revenue at our television studios was offset by lower content licensing revenue at our film studios, primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, including the impacts of the work stoppages in the prior year period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Studios increased due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses was due to lower marketing and promotion expenses. Programming and production expenses were consistent, reflecting lower film costs, offset by higher television studio costs due to the higher content licensing sales this quarter compared to the prior year period which was impacted by the work stoppages.\n\nTheme Parks\n\n($ in millions) 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Revenue $2,374 $2,371 0.1% Operating Expenses 1,535 1,499 2.4% Adjusted EBITDA $838 $872 (3.9%)\n\nRevenue for Theme Parks was consistent with the prior year period, due to lower revenue at our domestic theme parks, driven by lower guest attendance, offset by higher revenue at our international theme parks.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks decreased, reflecting consistent revenue and higher operating expenses, including around $35 million of pre-opening costs in the quarter for the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, which is scheduled to open on May 22, 2025.\n\nHeadquarters & Other\n\nContent & Experiences Headquarters & Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter was $189 million, compared to a loss of $337 million, including severance, in the prior year period.\n\nEliminations\n\nAmounts represent eliminations of transactions between our Content & Experiences segments, the most significant being content licensing between the Studios and Media segments, which are affected by the timing of recognition of content licenses. Revenue eliminations were $804 million, compared to $933 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a loss of $26 million, compared to a loss of $20 million in the prior year period.\n\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\n\n($ in millions) 4th Quarter 2024 2023 Change Corporate & Other Revenue $784 $760 3.2 % Operating Expenses 1,268 1,254 1.2 % Adjusted EBITDA ($484 ) ($494 ) 2.0 % Eliminations Revenue ($1,411 ) ($1,426 ) (1.0 %) Operating Expenses (1,369 ) (1,420 ) (3.6 %) Adjusted EBITDA ($42 ) ($5 ) N M NM=comparison not meaningful.\n\nCorporate & Other\n\nCorporate & Other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs; our Sky-branded video services and television networks in Germany; Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo. Corporate & Other Adjusted EBITDA was relatively consistent with the prior year period.\n\nEliminations\n\nAmounts represent eliminations of transactions between Connectivity & Platforms, Content & Experiences and other businesses, the most significant being distribution of television network programming between the Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, consistent with the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a loss of $42 million compared to a loss of $5 million in the prior year period.\n\nNotes: 1 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 3 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 4 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 5 Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 6 Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and disaggregated in accordance with GAAP. 7 From time to time, we may present adjusted information (e.g., Adjusted Revenues) to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges affecting period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 7 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNumerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts, unless otherwise noted. The change in Peacock paid subscribers is calculated using rounded paid subscriber amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding.\n\nConference Call and Other Information\n\nComcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, January 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

            "content": "Xfinity home internet users, your experience is about to get better thanks to this new Comcast upgrade. If you're a gamer, this upgrade could impact you the most. In January, Comcast announced a new technology that would significantly reduce your network latency, bringing a smoother experience for Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Valve\u2019s Steam users. Whether prepping for a FaceTime call with your friends, streaming a new show or getting ready to play Portal 2, this news might be music to your ears. Read on to learn which cities will have this upgrade first.\n\nXfinity Internet is available to more than 63 million homes nationwide. A spokesperson from Xfinity tells CNET that working latency was reduced by 78% after trials on this new technology.\n\nWhat will this technology do?\n\nXfinity\u2019s launching of a new open standard technology means that it will be for public use, but it may take some time before it\u2019s fully integrated and available across the country. According to a company press release, this new technology will significantly lower users\u2019 latency, which will be optimal for a smoother online and gaming experience.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nIn most markets, Xfinity users can expect maximum download speeds of 1,000 or 1,200 megabits per second, which is plenty for the average American household. But speeds aren\u2019t everything.\n\n\u201cModern applications are real-time and interactive and require more than just fast speeds. Xfinity Internet\u2019s lower lag times will be a differentiator for Comcast,\u201d Emily Waldorf, senior vice president of consumer products for Comcast Connectivity and Platforms, writes in a company press release.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWhat does this mean for your home internet?\n\nCNET\n\nAs you\u2019ve heard from CNET time and time again, fiber internet is generally our top pick due to its fast, symmetrical speeds and overall value for your service. But Xfinity\u2019s cable internet also features solid speeds and a wide variety of plan selections. This launch of its low-latency technology could significantly enhance its cable internet service. According to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission, Xfinity\u2019s cable internet offerings are available to over 34% of the country, so this impacts approximately one in every three households. But why is Xfinity\u2019s new working latency so important in the first place?\n\nWhat is working latency and why is it important?\n\nThis is not to be confused with traditional or \u201cidle latency,\u201d which measures how fast data is transferred from one point to another on the network. Working latency measures a connection's actual lag or delay under normal circumstances. For example, working latency is the delay you may experience while using multiple applications simultaneously. In other words, this technology could benefit videoconferencing, online gaming and virtual reality.\n\nHow does latency impact gamers?\n\nThe higher the latency, the more lag gamers can experience throughout a game. If you're playing a game with high stakes, your latency can make or break your gaming experience. According to a recent report from Liquid Web, over a thousand gamers were surveyed on the effects of latency and 95% complained about experiencing latency issues while gaming. These gamers were reported to play games on PC, Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo.\n\nHere are some of the key findings from that report that provide a better picture of how important latency is:\n\n78% of gamers rage quit due to latency issues while gaming, with Xbox gamers the most likely to do so at 85%.\n\n58% of Call of Duty gamers are most likely to rage quit due to latency issues, followed by Fortnite at 43% and Counter-Strike 2 at 42%.\n\n16% of gamers report that latency issues lead to lingering frustration or anger outside of gaming, lasting for an average of 19 minutes afterward.\n\nIt's safe to say that a low latency can benefit many gamers, ensuring less frustration and a better overall gaming experience.\n\nWhat applications can benefit from Xfinity's Low-Lag internet?\n\nCNET\n\nXfinity's Low-Lag internet is coming to these cities\n\nThis new technology will be available for different Xfinity gateway router models, such as the XB6, XB7 and XB8. But it won\u2019t be rolled out to all Xfinity cities immediately. Once this software has been fully integrated, all other modems will be equipped with this technology down the road.\n\nResidents in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Philadelphia, Rockville, Maryland, and San Francisco will soon have access to this new software upgrade. Comcast writes in a company press release that they plan on \u201cdeploying [this technology] in more locations across the country rapidly over the next few months.\u201d\n\nXfinity's Ultra Low-Lag Internet FAQs:\n\nWhat is Xfinity's Ultra Low-Lag internet? This is a new software upgrade available to Xfinity home internet users. This technology significantly lowers network latency and can improve the quality of gaming, streaming and even FaceTime calls. According to Xfinity, this technology can benefit Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Valve Steam users the most.\n\nWhat is the difference between idle and working latency? Xfinity's new Ultra Low-lag technology deals with working latency, which measures a connection's actual lag or delay under normal circumstances. For instance, working latency can show up as the delay between a user's action and the results on a system. On the other hand, traditional or \"idle latency\" measures how fast data is transferred from one point to another on the network.\n\nWhere can I find Xfinity's Ultra Low-Lag internet? At first, only a select few US cities will be able to access Xfinity's new software upgrade. Xfinity will deploy this technology first in these cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Philadelphia, Rockville, Maryland, and San Franciso. Comcast writes in a press release that they plan on \"deploying [this technology] in more locations across the country rapidly over the next few months.\"",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation on Thursday reported fourth quarter (Q4) revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, but the telecommunications firm continues to struggle with broadband Internet and cable TV subscriber losses that have weighed down that part of its business.\n\nComcast ended Q4 with 131,000 fewer residential Xfinity Internet subscribers, with its customer count logged at 29.373 million at the end of 2024. Another 8,000 business customers logged off Xfinity Internet during the three-month period that ended in late December, with Comcast counting 2.469 million Xfinity Internet business customers. All told, Comcast has 31.842 million Xfinity Internet residential and small business accounts.\n\nThe broadband losses were wider than the projection of 100,000 accounts Comcast offered to investors last year. The company continues to face pressure from fixed wireless broadband Internet services offered by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, and satellite-based broadband startups like Starlink, which afford greater connection flexibility and can be purchased at a discount when bundled with wireless phone services.\n\nComcast\u2019s pay TV business continues to erode as well, with the company reporting 12.523 million Xfinity TV subscribers, a loss of 311,000 accounts compared to Q4 2023. As with other pay TV businesses, Comcast has raised TV prices on subscribers in order to offset distribution fees charged by broadcasters and cable network programmers for the right to distribute their channels.\n\nTotal customer relationships dipped to 51.6 million, largely driven by gains in its Xfinity Mobile product and its overseas customer count. Comcast operates Sky Group, which provides satellite TV and broadband Internet services in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and other countries.\n\nOn a conference call with investors on Thursday, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said the company will lean into opportunities to bundle home Internet service with wireless phone going forward.\n\n\u201cWireless is a meaningful differentiator as our converged offers provide great savings to the consumer,\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cSo, you will see us shift our strategy to package mobile with more of our higher-tier broadband products, both for new and many of our existing customers.\u201d\n\nComcast also did not offer much of an update on the health of its Peacock business, though it did say the company ended 2024 with 36 million paid subscribers. Customer count was flat between Q3 and Q4, according to earnings data, while revenue attributed to Peacock dipped to $1.3 billion during Q4.\n\nComcast bundles Peacock with its Stream Saver product, which includes Netflix and Apple TV Plus, and recently announced plans to incorporate Peacock into its \u201cSports & News TV\u201d package for Xfinity TV and Xfinity Internet subscribers.\n\nThe company saw a significant uptake in Peacock subscribers during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, which offered all events live on the platform (though data from Nielsen and Adobe Analytics proved most people still watched NBC\u2019s coverage of the games on broadcast and cable).\n\nSome analysts, including Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, took Comcast\u2019s decision to not update its subscriber count for Peacock as a sign that there \u201cwas no fall-off in subscribers at the end of the Summer Olympics.\u201d Moffett declared it a \u201cwin\u201d for Comcast, though he offered no specific information to prove that the company did not see any churn at Peacock between Q3 and Q4.\n\nOther analysts offered a more-measured approach.\n\n\u201cPeacock is finding out that it\u2019s expensive to compete in the streaming wars and gains are becoming more difficult to come by,\u201d Ross Benes, the senior analyst at Emarketer (stylized as EMARKETER), said in a report.\n\nBenes remarked on a recent decision by Comcast to prioritize around its streaming TV future by spinning off most of its cable TV networks \u2014 except Bravo \u2014 into a standalone company.\n\n\u201cAs cord-cutting continues unabated, the decision to sell off TV networks continues to make sense, but buyer prospects of these assets will be limited,\u201d Benes said.\n\nOverall, Comcast\u2019s revenue was $31.915 billion during Q4, an increase of 2.1 percent, while its year-end revenue clocked in at $123.731 billion, a bump of nearly 2 percent.\n\n\u2014\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An initial version of this story erroneously said Comcast did not report subscriber figures for Peacock during its Q4 and full-year earnings update. The company reported no subscriber growth between Q3 and Q4, but did provide a hard count of 36 million paid subscribers.",

(Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.)\n\nThe technology powering this upgrade is based on a standard called L4S, which stands for \u201cLow Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput.\u201d My former colleague Mitchell Clark has a thorough explainer of what L4S is supposed to do, but the intention is that the tech can significantly reduce latency so that things like video games are smoother and video calls feel more like talking in real life without awkward delays and pauses.\n\nL4S pulls this off by giving internet packets an indicator that lets them know if they\u2019ve run into congestion or queueing along any of the hops in their trip between a user and whatever they\u2019re connecting to. If there is a delay, then the devices can start to adjust to stop making the congestion worse \u2014 and possibly eliminate it entirely.\n\nRelated The quiet plan to make the internet feel faster\n\nAs Mitchell explains, it can\u2019t bend the laws of physics to make data travel faster than the speed of light, but it can reduce the extra delays in the middle that have been slowing your connections down. While the bandwidth upgrades we\u2019ve seen over the years from dial-up to broadband have increased the amount of information transmitted, this change will actually make the internet feel faster for once.\n\nComcast says that you\u2019ll initially see the low-latency improvements with FaceTime, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now, \u201cmany games\u201d on Steam, and \u201capps on Meta\u2019s mixed reality headsets that will support this technology.\u201d Apple, Nvidia, and Valve all collaborated with Comcast during its trials of the technology, and Apple has had support for L4S built into its devices since iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma.\n\nComcast also notes that the tech will \u201cexpand to any additional content and application providers who choose to leverage the new open standard technology for their own products.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t tried the tech myself, so I can\u2019t personally speak to how the latency improvements feel in practice. But according to Comcast spokesperson Joel Shadle, during the trials, \u201cwe were able to reduce our working latency \u2013 the latency under normal conditions in the home when people are using the Internet \u2013 by 78 percent,\u201d meaning that Comcast customers \u201cshould expect to see significant improvement.\u201d\n\nWhen it\u2019s \u201cfully deployed,\u201d Comcast says its low-latency tech will be available to \u201call Xfinity Internet customers.\u201d",

            "content": "Comcast is rolling out low-latency DOCSIS and extolling the benefits of low-latency internet for consumers\n\nIs the industry finally getting somewhere with marketing and monetizing the low-latency aspect of advanced networks? Maybe, if you look at Comcast. As Comcast rolls out a new DOCSIS-based network that implements the Internet Engineering Task Force\u2019s (IETF) Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) open standards, the cable company is specifically calling out the lower latency as a differentiator for its Xfinity Internet services.\n\nComcast says that through the use of this \u201clow latency DOCSIS,\u201d or LLD, the latency of its Xfinity Internet \u201cwill be dramatically reduced to faster than the blink of an eye\u201d and called out specific technologies where consumers can expect to have a better experience: When using FaceTime on Apple smartphones, tablets, computer and TVs; when using apps on Meta\u2019s mixed reality headsets that support L4s; NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW gaming service and \u201cmany games on Valve\u2019s Steam games platform\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur connectivity is the key to unlocking a world of entertainment, sports, news and information and we\u2019re constantly pushing the limits of network innovation to create an experience that exceeds the expanding demands of our customers,\u201d said Emily Waldorf, SVP of Consumer Products, Comcast Connectivity and Platforms. \u201cModern applications are real-time and interactive and require more than just fast speeds. Xfinity Internet\u2019s lower lag times will be a differentiator for Comcast.\u201d\n\nNotably, a Comcast press release also compared L4S favorably to 5G-based broadband services, saying that over its L4S DOCSIS network, \u201cLatency-sensitive applications will experience less delay, and a smoother, more responsive end-to-end online experience compared to other options like 5G home Internet, where the network gets bogged down and the connection deteriorates when a lot of people are online.\u201d\n\nAs Comcast explained in a blog post, the L4S standards specify how network links can implement a new data packet processing function for latency-sensitive traffic in order to achieve ultra-low latency. App developers mark their traffic as latency-sensitive in order for that traffic to be managed appropriately. Comcast says that the application marking \u201cis entirely voluntary and available for use with no special cost, agreement, or proprietary APIs\u201d. There also needs to be device-level support, and Comcast named a number of Apple products as well as its Xfinity 10G Gateway (XB7 and XB8 models) or the Arris S33 or Netgear CM1000v2 internet gateways as having supported its DOCSIS trials with L4S.\n\nComcast said that its initial rollout of DOCSIS with L4S includes Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Philadelphia, Rockville (Maryland) and San Francisco, with deployments in more locations coming \u201crapidly over the next few months.\u201d When fully deployed, Comcast said that the low-latency service will be available to all of its Xfinity Internet customers.\n\nIn other test news:\n\n\u2013Rohde & Schwarz announced its new ScopeStudio software, which enables enables the import of oscilloscope waveforms or entire sessions from the company\u2019s MXO oscilloscope series and mirrors the instruments\u2019 analysis and measurement capabilities on a PC. R&S says there are three advantages here: leaving the instrument available for someone else to use, being able to use other PC-based tools to document designs with better images and annotations, and easier sharing of technical results across development teams.\n\nThe test company also said this week that it plans to hold its two-day Demystifying EMC 2025 virtual conference, focused on testing and demonstrations related to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), on February 11 and 12. More details available here.\n\n-ICYMI: It looks like a potential mega-merger of testing and certification labs isn\u2019t going to pan out. Both SGS and Bureau Veritas confirmed this week that merger talks between the two companies, which could have resulted in a $30+ billion combined testing and certification company, have ended with no deal.\n\nInterestingly, though, Bureau Veritas\u2014which has made a number of smaller acquisitions in the past few months and has been clear that active M&A is part of its growth strategy\u2014 indicated in its company statement that the talks ended without an agreement \u201cdespite a strong belief in the value of consolidation in the Testing, Inspection and Certification sector.\u201d We\u2019ll have to see if that means a different merger target will emerge.\n\n\u2013Keysight Technologies had a number of announcements this week, including a partnership with semiconductor company KD to create comprehensive physical layer testing for multi-gigabit optical automotive Ethernet; a new design and test solution for memory systems; and the signing of its first virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA). The VPPA with Southern Power will match the entirety of Keysight\u2019s U.S. and Canadian power usage with renewable energy produced in Texas. The renewable power expansion project is expected to come online in Keysight\u2019s fiscal year 2027.\n\n-A new report from BCC Research estimates that the market for IoT testing services will reach $10.4 billion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of more than 22% on a global basis. The firm said that the market growth is being driven by adoption of automated testing tools, more IoT testing-as-a-service and demand for 5G-related IoT testing.\n\n\u2013Spirent Communications finished out 2024 with a \u201cstrong uptick of order growth\u201d compared to the same time in 2023, the company said in a trading update. While Spirent said that market conditions are still challenging, it added that it is seeing \u201cearly signs of market recovery,\u201d with order growth in the second half of 2024 at 5%, which mitigated a weak first half of the year. Full-year orders, accordingly, reached \u201ccomparable\u201d levels to 2023, the company added. Read more details in this piece.\n\n-Test conglomerate Fortive announced this week that Sharmistha \u201cShar\u201d Dubey will succeed Alan G. Spoon as chair of the board. Spoon plans to retire, and will not be up for reelection at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in June 2025.\n\nSpoon has served as chair of the Fortive board of directors since the company was spun off from Danaher in 2016, and said that it was \u201cthe right time to elevate new leadership to guide the company in its next exciting chapter.\u201d\n\nHe added: :Shar has extensive strategic, operational, and executive leadership experience as well as deep knowledge of Fortive, which will serve the Board, the company, and our shareholders well. I have the utmost faith in her ability to continue to steward innovation and success at Fortive.\u201d\n\nDubey has served as a director on the Fortive board since 2020.

The technology has been in testing since 2023.\n\nDrastically reduced latency\n\nWith this launch, Comcast explains, latency for FaceTime on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro, apps for Meta's mixed reality headsets like the Quest 3, many Steam games, and NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, will be drastically reduced. In the future, \"other applications that choose to leverage this open standard technology\" will be supported as well.\n\nAlso: Slow home internet? 3 simple things I always check first for faster Wi-Fi\n\nThe company offered a surprise speed boost to customers about a year ago, but this change will make your current internet feel faster without actually increasing bandwidth. Just because it's available to customers, though, that doesn't mean everyone will see the benefit. The device or application you're using will need to support low-latency connectivity.\n\nXfinity offers up to 2,000Mbps connectivity across a wide part of the nation, but speed isn't everything. If data has a delay, or latency, as it transfers from one point to another (especially for latency-sensitive applications like those listed above), you're going to have a slow experience. Comcast's new venture focuses on ensuring each bit of information travels more quickly. If there's a slowdown, the devices can adjust to either lessen the blockage or even eliminate it entirely.\n\nAvailability\n\nWhen fully deployed, the new technology will be available to all Xfinity Internet customers.\n\nAlso: I turned my Starlink Mini into a near-perfect off-grid internet solution.

The company plans to eventually roll out the feature to all its Xfinity Internet customers.\n\nAccording to Comcast spokesperson Joel Shadle, L4S trials have shown that \"we were able to reduce working latency\u2014the latency under normal conditions in the home when people are using the Internet\u2014by 78 percent.\"\n\nL4S, which stands for \"Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput,\" is a technology that assigns indicators to packets of Internet traffic. These indicators show when traffic gets congested from point A to point B, allowing the devices on either end to adjust to this issue. In theory, this should reduce or even eliminate congestion.\n\nOf course, this doesn't magically increase bandwidth, especially throughput in raw download/upload speed. However, more intelligent traffic routing and management on the client and host sides can make a big difference. Comcast has been developing and testing this with help from Valve, Nvidia, and Apple. This should mean improved performance with game streaming, online gaming in general, and real-time video calling (mainly through FaceTime).\n\nFor those familiar with Internet traffic, you may already know the concept of \"QoS,\" or Quality of Service. Quality of Service typically happens within a router or a data center, where packets are sorted by type and latency sensitivity to ensure real-time gaming and video streaming function as intended. Not all QoS implementations are created equally, though, and it's usually understood as an optional router setting.\n\nComcast is now doing L4S similarly, but it is a bit more advanced to allow for more dynamic traffic adjustments even within specific types of traffic, not just how that traffic is allocated within given bandwidth constraints. While hands-on testing of L4S has yet to be seen, lowering latency for online calls or gaming, especially game-streaming, is imperative for a consistent and reliable experience. And trust me: playing competitively in today's market of high-refresh rate monitors and high-end PCs owned by your opponents, you want every bit of latency reduction you can get.\n\nDon't be a weird monster who insists on running games at uncapped framerates. If you're too lazy to find the right in-engine FPS cap, please set a framerate cap, even Nvidia Reflex or AMD Anti-Lag 2. Variable framerate means variable input lag, and maximizing GPU resources contributes to higher input lag in general and worsens performance dips where they occur since you have no overhead to compensate.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.",

In the quarter under review, CMCSA announced the launch of an early preview of the Multiview experience on X1 for sports fans, and will allow users to toggle between channels.\n\n\n\nThe company also announced the availability Crunchyroll app on Xfinity X1, Flex, Xumo Stream Box and Xumo TVs, offering more than 25,000 hours of anime.\n\n\n\nComcast announced its multi-year deals with Warner Bros. Discovery WBD to bring WBD\u2019s TV networks, HBO and streaming services like Max and Discovery+ to Xfinity, Sky UK and NOW TV customers.\n\n\n\nThe launch of NOW TV Latino, a new service targeting Spanish-speaking audiences, which is priced at $10 per month with no contract or additional fees, is expected to have gained popularity and adoption in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company's streaming platform, Peacock, is expected to have continued its growth trajectory. The rising popularity of Xfinity StreamSaver, a streaming bundle of Peacock, Netflix NFLX and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+ is likely to have been a game changer.\n\n\n\nWith its diverse content offerings, including popular TV shows, sports programming and original series, Peacock is likely to have attracted more subscribers and generated increased revenues. Peacock\u2019s revenues in the third quarter jumped 82% to $1.5 billion. Peacock\u2019s paid subscribers increased nearly 29% year over year to 36 million.\n\n\n\nComcast's Theme Park business is anticipated to have performed better, buoyed by slow yet steady occupancy rates across its global locations, including Orlando, Hollywood, Osaka and Beijing. In the third quarter, Theme Parks revenues declined 5.3% year over year to $2.29 billion.\n\n\n\nCMCSA's business services segment is likely to have shown resilience, potentially benefiting from an expanding client base drawn to the company's advanced network infrastructure. New and cost-effective mobile plans by Comcast Business are expected to have aided growth in new small business customers.\n\n\n\nAs Comcast prepares to release its fourth-quarter 2024 results, it continues to navigate a complex landscape shaped by evolving consumer behaviors, intense competition and broader economic trends.\n\n\n\nComcast\u2019s top line is expected to have reflected a slowing broadband subscriber base as the market shows signs of saturation. In the third quarter, Comcast lost 87K domestic broadband customers. Moreover, it lost 365K video customers.\n\n\n\nThe hybrid working model adopted by many companies post-pandemic has potentially reduced the urgency for high-speed home Internet upgrades. Additionally, increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber-based networks might have negatively impacted subscriber growth and retention.\n\n\n\nThe ongoing shift away from traditional cable TV services has been a significant hurdle for Comcast. The cord-cutting phenomenon, driven by the proliferation of streaming alternatives, is likely to have further eroded the company's video subscriber base. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV+ continue to offer compelling content at competitive prices, putting pressure on CMCSA's traditional cable business.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nIs AT&T or Xfinity internet better?\n\nAT&T and Xfinity are two of the biggest internet providers in the country. But which one is a better fit for your home? AT&T Fiber has faster download and upload speeds, better service terms and higher customer satisfaction than Xfinity, but it also has slightly higher pricing for comparable speeds. However, fiber internet from AT&T isn't available everywhere. That makes Xfinity the better option in terms of availability, cheap internet and discounted bundle packages, at least until the introductory pricing period (typically one to two years) ends and standard pricing goes into effect.\n\nWith a combined 69% nationwide coverage, according to the FCC, and overlap in significant portions of each other's networks -- the odds of you having to choose internet service between AT&T and Xfinity are fairly high.\n\nXfinity's pricing and available speeds vary by location, so the provider's savings over AT&T Fiber will depend on where you live. Additionally, select Xfinity markets may also have contract requirements for some of its plans, a 1.25 terabyte data cap (with potential overage fees) and a fee for opting to rent equipment. AT&T Fiber, on the other hand, has straightforward service terms: equipment is free and there are no data caps or contracts.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nIt's safe to say that whichever option you choose, both providers are among the best ISPs nationwide, so you really can't go wrong with either. In the most recent surveys from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power Survey, AT&T and Xfinity finished with above-average ratings among major internet providers.\n\nWhich ISP better suits your home networking needs -- AT&T or Xfinity? Let's examine how they compare.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nAT&T A frontrunner among fiber internet providers Our take - AT&T fiber plans are tough to beat, offering top-notch high-speed internet. Five-speed tiers are available: 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 megabits per second, and prices range from $55 to $245 per month. Starting prices are a bit higher than Xfinity's, but there are no set price increases after 12 months and no equipment fees to add to your bill. Read full review . . . Or call to learn more: (855) 900-7736 Check with AT&T Show more details Compare\n\nXfinity A top choice for cable internet Our take - With Xfinity, you can expect more plan options and a cheaper starting plan than AT&T. However, watch out for a price increase after your promotional period. It could add as much as $20 to $50 to your bill, depending on where you live and your chosen plan. In some markets, Xfinity charges a $15 to $20 equipment fee if you rent a router, but you can avoid that fee if you decide to purchase your own equipment. If you live in the West region, your equipment may be included in the first or second year of service. Finally, in select markets, Xfinity might be a faster option than AT&T Fiber, offering a 10,000Mbps fiber plan. Read full review . . . Or call to learn more: (844) 577-0451 Check with Xfinity Show more details Compare\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity plans, pricing and speeds\n\nBelow is an overview of AT&T Fiber and Xfinity internet plans. Xfinity speeds, pricing and service terms may vary depending on your region and chosen plan. I included only plan details for AT&T Fiber because if your choice comes down to Xfinity and AT&T's fixed wireless services, you should go with Xfinity.\n\nAT&T Fiber plans\n\nAT&T Fiber plans Starting monthly price Max download speeds Max upload speeds Equipment fee Data cap Contract Fiber 300 $55 300Mbps 300Mbps None None None Fiber 500 $65 500Mbps 500Mbps None None None Fiber Gig $80 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None None None Fiber 2 Gig $145 2,000Mbps 2,000Mbps None None None Fiber 5 Gig $245 5,000Mbps 5,000Mbps None None None Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nXfinity Internet plans (West region)\n\nXfinity Plan Starting monthly Max download speeds Max upload speeds Equipment fee Data cap Contract Connect $20 150Mbps 20Mbps $15 gateway rental (optional) 1.25TB 1-year Connect More $40 300Mbps 20Mbps $15 gateway rental (optional) 1.25TB 1-year Fast $60 500Mbps 20Mbps Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months) 1.25TB 1-year Superfast $65 800Mbps 20Mbps Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months) 1.25TB None Gigabit $70 1,000Mbps 20Mbps Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months) 1.25TB 1-year Gigabit Extra $85 1,200Mbps 40Mbps Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 24 months) 1.25TB 1-year Gigabit x2 $80 2,000Mbps 200Mbps Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months) 1.25TB 1-year Gigabit Pro (fiber) $300 10,000Mbps 10,000Mbps $20 gateway rental (required) None 2-year Show more (3 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nXfinity's speed tiers are fairly consistent throughout all service areas, but pricing may vary slightly from one market to the next. The plans and pricing above reflect the West region. For example, the standard speed for Xfinity Connect is 150Mbps for $20 a month in the West region, but the starting price can vary anywhere from $20 to $30 per month based on where you live.\n\nRates on all plans, excluding the $300-per-month 10 gigabit plan, are set to increase after the first year or two of service, depending on your location and the plan you choose and the chart reflects the standard prices after the promo prices end. Note that the exact price increases may vary depending on your address. Service terms also vary by location and plan as a data cap, equipment fee (if you choose to rent) and contract may apply.\n\nMeanwhile, AT&T Fiber plans, speeds, and terms are simple and straightforward regardless of where in the country you live. The provider's 300, 500, and 1,000Mbps plans are available in all service areas, and many will also have the choice of 2,000 and 5,000Mbps plans. There is no set price increase after 12 months and unlike Xfinity's confusing equipment fees, AT&T offers free equipment for all plans.\n\nFees, data caps and other potential sticking points\n\nAT&T is much clearer about service terms and doesn't offer any hidden fees\u2014but only for its fiber plans. Let's take a closer look.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity added fees\n\nLike most providers, AT&T and Xfinity will charge you a bit extra each month if you don't enroll in autopay or paperless billing, but those fees are easy enough to dodge if you just select autopay when you sign up.\n\nThe equipment fees are another story. With AT&T, you won't need to pay extra to use AT&T's Wi-Fi gateway. That's included in the regular monthly fee. With Comcast Xfinity, the cost to rent the xFi Gateway is $15 per month (or $20 per month for some of the faster plans), but it may be included at no extra charge with your plan. You can also bypass the fee, if there is one, by using your own compatible equipment.\n\nYou'll need to add $14 per month to your Comcast bill to use its xFi Gateway -- but you can skip that fee by using your own modem and router. Comcast\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity data caps\n\nAs for data caps, AT&T doesn't enforce them with any of its fiber plans or its new 5G home internet service, AT&T Internet Air. AT&T's basic fixed wireless plan does enforce a data cap, however, kicking in at 350GB. You'll still get charged $10 for each additional 50GB of data you use, but AT&T caps the charge at $200 instead of $100. Be mindful of falling asleep during a Netflix binge, AT&T Fixed Wireless customers.\n\nXfinity, meanwhile, has a monthly data cap of 1.25TB for certain plans, but some locations may have no data cap at all. If you have a cap, going over may cost you $10 for every 50GB of excess data used, capped at $100.\n\nTo be fair, 1.25TB is a lot of data, but it's not unreasonable to think that a busy household would occasionally need more. For example, on my network, where I work from home, stream plenty of movies in 4K and live with a roommate who's online just as much as I am, we go through about 320GB of data here in the first nine days of the month. That puts us on pace to use just over 1TB by the end of the month.\n\nIf you live with, say, two roommates -- or with a whole family of internet users -- then data caps like those might be something you'd want to steer clear of if you could.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity contracts\n\nAT&T internet service, from fiber to fixed wireless, does not require a contract. However, select markets for Xfinity may require customers to sign a one to two-year agreement for some plans. Canceling or changing your service before the term agreement is up may result in early termination fees and losing the lower introductory rate on service.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity installation costs\n\nAT&T charges $99 for professional, in-home installation, but self-installation kits are available for some addresses and AT&T typically waives the cost for installation for new customers.\n\nWith Xfinity, professional installation typically costs $100, but you don't have to \"qualify\" for the self-installation option like you do with AT&T. However, the self-installation option will incur a one-time charge of $40.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity coverage compared\n\nAT&T's networks (copper in pink, fiber in purple) and Xfinity's cable internet service (green) share coverage areas in the South, Midwest and parts of California. FCC/Mapbox\n\nA product of the nation's largest cable provider, Xfinity Internet, is available in select regions across 39 states and Washington, DC, covering about one-third of the entire population of the US. Most of that coverage is cable internet, but Xfinity has a small fiber network.\n\nAreas where Xfinity's fiber internet service is available primarily include parts Indiana, Illinois and Michigan, though parts of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee may be serviceable for fiber as well.\n\nAs for AT&T, the telecom company offers home internet plans in 22 states, covering much of the South, Midwest and West Coast. Both providers may be available at your address in some parts of the country, including Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Miami and San Francisco.\n\nAT&T pegs the number of households with access to fiber at approximately 21 million, spanning over 100 metro areas. The company plans to expand fiber access to millions more homes by the end of 2025, including the rollout of its multigigabit plans.\n\nFor the rest, there's AT&T Internet Air and AT&T Fixed Wireless, which use a portable modem or satellite mounted at your home to receive a wireless signal, and AT&T Internet, which uses DSL copper cable connections in combination with the company's fiber infrastructure to deliver service to people's homes, albeit it at much slower speeds.\n\nAT&T and Xfinity perks and promos\n\nAT&T typically has limited-time offers for new fiber customers. Currently, AT&T Fiber customers can receive a VISA gift if they sign up online. You may receive a reward of $50, $100 or $150, depending on your chosen tier. Additionally, wherever you are in the country, you'll have access to AT&T's nationwide network of 30,000 hotspots available.\n\nXfinity is no slouch either. It offers a number of enticing promos upon signing for service. For those who are eligible for an Xfinity mobile line, you can shave off $10 to $30 a month from your internet bill for the first two years. Similar to many cable ISPs, Xfinity also gives you several options to bundle your internet with TV package or a mobile line, saving you $10 or more per month. Even better, Xfinity introduced StreamSaver last year, a new streaming service bundle combining Netflix, Peacock and Apple TV Plus for just $15 monthly. If you sign up for the 1,000Mbps and faster plans, Peacock Premium is already included with your service. Like AT&T, Xfinity has over 20 million hotspots nationwide, allowing you to stay connected to the internet wherever you are.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity customer satisfaction scores\n\nACSI\n\nEveryone loves to hate their internet provider, so it's no surprise that customer satisfaction scores for the ISP industry aren't anything impressive. Still, AT&T and Xfinity are relatively strong performers here. AT&T remained at the top year-over-year with an 80 out of 100 from the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index. Xfinity's non-fiber score dropped a bit from 68 to 67 (bringing it just below the industry average of 68), but its fiber rating improved from 73 to 75. Not great, but not bad, either.\n\nMeanwhile, AT&T grabbed the top spot in the North-Central and West regions (while Xfinity scored second-highest in both) in the most recent J.D. Power US Residential Internet Service Provider Satisfaction Study for 2024. Notably, Xfinity just narrowly beat AT&T in the South with a score of 565 to AT&T's 564.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity recap\n\nIf your options are AT&T's fixed wireless service and Xfinity, the latter will be the best choice for speed, value, and reliability nearly every time. On the other hand, if your address is serviceable for AT&T Fiber and Xfinity, you're likely to get a better value with more favorable service terms from AT&T Fiber than Xfinity. Given the choice of the two, Xfinity stands out for its broad availability and low introductory pricing, but AT&T Fiber has the advantage in virtually every other category.\n\nAT&T vs. Xfinity FAQs\n\nWhich is better: AT&T or Xfinity? It depends on whether you can get AT&T Fiber at your address. Xfinity has the fastest plan between the two (the Gigabit Pro plan at 10,000Mbps), but at $300 per month, it's also the most expensive. AT&T has a 5,000Mbps plan that's a bit cheaper at $245 a month. We might lean toward AT&T because of its fiber internet plans, but those aren't available to all customers within its footprint. Others might have to settle for its slower, fixed wireless plans. In those cases, Xfinity and its cable internet plans would be preferable. Show more\n\nIs Xfinity cheaper than AT&T? Among its regular offerings, Xfinity's cheapest plan, depending on where you live, ranges from $20 to $30 per month in the first year. AT&T Fiber's cheapest tier starts at $55 monthly. However, both providers also offer discounted plans for low-income households. Access from AT&T has a 100Mbps plan for $30 per month, while Xfinity has Internet Essentials and Internet Essentials Plus, offering 75Mbps for $15 a month and 100Mbps for $30, respectively.

The payments were part of Comcast\u2019s $39 billion takeover of Sky Group in 2018, a move that brought the news channel under common ownership with NBC News.\n\nLaunched in the late 1980s, Sky News was one of the first modern rivals to television news produced by the United Kingdom\u2019s public service broadcasters \u2014 specifically, the BBC and ITV, the latter of which relied on bulletins from Independent Television News (ITN).\n\nThe channel gained a following for its tabloid-style reporting and right-of-center political coverage, aligning Sky News with newspapers like The Sun and The Times. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of those newspapers, founded Sky Satellite, the operator of Sky News, in 1989.\n\nUnder Comcast\u2019s ownership, the channel has shifted its editorial focus to include more in-depth reporting of Britain\u2019s political affairs and international events. It produced reports from the front lines of multiple wars, including the civil conflict in Syria and the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. Its fearless coverage of climate change, artificial intelligence, government surveillance and political wrongdoings have resulted in numerous awards over the past few years.\n\nStill, Sky News has remained much of an afterthought at Comcast, with the Philadelphia-based company struggling to figure out how to nurture its London-based newsroom while focusing much of its efforts on NBC News. Five years ago, the company laid out plans to consolidate Sky News into NBC News through the launch of a new global news channel called NBC Sky World News. The coronavirus health pandemic caused Comcast to put those plans on indefinite hiatus, and they have not been revisited since.\n\nThe new path for Sky News mirrors that of other major news operations, including CNN, which recently affirmed plans to reorient its channel around digital news production and distribution through online platforms. CNN rolled out a subscription model for its website late last year, and has plans to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service in the coming months.",

            "content": "Comcast Launches Affordable Sports And News Streaming Package The new offering targets budget-conscious viewers with diverse content choices and added perks.\n\nOn January 23, Comcast launched its much-anticipated 'Sports and News' streaming package, priced at $70 per month when bundled with Xfinity Internet service. For those without Xfinity Internet, the package is available for $90. Echoing recent moves by competitors like DIRECTV, which also unveiled their own $70 package aimed at sports and news enthusiasts, Comcast is strategically targeting consumers who are budget-conscious yet eager for specific content without the hassle of paying for extensive channel bundles.\n\nA key feature of Comcast's Sports and News package is its impressive lineup of channels, which promises to deliver coverage across various sports and news platforms. At the launch, it included 52 channels, which cover everything from sports to major news networks, ensuring subscribers have access to both their favorite teams and breaking news. Among the notable channels available are ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC, alongside sports networks like ESPN, Big Ten Network, SEC Network, and the Golf Channel.\n\nComcast hopes this mix appeals directly to its audience. \"Comcast is trying to reach cost-conscious consumers who want to watch specific genres without paying for a more expensive bundle,\" noted Phillip Swann from The TV Answer Man. This sentiment reflects the desires of many viewers today, who increasingly wish to customize their viewing experience according to personal preferences and viewing habits.\n\nUnlike traditional packages, the Sports and News option includes some enticing perks: namely, free access to the ads-included version of Peacock Premium, which typically costs $7.99 per month, along with 300 hours of DVR storage for users who want to save their favorite shows or games. This additional storage is increasingly valuable, allowing viewers to catch up on what they missed without the pressure of live schedules.\n\nComparing Comcast's offering with DIRECTV's new plan, which similarly targets niche markets, it becomes clear there is intense competition within the streaming space. DIRECTV launched its own sports and news package earlier this month, priced at the same competitive rate. This trend showcases how broadcasters are pivoting to focus on specific viewer interests rather than offering broad packages\u2014aligning with the shift in consumer behavior toward more specialized content consumption.\n\nWhile Comcast\u2019s channel offerings may primarily attract sports enthusiasts, they also encompass various news outlets, providing balance for diverse audiences. Subscribers would gain access to popular networks, including CNBC, CNN, FOX News, and MSNBC, ensuring they can stay informed alongside their favorite sports programming. For many, the availability of regional sports networks like NBC Sports Philadelphia sweetens the deal, particularly for local fans who want to follow their hometown teams.\n\nSo, the question remains: will consumers find the 52 channels compelling enough to subscribe at the set price point? Coalition members from the TV industry are watching closely. Comcast's challenge will be to convince potential users not only of the value of the content but of the strategic advantage this package offers over competitors, much like how DIRECTV is facing similar obstacles.\n\nTime will tell if Comcast's new Sports and News streaming package successfully captures the interest of cost-conscious viewers, but judging by the trend of unbundling services, the opportunity seems ripe for them to make significant strides. With sports and news at the core of this offering, Comcast is strategically positioning itself to attract dedicated fans who prioritize access over traditional bundling. The eventual success of this package could redefine how networks structure their offerings, renewing the conversation about consumer preferences and the future of cable versus streaming.",

The goal was to offer more competition to Comcast. While Lumos\u2019 Alexandria plans didn\u2019t take off, Ting started offering fiber internet in March 2023 in the Del Ray, Beverly Hills, North Ridge, and Lynhaven.\n\nThe announcement of the pause is likely not much of a surprise to Alexandrians following the internet company\u2019s stalled progress. In November, the company announced it was laying off 42% of its workforce.\n\nThe company told ALXnow that it has \u201ctemporarily paused fiber deployment\u201d in Alexandria \u201cto ensure the safety and well-being of its residents.\u201d\n\nTing said it \u201cbelieves open and transparent communication is crucial to building strong relationships within the communities we serve.\u201d The company quietly deleted its Alexandria construction status page \u2014 which now redirects to the homepage.\n\nThe company has been notorious for striking other utilities while digging to install fiber lines in Alexandria and an outage that started on Saturday has not been fully resolved as of noon on Monday.\n\nALXnow reached out to Ting with a series of questions about their Alexandria plans, including how much of the company\u2019s five-zone plan is currently covered by Ting. Ting did not answer the questions but instead sent back questions the company wrote, their own responses, and never responded to follow up questions.\n\nTing PR, Reputation and Social Listening Manager Jasmin Cruell wrote, in response to questions ALXnow did not send:\n\n1. Can you provide an update on the status of Ting\u2019s fiber construction in Alexandria?\n\nWe are partnering with the City of Alexandria, to ensure the safety and well-being of its residents and Ting Internet has temporarily paused fiber deployment. Ting and the City have a regular cadence of communication and are collaborating to ensure optimal coordination with existing city infrastructure. 2. Why did Ting proactively stop construction?\n\nTing Internet prioritizes and understands the importance of minimizing challenges and ensuring the safety of its residents. We acknowledge the recent incidents where crews encountered existing utilities. While we adhere to all required safety protocols, we believe a proactive and collaborative approach is essential for the Alexandria community. We are committed to working closely with the City of Alexandria to ensure a safe and efficient deployment of the fiber network. 3. How is Ting collaborating with the City of Alexandria on this project?\n\nTing and the City of Alexandria remain in regular contact and are committed to a transparent partnership. Together, we strive to balance the safety of all residents with the responsible expansion of high-speed internet options, ensuring the community has greater access and choice. 4. What steps are being taken to ensure public safety when construction resumes?\n\nTing is actively collaborating with the City of Alexandria and maintaining regular communication with city officials to ensure compliance with all relevant requirements and specifications. 5. What is Ting\u2019s timeline for moving forward?\n\nTing Internet and the City of Alexandria remain dedicated to open communication and collaboration as they work closely toward a shared vision for expanded internet choice. 6. How can residents stay informed about construction updates?\n\nWe will work closely with the City of Alexandria to determine the most effective channels to keep residents informed. Ting believes open and transparent communication is crucial to building strong relationships within the communities we serve.",

            "content": "Sixers owner Josh Harris and Mayor Cherelle L. Parker at a City Hall news conference earlier this month to announce the NBA team's new arena plans in South Philadelphia. Read more\n\nThe decision to build a new shared arena and development in the South Philadelphia sports complex is a tremendous victory for Philadelphians. This visionary move honors our neighborhoods, strengthens our existing infrastructure, and brings the jobs and economic growth our city deserves.\n\nThe added potential for a WNBA team is a phenomenal benefit. It is beyond time for Philadelphia to join other great cities by welcoming women\u2019s professional basketball, giving our passionate fans a brand-new team to rally around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis outcome is a testament to the collaboration between two committed stakeholders \u2014 Comcast and Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment, the co-owners of the Sixers \u2014 and the extraordinary leadership of Mayor Cherelle L. Parker.\n\nHaving faced tough battles as mayor and governor myself, I can tell you firsthand that balancing big ideas, high-stakes competing interests, and the demand for results is not easy.\n\nMayor Parker has demonstrated remarkable poise, agility, and command. Though she initially supported the Sixers\u2019 plan for a Center City arena, she quickly recognized that a partnership between Comcast and the Sixers would achieve many of the same goals, delivering not one but two projects for the city.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, she pledged to hold both parties accountable for executing the promised plans. These actions reflect a deep understanding of what makes Philadelphia great: our people, our pride, and our willingness to unite for the common good.\n\nPhiladelphia is not just a great sports town; it\u2019s a city of vibrant communities that deserve real investment. While celebrating the decision to keep our sports teams in South Philadelphia, we must also focus on East Market Street.\n\nAlthough it won\u2019t host an arena, this corridor is brimming with potential.\n\nThe closure of Macy\u2019s in the historic Wanamaker Building leaves a significant void but also presents a golden opportunity to reimagine Market Street, create jobs, and enhance our infrastructure.\n\nThere is no shortage of great ideas by Philadelphians that would bring exciting cultural and entertainment experiences to the corridor.\n\nFor example, in Peter Dobrin\u2019s recent Inquirer article lamenting the uncertain fate of the iconic organ housed in the Wanamaker Building, the brilliant architect and lifelong Philadelphian Richard Maimon proffered an idea of reimagining the Wanamaker Building as the site of a new Philadelphia Museum, focused on the city\u2019s storied industrial past, but built for the future education and enlightenment of Philadelphians and visitors of all generations.\n\nPicture a future in Philadelphia where East Market Street is as bustling a hub for arts, culture, and retail, as it once was. This new partnership must deliver a sustainable, practical, and community-forward destination that will serve Philadelphia for generations.\n\nUnder Ralph and Brian Roberts\u2019 visionary leadership, Comcast has consistently shown a deep commitment to Philadelphia for decades.\n\nThrough the collaboration of its extraordinary leaders and citizens, Philadelphia has always been a city of firsts, from the nation\u2019s first hospital to the first stock exchange in the United States. This spirit of partnership and innovation is part of our DNA.\n\nDuring my early years as governor, Comcast pledged to build a skyscraper to mark Philadelphia as its permanent home. The Comcast Center, completed in 2008, brought thousands of new jobs and a vibrant new ecosystem to a previously underdeveloped part of Center City.\n\nAs the company grew, a second tower, the Comcast Technology Center, opened in 2019. The two-building campus is now home to 10,000 employees, a five-star hotel, and several world-class dining spots, echoing Philadelphia\u2019s historical role as a commerce hub. Comcast\u2019s ongoing economic impact in Philadelphia is in the billions.\n\nTogether with the 76ers, I am confident Comcast will once again help create something transformative and exciting for Philadelphia, continuing our legacy of innovation and community investment.\n\nHaving faced tough battles as mayor and governor myself, I can tell you firsthand that balancing big ideas, high-stakes competing interests, and the demand for results is not easy.\n\nThe challenges ahead are real, but so is the opportunity. With the steadfast leadership of Mayor Parker and City Council and the collaboration of dedicated partners like Comcast and the Sixers, I have renewed confidence in the success of these two projects.\n\nNow we have a new chance to build something extraordinary that honors our history while looking to the future and showcasing the unique spirit possible only in Philadelphia. Together, we can make this happen.\n\nEd Rendell served as the 96th mayor of Philadelphia (1992-2000) and the 45th governor of Pennsylvania (2003-2011).",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

A recent report published by Ookla shows that Xfinity has the fastest median data speed in Portland, coming in at around 226Mbps. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Yet Ziply Fiber offers several of the fastest plans: 2000Mbps for $70 monthly.\n\nFastest internet plans in Portland\n\nProvider Starting price Max download speed Max upload speed Data cap Connection type Ziply Fiber $70 ($95 after 12 months) 2,000Mbps 2,000Mbps None Fiber Quantum Fiber $95 2000Mbps 2000Mbps None Fiber Xfinity 2 Gigabit\n\nRead full review $85 2000Mbps 35Mbps 1.2TB Cable Xfinity Gigabit Extra\n\nRead full review $75 1200Mbps 35Mbps 1.2TB Cable Astound Broadband\n\nRead full review $20 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None Cable Xfinity Gigabit\n\nRead full review $65 1,000Mbps 20Mbps 1.2TB Cable Ziply Fiber $60 1,000Mbps 1,000Mbps None Fiber Show more (3 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Portland\n\nSee all results for internet providers in Oregon.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming all at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Portland\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Portland?\n\nWhen choosing an internet service provider, you're always better off choosing fiber internet over all other options if it's available. Ziply Fiber and CenturyLink offer the best fiber internet plans in Portland. If fiber is unavailable in your neighborhood, cable internet or 5G fixed wireless providers offer fast and reliable connections. Just steer clear of data caps or any binding long-term contracts.\n\nInternet providers in Portland FAQ\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Portland? Ziply Fiber's 100Mbps plan is $20 a month with no contract. Xfinity offers a base plan for $20, reaching up to 150Mbps. Finally, Astound Broadband has a $20 plan that offers 300Mbps. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet service available in Portland? Yes. Most households in Portland will have access to fiber connectivity, the best internet connection you can get.

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

Meta\u2019s scheduled report comes as it lifted its projections on how much it would invest in emerging tech like AI. Apple\u2019s scheduled report follows analyst downgrades driven by worries about demand for new iPhones.\n\nSeveral other noteworthy tech firms are scheduled to release financials this week, including chipmaker ASML Holdings, IBM, Intel and ServiceNow.\n\nOil producers ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell are scheduled to release quarterly financials amid optimism regarding energy policy under the new Trump administration. Expected reports from AT&T, T-Mobile and Comcast will give investors a look at the health of the telecommunications sector.\n\nExpected earnings from Visa, Mastercard and SoFi this week could give market watchers a look at the health of consumers as debt levels have tapered back recently.\n\nBoeing is scheduled to host its investor call on Tuesday after the aircraft maker released earnings data early last week.

The next areas to be constructed are between Coral Ridge Dr. and Coral Springs Dr., south of W Sample Rd. and north of Royal Palm Blvd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see Comcast investing in and expanding to Coral Springs with a brand-new fiber network,\u201d said Cindy Brief, President of the Coral Springs Chamber. \u201cWhether you\u2019re using the Internet to work, learn or be entertained, an online connection is a must-have. Comcast\u2019s decision to come to Coral Springs means residents and businesses will have a new connectivity option, and it is just another reason our city is the perfect place to call home or open a business.\u201d\n\nThis new, next-generation network will give Coral Springs access to faster Internet speeds that outperform competitors \u2014 up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) for residential customers and up to 100 Gbps for businesses. With this fiber-to-the-home technology, customers can access symmetrical speeds which means faster uploads than ever before.\n\n\u201cCoral Springs is the ideal location to bring this remarkable technology,\u201d said Rafael Visbal, Vice President of Market Development for Comcast\u2019s Florida Region. \u201cWe heard from the community. Today, we\u2019re answering their call by building a network ready for tomorrow. Once our network is online, families, entrepreneurs and home-based businesses will have the reliability and speed they need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComcast\u2019s residential services are marketed under the Xfinity and NOW brands, and consumers in Coral Springs will be able to take advantage of Xfinity\u2019s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and home security. With fast Internet speeds, powerful WiFi that reaches every corner of the home, and super-responsive connections with low lag available with its plan, customers have a great experience using their connected devices to stream their favorite sports and entertainment content, video chat with coworkers and friends, learn from home or simply surf the web.\n\nFor local businesses, Comcast Business offers a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of all sizes achieve their business goals. Industry analysts and associations have consistently recognized Comcast Business as a leader and innovator in flexible, scalable options as well as one of the fastest-growing providers of Ethernet services.\n\nComcast is committed to making Internet accessible and affordable across communities in Florida. Since 2011, the technology leader has offered Internet Essentials. The program provides low-cost Internet service, digital skills training and subsidized computers to eligible income-constrained households. Internet Essentials has helped hundreds of thousands of Floridians since its launch in 2011, including students, senior citizens, veterans and people with disabilities enrolled in public assistance programs and more.\n\nThe technology company said its commitment to Broward County can be traced back for decades, and Comcast is now on full display in Coral Springs. The company recently sponsored the city\u2019s Oktoberfest event, where Xfinity representatives chatted with residents about future service areas. Comcast Business also took over Let\u2019s Chill Homemade Ice Cream. The team offered free ice cream flights to patrons and shared information about their products and services.\n\n\u201cThis is a new day, Coral Springs. While we have served businesses in the city for some time, we\u2019re thrilled to announce we\u2019re building a fiber network across the city. This investment should send a strong message that Comcast is here to support this community\u2019s connectivity needs for decades to come,\u201d said Jeff Buzzelli, Senior Vice President of Comcast\u2019s Florida Region. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to win your business and show you why Comcast is a leader in this space. Whether it\u2019s Comcast Business or Xfinity services, we\u2019re here to connect you to the moments that matter most.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Comcast announced a $15 million investment to build and expand its high-speed, reliable network across Charlotte County, Florida.",

He was 87.\n\nMr. Katz is perhaps best known for bringing the Sixers their most recent NBA championship in the 1982-83 season. He owned the team for almost 15 years, running the franchise from 1981 to 1996, when he sold the team to Comcast Spectacor.\n\nKatz and the Sixers drew criticism during his tenure for trading Hall of Famer Moses Malone, Terry Catledge, and two first-round picks (in 1986 and 1988) to the Washington Bullets for Cliff Robinson and Jeff Ruland on June 16, 1986. The Sixers also traded the first overall pick in the 1986 draft to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Roy Hinson. The Cavs used the pick to select Ohio Basketball Hall of Famer Brad Daugherty, the headliner of the draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut during his heyday, Mr. Katz was one of the area\u2019s most recognizable figures.\n\nIn 1972, he invested $20,000 to open the first Nutrisystem center, in Willow Grove. Shortly after, he opened a second center, and went on to create the Nutrisystem franchise. By the time he sold it in 1986, the business had grown to become the nation\u2019s largest medically supervised weight control company.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: How wrestling at Penn set Sixers managing owner Josh Harris on his path to team ownership\n\nMr. Katz was also the founder of H.

The Comcast-owned cable channel lost one of its key programs, WWE Raw, to streaming, with Netflix picking up the rights in a mega-deal. WWE Raw has propped up Monday night on the channel for decades (minus the show\u2019s brief TNN/Spike TV period), so the network is missing a key programming block.\n\nThe immediate filler for Monday nights has been the One Chicago franchise, namely Chicago Fire. The NBC series is still on Comcast\u2019s broadcast TV channel when it airs new episodes on Wednesdays, but USA Network currently holds some syndication rights. Reruns of the firefighter drama have been filling the WWE Raw void most weeks since the switchover at the top of the year.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nChicago Fire and WWE Raw don\u2019t exactly have a lot of crossover appeal, but that might be intentional. Historically, WWE programming viewership has moved from broadcaster to broadcaster, meaning USA Network probably knows most won\u2019t stick around to see what\u2019s not on each Monday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nHowever, it does seem USA Network will be flexible with its Monday night. For example, this upcoming Monday night\u2019s schedule will be filled by a movie from the Fast and Furious franchise, F9. However, Chicago Fire jumps right back into the time slot on Feb. 3.\n\nWWE fans without Netflix can still get their fix on USA Network, though. SmackDown still airs on the channel in the U.S. each Friday night at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to Watch WWE Raw and WWE Royal Rumble 2025\n\nWWE Raw airs worldwide on Netflix every Monday at 8 p.m. ET. Royal Rumble will air on Feb. 1 at 6 p.m. ET via Peacock in the U.S. and on Netflix internationally.",

            "content": "Comcast has entered the sports skinny bundle chat.\n\nOn Thursday, the largest cable provider in the U.S. announced that it will offer a sports and news TV video package at $70 per month. A skinny bundle of sorts, Sports and News TV will feature several nationally distributed sports channels like ESPN and FS1 along with the three top cable news networks: Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. Local affiliates for the major broadcasters (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Telemundo and Univision) are also included.\n\nSports and News aims to hit the market led by YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, and will also face a challenge from DirecTV\u2019s new MySports bundle, which launched on Jan. 14. All this movement, of course, comes a week after Venu Sports was shuttered and Disney subsequently announced its investment in Fubo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a bit of a journey over the last couple of years to make sure we have a great value at multiple price points, depending on what customers\u2019 budget needs are,\u201d John Dixon, Comcast\u2019s SVP of entertainment, said in a video interview. \u201cWe started at the more value-oriented segment with Now TV, and now we\u2019re focusing our energy in that middle segment between our premium products and our value products. And this is where we think Sports and News will meet a consumer need.\u201d\n\nThat need, according to Comcast, is for the tentpole sports events that air nationally. Sports and News brings national telecasts from the five major male pro leagues, the WNBA and NWSL, and major college conferences. Yet outside of the NFL and select MLS matches on Fox, the lack of the regional sports channels that air games from the other local pro and college teams is a glaring omission, at least on the surface.\n\nComcast has moved most RSNs into the higher tier Ultimate TV package with two major exceptions: NYC-based MSG Networks, which has been blacked out from customers in New Jersey and Connecticut since September 2021, and CHSN, the over-the-air network in Chicago that picked up Blackhawks, Bulls and White Sox games last fall. (Broadcast channels must have retransmission agreements with cable and satellite operators to be carried in those systems.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no question that RSNs are popular, particularly with high-interest sports fans,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, they do carry a lot of cost, and the big games typically are carried on the broadcast network, so they\u2019re carried on the cable nets. We\u2019ll always go back and revisit the RSN discussion and look for ways to bring them to these customers as well, perhaps out of the Ultimate plan, but that\u2019s the path for now.\u201d\n\nAlthough the RSN model was somewhat resuscitated when Main Street Sports Group (formerly Diamond Sports Group) formally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy this month, pro sports teams are continuing to test new options. This week, the Cleveland Cavaliers, owners of the NBA\u2019s best record at 36-7, moved a few games to the Rock Entertainment Sports Network, the over-the-air channel launched last summer for local teams like the AHL\u2019s Cleveland Monsters and the NBA G League\u2019s Cleveland Charge.\n\nDixon said this skinny bundle wasn\u2019t intentionally built to buffer the company from the plight of the RSN business, but it was designed for customer flexibility as consumers continue to look to cut the cord.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what we want to do with RSNs is give customers the ability and flexibility to get it who want them, but not burden customers who don\u2019t want them,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cWe felt like it was too confusing, quite frankly, to say a customer, \u2018You can\u2019t have it in (the Popular TV package), but you can have it in Sports and News, but you\u2019ve got to give up Entertainment\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile the new bundle does not include RSNs, it does include Peacock Premium, the ad-free version of the Comcast streamer. Peacock was already a prominent player for Comcast in recent years with exclusive NFL playoff games and the Olympics, including a record $1.96 billion in incremental revenue from the Summer Games in Paris. Peacock will have its own NBA regular season and playoff exclusive national telecasts when the NBA and WNBA return to NBC in the fall.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much any of these new bundles will stop the bleeding for cable carriers\u2014even one as big as Comcast, which lost 31% of its video subscribers in the last three years.",

First Name Last Name Your Email Address (Required)\n\nComcast has announced the launch of a bundle it calls Sports & News TV, an offering available to Xfinity Internet customers that brings together news, sports, entertainment and primetime network programming for $70 a month.\n\nThe package comes with 50-plus channels, including local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Telemundo and Univision channels where available plus Fox\u2019s conservative commentary channel, CNN, MSNBC, ESPN, FS1, ACCN, SEC, Big Ten Network and more.\n\n\u201cSports & News TV is a terrific option for customers looking for a great value in entertainment without sacrificing their favorite live sports and news channels,\u201d said John Dixon, senior vice president of entertainment, in a statement.\n\nAlso included is a Peacock subscription, 300 hours of cloud DVR storage and access to over 100 FAST channels, whose schedules are integrated into the on-screen channel guide for a seamless experience.\n\nNotably missing, however, are channels such as TNT, TBS and truTV, that air live sports as well. These offerings were slated to be part of the now-canceled Venu Sports, but that package did not offer news channels.\n\nThe $70 price is marketed as \u201call in\u201d but the fine print on the package page notes that taxes and fees may be extra. When NewscastStudio tried subscribing to the service, there was about $5 in extra fees added to the online quote based on the Chicago area (taxes and fees often differ from market to market), including any fees for internet service.\n\nThe price also does not include modem or gateway rental costs, which are normally $10 to $25 more, but promotional offers can lower it to $0 to $10 for the first 12 months, according to the site. It is possible for customers to use their own equipment to avoid these fees.\n\nOnly one television outlet can be connected to the cable package as well and installation fees of up to $500 may apply, according to the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the $70 price is only available if you have (or subscribe to) Xfinity Internet, which costs at least an extra $45 per month with promotional pricing. So, in reality, most customers will pay at least $100 a month for service.\n\nThe package does not require a contract, though some of the associated special offers do expire. It\u2019s not clear if Comcast would extend that promotional pricing after it expires.\n\nOverall, this offer is fairly tame compared one such as YouTube TV. YouTube TV costs $82.99 a month after a recent price hike, but includes over 100 channels. A a virtual MVPD, it is also not subject to as many taxes and it doesn\u2019t charge any equipment or broadcast TV access fees. There\u2019s also unlimited cloud DVR storage.\n\nYouTube TV and other vMVPDs do require an internet connection. When combined with the cost of paying Comcast or another provider for that, the total cost does come out higher than Xfinity\u2019s offering, but the trade-off is significantly more channels, more storage and lower hidden costs.",

            "content": "On the heels of Venu Sports\u2019 demise and DirecTV launching a streaming skinny sports bundle, cable operator Comcast this week unveiled its own skinny TV package featuring a lineup of sports and news networks.\n\nThe so-called Sports & News TV package offers 50 networks for $70 per month when customers also get Xfinity Internet service from the provider. Consumers can get the lineup through a traditional X1 set-top box or via streaming through the Xfinity Stream app.\n\nSports networks include ESPN, FS1, Golf Channel, ACC Network, Big Ten Network and SEC Network. It also comes with local broadcast networks ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and Telemundo, and cable news networks CNBC, Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. And Comcast is adding a subscription to NBCUniversal-owned Peacock, along with 300 hours of cloud DVR storage. Peacock itself is poised to serve up more than 8,000 hours of live sports, including NFL football games, Premiere League soccer, and soon NBA basketball games. Customers also get access to over 100 streaming channels incorporated into the channel guide.\n\nHowever, to get channels like CBS Sports, NFL Network, NFL RedZone and NBA TV customers need to add the \u201cMore Sports and Entertainment\u201d package, priced at an additional $9.99 per month. Comcast pitched this as a way for consumers to customize their TV packages if they want more sports, while also touting its $15 per month StreamSaver bundle that launched last year and includes Apple TV+, Netflix and Peacock.\n\n\u201cWith Sports & News TV, we\u2019ve brought together top networks for live sports and news and Peacock, the best streaming service for sports fans, to create a new video bundle packed with the best content at an unbeatable price, all accessible within a premium viewing experience that makes it easy for customers to find the content they care about most,\u201d said John Dixon, SVP of Entertainment at Comcast, in a statement..\n\nComcast\u2019s pricing is on par with that of virtual MVPD DirecTV Stream\u2019s MySports package \u2013 which is offering an even skinnier, 40-network lineup for just under $70 per month following a three-month intro price of about $50 per month. In addition to the ESPN channel suite and FS1 and FS2, DirecTV\u2019s lineup also includes TNT, TBS and TruTV, MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network and NHL Network and intends to offer ESPN+ at no additional cost. But unlike Comcast, DirecTV doesn\u2019t have a broadband product to bundle the pay TV offering with. DirecTV\u2019s offering is initially only available in 24 metro areas.\n\nComcast has local CBS broadcast, which is currently missing from DirecTV\u2019s lineup, but neither sports-focused bundle includes CBS Sports in non-local markets \u2013 something DirecTV was reportedly working on, but that TVREV analyst Alan Wolk called out in a recent column as a shortcoming of the DirecTV offering given the network\u2019s NFL game lineup.\n\nAlso missing from the DirecTV package is a full regional sports lineup, which in part, made Wolk question who the bundle is aimed at, as the firm noted there are usually fans of a specific sport \u2013 which it dubs ESPN fans - and fans of a specific team (aka RSN fans).\n\n\u201cWhile ESPN fans will be happy with this sort of service, RSN fans will not, because, as of now, MySports does not include access to any RSNs. And while some RSNs have indeed launched their own streaming services, most have not, meaning the only way to access them is via a traditional bundle,\u201d wrote Wolk of DirecTV\u2019s MySports offering. \u201cAnd if you have a traditional bundle, you have no need for MySports or MyFubo or any other sort of sports skinny bundle.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look as though Comcast is offering regional sports networks either.\n\nStill, while not a complete sports package, the ability to bundle sports networks together without other less-popular channels bloating the lineup has been a desire of several distributors in the industry, including DirecTV.\n\nThe dissolution of Venu earlier this month (brought on following an antitrust settlement with Fubo and related controlling 70% ownership buyout of the vMVPD by Disney) seems to have accelerated that ability. Without shuttering Venu, the media company JV partners (Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox) faced potential continued antitrust legal action over their alleged practices related to requirements in carriage agreements imposed on distributors for the right to carry their networks. Those so-called tying practices, which forced bundling of popular sports networks with less desirable ones, prohibited the ability for distributors like DirecTV and Fubo from offering skinnier, customized sports bundles \u2013 restrictions the channel owners didn\u2019t impose on themselves for the planned Venu Sports skinny linear sports offering, raising antitrust concerns.\n\nDirecTV and Dish pushed back after the Venu settlement, saying underlying antirust concerns were still valid. A day later Venu was discontinued, and DirecTV launched MySports the next week.\n\nComcast\u2019s NBCUniversal was never part of the Venu JV, a notable absence along with Paramount, particularly after NBCU secured an 11-year NBA rights deal last year alongside Disney and Amazon Prime Video, while long-time rights holder WBD lost out.",

However, the price of the bundle comes with a fine print, so not everyone will qualify for the lower price.For example, the 70$ is only available to Xfinity Internet and Xfinity TV customers. The rest will have to pay at least $90 per month for the bundle. It\u2019s also important to mention that not having set automatic billing through a bank account will increase the price of the bundle by $10. Also, autopay with a credit or debit card means another $8 to the final price.Basically, customers must pay as high as $100 for Comcast\u2019s Sports & News TV bundle, or as low as $70 if they meet all the requirements (and there are quite a few). Of course, these prices don\u2019t include tax.As mentioned earlier, the Sports & News TV bundle offers access to every local broadcast channel including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, Telemundo and Univision. Popular national news channels like CNBC, CNN, FOX News and MSNBC are included in the bundle too.More importantly, customers who pay for the Sports & News TV bundle will be able to watch sports channels with live coverage spanning college and professional sports including ACC Network, Big Ten Network, ESPN, FS1, GOLF Channel, and SEC Network.And thanks to the Peacock subscription included in the bundle customers will have access to an expansive selection of breakout original series, more than 8,000 hours of live sports including NFL football, Premier League soccer, WWE and coming soon NBA basketball.Customers who want the best viewing experience can add an X1 TV box to their subscription to get features like Enhanced 4K, Multiview, Odds Zone, integrated search with the Xfinity voice remote, and more.Keep in mind that if you\u2019ve already purchased a Xumo Stream Box, you\u2019ll be able to access Sports & News TV channels via the Xfinity Stream app. Customers who\u2019d rather watch on their own streaming devices, Sports & News TV is accessible in-home and on-the-go via the Xfinity Stream app on supported third-party platforms like Apple TV, Fire TV, iOS, Roku, Xumo TV, and more.",

            "content": "The Complex Fabric of Comcast: Beyond Traditional Media\n\nAs Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) evolves beyond traditional cable, it has cemented its place as a diverse media powerhouse, owning everything from internet services to global entertainment like Universal Pictures and Sky. This diversification allows Comcast to tap into various revenue streams, yet it also poses a unique set of challenges in maintaining effective focus and streamlined operations.\n\nGovernance Dynamics and Shares\n\nA crucial element of Comcast\u2019s corporate architecture is its dual-share system, which gives the founder\u2019s descendants significant control. This complex governance model might raise questions about future strategic directions and how it aligns with the interests of other stakeholders, highlighting the potential for internal discord.\n\nThe Sustainability Dilemma\n\nA less discussed but increasingly relevant challenge for Comcast is sustainability. As the company continues to expand its technological infrastructure, its environmental impact comes into sharper focus. Internet services contribute to carbon emissions, whereas the operation of theme parks involves considerable resource usage. The company faces growing pressure to enhance its sustainability practices or risk public disapproval and potential regulatory issues.\n\nAdapting to a Digital Age\n\nWith the media industry witnessing a seismic shift due to streaming and on-demand content, Comcast\u2019s ability to adapt will determine its future success. Analysts advocate for an agile restructuring that allows the company to consolidate its operations, ensuring it can remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market landscape.\n\nA Future of Opportunities and Challenges\n\nAs Comcast navigates these challenges, its future hinges on balancing its vast offerings with necessary innovations. A strategic emphasis on sustainability and streamlined operations will not only determine its competitive edge but also its legacy as a leader in the media sector.\n\nComcast\u2019s Environmental Impact: Navigating the Path to Sustainable Media Leadership\n\nAs Comcast continues to expand its influence beyond traditional cable networks into a diverse array of media and technology services, it faces pressing questions about its environmental footprint. The company\u2019s trajectory affects not only its own sustainability but also serves as a microcosm of the larger media and technology industry\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nEnvironmental Impact of Comcast\u2019s Expanding Infrastructure\n\nComcast\u2019s diversification into multiple sectors, such as internet services and theme park operations, significantly contributes to its carbon footprint. The Internet infrastructure required to provide services to millions is heavily reliant on vast data centers, which consume enormous amounts of energy and emit significant greenhouse gases. Similarly, the energy demands and resource utilization, such as water and electricity, in operating large theme parks further highlight the environmental challenges facing Comcast.\n\nThis environmental impact extends beyond the present, contributing to the broader issues of climate change and ecological degradation. As one of the key players in the global media landscape, Comcast\u2019s approach to sustainability can set benchmarks and influence industry standards, highlighting the critical need for effective environmental strategies.\n\nImplications for Humanity and the Global Economy\n\nThe environmental strategies adopted by Comcast can have far-reaching implications for humanity and the global economy. As climate change exacerbates, pressure mounts on corporations to commit to more sustainable practices.

            "content": "A post-Venu pay-TV landscape is beginning to take shape, with Comcast Xfinity launching a new skinny (or at least skinnier) streaming bundle of channels focused on sports and news programming.\n\nThe offering, Sports & News TV, is available to Xfinity internet customers for $70 per month, and includes all the major broadcast networks, as well as most (but not all) cable sports and news channels. it also includes a subscription to NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock, 300 hours of cloud DVR storage, and access to FAST channels directly in the app.\n\nSo what\u2019s included? ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Univision, Telemundo, and all the other local broadcast channels, as well as sports channels like ESPN, Fox Spots 1, Big Ten Network, Golf Channel, and SEC Network. What\u2019s missing? The most glaring example is the Warner Bros. Discovery Channels of TNT, TBS, and TruTV, though NBCU\u2019s USA Network is also absent.\n\nIt also includes every major cable news channel, including Fox News, MSNBC, CNBC, NewsNation, and somewhat perplexingly, CNN, which appears to be the only WBD channel represented in the package.\n\nThe untimely death of Venu earlier this month has led to a new world order in pay-TV, with Disney (whose ESPN channels form the bedrock of sports TV programming) now open to selling them in smaller more targeted bundles.\n\nDirecTV was first out of the gate with MySports, which also costs $70 per month, and has many of the same channels (it does have TNT, TBS, and USA). Sources in the cable business say that they expect other pay-TV providers to follow suit with their own twists on it.\n\nStill, $70 per month is a steep price compared to Venu\u2019s sub-$45 target, and is not much of a savings to the likes of YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV, which cost about $83 per month. But with consumers seemingly desiring skinnier options, Comcast is following DirecTV into the fray with something a bit more targeted: Get your entertainment elsewhere, but come to us for what\u2019s live.\n\n\u201cWith Sports & News TV, we\u2019ve brought together top networks for live sports and news and Peacock, the\n\nbest streaming service for sports fans, to create a new video bundle packed with the best content at an\n\nunbeatable price, all accessible within a premium viewing experience that makes it easy for customers to\n\nfind the content they care about most.\u201d said John Dixon, senior VP of entertainment for Comcast.\n\n\u201cSports & News TV is a terrific option for customers looking for a great value in entertainment without\n\nsacrificing their favorite live sports and news channels.\u201d",

Sports & News TV is available for an \u201call-in\u201d monthly price of $70 when combined with Xfinity Internet, with no contract required.\n\nIn marketing the package, Comcast is highlighting the fact that the $70/month price point is less than YouTube TV \u2014 which now costs $82.99/month after a price hike in December \u2014 as well as Disney\u2019s Hulu + Live TV service, which starts at $81.99/month for live TV only. \u201cSave $150/year over YouTube TV on our new ultimate entertainment experience,\u201d the cable operator says on the Xfinity Sports & News landing page.\n\nDirecTV earlier this month introduced a similar streamlined package called MySports, which initially includes 40 sports and broadcast channels and is available in 24 metro areas. It\u2019s regularly priced at $70/month, after a three-month promo price of $50 monthly.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSeparately, Comcast sells a cheaper streaming video package called Now TV that starts at just $20 per month for 125-plus channels \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t include sports networks or local TV stations. Now TV also requires Xfinity Internet broadband service.\n\nComcast\u2019s Sports & News TV package, available to new and existing Xfinity customers, includes: every local broadcast channel including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Telemundo and Univision; national news channels including CNBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC; sports channels with live coverage including ESPN, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, FS1, Golf Channel and SEC Network.\n\nIn addition, Comcast\u2019s Sports & News TV includes access to Peacock, the NBCUniversal streaming service that features original series, more than 8,000 hours of live sports including NFL football, Premier League soccer and WWE, movies, next-day access to all new shows from NBC and Bravo, plus library content and daily live news.\n\nComcast has seen its cable TV base shrink for years. It ended the third quarter of 2024 with 12.834 million domestic video customers, a loss of 365,000 for the period and down nearly 1.7 million from the year prior.\n\n\u201cWith Sports & News TV, we\u2019ve brought together top networks for live sports and news and Peacock, the best streaming service for sports fans, to create a new video bundle packed with the best content at an unbeatable price, all accessible within a premium viewing experience that makes it easy for customers to find the content they care about most,\u201d said John Dixon, Comcast\u2019s senior VP of entertainment. \u201cSports & News TV is a terrific option for customers looking for a great value in entertainment without sacrificing their favorite live sports and news channels.\u201d\n\nSports & News TV offers up to 300 hours of cloud DVR storage. The package also throws in access to more than 100 streaming channels such as American Crimes, E! Keeping Up, Fox Sports, Telemundo Al Dia, Today All Day and Sky News.\n\nCustomers can opt to pay extra to add an X1 set-top box to their subscription to get features like Enhanced 4K, Multiview, Odds Zone and integrated search with the Xfinity voice remote. Sports & News TV is also accessible in-home and on-the-go via the Xfinity Stream app on supported third-party platforms like Apple TV and iOS, Amazon Fire TV and Roku.\n\nOther add-ons available for Xfinity Sports & News TV are the More Sports & Entertainment package (an extra $9.995 per month), which includes channels like NFL RedZone, MLB Network, NBA TV and NHL Network and the Xfinity StreamSaver bundle with Netflix (with ads) and Apple TV+ (an additional $15 per month).",

The bundle also includes 300 hours of cloud DVR storage.\n\nIncluded in the channel lineup are local ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, Telemundo and Univision affiliates as well as national cable channels like CNBC, CNN, FOX News and MSNBC.

Xfinity\u2019s StreamSaver package, for $15, offers access to the ad tier of Netflix as well as Apple TV+.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSports & News TV joins a sports-focused package introduced this month by DirecTV in the wake of a settlement between pay-TV operator Fubo and major media companies Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. DirecTV\u2019s offering is also $70 but does not include CBS as of now. The $70 price point is far higher than the $43 announced by Venu, though it is a notch below the $83 level of leading internet-delivered bundlers YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nIn the Venu case, Fubo last year sued the trio, alleging anti-competitive behavior for seeking to launch a sports-focused streaming service, Venu. After getting bogged down in legal challenges, the service was ultimately scrapped. In the settlement of the lawsuit, Disney pledged to acquire majority ownership of Fubo, whose objection to Venu centered on its experience trying to offer more tailored, sports-oriented bundles. Those efforts were thwarted by major programmers forcing them to carry less-desirable, non-sports channels, thereby boosting the price for customers, Fubo said.\n\n\u201cWith Sports & News TV, we\u2019ve brought together top networks for live sports and news and Peacock, the best streaming service for sports fans, to create a new video bundle packed with the best content at an unbeatable price, all accessible within a premium viewing experience that makes it easy for customers to find the content they care about most,\u201d said John Dixon, SVP, Entertainment, Comcast. \u201cSports & News TV is a terrific option for customers looking for a great value in entertainment without sacrificing their favorite live sports and news channels.\u201d",

            "content": "But the fine print says you could pay as much as $100 monthly before taxes.\n\nA week after DirecTV launched its first sports-only streaming package, Comcast unveiled a similar offering that adds news to the mix. The Xfinity Sports & News TV package combines over 50 broadcast, cable news and sports channels with Peacock, DVR storage and more.\n\nAlthough Xfinity Sports & News is being widely marketed and reported as costing $70 monthly, there\u2019s some extensive fine print attached. (With Comcast?? Can\u2019t be.)\n\nFirst, that price only applies to Xfinity Internet or Xfinity TV customers (new or existing). You\u2019ll pay at least $90 monthly if you want to stick with home internet from elsewhere. On top of that, your monthly price goes up by $10 without automatic billing through a bank account. Autopay with a credit or debit card adds an extra $8.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nSo, it can be as little as $70 or as much as $100 per month. Plus tax. This is only a good deal compared to YouTube TV (which recently raised prices again) or Hulu + Live TV if you\u2019re already an Xfinity Internet customer who\u2019s cool with automatic payments.\n\nEven then, whether it\u2019s a bargain will depend on whether it has all the content you want. Its national cable news lineup includes CNN, CNBC, MSNBC and Fox News. It has ESPN, FS1, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, GOLF Channel and SEC Network for live sports channels. Also on tap are local broadcast channels, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, Telemundo and Univision affiliates. Plus, you get Peacock (which includes live sports in addition to its on-demand fare) and other extras like 300 hours of cloud DVR storage.\n\nIf you want the best viewing experience, you\u2019ll need an Xfinity X1 TV box, only available for Xfinity cable customers. But since that would be somewhat redundant, you can still watch through the Xfinity Stream app on streaming boxes like Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV and mobile devices.\n\nYou can read more (and perhaps make yourself dizzy from fine print) at Xfinity\u2019s Sports & News landing page.\n\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.",

            "content": "Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management's confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\n\"From a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that's partially because of the relative underperformance that they've had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they're becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won't rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company is working to expand its broadband services and improve its network infrastructure to keep up with growing consumer and business demands. By December 9, 2024, the company was providing broadband to 63 million homes and aims to reach an additional 1.2 million homes in 2025. A key goal is to deliver 1-gigabit speeds to ensure reliable, high-speed internet for activities like streaming, gaming, and other data-heavy uses. In addition, the company is implementing DOCSIS 4.0 technology, which will enhance broadband performance over hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) networks, supporting faster, symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported strong earnings with $32.07 billion in revenue, marking a 7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The company saw solid performance, including a 3.6% rise in broadband average revenue per user (ARPU) and a 5% growth in its connectivity segment. The Connectivity & Platforms division achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.9%. Moreover, Comcast's hosting of the Paris Summer Olympics significantly boosted Peacock\u2019s revenue and subscriber base, reinforcing NBC\u2019s position as the leading network for the 2023-2024 season.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) maintained a robust cash position in terms of dividends. In the most recent quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow, with free cash flow surpassing $3.4 billion. The company also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends. On January 7, it announced a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, in line with previous payouts. With 16 consecutive years of dividend growth, CMCSA is one of the best stocks with steady dividends. The stock supports a dividend yield of 3.35%, as of January 20.\n\nOverall CMCSA ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In a rare win for the beleaguered suburban office sector, media giant Comcast signed a 61,295-square-foot office lease at Affinius Capital\u2019s Schaumburg Corporate Center, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe new lease represents fuel that could spark a major turnaround for the office complex at 1515 East Woodfield Road, which was plunged into distress when work-from-home policies were widely adopted during the pandemic and interest rate hikes starting in 2022 cut further into property values.\n\nChicago-based Glenstar, which formerly owned the property, transferred it to San Antonio-based Affinius in 2023 via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, but Glenstar maintained its role as the property manager. Glenstar had originally bought the complex for $78 million in 2017 and spent $30 million on renovations before the pandemic. After Affinius took over ownership to settle a $78 million debt it provided to Glenstar in 2017, it refinanced the property for $95 million.\n\nComcast was one of 12 new tenants to sign leases at the 1 million-square-foot, three-building office complex in 2024, according to a press lease from Glenstar. Although the release doesn\u2019t specify that the 61,000 square foot deal was with Comcast, sources familiar with it confirmed the media company\u2019s involvement. The firm plans to move into its new space in April and will become the property\u2019s largest tenant.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nComcast, which is headquartered in Philadelphia, last reported in 2023 that it has over 186,000 employees total.\n\nThe 12 new leases at the Schaumburg Office Center, which total 196,000 square feet, were joined by a total of 88,000 square feet of office lease renewals from existing tenants. The property\u2019s total occupancy is now at 78 percent, above the 68 percent average notched for the entire suburban Chicago office market in the fourth quarter of 2024, which marked another new record low.\n\nStill, Comcast\u2019s new deal at Schaumburg marks an overall net loss for suburban Chicago\u2019s total demand, as it previously leased about twice as much space in the area. Comcast\u2019s Chicago regional headquarters were previously located in an Oak Brook office building at 2001 York Road, but the company vacated its space in 2020. It\u2019s unclear if the company found a different space between then and now or temporarily transitioned into a fully-remote workplace.\n\nLosing Comcast, the anchor tenant of the 184,000 square foot Oak Brook building, proved devastating to its ownership. A venture of Pennsylvania-based landlord Pembroke IV was hit with a $25 million foreclosure lawsuit last year after failing to pay off debt tied to the six-story office building at 2001 York Road.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s top stock picks.\n\nSteve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen\u2019s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics.\n\nIn 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities. The firm employs over 1,800 people and operates across multiple global offices. Point72 combines Cohen\u2019s expertise in active trading with investments in technology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of modern finance.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.",

Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

            "content": "When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") above 19x, you may consider Comcast Corporation ( ) as an attractive investment with its 9.5x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.\n\nComcast's earnings growth of late has been pretty similar to most other companies. It might be that many expect the mediocre earnings performance to degrade, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like Comcast's to be considered reasonable.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 3.2% last year. EPS has also lifted 22% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 7.4% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Comcast's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Comcast's P/E?\n\nGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of Comcast's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you're unsure about the strength of Comcast's business, why not explore for some other companies you may have missed.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "If you\u2019re reading this newsletter, you\u2019re almost certainly aware that the 76ers and team owner Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment made one of the more surprising about-faces in recent sports industry history just over a week ago, ending a two-year effort to build a new billion-dollar-plus downtown arena (shortly after receiving approval for the project from Philly\u2019s city council) and instead announcing a 50-50 partnership with Comcast Spectacor -- the Sixers\u2019 current landlords and passive-aggressive opposition in the new arena effort -- on a new venue in the Philly Sports Complex.\n\nComcast Spectacor, which owned the Sixers from 1996-2011, also took a minority ownership stake in the Sixers (the size of which was not disclosed).\n\nA few things to know.\n\nA knowledgeable source told me that in order to prevent leaks to the media, less than a dozen people knew about the deal before it was announced on a Sunday afternoon. Surprise!\n\nObtaining private financing for what would have been Philly\u2019s second major arena, with a likely cost of at least $2 billion, would have been tough. Add in the rising costs of the project as more issues arose around the SEPTA public transit station that the arena would be built atop (and would require, unpopularly, public dollars in a project otherwise privately funded); the Sixers\u2019 community benefits agreement payout; the limited ancillary mixed-use development opportunities because of the tight, mid-city site; and the future competition with Comcast Spectacor\u2019s Wells Fargo Center that would have likely stoked a race to the bottom, and it\u2019s not hard to see why this didn\u2019t pencil out for the Sixers. \u201cThese guys didn\u2019t get rich by using their own money,\u201d a source told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinners and losers in the Philly arena situation?\n\nPhilly politicians that stuck their necks out for the Sixers\u2019 arena project, then were kept in the dark about the team\u2019s reversal, are the biggest losers in this scenario; a quick perusal of the Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Letters to the Editor in recent days indicate the voting public is keenly aware. Concert promoters would have also hugely benefited from Philly having two similarly sized arenas and their subsequent competitive race to the bottom; so, the promoters lost out, too.\n\nBut there seem to be many more winners from this sudden switcheroo, which indicates an effective compromise:\n\nComcast has dramatically grown its clout in NBA circles since committing more than $27 billion over 11 years for a portion of NBA rights (the deal begins with the 2025-26 season) and buying back into the Sixers as part of this new deal. Spectacor sold the Sixers for $280 million in July 2011, a sale that some in the company\u2019s orbit had long considered a mistake; 13 years later, the Sixers are worth more than 16x that figure ($4.6B), according to Forbes' valuations. In the end, Spectacor and CEO Dan Hilferty adroitly managed a tricky PR situation with the Sixers and avoided the worst outcome -- a competitor arena. They did just spend more than $400 million renovating Wells Fargo Center, which now looks like it could be demolished as early as 2031, but in all, it was a positive outcome.\n\nHBSE ultimately got what it wanted -- a new arena that it won\u2019t have to fund solo, as well as more equilibrium and less landlord/tenant vibes in its relationship with Spectacor. Comcast Spectacor\u2019s new ownership stake in the Sixers would only need to be 5.8% for HBSE to have made back its 2011 investment. Ending the costly downtown Philly arena project also enables Josh Harris to focus more on the Commanders\u2019 complicated new stadium pursuit in the D.C. market, which should prove more lucrative long-term.\n\nThe NBA gets the new arena it wanted for the Sixers, seemingly strengthened its relationship with Comcast and appears likely to bring a WNBA team to Philly in the future.\n\nChinatown and Philly\u2019s trade unions were local winners. Chinatown defeated an arena proposal in its neighborhood for the second time this century, though it\u2019s unclear how much influence its opposition ultimately had on the scenario; Philly politicians approved the project before the Sixers bailed on it. And the trade unions banking on the jobs involved with a new arena get those, plus more work from the Sixers/Comcast Spectacor\u2019s now shared Market East development project.\n\nAdelman was brought into the Sixers\u2019 ownership group with a quasi-mandate to get the team a new arena (he was the real estate guy). He essentially succeeded, but it was an inartful process that torched the Sixers\u2019 local political capital, and it might be a while in Philly before he's anything other than the face of the failed arena effort. Still, in the 50-50 joint venture overseeing the new arena project, HBSE gets the chairmanship, which will likely be Adelman (plus the Market East project is still alive). Two big wins for the real estate guy.",

            "content": "Unraveling the Layers of a Media Titan\n\nComcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) is not just your average media company; its structure is a labyrinth of operations and complexities that raises eyebrows among investors and analysts alike. Recent discussions have highlighted just how intricate this communications giant has become over the years.\n\nA notable factor is the company\u2019s stock classification, represented by the CMCSA ticker, where the \u201cA\u201d denotes class A shares. This implies the existence of less accessible class B shares, crafted to maintain significant voting control for select stakeholders\u2014namely, the original founder\u2019s descendants. This structure undoubtedly adds to the company\u2019s multifaceted nature.\n\nDiving deeper, Comcast began as a cable provider but swiftly evolved into a multifarious enterprise encompassing internet services, television and movie production, as well as theme park operations following its acquisition of Universal. This diversification is both a strength and a potential hindrance, as it spreads the company\u2019s focus across various sectors.\n\nAdditionally, Comcast\u2019s global footprint is notable; it operates internationally and owns Sky, a major player in the UK market. However, while having multiple revenue streams can safeguard against downturns, it also risks diluting the company\u2019s concentration on core projects.\n\nWith analysts rating CMCSA as a Moderate Buy despite recent stock price declines, Comcast is at a crossroads, contemplating whether to streamline its extensive operations for greater efficiency.\n\nThe Broader Implications of Comcast\u2019s Complicated Landscape\n\nAs Comcast navigates its labyrinthine structure, the implications stretch well beyond the corporate boardroom. The global economy is feeling the reverberations of such a giant. With diverse holdings that range from telecommunications to theme parks, Comcast\u2019s performance influences media and entertainment trends. As consumer preferences shift towards streaming services, traditional cable subscriptions wane, prompting considerations of how companies like Comcast must adapt to retain viewers while investing in other ventures.\n\nCulturally, Comcast\u2019s reach impacts content production trends. By owning major film and television production arms, Comcast shapes the narratives that saturate global media. This control raises questions about representation, diversity, and whose stories are being told in an era where audience demand is constantly evolving. It calls for a more conscious approach to content creation, addressing the need for authenticity and inclusion.\n\nThe environmental effects of Comcast\u2019s operations should not be overlooked. The tech infrastructure required for internet services contributes to carbon footprints, while theme park operations generate significant waste and require extensive resource usage. As companies face increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices, Comcast must innovate or risk damaging public perception and regulatory pushback.\n\nIn light of these challenges, the future of Comcast may rest on consolidating its vast array of operations, striving for a balance between diverse offerings and focused expertise to meet an ever-changing market landscape.\n\nComcast: The Media Powerhouse You Didn\u2019t Know About\n\nThe Intricate Structure of Comcast\n\nComcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) operates as a media titan with a complex structure and diverse offerings that continue to evolve. As the owner of various subsidiaries including Universal Pictures and Sky, the company has positioned itself not just as a cable provider, but as a multifaceted media conglomerate. This business diversification includes internet services, television and film production, and even theme park operations.\n\nStock Structure and Shareholder Control\n\nOne unique aspect of Comcast\u2019s operations is its stock classification. The \u201cC\u201d in CMCSA identifies Class A shares, while the company also has Class B shares, which are primarily held by the founder\u2019s descendants and maintain significant voting control. This structure raises important questions about governance and the long-term strategy of the company, especially in how it balances the interests of these stakeholders with the broader market.\n\nGrowth and Diversification\n\nComcast\u2019s evolution from a traditional cable operator to a global media giant is both impressive and complex. The acquisition of Sky expanded its reach into the UK market, enhancing its international influence significantly. With this diversification, Comcast not only safeguards itself against market downturns but also faces the challenge of maintaining focus on its core competencies. The company\u2019s vast array of services can sometimes lead to a dilution of effort and resources.\n\nFinancial Insights and Market Performance\n\nDespite facing stock price declines, analysts have rated CMCSA as a Moderate Buy, suggesting that the company holds potential for recovery and growth. As the media landscape continues to shift with the rise of streaming services and changing consumer habits, Comcast\u2019s ability to adapt will be crucial.\n\nPros and Cons of Comcast\u2019s Business Model\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Diversified Revenue Streams: With operations across cable, internet, film, and theme parks, Comcast is well-positioned to weather economic fluctuations.\n\n\u2013 Strong Brand Presence: Ownership of well-known brands like Universal and Sky bolsters its market position.\n\n\u2013 Global Reach: Expansion beyond the U.S. into international markets supports growth opportunities.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Complex Corporate Structure: The dual-class share system and multi-faceted operations can create governance challenges and investor concerns.\n\n\u2013 Heightened Competition: The media and entertainment industry is increasingly competitive, especially with the emergence of streaming platforms.\n\n\u2013 Potential Resource Dilution: Diverse business interests may hinder strategic focus and operational efficiency.\n\nFuture Trends and Predictions\n\nMoving forward, Comcast will need to address its operational complexities while also keeping an eye on market trends such as the migration to digital streaming and consumer demand for on-demand content. Predictions suggest that Comcast might consider restructuring its operations to streamline management and enhance service offerings.\n\nInnovations and Sustainability Efforts\n\nIn addition to its media offerings, Comcast is making strides in sustainability. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency in its operations, and invest in renewable energy sources. These efforts not only help the environment but can also resonate positively with consumers who prioritize sustainability.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Comcast navigates its intricate web of operations and addresses market challenges, how it balances its storied legacy with innovation will be pivotal. The company is at a crossroads and must carefully strategize to maintain its status as a leader in the media industry while adapting to a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nFor more insights on corporate strategies and market performance, visit Comcast.",

The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

Credit: Chenyao Liu\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers recently abandoned their plans to build an arena in Center City and will remain at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.\n\nThe new arena plans were discussed at a press conference hosted by Philadelphia Mayor and 2016 Fels Institute of Government graduate Cherelle Parker. Under the agreement, the 76ers and Comcast will partner to build an arena in the Sports Complex. The space will be used by both the 76ers and the Philadelphia Flyers and is set to be finished by 2031.\n\nSixers' owner Josh Harris, a 1986 Wharton graduate, and Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts, a 1981 Wharton graduate, also attended the conference, both of whom have been funding the Chinatown development plan.\n\nParker said that the deal, which had been struck between Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment and Comcast Spectacor, was a \u201cwin, win, win, win for Philadelphia.\u201d The partnership will also include a 50-50 venture to support the revitalization of Philadelphia\u2019s Market East area.\n\nThe announcement came as a turn of events shortly after Philadelphia City Council members approved the legislative package that formed the proposal of a new 76ers arena\u2019s construction in Center City. The hearing was delayed for around half an hour by protestors who objected to the plan. The individuals donned shirts that read \u201cCity Council sold out Philly\u201d and sat arm in arm on the floor of council chambers until they were forcibly removed by police.\n\nIn a statement released following the announcement, Councilmember Jaime Gauthier \u2014 who voted against the Chinatown arena plan \u2014 wrote that the \"news is a win for both vulnerable communities and our city. It also confirms that 76DevCo was not engaging the City in good faith.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re glad that the Sixers will remain in the stadium district where they best belong. But the way they reached this decision reflects a profound lack of respect for City leaders, stakeholders, and residents,\" Gauthier wrote. \"It was shameful for 76DevCo to pit working-class Philadelphians against one another and pressure City Council to consider a half-baked proposal on an artificially rushed timeline.\"\n\nOn Jan. 13, community members gathered in front of the Friendship Archway in Chinatown to celebrate the scrapped Center City arena plans. Speakers from Asian Americans United and other local activist groups affiliated with the No Arena Coalition highlighted the potential negative impacts that a Center City arena would have brought, including gentrification and the destruction of Chinatown. They celebrated the arena result as a victory of community organizing and cross-racial solidarity, citing the months of protest and activism that led to the decision.\n\nCollege senior Taryn Flaherty spoke at the event alongside Bryn Mawr student Kaia Chau. The two co-founded Students for the Preservation of Chinatown and the Ginger Arts Center.\n\n\u201cThe No Arena fight is a wake up call to the city,\u201d Flaherty said in her speech. \u201cIt's a wake up call to our mayor and our city council that when you roll out a red carpet for the Sixers, you become the carpet they will trample all over.\u201d\n\nChau later told The Daily Pennsylvanian that she was relieved at the arena victory but cautioned that the fight against gentrification had not concluded.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Get our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning. Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, it's been a really big relief, but at the same time there is still hesitation,\u201d Chau said. \u201cThe fight against gentrification and against billionaire developers taking over the city isn't over, and even though we're elated to hear there's not going to be an arena outside of Chinatown, we're still hesitant of what this new development could look like.\u201d\n\nFounder of Asian Americans United Mary Yee, a 1990 Stuart Weitzman School of Design and 2018 Penn Graduate School of Education alumna, told the DP that although the new arena plans are cause for relief, community members are not done advocating for justice and equitable development.\n\n\u201cThe community had been saying how unfeasible and detrimental the arena would be and of course city council and the mayor did not listen to that,\u201d Yee said. \u201cNow the new effort will be to develop a citizens\u2019 master plan. Really this needs to be a master plan for all of Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

Subscribe to Premium to get our breaking news editions and texts before anyone else.\n\nDonald J. Trump is once again the president of the United States.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this newsletter, you probably watched the speech and the proceedings in the Capitol Rotunda. We\u2019re hoping to bring you a little bit behind the scenes of what was going on.\n\nSeating at the inauguration was extraordinarily limited after the event was moved from the West Front of the Capitol to the Rotunda. Governors and other dignitaries \u2014 Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp \u2014 were seated in an overflow room in the Capitol Visitor Center\u2019s Emancipation Hall. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and Rupert Murdoch all got prime seats in the Rotunda \u2013 even in front of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. Welcome to Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nThere were only around 600 seats inside the Rotunda, most of which were occupied by members and senators. Just 20 reporters were allowed inside, and we were lucky to have one of those slots.\n\nWith now former President Joe Biden and ex-Vice President Kamala Harris sitting just a few feet away, Trump blasted the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s record on everything from inflation to energy policies. He went on to tout his election victory, noting his sweep of the swing states and the fact that he won the popular vote.\n\nThere were bizarre moments. Trump said he\u2019d seek to rename Alaska\u2019s Denali Mountain to Mount McKinley. Alaska GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan have long opposed this.\n\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Panama Canal and vowed to rename the Gulf of Mexico. And when Trump declared Jan. 20 to be \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d Biden smirked.\n\nOne particularly interesting moment was when Trump vowed to impose tariffs on foreign imports, which many Republicans think is a bad idea. The applause was noticeably muted compared to Trump\u2019s other promises, which triggered ovations from Republicans.\n\nAhead of the speech, the incoming administration circulated a memo to congressional Republicans detailing Trump\u2019s plans for immediate action on border security and immigration, energy policy and government reform. Many of them mirrored the executive orders that Trump has promised to roll out on Day One. We scooped that for you on Sunday.\n\nSome of the huge changes at the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump has vowed to enact are already having an impact. For instance, Trump officials shut down use of \u201cCBP One,\u201d an app used by migrants to schedule an appointment to gain legal entry to the United States through a port of entry. Potentially as many as one million migrants had their appointments wiped out. Democrats suggested this could force those migrants to cross the border illegally.\n\nAlso: Trump signed several documents in the Capitol, including the acting leaders of Cabinet departments and a proclamation that the U.S. flag should fly at full staff on Inauguration Day.\n\n\u2014 John Bresnahan, Jake Sherman, Andrew Desiderio and Melanie Zanona",

            "content": "Harshal Shah's career in software engineering spans over a decade, with his roles at companies like eBay, Qualcomm, and Comcast highlighting his ability to lead teams and develop impactful technologies. Currently a Technical Lead Engineer at eBay, Shah oversees a team of 12 software developers, guiding them in creating tools that improve user experiences and drive company revenue.\n\nOne of his significant achievements at eBay has been leading the development of the AI-driven \"Ads Unified\" campaign tool. Launched in 2024, the tool simplifies the creation of promotional campaigns for eBay sellers. Using artificial intelligence, it generates tailored keywords and strategies in seconds, a process that previously required hours or days. The result? A significant percent increase in eBay Ads' quarterly revenue, totaling $2.6 billion.\n\nShah says about his leadership philosophy, \"My focus is on empowering my team with the tools and knowledge they need to innovate. Leadership is about amplifying the strengths of others, not just directing them.\"\n\nMentorship: Building Future Engineers\n\nShah's commitment to mentorship is a defining feature of his career. He emphasizes fostering technical and professional growth within his teams, particularly among early-career engineers.

His approach has contributed to a learning culture, with team members reporting improved performance and career satisfaction.\n\nPioneering Solutions in AI and Cybersecurity\n\nShah's technical projects demonstrate his ability to tackle real-world challenges. At Qualcomm, he led a team that developed a suite of network monitoring and management tools. These tools included an anomaly detector, intrusion prevention systems, and a dashboard for network analytics. The project added $5 million in annual revenue for the company and addressed critical data security needs for its clients.\n\nShah's published research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. His 2019 paper, Deep Learning Architectures for Safe and Secure Artificial Intelligence, outlines techniques like adversarial training and federated learning to create secure AI systems. These contributions have been widely cited in academic and professional circles, underscoring the practical implications of his work.\n\nThe Numbers Behind the Career\n\nShah's career trajectory is punctuated by measurable impacts across multiple organizations. At Comcast, his leadership on a fraud detection project reduced credit losses from millions to thousands within two months. His AI-driven tool at eBay shortened campaign setup times for sellers by 95 percent, significantly improving accessibility for smaller businesses. The mentorship program he introduced at eBay led to a 20 percent increase in team productivity. Shah's technical blog writing, including eight research papers, has garnered over 300 citations and over 5,000 reads by different professionals and students. His work on AI-as-a-Service models has influenced how businesses adopt scalable AI solutions.\n\nRecognition and Future Goals\n\nIn 2024, Shah received the Global Recognition Award for Engineering Leadership and Academic Excellence, a distinction that highlights his dual impact on corporate innovation and academic research. Additionally, he earned two Silver Claro Awards for his contributions to technology and artificial intelligence. His research paper titled \"Towards Safe AI: Ensuring Security in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning Models\" has been awarded for the contribution and honorable achievement in Innovative Research by the 26th edition of International Research Excellence and Best Paper Awards in Dec 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Shah is focused on integrating more privacy-preserving techniques, like federated learning, into commercial AI systems. \"As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring data security while maintaining functionality is crucial,\" he notes.\n\nA Career Built on Impact\n\nHarshal Shah's career exemplifies a blend of technical innovation and human-centered leadership. His contributions, whether through groundbreaking tools, insightful research, or dedicated mentorship, are a model for how engineering leaders can drive meaningful progress in their organizations and beyond. Shah is also a senior member of the IEEE and a fellow member of the \"International Organization for Academic and Scientific Development.\" Through these prestigious memberships, he actively contributes to mentorship initiatives and advancements in the fields of engineering and research, further solidifying his influence within the global technology community.\n\nAs Shah reflects, \"The most rewarding part of my career is seeing the ripple effects of my work, whether it is a new technology, a solution to a tough problem, or a colleague achieving their full potential.\"",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nBy Denise Clay-Murray\n\nRight now, everyone who was fighting against the Philadelphia 76ers building an arena in Chinatown needs to send NBA Commissioner Adam Silver a thank-you note.\n\nWhy? Because the rather dour news conference held at the Mayor\u2019s Reception Room announcing the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 decision to join forces with Comcast and build an arena that would be the home of both the Sixers and the Philadelphia Flyers was his doing.\n\nOn Saturday night, the buzz that the Sixers had changed their minds about building an arena near Chinatown was starting to mount. The word on the street was that NBA Commissioner Silver and Comcast CEO and chair Brian Roberts had met with Sixers owners Josh Harris, David Blitzer and David Adelman and said, in so many words, that the combination of bad publicity and the threat of scuttling the NBA\u2019s outreach into one of its biggest markets for growth \u2014 China, for those of you playing at home \u2014 made 76 Place a no-go.\n\nSo on Monday, Harris, Adelman, Roberts, Dan Hilferty, president and CEO of Comcast Spectacor, and even Silver via conference call were in the Mayor\u2019s Reception Room with the folks who were the last to know about this \u2014 Mayor Cherelle Parker, Council President Kenyatta Johnson, and some of the 12 members of City Council that voted to approve the arena \u2014 to give what would have to pass for details right now.\n\nNot even comedian Wanda Sykes could lighten the mood. More on why she was there in a minute.\n\nThe arena would open in 2031, but could open earlier, according to a press release issued by Comcast and Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment. In addition to the arena, both sides promised a 50/50 development in Center City to replace the arena that was supposed to be an anchor of a commercial corridor seriously in need of one, Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThe neighborhood needs a vibrancy, and the Sixers have been right about that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s another project, and that\u2019s going to require thought and starting over, but we\u2019re committed to that.\u201d\n\nWhat that means wasn\u2019t clear. But what was clear is that Comcast is getting a minority stake in the Sixers and has promised to help the city get a WNBA franchise.\n\n(That was, by the way, why Sykes was there. She and her wife Alex have been part of a group that has been championing a WNBA franchise for the city.)\n\nDespite having enough egg on it to build the world\u2019s largest frittata, Mayor Parker put on a brave face and said that in spite of the time wasted, and the political capital expended, Philadelphia will benefit in the end. Even Chinatown will benefit, because the $20 million pledged by the city for affordable housing will be honored, she said.\n\nAs the poorest city of its size in America, all economic development needs to be at least considered, Parker said.\n\n\u201cPhilly, this is a lot. This is a curveball that nobody saw coming, but we\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the mayor of the City of Philadelphia, I don\u2019t have the luxury of wallowing in this 180. We are not in a position to be able to lose revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could be a bad day if we were announcing that [the Sixers] were moving to Jersey. But we stand here today being able to accomplish everything we set out to do when we set out on this journey,\u201d Parker continued. \u201cWe talked about a revival of Market Street that would occur from City Hall down to the river. Nothing about that commitment has changed, except we will now fast-track the master plan and begin that process immediately.\u201d\n\nAlthough partnerships between the Sixers and Flyers have not traditionally benefitted the team \u2014 anyone who is a longtime sports fan here in the city remembers when the late Ed Snider owned both teams and used the Sixers to finance many of the questionable decisions he made with the Flyers \u2014 Harris was optimistic.\n\n\u201cI think that this is an exciting day for Philly,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe saw an opportunity for something even bigger than what we had planned. HBSE\u2019s new partnership with Comcast will see that Philadelphia will benefit from two projects instead of one. The journey to the best solution doesn\u2019t always go in a straight line, but I\u2019m positive that we\u2019re going in the right direction for Philly.\u201d\n\nBut that said, this direction could have been achieved earlier, Council President Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThis is a win-win, because plan B is better than plan A,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to double the revenue. We\u2019re still going to be focused on whether Black and Brown and women-owned businesses have a seat at the table. I wish y\u2019all could have gotten the deal done before we started the process. But this deal shows that at the end of the day, we have to focus on moving the city forward.\u201d\n\nThe new arena will be a part of the project that Comcast proposed some months ago that will be a partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Philadelphia Phillies, and the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing.\n\nI don\u2019t see any legislation coming before Council any time soon. And even if it does, it\u2019s going to have a hard way to go.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Councilmembers who voted in support of 76 Place, and those who voted against it, are more than a little angry because of how this all went down. To say that no one trusts most of the folks involved in this, especially the Sixers, would be the understatement of the year.\n\nAnd if the Sixers and Comcast think they\u2019re going to get Council President Johnson, whose district this will be a part of, to pay $259 a month for a Geo Metro, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a no.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nDisclaimer: The views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the author\u2019s employer, The Philadelphia Sunday SUN, the author\u2019s organization, committee or other group or individual.",

Comcast has pledged to commit the financial resources needed to revive the dormant Market East corridor, which is critically important to the Parker administration. For IBEW Local 98 and the building trades, a $1.3 billion construction project just turned into a multibillion-dollar mixed-use development in a stunning new sports district that will keep our members working for decades.\n\nMark Lynch Jr., business manager, IBEW Local 98\n\nConsumerless society\n\nIn my extra silverware caddie, I have a silver tablespoon with Gimbel Brothers engraved on the handle. I assume this was pilfered sometime back in the \u201840s or \u201850s when we built a middle class and working people could afford a little luxury, like eating out at the store\u2019s tearoom. Santa used to climb the fire truck ladder at our annual Thanksgiving Day Parade and enter Gimbels to see children until Christmas Eve. The problem facing our shopping district for the past 40 or 50 years isn\u2019t Amazon, it\u2019s the lack of living wages and time off. Fast food and shopping on Cyber Monday at work is the only way parents can get anything done, and far too often, DoorDash is the extra job that makes ends meet. Living wages and good benefits allowed us to have a consumer society and a vibrant downtown. Trickle-down economics destroyed it. Unless that changes, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMara Obelcz, Hatfield, momobelcz@gmail.com\n\nChilling numbness\n\nI think it is just a sad commentary on what we have become as a society that the story of young scholar and athlete Noah Scurry being gunned down while getting into a car to go to school was relegated to The Inquirer\u2019s Philly & Region section. What was on the front page? News of another Donald Trump sycophant trying to lie his way into a job, a murder that occurred in the \u201880s, how our mayor was played by two corporations, and, of course, Israel and Gaza news. I always thought of The Inquirer as a kind of barometer of what is important to everyday Philadelphians. I guess the killing of another youth just does not cut it anymore.\n\nVince Hughes, Middletown, Del., hudges@aol.com\n\nJoin the conversation: Send letters to letters@inquirer.com.

After all, many of Soros\u2019 fellow billionaires \u2014 including Steve Jobs\u2019 widow Laurene Powell Jobs and ex-Google chairman Eric Schmidt \u2014 had helped fund Biden\u2019s aborted re-election campaign. Major companies, too, have likewise dipped into their coffers at times to support the 46th president, such as back in 2021 when corporations like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Pfizer, Bank of America, AT&T, and Comcast put up $1 million each for Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\nFast forward four years later, with President-elect Trump preparing for his inauguration on Monday, and that same kind of political philanthropy from Big Tech CEOs to Trump is suddenly being decried as some kind of threat to the republic.\n\nImage source: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nWhile giving his farewell address from the Oval Office in recent days, for example, Biden saw nothing ironic in warning of an \u201coligarchy taking shape in America\u201d and of the \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultrawealthy people.\u201d Likewise, Democratic US Senators sent a letter with a barely veiled insinuation of corruption to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in response to his donation of $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 the same kind of donation, remember, that Biden got for his inauguration from both wealthy donors and corporations.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAltman tweeted out the letter he received from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet, which not only demanded that he explain himself and his donation, but added: \u201cWe are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.\u201d\n\nNoted Altman in his tweet: \u201cFunny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats\u2026\u201d\n\nSamuel Altman, CEO of OpenAI, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law May 16, 2023, in Washington, DC. Image source: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Altman isn\u2019t some sort of longtime Republican donor. \u201cI am voting against Trump because I believe the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America,\u201d Altman tweeted back in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s absuvie, erratic, and prone to fits or rage. I think he is unfit to be President and would be a threat to national security.\u201d Furthermore, ChatGPT \u2014 the high-profile chatbot launched by Altman\u2019s company, OpenAI \u2014 has been accused in the past of having a baked-in political bias that leans left (per The Washington Post).\n\nPerhaps Altman changed his mind about the incoming president. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case, but what I do know is that he also did the same thing that Democrat-leaning donors do all the time with no problem, and with no one in the press or in Congress questioning whether they\u2019re trying to curry favor or are potentially corrupt for doing so. Sens. Warren and Bennet, meanwhile, sent the same letter to Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos (incorrectly identified in their letter as Amazon\u2019s CEO), Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.\n\nThis scrutiny over political donations, obviously, raises important questions about fairness and consistency in holding powerful figures accountable. But if contributions from billionaires are to be viewed skeptically, that standard should obviously apply universally, regardless of the political party involved. Instead, these selective critiques risk deepening public cynicism about the integrity of institutions and leaders. Because, let\u2019s be real: If the other side had won in November, no one would be batting an eye at donations like these.\n\nI can certainly understand why people might be wondering what changed this time around, why the reaction from the business community to Trump\u2019s return is so different from what it was in 2016. Zuckerberg, for example, has gone through quite a dramatic MAGAmorposis. Likewise, Amazon\u2019s Prime Video streaming service has acquired a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, which it plans to release in the second half of this year. You would have never seen something like that in 2016, nor a statement about it like this one from the company: \u201cWe are excited to share this truly unique story with our millions of customers around the world,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said about the film, which counts Mrs. Trump as an executive producer.\n\nMaybe, though, instead of questioning the reality of political donations from only one side of the idealogical spectrum or why CEOs are doing what they do, perhaps there\u2019s a more substantive discussion to be had about why a recent poll found that most Americans can\u2019t point to one success of the Biden administration \u2014 and will, instead, remember him for doing \u201cnothing.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nWhen asked about the exact timing of potential rate cuts, Waller indicated that much depends on the continued improvement in inflation data. He stressed that the Fed is not in a rush to act, as Chair Jerome Powell has stated, and that they need to see more progress on inflation before making any decisions. Waller mentioned that while March is not entirely ruled out, any significant economic disruptions could push the timeline back. Regarding the number of rate cuts that might be expected this year, Waller reiterated that the data will drive the Fed\u2019s decisions. He noted that the extent of progress on inflation and the perception of the neutral rate among policymakers will influence the number of cuts.\n\nThe latest consumer price data has sparked optimism among investors, as easing inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts create a more favorable environment for businesses and markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 best cheap stocks to buy for 2025, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 15 as of January 15.

The Legacy Motor Club driver is known for giving back to his community and has received various honors for his contributions in recent years. The racer was the recipient of the 2024 Comcast Community Champion of the Year award, for his selfless work in early cancer screenings and detections. Last year, Hurricane Helene caused billions of dollars worth of damages, causing devastation in the Southeast. However, Jones stepped up once again, lending a helping hand through his foundation.\n\nThe Michigan-based racer isn\u2019t just helping humans but also animals affected by the category four storm. With winter currently underway, Jones has identified the potential challenges affecting livestock and has taken prompt action to provide relief.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nErik Jones comes to the rescue once again\n\nErik Jones might not be lighting it up on the track, but he\u2019s surely winning hearts off it. The Legacy Motor Club driver had somewhat of a lackluster Cup Series campaign in 2024, finishing 28th in the drivers standing after securing just one top-five and two top-ten results throughout the season. However, his contributions off the racing track were far more impactful, with his foundation providing donations and offering programs to a variety of communities in need of assistance. Recognizing his contributions, Comcast offered the Erik Jones Foundation a $60,000 grant in 2024, which will also go towards charity.\n\nIt seems like Erik Jones has now extended his assistance towards livestock as well. A tweet uploaded by his foundation read, \u201cThe Erik Jones Foundation is proud to support animals in need following the devastating flooding in Western North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene. We teamed up with a group of farmers from Northern Michigan to ship essential winter feed, providing much-needed relief to those affected. This partnership is a reflection of Erik\u2019s connection to his two home states.\u201d\n\nJones was born in Byron, Michigan, which is where he began his racing journey with midget cars at the age of seven. Naturally, Hurricane Helene\u2019s devastation hit close to home, prompting the racer to take prompt action to provide relief for the victims. The 28-year-old is also attached to North Carolina, as his home is in Cornelius, where he lives with his wife Holly Shelton, and son David Wayne Jones. The subsequent flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene severely affected the livestock in the two states, and Jones\u2019 contributions will provide much-needed relief to the farmers during winter.\n\nErik Jones\u2019 selfless efforts have helped him build a good reputation in the community, with Matt Lederer, vice president of brand partnerships and amplification of Comcast saying, \u201cErik has consistently demonstrated his passion for meeting people where they are\u2014offering support, resources, and hope.\u201d The Cup Series driver also began an initiative called #ReadWithErik during the COVID-19 pandemic, where he filmed himself reading children\u2019s books on Facebook, and hosted in-person meetings on racetracks and in schools.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nJones has much to prove in the 2025 season\n\nErik Jones is not a rookie. The 28-year-old has spent eight full seasons at NASCAR\u2019s highest level but has not finished above 15th in the driver standings in all those years. With Legacy Motor Club making wholesale changes to its backroom staff, expectations will be high from Jimmie Johnson going into the 2025 season. While his off-track contributions are commendable, the Michigan native needs to significantly improve his performances in the Cup Series.\n\nStatistically, 2024 was the worst year in Jones\u2019 career in NASCAR\u2019s premier series. With an average finish of 22.9, the racing driver struggled to take advantage of his experience to climb up grid positions during races. He also missed two races because of a back injury sustained during a clash at Talladega Superspeedway, which may have also affected his momentum. Ben Beshore, who began the season as crew chief for John Hunter Nemechek shifted to the No. 43 team for the last five fixtures, but the change yielded no improvement in results.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, 2025 marks a new beginning for Erik Jones. He showed glimpses of his former self at the 2024 YellaWood 500, where he finished fifth, his best result of the season. The two-time Southern 500 winner will be expected to challenge for a playoff spot if he wants to safeguard his future with Legacy Motor Club. Perhaps a full season with Ben Beshore atop the pit box might help the racing driver overturn his slump in form. Time will tell if Jones manages to turn his situation around in the upcoming Cup Series campaign.",

            "content": "What we\u2019ve read about the firestorms that are consuming entire towns and neighborhoods in metropolitan Los Angeles is traumatic for every Californian. The magnitude of the catastrophe is hard to comprehend.\n\nMost of us believed that wildfires that enveloped significant parts of Santa Rosa and the town of Paradise in Butte County were as bad as it gets. Wrong.\n\nSince the L.A. fires started, when I travel about Marin, I envision the daunting threat that we could face. Yes, the hot and dry Santa Ana winds are a longtime feature of the Southland. Yet, in years past they didn\u2019t reach a velocity of 100 mph, and they weren\u2019t a wintertime hazard.\n\nUnlike Northern California, which has plentiful rain this year, it\u2019s been a virtually rain-free winter south of the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nOne must be blind to reality either by ideology or political passion not to see the clear evidence that the climate is changing. These winds and persistently dry winters are a major climatic change for the L.A. Basin.\n\nTo deny what anyone can see is akin to stubborn passengers on the Titanic who, even after the iceberg caved in the ship\u2019s hull, refused to enter a lifeboat. The soon-to-be-deceased passengers remained convinced, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the vessel was unsinkable.\n\nWhile driving around Marin, my eyes are wide open and reflecting on what I\u2019ve read about what happened in places like Pacific Palisades.\n\nThink of the potential for a wind-driven fire as you travel through wooded hillside neighborhoods in Sausalito, Mill Valley, Corte Madera, Belvedere, Larkspur, San Anselmo, Ross, Larkspur, Novato and San Rafael. Every Marin municipality, plus unincorporated neighborhoods like Tamalpais Valley, Strawberry, Kentfield and San Geronimo, have characteristics like areas in Los Angeles. All have narrow streets loaded with foliage on all sides. Evacuation will be a challenge.\n\nIt can happen here. If the climate is changing in Southern California, it\u2019s more slowly but surely changing in Marin. Droughts are no stranger to North Bay residents. Our already strong winds could change into even stronger gusts.\n\nMarin has made major efforts financed by successful ballot measures to fund clearing vegetation from fire prone hillsides and encourage home hardening. Firefighters\u2019 stated goal is to prevent a small fire from getting out of control and becoming major. Yet when the winds howl, a small fire can become an unstoppable firestorm under adverse climatic conditions.\n\nNone of our prudent efforts have changed the reality that wildland fire is the greatest risk to life and property in Marin.\n\nWhat to do? Make certain your homeowners\u2019 or renters\u2019 insurance policy covers the full cost of replacing your home and its contents along with coverage for living expenses during a lengthy rebuilding process.\n\nCalifornia already has a property insurance crisis. Forty million Golden State residents aren\u2019t golden enough to keep for-profit insurance giants from quitting the California market after they pay out far more in claims than they received in premiums.\n\nLosses associated with L.A. fires will be billions of dollars. It\u2019s already difficult to obtain adequate property insurance. It\u2019s going to be even worse once L.A.-area fire claims are filed.\n\nMarin\u2019s fire flow lines operated by the Marin Municipal and the North Marin water districts, like those in Los Angeles, are designed to provide sufficient water to fight fires simultaneously in two or three residences or commercial buildings. They are inadequate to stem a firestorm that consumes entire neighborhoods.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to complain about high water rates needed to finance expanded fire flow capacity when an L.A.-style disaster seems a distant prospect. Then when your own home evaporates, others will complain that bigger pipes and increased water storage capacity should have been accomplished years ago.\n\nColumnist Dick Spotswood of Mill Valley writes on local issues Sundays and Wednesdays.

Bukaty/Associated Press\n\nOne of Connecticut's largest cable television providers has moved two regional sports networks to a more costly programming tier.\n\nNew England Sports Network (NESN) and NBC Sports Boston are being moved from Comcast's basic programming tier, known as Popular, to the cable provider's Ultimate, or premium tier. New England Sports Network carries Boston Bruins and Red Sox games as well as Big East college hockey games, while NBC Sports Boston is the telecast home of the Boston Celtics.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nComcast officials said Wednesday the programming shift will result in Connecticut consumers who want to watch programming from both regional sports networks to pay an additional $20 monthly for the upgrade to the premium tier, plus a regional sports network fee of $15.

Thanks to a new deal, NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California no longer exist on the standard \u201cPopular TV\u201d package and now reside on the \u201cUltimate TV\u201d cable tier, along with the official networks for the four major sports.\n\nFunctionally that means roughly $50 more in cable fees each month for local fans who want to watch the Giants, Warriors, San Jose Sharks, and the Sacramento Kings. Cable viewers who don\u2019t want to watch local sports do get to save a regional sports fee, but people who do want to watch their local teams suddenly have to sign up for a brand-new level of cable, at a significantly higher price.\n\nIt\u2019s another blow in the relationship between regional sports networks and the major sports they broadcast. A total of 27 teams from MLB, NBA, and the NHL lost their broadcasters when the Diamond Sports Group, owner of Bally Sports, declared bankruptcy in early 2023. They made a deal where some subscribers can watch their games through Amazon Prime, but MLB has to produce and distribute games for seven different teams.\n\nFrom 2013-2020, less than half of fans in the Los Angeles area could watch Dodgers games due to a dispute between their regional network and AT&T. Many fans in Denver can\u2019t watch the Denver Nuggets or Colorado Avalanche thanks to a stalemate between Comcast and their RSN. As consumers increasingly cut the cord and move to streaming or other options, cable providers are scrambling to make up for the lost fees in other places.\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re a fans of the Giants or Warriors or Sharks, this sucks for you.\n\nOf course, NBC Sports isn\u2019t the only channel you get when you go Ultimate. Here is an incomplete list of channels available on the XFinity \u201cUltimate\u201d tier that you don\u2019t get on the \u201cPopular TV\u201d package.\n\nThe American Heroes Channel: Mainly military documentaries, which means a whole lot of shows about Nazis.\n\nBabyFirst: Programing exclusively for viewers 0-3 years old.\n\nBET Her: Shows reruns of Martin, Family Matters, Sister, Sister, Kenan & Kel and three different Tyler Perry sitcoms.\n\nCooking Channel: Like the Food Network, only all reruns!\n\nDiscovery Life: Reruns from TLC.\n\nDiscovery Family: Mainly cartoons based on Hasbro toys.\n\nFanDuel TV: Because it\u2019s hard to find cable sports programming that talks about gambling.\n\nFYI Channel: The only place to see reruns of \u201cBilly the Exterminator,\u201d\n\nHallmark Mystery: If two channels of Hallmark movies weren\u2019t enough for you.\n\nMTV2: They don\u2019t show music videos either.\n\nOvation: It\u2019s not totally clear what their focus is, but they were owned by Harvey Weinstein until 2017.\n\nScreenPix: Do you know what ScreenPix is? Neither do we, but you get four different channels of it.\n\nSportsman: Shows about hunting and fishing, including a Sarah Palin reality show and a news magazine show produced by the NRA.\n\nVice TV: They went bankrupt in 2023, but now Vice TV is the only place on cable to watch \u201cThe Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis.\u201d\n\nAs a side note, \u201cXfinity\u201d is a stupid, stupid name. It\u2019s \u201cInfinity\u201d with an \u201cX,\u201d something a surly teenager would choose as the name for his terrible garage band that only plays Kings of Leon cover songs. Or a South African billionaire desperately trying to make Redditors thins he\u2019s cool. It sounds like \u201cEx-finity,\u201d which seems to mean, there were infinte options for you, but now there aren\u2019t. And also it\u2019s 50 dollars a month to watch the local sports teams collectively try to barely finish above .500. This author feels dumber simply spelling the name out.\n\nSo whether or not the Giants pony up for a new first baseman, better relief pitching, or a starting pitcher who was born after Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, fans will have to pony up to watch their games next season.",

            "content": "Regarding the potential for a good year in the stock market, especially after the S&P\u2019s back-to-back 20%+ gains, Lee expressed a high level of optimism, estimating an 80% chance of achieving double-digit returns for the year. He highlighted the positive start to January, with the S&P main index already up 0.7% by January 15, as a good harbinger for the year ahead. However, Lee acknowledged that the market\u2019s performance could be challenged if bond yields remain elevated, as this would represent a severe tightening of financial conditions, potentially impacting sectors such as housing.\n\nLee also discussed the implications of the California fires on future inflation, suggesting that these events could introduce additional volatility. However, he remains optimistic about the inflation outlook over the next three months, expecting it to be significantly lower compared to the levels seen in November and October. He pointed out that the inflation figures in January of last year were around 0.4%, indicating that the upcoming months could offer favorable comparisons, which is positive for the market.\n\nIn an interview on January 16, Tom Lee, Managing Partner at Fundstrat provided his outlook on the current market dynamics and stock performance expectations for the year. Lee noted that the market is showing relief following the better-than-expected December Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI), has been dovish. This has set the stage for bond yields, which had been approaching 5%, to cool down, particularly in a context where market sentiment has been largely negative. Lee emphasized that the recent dovish inflation prints, including the core CPI, have alleviated fears of a hot number, leading to a reduction in the probability of a rate hike, as reflected in the Fed funds futures.\n\nStocks rallied on January 15, following an encouraging consumer price index (CPI) report that indicated a slowdown in core inflation and strong earnings from major U.S. banks. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 3.2% in December, down from the previous month and slightly below the 3.3% forecast by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. Headline inflation increased 2.9% over the past year, matching expectations.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Cheapest Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) stands against other cheapest stocks with biggest upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen asked about the market\u2019s resilience if the Federal Reserve does not cut rates until later in the year and bond yields remain high, Lee admitted that such a scenario would test the market\u2019s resolve. While he doesn\u2019t believe it would be fatal for equities, he noted that it would be difficult for investors to remain highly bullish if yields stay near 5% for the next six months. This could raise concerns about a policy error from the Fed, either due to financial conditions being too tight or the bears arguing that the Fed cut too aggressively in the past.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s positive momentum, fueled by encouraging inflation data and strong earnings reports, suggests a promising outlook for the year ahead. Companies with strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and undervaluation are positioned for significant returns.\n\nWhy Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Is One of the Cheapest Stock with Biggest Upside Potential?\n\nA couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 cheapest stocks with biggest upside potential, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 10 as of January 15. We then sourced the analysts\u2019 average price targets and picked the 12 stocks that had the highest upside potential. We also included their stock price as of January 15 and their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average upside potential as of January 15.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nUpside Potential: 31.53%\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of January 15: 8.24\n\nStock Price as of January 15: $36.38\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 72\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest cable, broadband, and telecommunications companies with a significant presence in the United States. The company serves millions of customers through its various business units, including Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. Comcast Cable\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is expanding its broadband connectivity and enhancing its network capabilities to meet the growing demand of consumers and businesses.

            "content": "One of our best sports betting sites is about to get more exposure.\n\nComcast has extended the integration of sports betting into Xfinity X1 by adding live odds from FanDuel into the Xfinity Odds Zone. After integrating DraftKings in March 2024, this move lets customers view and interact with odds from two of our best sports betting apps while watching their favorite teams.\n\nX1's Odds Zone is a two-screen environment where odds are delivered live and right next to major sporting events broadcasts. It pairs real-time betting data with live coverage of professional sports. Among the included leagues are MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, NCAA Basketball - Men's and Women's, NCAA Football, PGA Tour, and the WNBA.\n\nComcast VP of Sports Entertainment Vito Forlenza said in a statement about the launch, \"X1 is the best seat in the house for live sports, and now with FanDuel as part of Odds Zone, we're making it even better for fans by integrating odds from another top sportsbook directly into their viewing experience.\"\n\nOne of the key features in the Odds Zone is the ability to let bettors make a wager right from the screen. In this regard, there is a QR code displayed on the interface, which redirects customers to the FanDuel mobile app when scanned. The QR code will pre-populate the selected wager onto the app\u2019s bet slip, enabling users to instantly place bets.\n\nKarol Corcoran, Senior Vice President and General Manager of FanDuel Sportsbook, commented, \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with Comcast to enhance how our customers can watch and wager on their favorite teams and athletes. Integrating FanDuel odds into the Xfinity Odds Zone offers sports fans another way to interact with our robust sports betting offering, and we look forward to collaborating with Comcast to continue elevating the game day viewing experience.\u201d\n\nFanDuel has recently pushed itself into the media broadcasts market, launching its FanDuel Sports Network product in several US states in December. With this move, the company now broadcasts in several US states, providing pregame and postgame coverage of seven MLB, 12 NBA, and eight NHL teams.\n\nIts been a busy few months for the sports betting behemoth which you don't even need a FanDuel promo code to take advantage of its excellent offerings.\n\nFanDuel on Xfinity Odds Zone in legal states\n\nComcast highlighted that the Odds Zone is available to all customers who have access to X1. However, the ability to wager is restricted to only those states with legal sports betting and where DraftKings and FanDuel operate.\n\nAccording to data compiled from Comcast, DraftKings, and FanDuel, Comcast customers can place wagers in states where one of the two sportsbooks is licensed.\n\nThere are currently 26 states and jurisdictions that Comcast shares with one or the other sportsbook, including the Colorado sports betting, Connecticut sports betting, Illinois sports betting, Indiana sports betting, Maryland sports betting, Massachusetts sports betting, Michigan sports betting, New Jersey sports betting, North Carolina sports betting, Pennsylvania sports betting, Tennessee sports betting, Virginia sports betting, and the DC sports betting markets.\n\nComcast also announced that a new sports betting hub will launch on X1 in the coming months. It will be a central destination for fans, bringing together live odds, sports betting resources, and fantasy sports tools in one place.",

            "content": "Comcast Using Industry to Grow Platform\n\nLike the sports betting industry, competition between streaming platforms is fierce in the US. With so many Americans ditching cable, traditional media giants like Comcast must find ways to compete against new rivals. The company hopes that they can use sports betting to do so.\n\nMany channels and platforms use live odds, but few streaming services do. DraftKings's deal was a strong start, and its success led to its addition of FanDuel, which offers odds from the two top sportsbooks in the US.\n\nLive Sports Remain Key Market\n\nWith major networks using their own streaming platforms to access shows on demand, live sports have become incredibly valuable. Companies like Comcast are battling over rights for leagues, but sports betting represents a new market for rivals to compete.\n\nComcast hopes their Odds Zone will help lure sports bettors to switch. While platforms like YouTubeTV and Fubu have better sports, the ability to access live odds sets Xfinity X1 apart. Time will tell if the move pays off and if other rivals follow suit.\n\nWill Odds Draw Attention from Lawmakers?\n\nSince launching DraftKings odds last year, Comcast has avoided scrutiny from lawmakers. However, calls for increased regulations on sports betting have grown since then, thanks to an uncontrolled spike in problem and underage gambling.\n\nThe biggest issue could be the availability of the Odds Zone. The threat to those struggling with gambling addiction is clear, but the more significant threat is to underage residents. The country has seen many young people begin to find ways to place bets. While regulated Sportsbooks have tools to prevent underage gambling, it's not always enough. There are also offshore sportsbooks, which care little about the age of its customers.\n\nWhile the Odds Zone isn\u2019t technically advertising, new federal legislation could soon change that. If it does, it will spell the end of the offering.",

            "content": "Entire direct-to-consumer empires have been built on the back of paid social and search advertising. But empires have to think about the long term to last.\n\nWith platforms such as Facebook and Instagram becoming more expensive and quite possibly less brand safe, Comcast hopes to tempt away DTC advertisers from those performance-focused channels and lead them toward TV and CTV inventory. Its execs hope a new ad sales platform, Universal Ads, could help convert performance marketers into long-term brand builders.\n\nIt\u2019s a move many DTC and SME brands would welcome, according to eight media buyers working with DTC clients that spoke with Digiday. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean a shift in DTC spend to TV is a fait accompli.\n\nPull and push\n\nBuilt by Comcast ad tech firm FreeWheel, Universal Ads grants buyers access to ad inventory across NBCUniversal, A+E, AMC Networks, Fox, Paramount, Roku, TelevisaUnivision and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is unlock that [latent] demand and create a front door into the premium video category,\u201d said Comcast Advertising president James Rooke, who spoke with Digiday from CES, where the platform was unveiled.\n\nSpecifically, Rooke wants to open the door to the thousands of advertisers beyond Fortune 500 rankings. He described them as \u201cdigitally native, direct to consumer companies that have never bought our category, but are looking for new qualified audiences to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey of 250 non-TV performance advertisers Comcast conducted last year, 50% said they\u2019d detected worse returns on their paid social spend, while 89% said they\u2019d be willing to try TV.\n\nThe platform includes a marketing API that Rooke said will bring DTC and small-business marketers the measurement and attribution for TV and CTV ads they\u2019re used to getting for social.\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous opportunity to steal market share from our tech competitors in a very unique and collaborative approach that will change the advertising landscape in a big way,\u201d said Mark Marshall, chairman, global advertising and partnerships, NBCUniversal, in an email. Marshall declined to share precise revenue expectations.\n\nComcast\u2019s move follows the launches of self-service platforms by Paramount last year, Peacock in 2022 and Hulu in 2020.\n\nAccording to Rooke and Marshall, the aim is to attract DTC advertisers and SME brands that might previously have steered clear of TV, due to either price or lack of attribution.\n\n\u201cI could see it working for someone that is trying to get into the CTV space, but don\u2019t know how,\u201d said Eric Tilbury, senior director of ad operations and product solution engineering at Inuvo, an ad tech startup that provides media buying services.\n\nLess bang for the buck\n\nThough buyers still say paid social is a key component of the DTC and SME advertising playbook, several told Digiday there\u2019s plenty of reasons for brands to begin looking elsewhere.\n\nFrom a DTC perspective, the channel is choked with ads for competitors, and it\u2019s costlier than it once was.\n\nPaid social has indeed become more expensive for advertisers in recent years. According to performance marketing agency Gupta Media\u2019s social media CPM tracker, Meta\u2019s average CPM rate for 2023 was $7.15, increasing to $7.50 in 2024; TikTok\u2019s CPMs came in at $3.48 in 2023, stretching to $3.77 in 2024; and Snapchat\u2019s CPMs rose the fastest, averaging $5.20 in 2023, but bumping up to $7.65 in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clearly at a point where we\u2019ve reached diminishing returns,\u201d said Katy Geisreiter, planning director, Media by Mother. Her colleague, account director Daniela Elvira, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s not scaling as it did before. It\u2019s heavily saturated.\u201d\n\nScott Harkey, founder and CEO of full service agency OH Partners, noted that he\u2019s experienced diminishing returns on search and social \u201cfor the last two or three years.\u201d\n\nAnother factor that could push nascent brands toward TV and CTV? Meta\u2019s recent decision to fire its fact-checkers and roll back misinformation guardrails. Though so far treated with wariness rather than panic by advertisers, the move makes it easier for execs like Rooke to persuade brands shifting from short-term to long-term activity to consider premium video.\n\n\u201cWhat Meta has done is great for Universal Ads,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an opportunity to define premium video as a highly transparent, brand-safe category, and now you can access it in a single, simplistic way with scale.\u201d\n\nUp the funnel\n\nEven in an era of declining linear viewership, TV\u2019s reach makes it a blunt but effective instrument \u2014 and marketers at maturing DTC brands understand its value, said John Gladysz, head of product at Noble People, which counts Oofos and Marco\u2019s Pizza among its DTC clients.\n\nStreaming video and TV are effective tools for bringing a brand to new audiences \u2014 and money spent on them could provide a greater return in time by widening a brand\u2019s customer base, compared with budget assigned to paid social that drives sales from the same set of consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at your upper- and your mid-funnel, there\u2019s real cost benefits to leaning into richer things: CTV, YouTube, [premium] video. Two or three of those impressions are going to go a lot farther than nine or 10 social impressions,\u201d Gladysz said.\n\nDan Salkey, co-founder of creative agency Small World, which works with DTC brands such as Dr Squatch, agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see scale ups add in TV in a way that is more savvy and smart,\u201d he said, but he declined to provide specific client spend figures.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only answers, though. Out-of-home, streaming audio, podcasts and radio can each fill a similar role for marketers wielding smaller budgets.\n\nOH Partners\u2019 Harkey suggested that Universal Ads\u2019 ability to draw in these smaller advertisers would depend on the quality of measurement derived from its API access, given the caution shown around TV by performance marketers.\n\nHe\u2019s onto something with that observation. And for Matt Larson, vp of media and connection strategy at Collective Measures, that\u2019s actually the \u201cbig question \u2026 The challenge will continue to be the ability to attribute those sales back to the efforts themselves.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Digiday initially incorrectly characterized Noble People\u2019s clients.",

Platforms like fubo and YouTube TV include NBC Sports Bay Area in their channel lineups, giving local fans full access to their favorite teams without the extra cost and hassle of cable. Unlike traditional cable subscriptions, these streaming platforms come with added perks like no long-term contracts, mobile viewing options, built-in DVR features, and a seemingly endless library of movies and TV shows. It\u2019s a convenient way to enjoy live sports without being tied down to a pricey cable plan.\n\nFor Bay Area fans tired of Comcast\u2019s rising costs and limited options, now might be the perfect time to make the switch. Streaming services offer a better viewing experience with flexibility that cable can\u2019t match. Whether it\u2019s catching the Warriors\u2019 next big game or following every pitch of the Giants\u2019 season later this year, these platforms provide an easy, hassle-free way to stay connected to your favorite teams. And with many services offering free trials, making the transition to streaming is easier than ever.\n\nHow to stream NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nSwitching to a streaming service is the easiest way to keep up with the Warriors, Giants, and Sharks without agreeing to Comcast\u2019s higher pricing. Here are the top streaming platforms that offer NBC Sports Bay Area to fans in the local region, along with any free trials and the current monthly pricing:\n\nfuboTV ($45 for the first month then $80/month; 7-day free trial)\n\nHulu + Live TV ($83/month with a 3-day free trial; also gives you access to Disney+ and ESPN+)\n\nYouTube TV ($60/month for the first three months, then $83/month; 7-day free trial)\n\nDIRECTV STREAM ($90/month; 5-day free trial)\n\nFor fans outside of the Bay Area who want to watch every Warriors game this season, NBA League Pass is the only real option. The service offers access to pretty much every game, letting you follow the Warriors no matter where you live. With options for team-specific or full-league coverage, NBA League Pass is ideal for out-of-market fans who want to catch the action all season long. It allows you to tune into the local broadcast, so you\u2019ll still be hearing the game just as it would sound if you were watching NBC Sports Bay Area from your couch in San Francisco.",

            "content": "Comcast Corporation is a global telecommunications conglomerate headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, the company has become one of the world's largest media and technology companies. The mission of Comcast is to \"create and deliver innovative entertainment and communication experiences that connect people to what they love.\"\n\nComcast is primarily involved in three main businesses: cable communications, cable networks, and broadcasting. The company provides cable television, high-speed internet, and home phone services to more than 30 million residential and business customers across the United States. Additionally, the company owns and operates broadcast television networks, including NBC and Telemundo.\n\nComcast targets a diverse range of consumers, from families seeking premium entertainment to businesses looking for reliable communication services. The company's key customers include residential and commercial customers, advertisers, and content producers. Comcast operates across the United States, with a strong presence in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nComcast's management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts, who has been with the company since 1981. Roberts has played an instrumental role in the growth of Comcast, overseeing significant acquisitions such as NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation. Other key management team members include Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh.\n\nOver the past few years, Comcast has delivered declining financial performance, with revenues and net income down. Comcast's profit margins have also declined, with an average gross profit margin of around 4.5%.\n\nComcast's debt levels have increased in recent years due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and other significant investments. However, the company maintains a strong credit rating, with a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poors. In 2020, Comcast announced the completion of its acquisition of Xumo, a free, ad-supported streaming service, which is expected to drive long-term growth.\n\nComcast's valuation metrics align with its media and entertainment industry peers. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book are both lower than industry averages. Its strong financial performance and growth prospects drive the company's valuation, particularly in the streaming and broadband markets.\n\nComcast's stock has been on a declining trajectory for the past few years. The company's market capitalization is around $160 billion, down from $268 billion a few years ago. However, Comcast is still one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The company's strong performance is driven by its lackluster performance and the continued trend of \"cord-cutting.\"\n\nComcast operates in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industry, characterized by rapidly changing technologies and shifting consumer preferences. The company faces intense competition from a range of players, including traditional cable providers, streaming services, and telecom companies.\n\nOne key advantage that Comcast has is its extensive infrastructure and network capabilities. The company has invested heavily in its broadband network and is well-positioned to continue delivering customers high-quality internet and other services. Additionally, the company has successfully leveraged its extensive content library to launch its streaming service, Peacock, which consumers have received well.\n\nComcast also faces some significant challenges in the industry. In recent years, there has been a trend toward cord-cutting as more consumers shift away from traditional cable and satellite television in favor of streaming services. This trend will likely continue in the coming years, and Comcast must adapt its offerings accordingly to remain competitive.\n\nComcast has several growth opportunities available to it in the coming years. One key area of focus for the company is the expansion of its streaming offerings. The launch of Peacock has been a promising start, and the company is likely to continue investing in this area to compete with other streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nAnother area of focus for Comcast is its international expansion. The company has already made significant investments in Europe and plans to continue expanding its offerings in this region in the coming years. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of DreamWorks Animation provides it with a significant foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, which is expected to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nComcast faces a number of risks and challenges that could impact its future performance. One key challenge is the ongoing trend toward cord-cutting, which could affect the company's revenue from traditional cable and satellite television offerings. Rising interest rates and increasing competition in the streaming space could also threaten the company's financial performance.\n\nComcast must continue innovating and investing in new technologies and offerings to address these risks to remain competitive. The company will also need to focus on risk management strategies and ensure that it has adequate resources to weather any disruptions in the industry.",

This has been the most rewarding chapter of my professional career and I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished, which has been made possible only by you.\u201d\n\nThe changes have come thick and fast at Comcast over the past week, as a major reorganisation takes place ahead of its planned spin-off of seven cable networks into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new entity, currently dubbed SpinCo, will comprise MSNBC, USA Network, CNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, in addition to digital assets Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and SportsEngine. Mark Lazarus is moving from his role as chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group to become the CEO of SpinCo, which is set to launch later this year.\n\nNotable changes over the past seven days include the departure of Peacock president Kelly Campbell, the appointment of an executive team to lead SpinCo and the announcement that children\u2019s net Universal Kids will close in early March.\n\nJones\u2019 departure comes during a pronounced ratings dip following Donald Trump\u2019s election as the next US president.\n\nIn a memo, Lazarus said Jones had \u201cexpertly navigated MSNBC through a years-long, unrelenting and unprecedented news cycle, all while driving the network to record viewership and making investments in non-linear businesses. MSNBC is well-positioned for the future.\u201d\n\nAs president, Jones had oversight of all programming, digital, new businesses, editorial units, business development and technical operations. Before being named president, she was the senior VP of NBC News and MSNBC.\n\nKutler joined MSNBC as senior VP of content strategy in September 2022 after spending more than a decade with CNN. In her final role at the Warner Bros Discovery-owned news brand, she served as senior VP and head of programming at the short-lived news streaming service CNN+.

He has called for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to take away \u201clicenses\u201d from media outlets that fact check his lies, for example.\n\nTrump has also encouraged violence against members of the media. At a rally during his 2024 campaign, he downplayed what he thought was a man attacking news reporters, telling his followers that the individual was \u201con our side\u201d as they were booing him. At another rally, he pointed out that a would-be assassin would \u201chave to shoot through\u201d reporters in order to reach him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that so much,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Meyers and other late-night comedians continue to showcase Trump\u2019s views to a mass audience, news media are starting to capitulate to the president-elect. (Recently, for example, ABC News agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit Trump made against them instead of challenging his dubious legal arguments, demonstrating that his attacks are seemingly working.)\n\n\u201cThis will be a prime MO of the second Trump administration,\u201d The Nation\u2019s Chris Lehmann said in a recent interview with Democracy Now. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very worrisome that even before Trump takes office, [news networks are], without cause, giving in. It sends a very distressing signal.\u201d\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.

            "content": "- Advertisement -\n\nComcast reached an agreement with NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California that has resulted in the regional sports networks being moved to a more expensive tier, requiring users to upgrade to receive access to local broadcasts of the San Francisco Giants, Golden State Warriors, San Jose Sharks, Sacramento Kings and Athletics. The networks had previously been available on the Popular TV package, accounting for a price difference of approximately $20 per month as of Tuesday, which is when the change went into effect. A similar move took place in Boston with NESN and NBC Sports Boston agreeing to deals with Xfinity moving to the higher tier.\n\nAccording to a Comcast spokesperson, company data demonstrates that most viewers of regional sports networks are already subscribed to the Ultimate TV tier. Furthermore, the company conveyed that the decision to make this move was related to augmented programming costs, particularly as it relates to sports broadcasting rights. The company is offering promotional deals for users who are looking to upgrade their subscription plan. Conversely, customers who are subscribed to the Popular TV fan will have a reduction in fees.\n\n\u201cComcast is pleased to have reached agreements with NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California to continue offering their networks in a way that reflects the changing video marketplace for local sports and provides our customers with a choice,\u201d Comcast said in a statement. \u201cWe are notifying customers that effective [January 14, 2025], NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California will be available on the Ultimate TV level of service. While the majority of customers shouldn\u2019t be impacted, we have promotional offers for customers with Popular TV service who want to continue receiving NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned regional sports networks, the Ultimate TV subscription tier also includes league-owned networks, along with seven additional sports networks and more than 50 other channels. NBC Sports Philadelphia is remaining on the Popular TV tier at the moment, but Comcast has moved approximately 30 RSNs to its Ultimate TV tier for over a year as carriage agreements approach expiration.\n\nBarrett Media produces daily content on the music, news, and sports media industries.

Bond has, however, agreed to serve in an advisory role for a few years at NBCUniversal.\n\nComcast plans a spinoff of most of its cable networks into a separate entity, led by Mark Lazarus as CEO. Structured as a tax-free spinoff to Comcast shareholders, the transaction is expected to take around a year to complete.\n\n\u201cNBCUniversal has never been in better condition with respect to distribution,\u201d Bond declared in his exit announcement.\n\nThe full internal memo from Matt Bond follows:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nFirst, I want to congratulate you all for your work in this epic deal cycle through 2023 and 2024. These 17 deals were accomplished at a pivotal moment for NBCUniversal, spanning the intersection of streaming and linear cable and the creation of new packaging paradigms. We exceeded all our financial objectives while leaving flexibility for the growth of Peacock. As we\u2019ve done every year for the last 13 years, we achieved this without a single distribution dislocation. NBCUniversal has never been in better condition with respect to distribution. In the spirit of leaving on a high note, I have decided that it is the right time professionally and personally for me to retire. However, the company has asked me to serve in an advisory role for the next few years, and I have agreed to do so. As many of you know, I have been considering this for a long time, weighing my own personal challenges. But, as Lisa always told me, \u201cYou always want to leave just as the party is getting good.\u201d\n\nMatt Schnaars and I will be working through a transition, and we are working closely with Matt Strauss on how our team will fit into the new Media Group structure. As we work through those details, we will certainly share them with you. I could not be more grateful and honored to have been part of the Comcast NBCUniversal family for over 20 years. Once I came to Comcast in 2002, I never once looked for another job. Comcast is a wonderful family that cares about all its people, and that attitude starts with Brian and goes through the whole organization. The company has always treated me better than I expected or deserved.\n\nI also feel blessed to have worked with all of you \u2013 the smartest and most capable people in the industry. Together with many of you, we\u2019ve seen many changes in the television business, and we will see many more. But people love the content we produce, and the future looks exceptionally bright as new technologies expand the reach of our content. Through all of this, our team has remained nimble and found ways to navigate this change in a way that added value to NBCU, building a truly unparalleled reputation for success amongst our industry peers in the process. And I know this work doesn\u2019t come easy \u2013 it\u2019s the result of thousands of hours of late nights, often over weekends and holidays.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be prouder of the work that everyone has done over the last decade. It truly is a remarkable accomplishment. We have a small team, every one of whom is crucial to success of the whole. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, it\u2019s not often so many owe so much to so few. I won\u2019t be going far and look forward to continuing to work with you all in my new capacity.\n\nThank you for everything.\n\nMatt",

            "content": "These are uncertain times at MSNBC, and they just got a tad more uncertain. On Tuesday, Rashida Jones stepped down as president of the network.\n\nThe news doesn\u2019t come as a total shock. Media writer Oliver Darcy reported in his \u201cStatus\u201d newsletter last month that Jones was weighing an exit from MSNBC sometime in 2025.\n\nSo while it is not necessarily surprising, it is significant. Jones was named president of MSNBC in 2021, becoming the first Black woman to lead a major television news network. During her time, she helped push MSNBC past CNN in the ratings.\n\nThe timing, however, is notable. Jones steps away less than a week before Donald Trump returns to the White House in what surely will kick off a furious news cycle. More significantly, Jones leaves as Comcast, which owns MSNBC, looks to spin off the network and its other cable channels into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nJones told staff in a memo that she is to \u201cpursue new opportunities.\u201d Rebecca Kutler, MSNBC\u2019s senior vice president of content strategy, will serve as interim president. Jones is expected to stay on to help with the transition to a new president.\n\nMark Lazarus, who will oversee MSNBC\u2019s new parent spin-off company, reportedly told staff in a meeting, \u201cWhen Rashida shared this with me at the end of last week, I was surprised. I was a little saddened for the company but very happy for her to be able to come to grips with a hard decision \u2014 a very personal decision.\u201d\n\nThat would seem to indicate that it truly was Jones\u2019 decision.\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 David Bauder wrote, \u201cMSNBC\u2019s viewership has dropped 57% since Trump\u2019s election. The network notes that the post-election audience for cable networks closely associated with a losing candidate typically sinks, and that there are already signs that things are picking up again. Whether it will to the extent that it happened for MSNBC in 2017 is an open question, particularly with more people eliminating their cable service.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Jeremy Barr reported, \u201cMSNBC\u2019s prime-time audience last week averaged 950,000 total viewers, an increase of 36 percent from the network\u2019s performance in December. MSNBC averaged 1.22 million prime-time viewers in 2023.\u201d\n\nHowever, Barr added, \u201cA person with knowledge of the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, said Jones\u2019s departure is not tied to the ratings drop and that it was her decision.\u201d\n\nIt was only a day earlier when MSNBC announced that prime-time star Rachel Maddow would return to hosting her weeknight show five days a week for the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Maddow said it was Jones who approached her about that plan. That, it would appear, was Jones\u2019 final big move as head of the network.\n\nBut it was far from her only significant move. In what might have been her biggest on-air transaction, Jones lured former Joe Biden press secretary Jen Psaki to the network, where Psaki has become a solid broadcaster.\n\nOverall, Jones\u2019 stint as president should be considered a successful one. In addition, it\u2019s believed she was liked and respected by those at the network, particularly on-air talent.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Benjamin Mullin and John Koblin reported, \u201cOn Tuesday\u2019s call, Ms. Maddow said Ms. Jones had served as a \u2018heat shield\u2019 that protected MSNBC\u2019s anchors from pressure that would have otherwise been brought down on them. \u2018Other companies don\u2019t run that way, and it is because you\u2019ve been insistent that we treat each other respectfully and that you\u2019ll be the one who takes the outside heat,\u2019 Ms. Maddow said.\u201d\n\nAs far as Jones\u2019 interim replacement, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter writes, \u201cKutler spent 20 years at CNN, first as an intern for one of anchor Wolf Blitzer\u2019s programs in the Washington, DC, bureau. She later became a key producer, launched several shows for CNN, oversaw a roster of analysts and commentators, and headed up programming for CNN+, the short-lived streaming news service.\u201d\n\nIn his note to staff, Lazarus wrote, \u201cRebecca is the ideal leader to guide us through this moment, and I look forward to collaborating with her as we shape our collective future together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of MSNBC \u2026\n\nDave Bauder of the AP reported, \u201cLazarus also told employees Tuesday that MSNBC will keep its name. There had been some talk that it would be changed under new corporate leadership; the name was a result of a partnership with Microsoft when the network started in 1996. There have been few other indications of visible change for viewers yet due to the uncoupling from NBC News.\u201d\n\nThe story of Baltimore\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in media, then you must check out this story by my Poynter colleague, Angela Fu: \u201cA rare newspaper war was brewing in Baltimore. Then a billionaire owner began meddling.\u201d\n\nFu tells the story of the intriguing newspaper battle in Baltimore between The Baltimore Sun and the relatively new Baltimore Banner. The good old-fashioned newspaper war especially came into focus during the Francis Scott Key Bridge accident in March 2024.\n\nFu wrote, \u201cIn a country pocked with \u2018news deserts\u2019 and grappling with a decadeslong decline in local journalism, Baltimore was experiencing the opposite. The aggressive growth of the startup Banner in the past two years meant that the city had not one, but two powerhouse newsrooms ready to cover that devastating night in March.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Fu continued, \u201cwhat appeared to be a burgeoning \u2018newspaper war\u2019 \u2014 offering Baltimorians a new era of in-depth, daily coverage \u2014 now faces an uncertain future.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Fu\u2019s must-read media story gets rolling.\n\nEarlier this week, I had a chance to ask Fu about her story (she sits right next to me at work!). Here\u2019s our quick Q&A:\n\nTom Jones: What was it about Baltimore that made you want to explore this story?\n\nAngela Fu: Baltimore is pretty unique in that it has two large daily news operations. While many local news startups choose to launch in cities that already have legacy papers, they tend to be quite small, and few, if any, operate on the same scale as The Baltimore Banner. Within two years, the Banner\u2019s editorial staff surpassed The Baltimore Sun\u2019s in size. Add in all the change from the Sun\u2019s new ownership, and Baltimore was a very interesting city to do a deep dive into.\n\nJones: The story focuses pretty exclusively on Baltimore. Why does it matter for people who live elsewhere?\n\nFu: I think the story touches on two ongoing stories in media. One is the precarity that comes with billionaire ownership. Last year, The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times made headlines for their billionaire owners\u2019 antics, and we\u2019re seeing The Baltimore Sun grapple with its own challenges stemming from changes made by its new billionaire owner. The other is the longstanding struggle to find a sustainable model for local news. The Banner\u2019s approach to that challenge is fairly unique among news startups, and I think people across the country are watching to see whether they succeed.\n\nJones: You went to Baltimore and talked to everyday people on the street about their news consumption habits. What was that like? What did you learn?\n\nFu: One of the most striking \u2014 but not surprising \u2014 things I noticed was how difficult it was to find people who read, much less subscribed, to either the Sun or the Banner. As has been reported by many studies and surveys, local news consumption is low. Among the news consumers I did talk to, it was especially difficult to find Sun subscribers. One of the story\u2019s main theses is that readers are switching from the Sun to the Banner because of changes at the Sun. It was one thing to hear from journalists and media watchers theorizing that this was the case; it was another to hear directly from readers who had made the switch.\n\nMy thanks to Angela, and again, I highly recommend reading her story.\n\nGuess who\u2019s coming?\n\nWell, considering recent events, this comes as no surprise. Yet it still feels somewhat disconcerting.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos \u2014 three giants in the tech industry, as well as three of the most prominent influences on media \u2014 will all attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next Monday.\n\nNBC News\u2019 Jake Traylor and David Ingram report, \u201cThey will have a prominent spot at the ceremony, seated together on the platform with other notable guests including Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees and elected officials.\u201d\n\nMusk, owner of X, has been practically joined at Trump\u2019s hip since before the election, and seems to have a prominent voice in Trump\u2019s universe these days. Zuckerberg, bending the knee to Trump and Republicans, just announced that his company Meta \u2014 which includes Facebook, Instagram and Threads \u2014 would drop its fact-checking program. And Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, infamously killed a Post editorial that would have endorsed Kamala Harris for president.\n\nBoth Zuckerberg and Bezos donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Musk reportedly donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nTraylor and Ingram write, \u201cThe tech leaders have a significant amount at stake in Trump\u2019s second term, not only because of potential tax and trade policy changes but also because of issues specific to their businesses.\u201d\n\nMaybe put the phone down for a bit\n\nTrump is about to become president again next Monday. (Uh, that\u2019s the president of the United States of America.) You would think he has more to worry about than \u2026 NBC late-night talk show Seth Meyers.\n\nYet, Trump went on an unhinged rant about Meyers on his Truth Social, posting:\n\nHow bad is Seth Meyers on NBC, a \u201cnetwork\u201d run by a truly bad group of people \u2013 Remember, they also run MSDNC. I got stuck watching Marble Mouth Meyers the other night, the first time in months, and every time I watch this moron I feel an obligation to say how dumb and untalented he is, merely a slot filler for the Scum that runs Comcast. These guys should be paying a lot of money for the right to give these \u201cin kind\u201d contributions to the Radical Left Democrat Party. These are not shows or entertainment, they are simply political hits, 100% of the time, to me and the Republican Party. Comcast should pay a BIG price for this!\n\nWho knows what set Trump off this time? His post was at 1:24 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday, so it was while Meyers\u2019 show was still on the air. Meyers regularly pokes fun at Trump (and a million other people) during his talk show.\n\nNormally, you could just roll your eyes at Trump\u2019s comments, but it\u2019s always a bit concerning when he starts talking about going after media companies and television networks just because a comedian told a joke about him.\n\nZirinsky returns\n\nVeteran journalist and former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky is returning to CBS News as executive editor on a temporary basis. The move is in response to criticisms of perceived bias within the news division, according to CBS co-CEO George Cheeks.\n\nIn a memo to staff, Cheeks wrote, \u201cIn today\u2019s fast-moving news environment, it is critical for newsrooms to quickly and effectively deliver balanced, accurate, fair and timely reporting, including highly complex, sensitive issues like the war in the Middle East. CBS News takes this responsibility seriously. While there is no way to cover such sensitive issues without provoking some degree of criticism, we have a responsibility to address those concerns. This includes feedback regarding perceived bias in some CBS News coverage. We cannot let this negatively affect our legacy or our future, our mission or our connection to our viewers.\u201d\n\nAs TheWrap\u2019s Benjamin Lindsay noted, \u201cOn Sunday \u201860 Minutes\u2019 aired a story about dissent in the State Department over US policy on Gaza on Sunday that drew the fury of Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, for being anti-Israel.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement on X, Greenblatt wrote, in part, \u201cI\u2019m outraged that @CBSnews\u2019 @60minutes would air such a biased and one-sided piece, villainizing Israel and berating US support for its ally. 60 Minutes is supposed to be the gold standard for broadcast journalism, but they completely dropped the ball last night.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cEven before this, CBS had a recent history of insensitivity on Jewish issues that was incredibly problematic. But they\u2019re not alone. Major media outlets all need to do better.\u201d\n\nZirinsky was a longtime producer at CBS News before taking over as president of the news division from 2019 to 2021. Since then, she has gone on to lead See It Now Studios, a production unit devoted to special projects and documentary programs for Paramount and CBS. She will continue in that role while being interim executive editor of CBS News until a permanent person is named. Zirinsky is one of the most respected journalists in television news history and, fun fact, Holly Hunter\u2019s character in \u201cBroadcast News\u201d is loosely based on Zirinsky.\n\nCuts at Meta\n\nMeta is cutting 5% of its staff, or about 3,600 employees.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Riley Griffin broke the news, which included a memo sent by Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg to employees that said, in part, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said in the memo that those cut will receive a \u201cgenerous severance.\u201d\n\nThe news comes on the heels of Meta\u2019s controversial decision to end its fact-checking program.\n\nZuckerberg wrote in his memo, \u201cMeta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.\u201d\n\nMedia tidbits\n\nHot type\n\nMore resources for journalists\n\nTransform Local Crime Coverage in your newsroom.

            "content": "NBC Sports Philadelphia currently broadcasts Sixers, Flyers, and Phillies games as part of long-term agreements with the teams. Read more\n\nWith Comcast now a minority owner of the Sixers and the two partnering on a new arena in South Philly, what does it mean for NBC Sports Philadelphia?\n\nThe short answer: not much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNBC Sports Philadelphia, formerly Comcast SportsNet, is one of four regional sports networks owned by Comcast through NBCUniversal. The network broadcasts Sixers, Flyers, and Phillies games, and includes studio shows centered on the city\u2019s four major sports teams.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the decline of regional sports networks as viewers cut their cable subscriptions and move to streaming services. NBC hasn\u2019t been immune to those pressures \u2014 in recent years the company shut down NBC Sports Chicago, NBC Sports Northwest, and sold NBC Sports Washington to Monumental Sports & Entertainment.\n\nComcast kept NBC Sports Philadelphia and its regional sports networks (along with NBC Sports Group) within NBCUniversal while it spun off cable channels like MSNBC, CNBC, and USA Network into a separate company currently called SpinCo.\n\nThings are stable in Philadelphia, at least at the moment. The Sixers and Flyers have TV deals with NBC Sports Philadelphia that run almost all the way through to the end of the decade, according to network sources not authorized to speak on the record. The Phillies are in the middle of a 25-year, $2.5 billion deal to broadcast games on the network through 2041.\n\nThere are also numerous entanglements between Comcast and Philly\u2019s sports teams. As part of the deal to build a new arena in South Philly, Comcast became a minority owner in the Sixers, though it\u2019s unclear how big of a stake they took. Comcast also owns the Flyers under Comcast Spectacor, which owns and manages the Wells Fargo Center; the Wings of the National Lacrosse League; and the Seoul Infernal (formerly the Philadelphia Fusion) of the esports Overwatch League.\n\nOn top of that, the Phillies purchased a 25% stake in NBC Sports Philadelphia as part of their long-term TV deal.\n\nXfinity customers could pay more for NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nThe big change for fans who watch NBC Sports Philadelphia on Xfinity could be a jump in price as NBC moves its regional sports networks to more expensive plans. In Boston fans began paying more this week, when Comcast moved NBC Sports Boston into the higher-priced Ultimate TV tier. NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California are making similar moves this week.\n\nThe move isn\u2019t happening yet in Philadelphia, as NBC Sports Philadelphia is in the middle of an affiliate deal that runs for several more years, according to Puck\u2019s John Ourand. But NBC Sports Philadelphia and SNY (which NBC owns a small stake in) are the only Comcast-owned regional sports networks that haven\u2019t yet moved to a more-expensive plan.\n\nComcast declined to comment, as no move in Philadelphia has been announced.\n\nWhy is Comcast moving its regional sports networking into premium tiers that cost more? You can blame cord cutting, as viewers who don\u2019t watch sports cut their cable bundle in favor of less-expensive offerings. While the moves mean sports fans pay more, viewers who don\u2019t follow local sports teams will see their cable bill drop. In Massachusetts, the decrease will be $12.85, according to the Boston Globe\u2019s Chad Finn.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Xfinity subscribers paid $14 a month for NBC Sports Philadelphia last year, up from just $3 in 2016. Currently that\u2019s paid by every viewer, whether they watch a single Phillies game or not.\n\nWhen will NBC Sports Philadelphia be available on Peacock?\n\nThat remains unclear. The Wall Street Journal and the Desk have reported NBC plans to put NBC Sports Philadelphia and its other regional sports networks on Peacock, the company\u2019s subscription service, as soon as the first quarter of 2025. Network sources say details have not yet been finalized, and NBC has not made any announcements.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, complicated road to allow sports fans to stream games on Peacock.\n\nA plan to put live games on Peacock was halted in 2021 over internal concerns over NBC\u2019s broader streaming strategy, according to the Wall Street Journal. In 2022, NBCUniversal Local was forced to walk back a statement that indicated the company would be launching a streaming product for its regional sports networks.\n\nNBCUniversal chairman Mark Lazarus said the company planned to put all its regional sports networks \u2014 including NBC Sports Philadelphia \u2014 on Peacock in 2023. We\u2019re two weeks into 2025, and plans have yet to come together.\n\nThe least-expensive way to stream NBC Sports Philadelphia is through a subscription to Hulu + Live TV, which runs $81.99 a month. That\u2019s $1 less than YouTubeTV, which now costs $82.99 a month.",

            "content": "Customers of the two biggest cable mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) in the U.S. \u2013 Charter\u2019s Spectrum Mobile and Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Mobile \u2013 are both enjoying an impressive upward trajectory in their overall network performance. In their respective service areas over the past two years, Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile users\u2019 download speeds increased by more than 100 Mbps. The performance lift is largely thanks to Wi-Fi offloading capabilities through Spectrum Mobile\u2019s Speed Boost and Xfinity Mobile\u2019s PowerBoost.\n\nCharter began augmenting speeds for its Spectrum Mobile customers leveraging their home Charter Wi-Fi in spring 2022 and, in the fall the same year offered speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Likewise, Comcast was aggressive in tapping into its installed base of customer hotspots, and in 2023, Charter and Comcast offered their combined footprints to each other\u2019s MVNO customers. That is, Charter\u2019s Spectrum Mobile customers have access to the network of Comcast Wi-Fi hotspots within the Comcast service area \u2013 and visa-versa for Xfinity Mobile customers in the Charter service area.\n\nComcast said it operates more than 23 million Wi-Fi hotspots in its footprint. Charter says it has 43 million Wi-Fi access points in its and its partners\u2019 networks, the latter including the Comcast figure. Both cable companies say that between their own Wi-Fi networks and those of partners, with minimal overlap, they provide near-nationwide (population) coverage.\n\nThen, in April 2024, Comcast took the lid off with WiFi Boost offering speeds up to 1 Gbps, and just last week have rebranded the feature to PowerBoost. These steps by Charter and Comcast to converge the mobile and Wi-Fi networks are meaningfully boosting their customer experience in home and out-and-about.\n\nWe examined the last eight quarters (Q1 2023 \u2013 Q4 2024 ) of Speedtest Intelligence\u24c7 data for the median download speed performance of Speedtest users for customers of Spectrum Mobile, Xfinity Mobile, U.S. mobile providers as a group, and Verizon; the latter is the host mobile network for both MVNOs. We analyzed the Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile results within their two respective geographic service areas of Charter and Comcast, where \u201cpublic\u201d Wi-Fi is available to enhance available speeds of their mobile customers. (\u201cPublic,\u201d in our usage here, means access points managed by Charter and Comcast, available to Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile customers.) We do not have knowledge about the wholesale network relationships or any performance implications as part of their agreements.\n\nSpectrum Mobile \u2013 They Have Separation\n\nCharter\u2019s earlier start in promoting Speed Boost had its Spectrum Mobile users consistently clocking higher overall download speeds in its service area than Comcast did for Xfinity Mobile users in its service area. (Charter and Comcast service areas do not overlap.)\n\nDuring these past two years, Spectrum Mobile customers saw their median download speeds increase by more than double from 84.35 Mbps to 188.63 Mbps \u2013 a 104.28 Mbps increase. The pause in its quarterly climb in Q2 and Q3 2024 is explained, at least partly, by the underlying host mobile network slowing down.\n\nXfinity Mobile \u2013 Up and Up\n\nXfinity Mobile, on the other hand, was not affected the same way. Its later introduction of WiFi Boost, compared to Spectrum Mobile\u2019s Speed Boost, was still providing gains during this period. Speed Boost, however, had already realized the speed gains from Wi-Fi (also explaining why Spectrum Mobile was faster than Xfinity Mobile), thus being more sensitive to the mobile network performance. Interestingly, the Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile speeds became closer to one another in the second half of 2024, as WiFi Boost (now PowerBoost) was catching up.\n\nXfinity Mobile users, comparing year-on-year Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, saw their download speeds increase more than 2.5 times from 66.60 Mbps to 170.39 Mbps.\n\nQuarter-on-quarter, Xfinity Mobile Speedtest users experienced a relentless climb in their download speed performance starting from Q3 2023 at 54.81 Mbps:\n\n\u2022 Q4 2023 up 11.79 Mbps to 66.60 Mbps\n\n\u2022 Q1 2024 up 29.60 Mbps to 96.20 Mbps\n\n\u2022 Q2 2024 up 24.85 Mbps to 121.05 Mbps\n\n\u2022 Q3 2024 up 21.86 Mbps to 142.91 Mbps\n\n\u2022 Q4 2024 up 27.48 Mbps to 170.39 Mbps\n\nThe Verizon network provides the Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile customer experience, when not on Wi-Fi. During this same two-year period, nationwide Verizon\u2019s overall median download speeds increased from 66.81 Mbps in Q1 2023 to 97.45 Mbps in Q4 2024 \u2013 up 30.64 Mbps. Increased network capacity from Verizon\u2019s ongoing C-Band spectrum deployment is a rising tide that floats the boat for Verizon\u2019s customers, as well as for Spectrum Mobile and Xfinity Mobile customers.\n\nTo Xfinity, Spectrum and Beyond\n\nHardware is a key component to faster speeds, and PowerBoost benefits from a new access point with Wi-Fi 6E technology that triples the available bandwidth versus the prior generation. Comcast began offering its 6E-capable xFi Advanced Gateway in 2022.\n\nComcast also is making improvements to its underlying network. The company is currently upgrading from DOCSIS 3.1 to DOCSIS 4.0, doubling downstream capacity and quadrupling upstream capacity. In September 2024 the cable company said it had deployed DOCSIS 4.0 to parts of 10 markets and 1 million homes.\n\nAnd, as older handsets are replaced with newer and faster ones, the technology ecosystem as a whole comes together to deliver an ever-better customer experience.\n\nAnd just as technology advancements mentioned above have provided the foundation for the performance gains these past two years, more is on the way.\n\nThe XB10 gateway, coming in 2025, will be Comcast\u2019s fastest and most powerful device yet \u2013 supporting WiFi 7 and DOCSIS 4.0 \u2013 and will deliver multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds over WiFi, with the unprecedented capacity to connect to 300 devices simultaneously. The XB10 also includes AI technology that will help ensure a consistent experience. Comcast WiFi\n\nImplicit in the march of technology is not just the network foundation, but also the consumer adoption. New access points require new cabling, and newer devices offer improved capabilities, and often paying for the \u201cright\u201d bundled service offering is needed. For example:\n\nFor Spectrum Speed Boost, you need Spectrum Internet, Spectrum Mobile and Advanced WiFi. Spectrum Speed Boost\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret that the vast majority of mobile device data traffic is actually served by Wi-Fi, rather than the mobile network. Comcast President Michael Cavanagh noted in a recent call with investors, \u201cMy final thought on broadband is the importance of bundling with mobile, with 90% of Xfinity Mobile smartphone traffic traveling over our Wi-Fi network.\u201d\n\nNoteworthy is Cavanagh\u2019s mention of \u201cbundling,\u201d which, in the context of the foregoing analysis, is the combining of networks in a way to best benefit the customer experience. Comcast and Charter are proving this to be the case.\n\nThis approach of combining the networks is part of a strategic narrative happening in the U.S. telecoms industry called network \u201cconvergence.\u201d Were it not for AI, convergence could have been the industry\u2019s top buzzword in 2024. And, like with AI, there will be plenty more said about convergence in 2025.",

            "content": "The Philadelphia 76ers announced Monday a dramatic reversal of their arena plans, unveiling a \u201c50-50 joint venture\u201d with Comcast on a new building that will house both the NBA team and the NHL\u2019s Philadelphia Flyers, who are owned by the media giant.\n\nThe news came about a month after the City Council voted to approve the 76ers\u2019 previous plan, a controversial $1.3 billion building in a different part of town, and following roughly two years of often-vitriolic fighting between the team\u2019s owners and Comcast. The plan for a new joint venue in South Philly\u2019s existing pro sports district, which both groups called a compromise, came together in just the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe journey to the best solution doesn\u2019t always go in a straight line,\u201d Sixers co-owner Josh Harris said Monday in a press conference. \u201cBut I am certain that today we have found an incredibly positive solution for Philly. Now it\u2019s time to get to work.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly does that solution entail? What changed in recent months? And what concessions were made? Here are seven quick takeaways from the surprising union:\n\n1) New NBA TV Deals: It\u2019s likely not an exaggeration to say that this deal might not have happened had Comcast not joined the NBA\u2019s new $77 billion media deals last year. Comcast is now a leaguewide media partner\u2014in addition to its RSN holdings\u2014and that carries a whole new bucket of obligations and pressures.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver, who spoke first during Monday\u2019s press conference, clearly played a significant role in the talks. Silver was present in Harris\u2019 box at the Washington Commanders game on Dec. 1, alongside Comcast chair Brian Roberts and a number of other industry leaders, for a gathering that reportedly helped thaw the relationship between the two sides. Both Harris and Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker mentioned Silver and the NBA\u2019s role in the new partnership. So too did Ryan Boyer, who leads a coalition of powerful unions in the city.\n\n\u201cListen, Comcast is now the media partner for the NBA, so obviously that played into the deal,\u201d Boyer, business manager of the Philadelphia Building and Construction Trades Council, said Monday, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cThe NBA is back on NBC. Peacock\u2014they\u2019re going to be streaming some games. So, I\u2019m sure that that partnership played a lot in this decision that you see now, as belated as it may be.\u201d\n\n(An NBA spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on Silver\u2019s involvement; a representative for the Sixers declined to comment on specific deal points).\n\n2) 50-50 Partnership: The two sides haven\u2019t released any details on how they\u2019ll share revenue and expenses, but there is plenty of precedent across pro sports. In the mid-2000s, for example, the New York Jets and New York Giants teamed up to build MetLife Stadium at a cost of $1.6 billion. The two NFL teams split the costs evenly and share in operations of the venue. They evenly split much of the revenue, too\u2014including those from the MetLife naming rights and cornerstone building sponsors like Verizon and Bud Light.\n\nThings get slightly more complex when building and team revenue blend. MetLife sells all-event suites, but the Giants and Jets also sell their own, which stays on each team\u2019s side of the financial ledger. Ticket sales from their own games\u2014Giants tickets are generally more expensive\u2014also remain on each team\u2019s P&L.\n\nThere are similar arrangements in the NBA/NHL\u2014two teams with different ownership groups, a 50-50 arena venture and shared economics. In Chicago (Bulls and Blackhawks), and in Dallas (Stars and Mavericks), venues are operated along similar lines. This is different than buildings like Boston\u2019s TD Garden, and the 76ers\u2019 current setup at the Wells Fargo Center, where the arenas are controlled by one team with another as a tenant.\n\n3) Lack of Competition: Going from two Philly-area arena projects to one also concentrates revenue opportunities on non-gamedays. With the current plan, the Flyers won\u2019t be competing against the Sixers trying to lure concerts, monster truck rallies, rodeos and other events that boost revenue when the teams aren\u2019t playing. Besides New York and Los Angeles, there are few cities in North America with multiple 15,000-seat arenas that separately house NHL and NBA teams.\n\n\n\n4) Naming Rights: As part of the deal, Comcast will have naming rights to the new building, which is set to open in 2031. It\u2019s unclear if the company is paying directly for the right or if it is an in-kind concession, but that\u2019s valuable advertising real estate either way. Projecting value seven years in advance is inexact, but based on current deals for multi-team arenas, those naming rights could be worth $25 million to $35 million per year, according to sponsorship consultant Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group.\n\n\n\n5) Equity: Comcast is also \u201cplanning to take a minority stake in the 76ers,\u201d according to the press release. Again, it\u2019s unclear if Comcast would pay for that (and at what valuation), or be given it as part of the partnership, but it\u2019s another major financial concession. The Sixers are worth $4.57 billion, according to Sportico\u2019s most recent number, which ranks eighth in the NBA.\n\nThis equity is almost certainly Sixers-only, and will not include HBSE\u2019s other major sports asset, the New Jersey Devils. Comcast\u2019s Flyers ownership precludes the company from holding equity in multiple NHL teams.\n\nIt likely does, however, extend to a possible WNBA franchise. The expansion fee for the W\u2019s 16th team could easily reach $100 million, and the average WNBA team is now worth $96 million, according to Sportico.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time a league\u2019s national broadcaster also holds equity in a team. Rogers Communications (NYSE: RCI) has the NHL\u2019s Canadian TV rights\u2014a 12-year deal signed back in 2004\u2014and is also a prominent investor in MLSE, which owns the Maple Leafs.\n\n6) WNBA Expansion: Speaking of the WNBA, this announcement certainly strengthens Philadelphia\u2019s push to land an expansion team. There are a number of different cities vying for the 16th spot\u2014some tied to NBA owners, some not\u2014and it\u2019s been an open question as to how much weight the NBA would place on choosing one of their own. Recent expansion choices have been Golden State (NBA owner), Portland (NBA minority owner) and Toronto (tied to NBA owner).\n\nIt\u2019s worth also noting that comedian Wanda Sykes and her wife, Alex, were both present on the stage at Monday\u2019s press conference alongside Harris, co-owner David Blitzer, Roberts, Mayor Parker, Phillies owner John Middleton and others. Wanda and Alex Sykes have long pushed for Philadelphia to land a WNBA team, and Parker has joined the efforts, with WNBA commissioner Kathy Engelbert confirming in October that the city was \u201con the list.\u201d\n\nWNBA expansion bids are due in the coming weeks, and the Philadelphia offering now has a new arena to tout, and the focused attention of Silver.\n\n7) Lingering Bitterness? This partnership would have seemed unthinkable just a few months ago, as the two sides tried to undermine each other behind closed doors and in the public. In September 2023, the Wells Fargo Center\u2019s X account said some of the Sixers\u2019 projections for their own arena were a \u201cmyth.\u201d Around the same time, David Adelman, a Sixers investor and the team\u2019s lead negotiator on the project, accused Comcast of \u201clurking in the shadows, hiding behind others, while it lobbies decision makers and twists arms to try to stop the [76ers] from building our own privately funded arena.\u201d\n\nHow much of that bitterness still exists? It\u2019s unclear, though it wasn\u2019t present at Monday\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone more surprised that we\u2019re standing together than me,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cBut having been on the opposite team the past couple years, I can say that being on the same team is a much better feeling.\u201d\n\n\n\n(This story has been corrected in the 6)WNBA section to note that Portland\u2019s WNBA team has a NBA minority owner.)\n\nWith assistance from Kurt Badenhausen.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 14, 2025 \u2013 Customers of two leading mobile virtual network operators have seen a boost in network performance recently, largely thanks to a shift toward wireless service.\n\nResearch published Tuesday by Ookla, a company specializing in network intelligence, found that Charter\u2019s Spectrum Mobile and Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Mobile have seen a significant increase in users' download speeds over the past two years.\n\nAccording to Ookla, Spectrum\u2019s Speed Boost has seen its median download speeds go from 84.35 Mbps in Q1 2023 to 188.63 Mbps in Q4 2024, a 124 percent increase. There has been an even larger increase for Xfinity Mobile\u2019s Wifi Boost, which has gone from median speeds of 53.65 Mbps in Q1 2023 to 170.39 Mbps in Q4 2024, a 218 percent increase.\n\nThis performance increase came after both companies implemented Wi-Fi offloading in the last two years through Spectrum Mobile\u2019s Speed Boost and Xfinity Mobile\u2019s WiFi Boost. This process has allowed users\u2019 mobile usage to go through one of the companies\u2019 Wi-Fi hotspots located in any customer\u2019s home rather than through Verizon\u2019s cellular network, which the MVNOs lease out.\n\nOokla also said Verizon\u2019s overall median download speeds have increased from 66.81 Mbps in Q1 2023 to 97.45 Mbps in Q4 2024, a 46 percent increase.\n\nBy keeping the network usage in-house through these Wi-Fi hotspots, both Comcast and Charter have been able to keep network costs far lower for both the consumer and the company than before implementing Wi-Fi offloading.\n\nBoth Comcast and Charter say that through separate partnerships, they have been able to expand their network of Wi-Fi hotspots to near-nationwide coverage.\n\nMVNO Wi-Fi offloading is significant for the cellular market as well. UScellular has stated that it needs to sell to T-Mobile because it lacks national scale and cannot compete with cable MVNOs that cut costs by migrating cellular traffic to their Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\u201cCable wireless providers have acted as mavericks throughout UScellular\u2019s footprint by leveraging their ability to bundle services, subsidize wireless offerings through margins on their traditional offerings, and offload more traffic onto their own Wi-Fi networks in order to aggressively price their wireless offerings and increase market share,\u201d T-Mobile and UScellular said in a Jan. 8 filing that was posted to the FCC\u2019s website a few days later.",

            "content": "In an early morning rant, Donald Trump went off on Seth Meyers\u2018 late-night NBC show, declaring that \u201cComcast should pay a BIG price\u201d for shows that he calls \u201cpolitical hits.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s 1:24 a.m. ET post on Truth Social, he said that he had watched Meyers\u2019 show recently. Meyers\u2019 humor for years has been biting when it comes to Trump, with his segments also serving as a form of commentary.\n\nTrump wrote, \u201cHow bad is Seth Meyers on NBC, a \u2018network\u2019 run by a truly bad group of people \u2014 Remember, they also run MSDNC. I got stuck watching Marble Mouth Meyers the other night, the first time in months, and every time I watch this moron I feel an obligation to say how dumb and untalented he is, merely a slot filler for the Scum that runs Comcast. These guys should be paying a lot of money for the right to give these \u2018in kind\u2019 contributions to the Radical Left Democrat Party. These are not shows or entertainment, they are simply political hits, 100% of the time, to me and the Republican Party. Comcast should pay a BIG price for this!\u201d\n\nTrump has long bashed Comcast, NBC and MSNBC. During his first term, he suggested pulling the network\u2019s FCC license after he got angered by an NBC News report. Ajit Pai, who he appointed FCC chair, later noted that the agency licenses stations, not networks, and that news programming was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nBut Trump\u2019s appointee as chair of the FCC during his next term, Brendan Carr, has suggested that the agency can examine complaints over news programming, including one that challenged the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris. He also bashed NBC for featuring Harris on Saturday Night Live in the final show before the election, warning that it was a violation of equal time rules. The network gave Trump\u2019s campaign time the next day, but Carr warned that other third-party candidates may have been denied airtime.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments are a contrast to President Joe Biden\u2019s feelings about the show. Last year, he made an in-studio visit as the show marked its 10th anniversary.\n\nComcast is in the midst of spinning off MSNBC and other cable assets, something that may require regulatory approval. But media companies have been eyeing the Trump administration as potentially more permissive when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. During Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department challenged AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner, then the parent company of CNN. AT&T won the case, but a number of Time Warner executives believed that the transaction was challenged because Trump so despised the reporting of its subsidiary, CNN.\n\nIn contrast, when Fox sought to sell many of its studio assets to Disney \u2014 a horizontal transaction that eliminated competition from the landscape \u2014 the transaction sailed through in just six months.",

This visionary and forward-looking facility will take the fan experience to a whole new level where the great pride and passion of Philadelphia sports fans will continue to be on full display.\u201d\n\nThe original plan was for the 76ers to build a new 18,500-capacity arena, 76 Place, in the Market East area of Philadelphia at the Fashion District site.\n\nThat plan faced heavy opposition from local residents, despite political backing, and ultimately fell through.\n\nThe 76ers\u2019 lease on the Wells Fargo Arena expires in 2031, and ahead of the team exiting the venue, Wells Fargo said it will not renew its naming rights agreement for the venue beyond 2025, nor its sponsorship of the 76ers and Flyers.\n\nDespite that, Comcast Spectacor is still committed to renovating the arena in a $400 million transformation campaign.",

Roberts, CEO and chair of Comcast at the press conference, which also announced his company\u2019s partnership with the Sixers to develop the new arena in South Philly and revitalize Market East. The shock of that news on Sunday elicited joy from Center City Arena opponents and surprise and anger from some council members who took very difficult votes for the original plan.\n\nThe Sixers\u2019 push for a WNBA franchise in Philadelphia was promised in the Center City arena plan. The addition of Comcast as a minority stakeholder in the possible expansion team is a new wrinkle.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver was reportedly part of the effort that brought the Sixers back to the South Philly sports complex. He attended Monday\u2019s press conference virtually and spoke encouragingly of the possibilities.\n\n\u201cI greatly appreciate the leadership of Mayor [Cherelle] Parker and Governor [Josh] Shapiro and the willingness of [Sixers\u2019 owners] HBSE and Comcast to join forces, the result of which will be a world-class arena for 76ers and Flyers fans, with opportunities for more teams to come,\u201d Silver said.\n\nEsther Rosen, a grassroots advocate for a Philly WNBA franchise who runs the popular \u201dWNBA Philly\u201d social media accounts, called the update \u201cvery exciting news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever gets us a team, ultimately,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe WNBA Philly community seems stoked about the franchise bid news as well.\u201d\n\nThe WNBA currently has 12 teams, with the Golden State Valkyries joining in the upcoming season and franchises in Toronto and Portland scheduled to make it 15 by 2026. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert \u2014 a Collingswood, N.J. native \u2014 said in October that a 16th team is slated for 2027 or 2028, and confirmed that Philly was on the list of 10 to 12 viable candidates. The league has been vocal about wanting to see NBA teams attached to expansion franchises.\n\nWatch Party PHL has also advocated for a WNBA franchise at the grassroots level. Its host and founder, Jen Leary, called the new proposal a win for everyone, saying that the bid is strengthened by the inclusion of Comcast and removing the divisiveness that came with the Center City arena.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that everyone is on the same page, now that there\u2019s this huge partnership with the investor groups, the Sixers and Comcast, and they listened to the people of Chinatown, it\u2019ll be so much easier for the people of Philadelphia to get behind this,\u201d she said.\n\nRiding a wave of interest in women\u2019s sports that surged with then-collegiate star Caitlyn Clark last year, \u201cThe W\u201d had a breakthrough last season, with an average attendance of 9,807, up a staggering 48% from the previous year. It also had a new record attendance of 20,711.\n\nA Philly bid, spearheaded by comedian Wanda Sykes and her wife Alex Niedbalski-Sykes, has been in the works since 2021. The couple were at City Hall Monday for the update, confirming their involvement in the current bid.\n\nThey\u2019re hardly alone. Among the big names involved in the bid for the team \u2014 that could potentially be called the Philadelphia Sisters \u2014 were Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant, actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith, tennis legend Billie Jean King, South Carolina Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley, and the Roots drummer Questlove. Then-Councilperson and now-Mayor Cherelle Parker supported the effort, as did Sixers co-owner David Adelman and Comcast, Niedbalski-Sykes revealed at Monday\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cTo see them standing up there today really renewed my hope that this could actually be a possibility here in Philadelphia, and sooner rather than later,\u201d Leary said of the couple.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our odds could be any more favorable than the position we are in right now,\u201d Sykes said at the press conference. \u201cWith the support of the mayor, this amazing team, Governor Shapiro. Just thank you, this is just such an amazing day\n\n\u201cAnd go Birds,\u201d Sykes closed, apologizing to Sixers\u2019 Josh Harris, who also owns the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders.",

The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.16% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.86%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.38%.\n\nShares of the cable provider have depreciated by 8.92% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 5.64% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.2%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Comcast will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on January 30, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Comcast to post earnings of $0.88 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.76%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $31.63 billion, up 1.21% from the year-ago period.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Comcast. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.72% lower. As of now, Comcast holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Comcast is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.24. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 8.78.\n\nAlso, we should mention that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 1.32. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Cable Television industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.73.\n\nThe Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 91, putting it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

For example, it is unclear how much the facility will cost or whether the city or state will, unlike the previous arena proposal, contribute taxpayer dollars to help Comcast and the Sixers cover the cost of construction.\n\nIt is also unclear what investments will be made along the Market East corridor, the disjointed stretch that sat at the center of Parker\u2019s argument in favor of building a Center City arena.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of homework and a lot of due diligence before we can get the ball rolling,\u201d Parker said.\n\nParker told reporters Monday that the city will still send $20 million to Chinatown for affordable housing initiatives, a pledge that helped push the previous arena proposal over the finish line.\n\nBut the city will have to negotiate a new deal with the Sixers and Comcast, which will include a new community benefits agreement and a new PILOTs [payments in lieu of taxes] arrangement for the city and its school district. Under its previous agreement with the city, the Sixers were set to pay an average of $6 million a year in lieu of property taxes.\n\nThe Sixers and Comcast will also likely need legislative approvals from City Council before construction could start on the new arena.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be rough going through this Council again because we all put ourselves out there and we believed in it.

The new building will house the NBA team and NHL\u2019s Philadelphia Flyers, who are owned by Comcast Spectacor, according to a source familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nErnest Owens of Philadelphia magazine was the first to break the news.\n\nThe Sixers\u2019 current lease at Wells Fargo Center runs until 2031, and the team has spent two years laying the groundwork for a new NBA arena in downtown Philadelphia. It also explored building a new arena in New Jersey, which was \u201cmore real than people realized,\u201d according to a source.\n\nThe new building will keep the NHL and NBA teams in the same stadium district that also houses the NFL\u2019s Philadelphia Eagles and MLB\u2019s Philadelphia Phillies. The arena will be a 50-50 partnership between the 76ers, who are owned by Josh Harris and David Blitzer, and the Flyers. The 76ers are currently a tenant at Wells Fargo Center and capture limited arena revenue outside of tickets.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Comcast will take a minority stake in the 76ers and will partner with Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) to help bring a WNBA team to the city, the NBA said in a press release on Monday. Comcast will also have naming rights to the new building.\n\nIn December, the Philadelphia city council approved the 76ers\u2019 plan for a $1.3 billion arena in the Center City section of the city, but there has been significant opposition to the plan regarding the disruption a new arena would bring. The Sixers still plan to make real estate developments and investments in Market East of Center City, per the source.\n\nThe new partnership between HBSE and Comcast Spectacor came together during the holidays. The ties between the two run deep. In addition to being a landlord for the 76ers, Comcast is the team\u2019s local media partner as the owner of NBC Sports Philadelphia. The media giant also just secured broadcast rights for its NBC and Peacock channels as part of the NBA\u2019s new 11-year, $77 billion rights deal that also includes ESPN and Amazon. Comcast recently completed a $400 million renovation of the Wells Fargo Center to modernize the building that opened in 1996.\n\nIn addition to reaching an agreement on a new building, Comcast will join the 76ers\u2019 bid for a WNBA expansion team. In September, the WNBA hired Allen & Company to lead the expansion process for a 16th WNBA team. The expansion fee is expected to be in the neighborhood of $100 million, with a significant commitment also required for startup costs and to build a practice facility.\n\n\n\n(This story has been updated in the fifth paragraph with news of Comcast\u2019s stake in the 76ers and naming rights to the new arena.)",

Check out their remarks.\n\nIn a move that will likely stun many, the plan to bring a $1.3 billion arena to Market Street in Center City Philadelphia has been abandoned.\n\nOn Sunday, around noon, a union representative and city official confirmed with NBC10 that the team has worked out a new deal with Comcast Spectacor and has backpedaled on a plan that would have brought an arena to the area of the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets.\n\nRyan Boyer, president of the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, told NBC10's Lauren Mayk that instead, the team plans to demolish Wells Fargo Center and will eventually build a new arena in South Philadelphia for the Sixers and Flyers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"We actually get more jobs,\" Boyer said. \"For the building trades, this is good news.\"\n\nIn a statement released Sunday afternoon, officials with Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also celebrated the decision, saying that the move will see the stadium district in South Philadelphia \"enhanced and expanded.\"\n\n\u201cIBEW Local 98 and our partners in the Philadelphia Building Trades have worked diligently with the 76ers throughout this protracted process. This new agreement between the 76ers and Comcast is a significant win for the 76ers, Comcast, our members and the entire City of Philadelphia. The Stadium District in South Philadelphia will be dramatically enhanced and expanded, providing the 76ers with the new state-of-the-art arena the team needs and deserves,\" an IBEW representative said in a statement. \"Comcast has also pledged to commit the financial resources needed to revive the dormant Market East corridor, which is critically important to the entire city. For IBEW Local 98 and the Trades, a $1.3 billion project just turned into a multi-billion development that will create a stunning new stadium district that will keep our members working for decades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Philadelphia City Councilmember at-large, Jim Harrity, said he was disappointed in the surprise move. In fact, he said, he felt \"bamboozled.\"\n\n\"I feel completely bamboozled,\u201d Harrity said. \"I'm not going to forget this... I feel they not only bamboozled me but bamboozled the citizens of Philadelphia and I\u2019m not going to forget that.\u201d\n\nHarrity said he is upset that the city's schools won't get the promised money from taxes the new arena would bring.\n\nThe plan had been approved by Philadelphia's City Council late last year.\n\nThe plan had long been a contentious one, with many residents in communities closest to the project site protesting against it since it was initially proposed.\n\nIn the late months of last year, in the run up to a City Council vote on the project, city officials -- including Mayor Cherelle Parker -- met with members of the community all across the city to determine the future of the project.\n\nBefore City Council eventually approved the plan on Dec. 19, 2024, a main issue with the project was just how much funding would be included in the community benefits agreement. Initially, developers proposed a $50 million agreement, but residents closest to the project called for more -- as much as $300 million.\n\nEventually, City Council approved the plan with a $60 million community benefits agreement.\n\nDevelopers had planned to begin development this year and open the arena in 2031.\n\nThe specifics of the deal that led to the decision to stay in South Philadelphia have not yet been provided by officials.\n\nBut, according to a source with information on the situation, the Sixers and Flyers are expected to partner on a new arena in South Philadelphia with Comcast Spectacor.\n\nThe Sixers and Comcast Spectacor will also work on a revitalization project for the Market East neighborhood in Center City Philadelphia, according to the source.\n\nPhiladelphia councilmember Kendra Brooks -- who had opposed the Center City plan -- was happy with Sunday's news but wanted more details on the new deal.\n\n\u201cWe said that we didn\u2019t think that this was a good deal from the beginning, both Nicolas O\u2019Rourke and I. As minority leaders, we both said that we were gonna go with the side of the people,\" Brooks said. \u201cI\u2019m interested to know the details behind what happened. We spent a lot of time and effort and resources on hearings that lasted through the end of the year that could have been spent towards other issues that we\u2019ve been focusing on. So, I\u2019d really like to know the details and what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nThe No Arena Coalition -- a group made up of thousands of organizations strongly opposed to the Center City arena plan -- also reacted to Sunday's news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re relieved to hear that the nightmare of a Center City Sixers arena will not haunt our city any more. To every Philadelphian who called, marched, testified, and warned City Hall that this was a raw deal: This win belongs to you, and the lesson for politicians is to trust the people. To the five Councilmembers who stood on the right side of this fight: We will not forget,\" a spokesperson for the group wrote.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, Philly built a movement not only to save Chinatown, but to defend our entire city from predatory billionaires who saw us for a profit playground, and tens of thousands of Philadelphians showed up. When some said it was a done deal, this movement stayed true, committed to a different kind of city.\"\n\nA press conference on the decision is expected to be held on Monday morning, Jan. 13, 2025.\n\nContacted on Sunday, officials with the Sixers, Comcast and the City of Philadelphia, did not immediately return requests for comment.",

Read more\n\nThe 76ers are going to stay in South Philly after all, according to City Council members and a key labor leader.\n\nThe team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the South Philadelphia sports complex, after more than two years of heated debate over moving to a potential new arena on East Market Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Live updates: Sixers abandon plans to build new arena in Center City\n\nRyan Boyer, head of the Philadelphia Building and Construction Trades Council, said the new deal involves the 76ers and Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center, working together to build an arena in South Philadelphia.\n\nBoyer, whose organization is a politically powerful coalition of more than 30 unions, said the deal also involves a commitment for major developments on East Market Street, but he did not yet have details on what that would look like.\n\n\u201dThe commissioner of the NBA was involved in it, and the commitment to Market Street redevelopment is still there,\u201d Boyer said. \u201cWe think that overall it will be good for the city. It\u2019s just a pivot.\u201d\n\nThe reversal is a stunning end to a saga that has dominated city politics for more than a year and a setback for Mayor Cherelle L. Parker and others who championed the $1.3 billion Center City proposal.\n\nNeither Comcast Spectacor nor the 76ers commented on the deal Sunday despite lawmakers and labor leaders discussing it openly. Parker did not respond to requests for comment. And Council President Kenyatta Johnson\u2019s spokesperson Vincent Thompson referred comment to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nLast month, Council, in a contentious 12-5 vote, passed enabling legislation that would have allowed the arena in Center City to move forward. Lawmakers were criticized intensely for supporting the project, especially from advocates for Chinatown, which borders the proposed site at 10th and Market Streets. But they ultimately approved it after lobbying from unions, including Boyer\u2019s group, and Parker\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so livid right now I don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d said Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of City Council, who was the first city lawmaker to publicly endorse the team\u2019s move to East Market Street. \u201cI feel as though I was used as a pawn.\u201d\n\nCouncilmember Mark Squilla, whose district includes the proposed Center City site, introduced the legislation needed to green-light it. Throughout the fall, he worked tirelessly to get it across the legislative finish line, weathering attacks from his constituents in Chinatown and Washington Square West.\n\nSquilla said Sunday that although he was not involved in the talks that led to the new deal, he\u2019s not upset about how it turned out.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m OK being used in that process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might end up actually being the best-case scenario. We can reimagine Market Street without an arena, have people committed to \u2026 investing in it, and still have a new arena in South Philly.\u201d\n\nDespite the team not commenting on the deal, Sixers coach Nick Nurse weighed in Sunday, saying the prospect of \u201ca state-of-the-art facility\u201d was \u201csuper exciting.\u201d Nurse said that when he visited the Wells Fargo Center as a visitor before he joined the 76ers, he \u201cdidn\u2019t quite get\u201d why the city\u2019s sports facilities were all clustered in the South Philadelphia stadium complex.\n\n\u201cBut now that you are there, it\u2019s a pretty cool setup,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cPhiladelphians love it, and they\u2019re really used to it. They got kind of the same place to support all of their teams. ... So it looks like a win on all fronts to me.\u201d\n\nAfter the Sixers announced their desire to leave South Philadelphia, Comcast Spectacor began aggressively courting them to stay in the stadium district. As part of their campaign, they revealed an ambitious and sprawling proposal for a $2.5 billion complete redevelopment of the area that would add thousands of apartments, restaurants, and more entertainment options.\n\nThat led to a clash between the 76ers\u2019 billionaire owners \u2014 Josh Harris, David Blitzer, and David Adelman \u2014 and Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and CEO of Comcast, which owns Spectacor. Publicly, Adelman feuded with Daniel J. Hilferty, the president and CEO of Comcast Spectacor, a subsidiary of the cable and internet giant.\n\nThe 76ers for months were insistent that they had big plans for East Market Street. They also acquired a number of properties on the south side of Market Street that were slated for development as housing and retail.\n\nOne Council member who has talked with the administration and the team said the timeline for development on both East Market and in South Philly would be moved up as well. The Sixers\u2019 East Market arena was originally slated to open in 2031.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen to the commitments that the 76ers made as part of a community benefits agreement the team negotiated with the city before the Council vote on the Center City proposal. The team agreed to pay $60 million for a variety of municipal programs and community groups.\n\n\u201cWe were a negotiation ploy for these people who promised a big bag of goods that were going to help the city,\u201d said Harrity. \u201cThey\u2019re taking money from our kids.\u201d\n\nDuring last-minute negotiations, Parker committed to setting aside $20 million of city money for affordable housing in Chinatown. Squilla said that commitment remains in place.\n\nBut the team\u2019s plan to purchase and demolish the western third of the Fashion District shopping mall is now halted. The Fashion District and other parcels on East Market Street will be part of the broader conversation about what the 76ers and Comcast Spectacor plan to help revitalize the corridor, he said.\n\nThe news also comes three days after Macy\u2019s announced it would be closing its department store on East Market Street, which has long been a pillar of the corridor, underscoring the need for investment on the faded commercial strip.\n\nCouncilmembers Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, members of the progressive Working Families Party who voted against approving the Center City plan, said in a statement Sunday that the news that the team is staying in South Philadelphia represents a \u201chistoric win and a testament to the power of organizing.\u201d\n\nCouncilmember Jamie Gauthier, who also voted against the arena\u2019s enabling legislation, said that she had been concerned that the arena\u2019s effects on SEPTA and Chinatown had never been fully answered. This latest development brings the Sixers\u2019 previous commitments into greater doubt.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that we should have never trusted the process in the first place,\u201d said Gauthier, who represents much of West Philadelphia. \u201cThis development proves that the project was half-baked.\u201d\n\nGauthier said she has not yet had the chance to consult with her colleagues or the administration on next steps, but she believes future proposals from the 76ers will be subject to far greater scrutiny.\n\nThe team has burned a lot of political capital getting their legislation through City Council in a polarizing vote, only to back away at the last minute.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t respect us, they don\u2019t respect Council, they don\u2019t respect the mayor, they don\u2019t respect the citizens, which is why they never should have had such an easy path in the first place,\u201d said Gauthier.\n\nStaff writers Anna Orso and Keith Pompey contributed to this article.",

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.\n\nThe 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectator -- which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays -- did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who play there too.\n\nOpponents of the arena's move to downtown celebrated the news.\n\nTwo City Council members who voted against the plan, Jamie Gauthier and Rue Landau, said the reversal shows that the 76ers' development arm had not dealt in good faith with the city.\n\n\"We're glad that the Sixers will remain in the stadium district where they best belong. But the way they reached this decision reflects a profound lack of respect for City leaders, stakeholders, and residents,\" Gauthier and Rue said in a statement.\n\nThe 76ers' downtown development plan had pitted working-class Philadelphians against each another and the team had pressured City Council to consider a \"half-baked\" proposal that left open questions about gridlock and the displacement of the city's Chinatown section, they said.\n\nThe council had voted Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.\n\n\"I'm so livid right now I don't even know what to do,\" Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team's move, said, \"I feel as though I was used as a pawn.\"\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \"historic game-changing economic development project.\" Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite redevelopment efforts.\n\nThe team owner, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year's end so it could meet the target opening date. It had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although it was free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, it would have paid about $6 million in annual payments.\n\nOpponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.\n\nThe Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991.",

            "content": "Cable and streaming services have become similar in recent years when it comes to how content is delivered -- live, and with ads -- and in some cases, with pricing. Our analysis compared the costs of each where we did the math, and we found that depending on what you watch, streaming can be less expensive, especially once you figure in the taxes and fees that get added to your monthly cable bill.\n\nIf you're ready to save, here's how to cut the cable TV cord and replace it with streaming services. You just need to a good internet connection and the apps built into your smart TV or running on an inexpensive streamer, such as a Roku or Amazon Fire TV. They'll give you access to Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, Max, Hulu and more, as well as numerous free TV streaming options.\n\nStill want sports or local news? Live TV streaming services like Sling TV and YouTube TV start at $40 a month and can stream most of the live channels available on your cable box with no contracts to sign, so you can cancel anytime. You can watch every live NFL game every week, for example, with no cable box required.\n\nReady to cut the cord? Good. Here's how to get started.\n\nSet up a home internet plan with unlimited data, if you can\n\nEven if you cut cable TV you'll still need a home internet connection for streaming. Many people get their internet as part of a cable TV bundle, maybe with phone service too. Often your cable company is the same one providing your internet connection, but sometimes you can shop around to find the best internet provider.\n\nYou'll need to find out how much home broadband costs by itself, without a TV bundle. If your bundle is $130 a month, maybe you'll have to pay $60 for just internet. That leaves $70 of potential savings by cutting cable TV. That's a lot of money every month to pocket or spend on new streaming services.\n\nOther things to consider as you shop for internet-only plans:\n\nAre you under contract? If so, you'll have to either wait it out, renegotiate a new internet-only deal with your cable company or eat the early termination fee.\n\nHow fast of a connection do you need? Start by pricing out the same speed you have already but keep in mind that with everyone in your home streaming more, you might need a faster connection.\n\nYou should get a plan with unlimited data, if available, which can cost more than data-limited plans. Streaming video can really add up.\n\nLive TV services like YouTube TV have grid-style program guides, just like your cable service. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhich TV shows and channels are your must-haves?\n\nNow it's time to figure out your TV must-haves. Canceling cable means you'll need to stream the stuff you normally watch on your cable box.\n\nMake a list of the shows and channels you and your family watch regularly. In some cases you'll be able to replace your favorite channel programming with a streaming service such as Netflix, Peacock or Hulu, but be aware that many current-season episodes won't be available immediately.\n\nHere are our picks for TV and movies you can stream on each of the main streaming services:\n\nThe best option to replace your cable box directly is with a live TV streaming service. Each offers a package of live channels you can watch on a streaming app that, with a bit of a learning curve, works just as well as (or better than) cable. They include program guides, cloud DVRs and extras your box can't deliver including user profiles and mobile streaming. Prices start at $28 a month but to get live local channels (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox or PBS) and a package comparable to cable, you'll need to pay at least $83 per month. For premium shows, Starz ($9), Showtime (on Paramount Plus) and others all have standalone streaming services, too.\n\nThe best part about any of the services above? Unlike cable, you can cancel and restart service anytime without contracts or penalties. You can subscribe to follow a particular show, for example, and then cancel after the finale.\n\nRead more: A Cord-Cutters Guide on Where to Stream the Top Live TV Channels\n\nRoku offers support for a wide variety of streaming services. Ty Pendlebury/CNET\n\nSign up for a bundle\n\nBundles are the wave of the present and future, and can save money in the short and long run on streaming subscriptions. Select one of the Disney bundles to watch Disney Plus and Hulu with or without ESPN Plus, with options to stream ad-free or not. There's also a Max bundle that combines it with Disney Plus and Hulu, and Comcast Xfinity customers should look into the StreamSaver package that gives you Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV Plus together. For live TV customers, Philo now includes AMC Plus at no additional charge.\n\nAside from these packages, your wireless carrier or favorite retailer may offer streaming service bundles that will help trim your streaming TV expenses. But we urge you to be on the lookout for new bundles this year.\n\nTry to replace your DVR'd shows with streaming options\n\nDo you use your cable box's DVR a lot? Live TV streaming services offer a \"cloud DVR,\" but they do have some limitations compared to TiVo or the DVR from your cable company. Some have storage limits, shows that expire after a certain time, limitations on which channels can be recorded, and some even force you to watch commercials. YouTube TV has the best cloud DVR we've tested, and in most ways it's as good as TiVo, and most other services' cloud DVRs are solid too.\n\nThanks to on-demand, however, you might not miss your DVR much at all. Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Max and others let you watch shows on-demand -- often the same shows you're using your DVR to record. And live TV services such as YouTube TV and Sling TV offer a lot of on-demand shows, and you can often pause or even skip commercials. On the other hand, every episode of every show might not be available.\n\nInstall a TV antenna for local channels\n\nOne way to get around the high cost of local networks on streaming is to use an antenna. To qualify as a television, and not a monitor, a display needs to have an over-the-air tuner built-in, so you can plug in an antenna and watch broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS. Reception varies widely depending on where you live, however, and unless you buy an antenna DVR like the AirTV or the subscription-free Tablo, you're restricted to live-only viewing.\n\nOver-the-air antennas are affordable and easy to install. CNET\n\nUse a streaming device: smart TV, game console, Roku, Fire TV, Chromecast or Apple TV\n\nYou won't need that cable box anymore, but you will need some kind of streaming device to watch services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max. Maybe the app is built into your smart TV, maybe into your game console, or maybe you have to buy a new streaming device like a Roku or Apple TV. In any case you'll also need to connect such a device to each TV that's currently connected to a cable box.\n\nStreaming devices are relatively cheap ($25 and up), and you don't have to pay the cable company every month to rent one. And with most services you can also watch on your phone, tablet or computer.\n\nSports fans can cut the cord too, but it can get expensive to see your team's regular season MLB, NBA or NHL games. David Katzmaier/CNET\n\nDo you care about watching sports?\n\nSports fans have an increasing number of streaming options that show live games, but depending on which sport(s) you follow, the local team(s) in your area and how many games you want to watch, it can get costly. Channels devoted to NBA basketball, NHL hockey and MLB baseball teams, known as regional sports networks, are available on most cable networks but can be hard to find or expensive on streaming services. These are the channels you'll need to watch most regular-season games for those sports (the playoffs are generally on national channels).\n\nLive TV streaming service DirecTV Stream's $115 Entertainment plan or its $130 package are options if you want to watch your local RSN via streaming, although in some parts of the country a somewhat cheaper service (namely YouTube TV or Fubo at $83 or $80, respectively) will carry your channel. Coverage varies widely by sport, team and city, so check out our dedicated guides for more details -- including exactly which services carry your local team and how much they cost.\n\nNFL pro football is a different beast. Those games are usually carried on local CBS, Fox and NBC networks, but you'll typically need an antenna or a live TV streaming service, or you'll have to watch select games on Paramount Plus, Peacock or Prime Video -- the latter hosted Thursday Night Football exclusively this season. And of course you'll need ESPN, available on most livestreaming services, to watch Monday Night Football.\n\nIf you like to chat with friends in real-time during the game, or follow live games on Twitter or social media, be aware that streaming sports are often delayed compared to the \"live\" game on cable or elsewhere. The Super Bowl, for example, lags 30 seconds to a minute behind cable.\n\nDo a trial run before you cut the cord for good\n\n\n\nCutting the cable cord can save you a lot of money but you'll need to do some planning to make the transition as painless as possible. It pays to get all your streaming ducks in a row before you make that final call to your cable provider.\n\nGo through your checklist and figure out which services you need to subscribe to and which devices you'll need to get. Install everything on your main TV, unplug your cable box and get used to using streaming instead. Familiarize yourself first, then move on to helping other members of your household.\n\nChances are you'll experience some bumps along the way. The menu systems on some streaming services are different, the remote controls on devices are different, even the lack of channel numbers and need to use search can be tough to grok. Give it time and patience, however, and it will be fine.\n\nReady? It's time to cancel your cable service\n\nAfter you've lived with streaming for a while and have grown comfortable with the process of clicking on an app rather than firing up your cable box, it's time to make the fateful call. Your cable provider might offer you incentives to stick around and you'll have to weigh those against the benefits of cutting the cord, but do so carefully. Especially if the offer is contingent on signing a two-year contract. A lot can change in two years and with the freedom of streaming, it's simply a lot easier to save money than with cable.\n\nIn the end, cutting cable TV isn't for everyone. No single device or service has as many channels as a premium cable package. Juggling different services to find the shows you want to watch can be more effort than some people are willing to put in.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting cable is getting easier with every new option that hits the market. Beyond the savings, you get the freedom of being able to pick and choose the service you want -- and drop it like a hot potato if you don't like it anymore, your favorite show ends or something new comes along. Cutting cable is all about choice and if you do it right, you'll never miss that old cable box.",

            "content": "Divergent priorities, an evolving media landscape, ongoing legal threats and the march of time just crushed a joint venture called Venu Sports.\n\nOf Venu\u2019s three big media partners, Fox may be a winner, some think. Warner Bros. Discovery is back where it started. Disney has complicated its business a bit, but that could pay off. Smaller Fubo, which held up Venu\u2019s launch up so long that the venture became moot, has a pot of fresh cash and a new deep-pocketed parent, Disney, in the wings.\n\nVenu\u2019s story unfolded over the course of a full year. The three media giants announced Venu Sports in early February of 2024. Fubo filed an antitrust suit weeks later and won a temporary injunction so Venu could not make a planned August launch. But the partners burned through tens of millions of dollars anyway with the case still pending, hiring executives and engineers, building it out, pricing it.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe trio settled the Fubo suit last Monday for $220 million, clearing the way for Venu. Disney also agreed to merge its Hulu + Live TV into Fubo for a 70% stake in the expanded, publicly traded video provider, a deal no one saw coming. Yesterday, the partners unexpectedly shuttered their JV.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service. In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThis brings to a close a year\u2019s worth of strategy decisions that at nearly every turn left us with many more questions than answers,\u201d said MoffettNathanson in a note Friday.\n\nIndustry excitement around Venu when it was first unveiled can\u2019t be overstated. Love it or hate it, it was something original, a skinny bundle, a MVPD, for the digital age in a fast-changing industry that really does needs to experiment. But as the suit dragged on with the temporary injunction and a trial not scheduled until fall of 2025, that excitement fizzled.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney\u2019s ESPN+ flagship launch became its priority and a distraction. WBD lost professional basketball so had less to contribute to Venu. Fox has been wary of SVOD, some industry players noted. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch had pegged Venu at 5 million subscribers in the first five years, so it was never going to be a blockbuster. Disney and DirecTV agreed to skinny bundles in a carriage renewal. The dynamics had changed. Asked about Venu\u2019s prospects on earnings calls or at investment conferences as 2024 advanced, executives at the three partners sounded increasingly less optimistic but never dire, whatever happened.\n\nJoint ventures in even the best of circumstances are notoriously difficult to pull off. Hulu is one example. Disney bought out Comcast, finally, but the two have been haggling endlessly over the price tag. Speaking of which, analyst Rich Greenfield wondered how the never-ending Disney buyout of Comcast\u2019s Hulu stake is impacted by this Fubo transaction, saying it would impact the value of Hulu.\n\nWhere Things Stand\n\nNow, \u201cDisney is left to either double down on vMVPDs and stick to its recently announced Fubo deal, or to cut its losses and pay the deal\u2019s $130 million termination fee. WBD is back in more or less the same position it likely would have been in regardless of whether Venu ever launched. And Fox could end up getting the final laugh,\u201d wrote MoffettNathanson\u2019s Robert Fishman.\n\nOf the Murdoch-run company, he said: no other has \u201cthe most to gain from the testing of the Venu thesis that there is an appetite out there for skinnier bundles\u201d \u2014 especially with a sports and news focus. \u201cGiven Fox\u2019s already skinny cable network offering focused on highly watched sports and news content, the fat in\u201d bigger bundles would almost certainly be cut elsewhere. \u201cIf this does in fact play out, it could make the money and man-power Fox poured into Venu pay for itself many times over.\u201d\n\nAlicia Reese of Wedbush Securities noted that after WBD lost its rights to regular and postseason games for its TNT network to Amazon in July, the David Zaslav-run company didn\u2019t have much left to contribute to the new service, which \u201cwould have been mostly ESPN, which Disney can offer standalone, for example, in its upcoming ESPN flagship app, or through combinations. Disney\u2019s ultimate goal is to get ESPN content to consumers in as many ways as it can,\u201d she said \u201cVenu was just one additional way to do that.\u201d\n\nLegal challenges loomed beyond Fubo, most immediately pushback from the nation\u2019s two big satellite TV providers, Dish and DirecTV, who insisted that antitrust issues remained and asked the New York judge not to approve the settlement. It became too much of a headache and a potentially risky business proposition for the three companies to continue fighting to launch Venu.\n\nUltimately, the case would not only have put Venu on trial but also \u201cthe industry\u2019s long-standing practice of network owners bundling their desirable networks with their less desirable ones,\u201d said Fishman, \u201cWith the cable network cash flows that Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery each rely on at risk, the three partners decided to, at long last, cut their losses and call it quits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with our programming partners \u2013 including Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery \u2013 to compete on a level playing field to deliver sports fans more choice, control, and value all-in-one experience,\u201d DirecTV said Friday after Venu\u2019s demise.\n\nFor some, Fubo remains a question mark. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether or not the shutdown of Venu Sports will disrupt the agreement between Disney and Fubo,\u201d Reese says.\n\nGreenfield wondered that too. \u201cWhat surprised us most initially (beyond the deal being announced in the first place), was that Fubo said the timeframe to close was 12-18 months. Given it is a relatively small transaction with no FCC approval needed \u2026 we cannot understand why it would take so long and Fubo has offered no rationale for the timing comment. We also wonder if the time to close will be impacted by the Venu shutdown.\u201d\n\nFishman thinks Disney should bail. \u201cThe best answer we can come up with today that would cap off this week is for Disney to exit and pretend the Fubo deal never happened. Then at least investors can start to focus on a more cohesive sports and streaming strategy.\u201d\n\nFubo shares, which soared on Monday after the deal, fell on Friday.\n\nOther\u2019s don\u2019t. There\u2019s that $130 million breakup fee. Strategically, some, including analyst Paolo Pescatore, believe Disney is in the process of moving away from pay TV, so it makes sense to hand off Hulu Live to Fubo CEO David Gandler and his management team to run. Disney can focus on the rest of its streaming business.\n\nHe speculated that Disney\u2019s 70% interest in Fubo could follow a similar track to that of DirecTV.\n\nAT&T sold its 70% stake in the satcaster to TPG last year for $7.6 billion.\n\nDade Hayes contributed to this report",

In doing so, the partners hope simplicity can win over smaller, digital-native advertisers who have never touched TV.\n\nLaunch partners include A+E, AMC Networks, DIRECTV, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Paramount, Roku, TelevisaUnivision, Warner Bros. Discovery and Xumo.\n\nComcast has been talking for some time about why TV, and its various related formats, needs to be made as easy to buy as social and digital have been.\n\nThe Universal Ads platform is built on top of the FreeWheel platform, with a marketing API that enables underlying capabilities from FreeWheel to be applied to a new demand set.\n\n\u201cUnder the hood is the FreeWheel technology, and we are abstracting capabilities from FreeWheel to provide an experience that is exactly the same as if you were buying social or as others, providing that front door for advertisers to buy premium video at a category, as a category at scale as simple as they can buy social,\u201d Rooke said.\n\nTransparent Metrics and Brand Safety\n\nWhile Universal Ads\u2019 buying process may be familiar to buyers of social and digital ads, Comcast believes it can go one better by offering premium video.\n\n\u201cWe are going to \u2026 set the standards \u2026 that have been the case for a long, long time with the Fortune 1000, and bring that quality, bring that performative media, bring that transparency, and make it available to advertisers who have built their businesses on social,\u201d Rooke said.\n\n\u201cThere is a ton of AI that we\u2019re going to have to apply beyond creative to ensure that we can provide self-serve guidance to advertisers about how their campaigns are performing, what they should do to improve those campaigns \u2014 that\u2019s a base expectation.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re watching \u201cBringing Simplicity to TV Advertising,\u201d a Beet.TV Leadership Series at CES 2025, presented by FreeWheel.

A full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on Jan. 06, 2025.\n\nDylan Lewis: Is cable coming for streaming and ads? Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis; I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers. Tim, thanks for joining me.\n\nTim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan. Not quite caffeinated today, because it's not a caffeine day, but I'm still ready to go.\n\nDylan Lewis: You're still bringing the energy, with the caffeine-free Monday. It's always a coffee morning for me, Tim. It might be a hot cocoa afternoon with the snow that we've gotten here in Washington, DC. I'm very excited, I am in the winter spirit, but we have plenty to talk about before I can go frolic out there in the white stuff.\n\nWe got our first preview of some of the things that will be coming for the consumer electronics show and what's going on in the state of tech streaming this week. Ahead of the trade show, Comcast announced its new ad-buying platform, Universal Ads. The company will be using its own properties in a hope to simplify the ad buying process in particular for small and medium sized businesses. Tim, I feel like there's already a company that does a little bit of ad buying over streaming video.\n\nTim Beyers: There is. You might have heard of it. It's called The Trade Desk. Boy, I don't mean to sound cynical, Dylan. But does this not sound like a money grab?\n\nDylan Lewis: It does.\n\nTim Beyers: This totally sounds like a money grab. It's not necessarily a bad thing, although we don't really know too much about the details of this. But here's why I say it's a money grab. We have a lot of different companies that are competing to be the provider of record of advertisements once they've got your data. The argument is, Hey look, you're here, we've got your data, we know best how to serve you, so we'll be the ones that serve ads to you. This has gone back a long time. But probably the biggest benefactors of this shift in recent years have been Amazon built a huge advertising business, because, hey we know you're buying habits. You should come advertise inside the Amazon platform, and that has become a big business. Walmart is another one that has profited from this. At the same time, I find it a curiosity, Dylan, that this has come really just like two months after The Trade Desk decided to say, Hey we're going to create a connected TV operating system for devices, because everybody else has this self-interested. The Amazon Fire, they have their own content. They're not Switzerland here. We'll be Switzerland.\n\nWe'll give you an open platform here. Everybody wants a piece of this pie, Dylan. Is Universal Ads going to be materially better? Is it going to be more simplified, which is the pitch here? I don't know if that's true. Well, I have a strong suspicion, I should say, that Comcast seized the margin opportunity and has decided to seize it.\n\nDylan Lewis: It does feel a little bit like they're doing the Apple thing of, Hey, we didn't need to be first to this, but we saw how you were doing it and we like how it looks, and we think we can get some margins doing it, so we're going to do it too. I suppose if you're someone who wants to advertise and you want to advertise on their programs, it doesn't really matter whether you want a Switzerland-type relationship, you are going to have to play on Universal Ads if that's the only game in town for getting onto their channel.\n\nTim Beyers: Well, it's not clear to me that they have said it's the only way to do it, but it certainly feels like this is going to be the primary way, and there may be some strong incentives to go through Universal Ads. But it's a dangerous game to make it the only avenue, especially when the government has its eye on portals, which has been a thing. The government has been very conscious of portals, and without making any political statements here, one of the commonalities between the outgoing administration and the incoming administration is that both have been, let's say looking somewhat askance at Big Tech. They have not necessarily been buddy buddy. We shouldn't presume that the next administration is going to be any more interested in giving free license to tech companies, big mergers. I think anytime a company decides to exert portal control, you may be inviting scrutiny you don't want.\n\nDylan Lewis: I think one of the interesting things is, Comcast is very much seeing what's happening in Big Tech and saying we'd like a piece of that and we'd like to be able to have our own version of that. They, in the grand scheme of advertising, look at a Facebook or a YouTube and say, they have 10 million advertisers, and we have several thousand advertisers when it comes to people who are across NBC Universal. They clearly feel like they are a small player in this space, even though they are maybe able to possess the relationship in a way that those other players maybe couldn't for their own content.\n\nTim Beyers: To be fair, we are also talking about lots of different ways. One of the things that's probably going to be true about 2025, that makes this an interesting time to be trying something like Universal Ads, is that we are seeing new bundles, new ways of getting things. I personally right now don't have access to generalized cable, but I have access to Peacock, and I have access to Paramount +, and honestly, I have access to YouTube, and YouTube gives me most of what I want, because most things are available later on YouTube. You know what? I'm fine with that.\n\nDylan Lewis: You're fine with waiting, Tim? You don't mind waiting around?\n\nTim Beyers: I don't mind waiting around.\n\nDylan Lewis: You mentioned Peacock, and I want to get an alarm meter from you on this for The Trade Desk and for trade desk shareholders. I'm asking selfishly, because I am one here. Trade Desk was going to be one of the people selling NBC Universal's Peacock, I think that was announced back in 2021. They have been one of several companies that have been selling inventory there, I think, for the last couple of years. We don't know a lot of the details of this yet, but when you see this news, how big of a deal do you think this is for The Trade Desk?\n\nTim Beyers: I don't know how big of a deal it is for The Trade Desk, but I do think the ground is shifting a little bit in terms of who's going to own the brokering relationship for putting ads out into the market. That seems to be undetermined at this point. Now, to be fair, I do think there is a big market for an independent broker that can provide good data, fair pricing, transparent pricing. I think the market needs that. I don't see them being disrupted by this, but I think the desire for companies and now Comcast is another one of them do take greater control of the customer relationship and leverage that customer relationship. That's going to be something that The Trade Desk is going to have to work through, don't underestimate how much of this has to do with Netflix envy. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Netflix envy, Dylan, not at all.\n\nDylan Lewis: They're saying, you innovated in this space, you created the category, you've got a successful business there rolling out the ads. We want a part of that. We want the membership model, we want the ad revenue, we want it all.\n\nTim Beyers: Absolutely, we want a piece. Don't ever underestimate envy as a motivating factor, for sure.\n\nDylan Lewis: Sticking with streaming, Comcast is not the only one making moves this week. Disney also apparently nearing a deal to bring Hulu + Live TV together with Fubo. This is a smaller streamer that is known for its sports content. The focus on sports here maybe not necessarily a surprise because Disney has been developing venue sports with Fox and Warner Brothers, and Fubo has been a thorn in their side as they've been trying to do that too.\n\nTim Beyers: In fact, they sued over it. A judge had actually blocked the launch of a venue. Fubo did was starting to get some traction here from that lawsuit. This is according to the Wall Street Journal, that the judge said that the deal, this new bundle would substantially lessen competition and restrain trade. Not great. The partners in Venue, which are essentially the partners in Hulu and the Hulu Live + TV service have appealed the decision, but now it does look like, by virtue of an acquisition or a merger, I guess, it would be in this case, you can make that litigation go away. It is interesting. This is what I said previously. We are talking about different types of very specialized bundles showing up. Streaming, it makes your ability to make a bundle that fits you a little more compelling. Like I said, in this case, my bundle is YouTube, free, I pay for it with ads, and then cheap Peacock and Paramount +. I get a fair amount of sports ball, which I want, and I get some decent TV programming, and I get plenty of movies. I'm good. The only other one I've added to that is Netflix, I added that recently.\n\nThat's a very tailored bundle. You can see, Dylan, that this is going to be a thing, where you have specialized bundles coming together to serve a particular niche. In this case, it's sports. But it might be something entirely different. It may be a reality TV bundle or cooking shows bundle. I fully expect that that comes around. At some point, this is just the precursor. To be clear about what's happening here, this feels more than anything else, like, look, we just want to move forward with our sports bundle. Can we get the litigation to stop? I think that's what this is.\n\nDylan Lewis: Fubo TV, I think, before this deal was announced, was a sub-billion dollar company. I could see Disney basically saying, I think we can pay to make this go away for about $1.5 billion. I think that's within our wheelhouse. The venue sports bundle that they are developing with Fox and Warner Brothers, focused on sports. No surprise there, it's right there in the name. Live games and event coverage from the major professional sports leagues and major college conferences sounds very appealing. I think what's fascinating about this is Disney just spent so much time trying to untangle the multi-owned joint venture, that is Hulu. Then they're are saying, let's hop right back into that lane with venue sports, Tim. What do you make of that?\n\nTim Beyers: Irony never disappoints, Number 1, never ever does it disappoint. That's Number 1. But Number 2, is it tells you something about the appeal of targeted bundling. That's what I mean. When I said that I think we can expect to see more targeted bundling, I think Disney has woken up to realize that it might be a bit of an ask for some people to say, you can get the whole big enchilada. If you want live TV, in that Hulu bundle, it's still not that cheap. You're still not that far off $100 if you want live TV in a bundle. I don't know that that is a sale that works anymore. In the era of YouTube and very targeted streaming. I'm not sure I'm the only one who's like, I don't know that I need that. It just went YouTube +, my very targeted streaming services. Figuring out how to maybe make these things a little bit more appetizing, I think is the thing. One of the ways to do it is to control a niche and then package the niche. We'll see, but it's a very interesting time.\n\nDylan Lewis: Putting the story here with Fubo and Disney together with that Universal Ads story, I do see a little bit of a throughline in that it seems like it is going to get impossible almost for smaller players to really establish themselves, in streaming. The Trade Desks of the world, they were able to seize a market opportunity because the legacy players hadn't quite gotten there yet. Fubo was one of those smaller players that people have thought maybe might be able to turn into something. I don't know how easy it's going to be for anyone over the next five or ten years that is not already a major media brand to hop into this space, whether it's on the ad side or on the content side.\n\nTim Beyers: That's a really good point, and it's hard to see, to maybe validate your point a bit here, the great cautionary tale in this space is CuriosityStream, which is now the MicroWest of microcaps.\n\nDylan Lewis: It's 100 million, I think.\n\nTim Beyers: It just hasn't really gone anywhere. For those who don't know, the ticker CURI is a microcap streamer of documentaries. It's not like that's a bad service or something that is unwanted. There are people who are very much in the market for, yes, I want to see a bunch of documentaries, but how you make that into something big is, it's just harder to see. To your point, you're probably going to have the major media companies. But what those major media companies are doing is a different strategy to profit, which may be like creating some balkanized, very specialized content bundles and maybe not trying to make you swallow 100 to $200 a month, but trying to get you on a consistent $35 a month. Does that actually work? I don't know, but that favors the companies that already have a chokehold on content and licensing deals.\n\nDylan Lewis: Tim, you know what one of my favorite bundles is?\n\nTim Beyers: Tell me.\n\nDylan Lewis: You and Monday Motley Fool Money. Thanks for joining me today.\n\nTim Beyers: Nice. Well done. Thank you. Thanks, Dylan.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nDylan Lewis: Listeners, coming up on the show. You've probably heard about the sports betting platform DraftKings. But what about the company that powers DraftKings, and a number of other sports betting platforms around the world? Up next, Anand Chokkavelu host Dan Caplinger and Dave Meier for a Scoreboard episode, Breaking Down Sportradar.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: Welcome to latest Motley Fool Scoreboard. I'm Anand Chokkavelu. We've got longtime Fools, Dan Caplinger and David Meier, giving a 1-10 rating to sports gambling data provider, Sportradar, ticker symbol SRAD. First, we'll hit the business, including factors like industry and competition. A ten is invincible, a one is hopeless. David's going with an eight, Dan's going with a seven. David, I know you're pretty hot on this stock, why don't you tell us about the business?\n\nDavid Meier: Sure. Sportradar licenses sports data from leagues and sports literally all around the world. What it does is it takes that data and turns it into a variety of different content and betting opportunities, that it sells to its customers, whether it's a Draft Kings on the betting side or a CBS sports on the content side. The company has proven itself to be both a smart buyer of the data and a smart seller of its products, and for that reason, I think it's a very good business model.\n\nDan Caplinger: I gave it a seven. I like the business model as well, David's right. There's a whole lot of betting services out there across the world. Plenty of competition in that space in a highly competitive market. I love to look at the pick and shovel places, the underlying businesses that make these industries go. These betting sites can't do what they do without the data to back them up. That's what Sportradar is giving them. I like it, I gave them a seven.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: Give the apps the data. I take that data on the apps, I convert it into losses. You might want to invest in me. [laughs] Let's go on to management. A 10 is Warren Buffett, a one is Homer Simpson. David gives an eight, Dan gives a seven. This time, we'll go with Dan.\n\nDan Caplinger: I've got a lot of confidence in founder, CEO, Carsten Koerl. We like to see founders who are invested in their businesses. Koerl is 23-year-veteran in the business, and prior to that, he worked at an actual betting site, and so he understands what his betting site customers need from Sportradar. I think that helps to inform his leadership style has done well operationally as well as from a stock performance standpoint.\n\nDavid Meier: As you said on it, I gave it an eight, and I completely agree Carsten Koerl has been a great founder CEO. Interestingly, he reorganized the company in early 2024 in order to simplify the business structure. In the process, in my opinion, he hired a very key new executive, whose name is Behshad Behzadi. Behshad is now the chief technical officer and chief AI officer. Basically, what they're doing is bringing their technology platform and their analytics platform into the modern era. I've been impressed so far, and I look forward to seeing what they do with the business going forward.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: For financials, a 10 is a fortress, a one is yikes. David's going with an eight, Dan's a bit lower at a six. Start with the bull case here, David.\n\nDavid Meier: [laughs] It was a little rough actually in 2023, but growth has returned, and that's on the back of extending and expanding its deal with the NBA and a number of other sports leagues around the world. I expect to see additional scale going forward as this growth persists. You got to remember the way this works is they pay money upfront to get the licensing deals, and over time, they monetize it. That's how we should see the scale from the new deals.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: I don't think I disagree with anything David said. I think I just ding Sportradar a little bit for that rough patch that he's talking about. They've shown nice revenue growth. There's modest profitability. I like the fact that the balance sheets relatively strong, minimal debt, significant amounts of cash available to inform, strategic decisions or reinvestments in the business. It's just I like to see more consistent. The fact that you go through a rough patch, I think is probably the reason why our scores differ on that score.\n\nReal quick, David, before we go on evaluation. I have a follow up question, which is why do the apps need Sportradar as a middle person between the leagues and the apps?\n\nDavid Meier: I'll use DraftKings as an example again. What is DraftKings core competency? It's marketing. They're not in the analytics business in terms of, how do I interface with the sporting data? That's what Sportradar is good at, and so it's better for a company like DraftKings and many others to go to Sportradar to get the betting opportunity and present it to its customers.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: Beautiful. Let's move on to valuation. Dan, we'll start with you. How well will Sportradar stock do over the next five years? How safe is it? Ten is a sure thing, one is a lottery ticket.\n\nDan Caplinger: I put five year returns of five to 10%. Some might think that that's low. That's actually pretty much middle of the road for me. I like the stock is starting to gain some momentum here. New legalizations at the state level for online gambling in the US, I think is helping the industry overall. Questions whether that expansion will continue. I give them a safety score of six just because I think there's some question about that future direction, and the extent of future growth that we haven't already seen priced into the stock.\n\nDavid Meier: I'm agreeing with Dan on the safety score, I also gave it a six. As you noted earlier, I am a bull. I think there's 15% plus returns available, even after the recent rise in the stock. One of the reasons is this is the industry leader and they are a trusted partner. They've been able to renew their contracts at higher and higher levels for a number of years. The paradox here is actually, the United States is the emerging market here. Dan pointed to legalization within different US states. That is absolutely a growth. Those are the growth opportunities going forward. There's definitely risk, though. You can pay too much for the data. You could price your bets and your contents poorly. I also think there's risk, but I think the return potential is very much worth it.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: Everyone's favorite topic. Dan, is there accompanying Sportradar space you like more? It depends how you want to define the space. I'm not really sure there's any other company that does sports data the way the Sportradar does. When you broaden it out to the betting world more broadly, I'd go with MGM Resorts, ticker MGM. It's a betting site provider. It might be a potential customer Sportradar, they also have the Brick and Mortar Casino resorts. You have a good loyalty program. The loyalty has branched out to talk with other loyalty programs like the Marriott Bonvoy program. It's got exposure to the Asian gaming capital of Macau. I think it's an interesting play right now.\n\nDavid Meier: The direct competitor is a company called Genius Sports, ticker is G-E-N-I. I agree with Dan, you got to broaden out a little bit. One company I think that's very interesting is a maker and licenser of digital casino games. I learned about this company from our colleague, Bill Mann, and the company is called Evolution AB. It's a little tough to trade on because it's on the pink sheets, but that is a very interesting company.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: You like it more than Sportradar, David?\n\nDavid Meier: Yes, but it's hard to buy.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: That's what makes it all so worthwhile, right?\n\nDavid Meier: Yeah.\n\nAnand Chokkavelu: [laughs] Thank you to David and Dan. They've given Sportradar pretty good overall score of 7.1 out of 10, short of that 8.0 that would force me to own shares. Left to his own devices, though, David would have given it an eight if you average all his scores. It's one I've been meaning to look at, actually, because David got it on my radar a few months ago. Maybe you'll look into it as well.\n\nDylan Lewis: Listeners, premium TMF members get access to all of our Scoreboard episodes, including the Fool Archive. Those drop every weekday at 7:00 PM ET.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Due to stock-specific weakness in a handful of holdings and a lack of exposure to several of the top-performing, higher-beta growth companies, the strategy underperformed its benchmark the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index in a momentum-driven market. Following Trump\u2019s victory, small-cap, value, and cyclical shares saw a spike in price; however, growth stocks regained their lead by the end of the quarter. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in the fourth quarter 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a media and technology company. The one-month return of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) was -7.63%, and its shares lost 14.10% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On January 8, 2025, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock closed at $37.17 per share with a market capitalization of $142.232 billion.\n\nClearBridge Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We continue to consolidate our positions within media to those with more attractive growth prospects over the next several years. We sold media conglomerate Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as it faces greater competition and weakening pricing in its core broadband business. The growth outlook for Comcast is more challenged as competition from new entrants and dampened pricing power has impacted its connectivity business. Industry-wide saturation in broadband, coupled with a secular decline in cable TV subscribers, has diminished growth potential in its core cable business. Comcast\u2019s ability to offset these subscriber losses through price increases is also becoming increasingly constrained.\"\n\nA couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 72 hedge fund portfolios held Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) at the end of the third quarter which was 61 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In Massachusetts, the drop will be by $12.85.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have reached agreements with NBC Sports Boston and NESN and appreciate them working with us to continue offering their networks in a way that reflects the changing video marketplace for local sports and provides our customers with a choice,\u201d said an Xfinity spokesperson in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spokesperson said most of Xfinity\u2019s customers already have the Ultimate TV package. As of the end of 2023, Comcast/Xfinity had approximately 920,000 cable subscribers in Massachusetts, down from 1.05 million in 2022, per Mass.gov.\n\nNESN is one of the more prominent regional sports networks in the country at a time when the cable sports model is struggling mightily. Lane Turner/Globe Staff\n\nThe Bruins play the Lightning on Tuesday, the day the new arrangement goes into effect. When Xfinity Popular TV subscribers turn on NESN that night, there will be a message on the screen saying that a subscription to the Ultimate TV package is required. That also will be the case for the following night\u2019s Celtics game against the Raptors on NBC Sports Boston.\n\nXfinity says it will offer a promotional package to those switching to the Ultimate TV level, the details of which will be available at Xfinity.com/upgradeTV.\n\nComcast/Xfinity has moved regional sports networks to its more expensive tier in approximately 30 other markets.\n\nThe deals with NESN and NBC Sports Boston are for multiple years, which offers some stability in a regional sports network landscape that has been shaken by the decrease in revenue because of cord-cutters who have switched from cable television to streaming in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most RSNs and their respective teams typically prefer to remain on the basic, lower-cost tier of cable, fearing that moving to a more exclusive and costlier level will affect viewership.\n\nChad Finn can be reached at chad.finn@globe.com.

It is expected to close by the end of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n\nThe combined entity will end up with about 30 million subscribers, as the two companies already have strongholds in major markets like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Comcast has 22 million pay TV customers but plans to divest 3 million after the deal closes. Time Warner Cable will contribute 11.2 million customers.\n\nThe price amounts to $158.82 per share for Time Warner Cable and is about 17 percent above that stock\u2019s Wednesday closing price of $135.31. It tops a Charter Communications Inc. proposal to buy Time Warner Cable for about $132.50 per share.\n\nCharter had pursued Time Warner Cable for months, but Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus had consistently rejected what he called a lowball offer, saying he\u2019d cut a deal for $160 per share in cash and stock.\n\nFor a time, Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, stayed in the background, waiting to purchase any chunk of subscribers that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would sell off. Charter had planned to finance its bid with $25 billion in new debt. As part of a plan to pay off the debt quickly, the company considered selling off some of its territories after a deal had closed. Time Warner Cable\u2019s Marcus had also balked at the huge debt burden the Charter takeover represented.\n\nThe Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination\u2019s total of roughly 30 million customers is believed to be a level that won\u2019t trigger the concern of antitrust authorities. Divesting subscribers could help the deal get approved more quickly.\n\nComcast also is taking the position that because Comcast and Time Warner Cable don\u2019t serve overlapping markets, their combination won\u2019t reduce competition for consumers. Comcast operates in Chicago and mainly in northeast markets that also include Boston, Washington and its home base of Philadelphia. Time Warner Cable has strongholds around its headquarters in New York as well in Los Angeles, Dallas and Milwaukee.\n\nIn many of those areas, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will face competition from rivals AT&T and Verizon, which provide both pay TV services and Internet hookups. Both AT&T and Verizon are growing quickly. They ended 2013 with 5.5 million and 5.3 million pay TV subscribers, respectively.\n\nTime Warner Cable shareholders will receive 2.875 Comcast shares for every Time Warner Cable share they own. Once the deal is final, they will end up owning about 23 percent of the combined company.\n\nComcast and Time Warner Cable are expected to save $1.5 billion in annual costs over three years, with half of that realized in the first year.\n\nComcast also plans to add an additional $10 billion in share buybacks at the close of the deal, on top of a recent plan to boost its share buyback authority to $7.5 billion from $1 billion.\n\nConceding that it had lost the takeover battle, Charter issued a statement Wednesday saying, \u201cCharter has always maintained that our greatest opportunity to create value for shareholders is by executing our current business plan, and that we will continue to be disciplined in this and any other (merger and acquisition) activity we pursue.\u201d\n\nEven before the deal had been formally announced, it was being denounced. Public Knowledge, a Washington-based consumer rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that regulators must stop the deal, because it would give Comcast \u201cunprecedented gatekeeper power in several important markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard,\u201d it said.\n\nShares of Time Warner Cable jumped 7, or $9.46, to $144.77 Thursday morning after the deal was announced, while broader trading indexes slipped less than 1 percent. Comcast shares fell more than 3 percent, or $1.74, to $53.50.",

Or at least that\u2019s what the president of Comcast Advertising, James Rooke, said during an interview on Wednesday at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. The ad exec was speaking about the company\u2019s Monday launch of \u201cuniversal ads,\u201d a solution that lets marketers buy TV ads from a variety of media companies in one place.\n\nLaunch partners for universal ads include A+E, AMC Networks, DIRECTV, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Paramount, Roku, TelevisaUnivision, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Xumo, with more said to be on the way. The inventory for universal ads will be streaming inventory to start, with plans to add solutions for linear TV inventory over time.\n\nThe goal is to simplify buying TV ads to better compete with how easy it is to buy ads across social video sites like YouTube. In other words, buying streaming TV ads should be as easy as buying ads on social video, where there\u2019s not that much of a learning curve to get started.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of advertisers out there that have built their businesses on social video, on YouTube advertising, and others, that haven\u2019t had the ability to access the power of the content [and] the advertising solutions that come from companies like these and others as simply as they would like to,\u201d Rooke said. \u201cAnd as we speak to those advertisers who built their businesses on social video, they\u2019re looking for new qualified audiences.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also looking to have their business associated with content that is brand-safe, something social video can\u2019t always provide as past advertiser boycotts of YouTube and other social sites have proven.\n\nWith the launch of universal ads, the companies are hoping to make their \u201cpremium\u201d video another category considered by those same marketers who today advertise on social video, whether that\u2019s unscripted or short-form video like those found on YouTube or more social video, like those found on Meta\u2019s apps, the Comcast exec noted.\n\nThis is key because the majority of the competition and growth in the industry was coming from social video, Rooke said \u2014 and not necessarily from other TV providers or even streamers, like Netflix and Amazon.\n\n\u201cWhile these companies and us, we compete in certain ways, the real competition is coming from new providers that are going after TV dollars \u2026 So if you look at where the growth is, all of us are doing really well in terms of growing our CTV [Connected TV] businesses \u2014 our streaming businesses \u2014 and the app revenue that comes from it, but the majority of growth overall is going to social video, and that\u2019s not slowing down,\u201d Rooke pointed out.\n\nThat led Comcast to its decision to chase net new dollars from where the growth is taking place, as opposed to going after the same ad dollars as before.\n\nYouTube has been working for years to capture more TV ad dollars, particularly as its service became more popular on TVs, which now accounts for nearly half its viewership.",

            "content": "In a deal that will expand its MSP services to enterprise customers, Comcast Business recently acquired Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) provider Nitel to capture and grow its MSP business and services. Comcast plans to use the Nitel acquisition to offer additional connectivity, global secure networking and other advanced services to Comcast\u2019s enterprise clients.\n\nBy acquiring Nitel\u2019s MSP operations, Comcast Business can also move to expand its offerings into indirect sales channels, broadening its business reach and opportunities in the marketplace.\n\nComcast Business is acquiring Chicago-based Nitel from international private equity firm Cinven for an undisclosed price. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Further terms of the deal are not being released.\n\nWhy Comcast Business Is Buying an MSP\n\nAs a NaaS vendor, Nitel provides high-performance networking, cloud services, and cybersecurity services to enterprise customers across the United States. Nitel has about 6,600 clients across the country, with a strong focus on mid-size enterprise customers in financial services, healthcare, education, and other industries.\n\nThe Nitel acquisition appears to follow a recent trend by some tech vendors to purchase and integrate their own MSPs to allow them to more easily expand their businesses into indirect sales channels, raising revenue and broadening their customer bases.\n\nSeveral IT analysts, including Dan Olds , principal of Olds Research, said that for companies like Comcast Business, this approach \u201cmakes some sense in terms of being able to compete faster in a crowded market.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly beneficial for Comcast \u201cgiven how their existing revenue sources, namely cable connectivity and entertainment, are under immense pressure by competitors,\u201d said Olds. \u201cTheir revenue for the past three years has been flat, and they must be looking for some way to juice growth. The business services and connectivity only make up 7% of their revenue but account for 13% of their earnings, which is why we see them doubling down on business services with this purchase of Nitel.\u201d\n\nOlds said that he thinks that more large companies could eye similar moves to buy their own MSPs to expand their own businesses in the future.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of tech-centric big companies who, like Comcast, probably see business services like cloud computing as a way to increase profitability and revenue growth,\u201d said Olds. \u201cThere are also a lot of reasonably sized and profitable MSPs out there who could be purchased with stock and modest amounts of cash for a win-win deal. However, as the market consolidates, it will become even more competitive and more difficult to differentiate on things other than cost \u2013 which is a formula for lower returns over time.\u201d\n\nOne thing is certain, said Olds \u2013 MSPs that are looking to sell out will find willing buyers, including some that will overpay to get into a business they are unfamiliar with. \u201cFor those who are in it for the long haul, the ride is going to get rockier as well-financed competitors attempt to lure customers away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to hunker down in their niches, make sure they are delighting their customers, and look for ways to be more efficient on CapEx and OpEx. \u201c\n\nOn the other hand, added Olds, \u201cthe big conglomerates always have a problem when it comes to focus. When they get too big, they become unwieldy, lose touch with customers, and eventually lose interest and decide to slim down again. \u201c\n\nAnother analyst, Zeus Kerravala , the founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told ChannelE2E that for MSPs deals like this one can be a profitable boon.\n\n\u201cYes, it has been a trend\u201d to see similar MSP acquisitions like this one by Comcast Business, said Kerravala. \u201cFew MSPs can scale to more than a few hundred million dollars, so an exit like this is best for them.\u201d\n\nFor the acquiring company, however, there is a risk in acquiring an MSP, he added.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-market, where Comcast's main buyers are, most products are bought through channel partners, such as MSPs,\u201d said Kerravala. \u201cAcquiring your own MSP does have some logic but what happens is the acquirer can end up competing with its own channel offerings, limiting its reach.\u201d\n\nIt is more complicated for Comcast Business because \u201cComcast is not known as a great channel company, and I look at this deal cautiously as it needs to be managed carefully or could cause Comcast to take a step backward,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is great for Nitel and its customers.\u201d\n\nRob Enderle , principal analyst with Enderle Group, said he sees the Nitel acquisition as critical for Comcast\u2019s continued survival. Recently, the company announced it is working to spin off some of its cable TV networks into a new publicly traded company as it focuses on its core growth businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, business services, and its NBCUniversal streaming, studios and theme parks.\n\n\u201cComcast has a problem \u2013 it is in decline and wants to sell off its cable networks, but that means they need to build up and strengthen their other business opportunities,\u201d said Enderle. \u201cThis acquisition appears to be tied to their effort to redefine themselves. So, while I agree this is a trend, for Comcast in particular, this may make the difference between whether they are still around post-cable-network sales.\u201d\n\nIn the big picture, said Enderle, \u201cit showcases this is an element they intend to invest in as they reduce or eliminate their presence in the cable tv segment.\n\nThe success of this move is still to be seen in the future, he said. \u201cIt really depends on how effective Comcast\u2019s pivot is. If Comcast scales this business, it could put pressure on the independent MSPs to find a larger company to merge with to fight Comcast, which has a reputation of being an aggressive competitor.\u201d",

Powered by MachineQ\u2019s scalable IoT network connectivity platform, the remote equipment telemetry and control device delivers real-time visibility and enhanced operational efficiency across various industries, from foodservice to life sciences, adding equipment intelligence to its solutions portfolio.\n\nAs the demand for improved efficiency, safety, and sustainability in the foodservice industry accelerates, the MQio 9w enables operators to remotely collect and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) of equipment across their operations, allowing for data-driven decisions to help optimize equipment usage, maintain food quality, and extend the uptime and lifespan of their assets through proactive maintenance.\n\nThe device contains multiple digital and serial interfaces to support a wide range of equipment types. With the edge processing capability, the device non-obtrusively extracts key data points from the equipment and sends it to the cloud, providing centralized visibility and actionable insights to help keep operations running smoothly.\n\nFor example, maintaining a consistent supply of ice is crucial to many restaurant brands. With the MQio 9w, operators can monitor ice machines in real-time to ensure they are functioning properly, and production is always at optimal levels. It can also alert staff to anomalies such as low production stemming from compressor malfunctions or temperature fluctuations to prevent potential shortages that could disrupt service.\n\nFurther, operators can remotely monitor fryers in their kitchens, gaining instant access to crucial data such as batch size, cook time, oil quality, temperature, and energy use. This level of insight helps operators enhance operational efficiency and supports more informed decision-making, such as proper and timely oil changeout to maintain quality and taste\u2014leading to a better customer experience.\n\n\u201c The MQio 9w helps eliminate inefficiencies associated with managing multiple systems from the individual store level to global store locations,\u201d said Bryan Witkowski, head of product and strategy at MachineQ. \u201c This device uses IoT technology to connect equipment, effectively turning them into smart devices capable of real-time communication. And its design ensures seamless integration with existing equipment and easy installation.\u201d\n\nBeyond food services, the MQio 9w has broader applicability in other verticals. Witkowski adds, \u201c Most enterprises have commercial or industrial equipment they rely on for operational needs. And data from that equipment can be of value. For example, life sciences customers can use this device to extract data from original equipment manufacturer (OEM) equipment, incubators, refrigeration units [cryo, ultra-low temperature], and other lab instruments for workflow efficiencies.\u201d\n\nThe MQio 9w leverages MachineQ\u2019s scalable network connectivity platform, allowing businesses to quickly deploy additional solutions, like power monitoring, which the company announced last month. The power monitoring solution enables operators to get visibility into consumption data to help reduce usage, aiding in sustainability efforts\u2014all while using the same network infrastructure.\n\nOther solutions include real-time temperature monitoring, smart restrooms, leak detection, asset utilization, and more \u2014 aimed at providing a holistic view and opportunities for achieving operational effectiveness.\n\nFor more information about the MQio 9w and how it can enhance your operations, please visit machineq.com.\n\nAbout MachineQ\n\nMachineQ, a Comcast Company, makes it simple for enterprises to build, connect and deploy IoT solutions at scale.

            "content": "With a market cap of $142.3 billion , Comcast Corporation ( CMCSA ) is a leading global media and technology company. The company delivers broadband, wireless, and video services through its Xfinity, Comcast Business, and Sky brands, while also creating and distributing entertainment, sports, and news content via NBCUniversal, Telemundo, Peacock, Sky Studios, and more. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based company is expected to release its fiscal Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Thursday, Jan. 30.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts expect the cable provider to report a profit of $0.88 per share , up 4.8% from $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has surpassed Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in the last four quarters. CMCSA exceeded the consensus EPS estimate by 5.7% in the most recent quarter.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect CMCSA to report EPS of $4.25, up 6.8% from $3.98 in fiscal 2023 .\n\nComcast has declined 13.6% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming both the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 25.8% gain and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund's ( XLC ) 35.8% increase over the same period.\n\nShares of Comcast rose 3.4% on Oct. 31, driven by its strong Q3 2024 earnings report . Adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 beat the consensus estimate, while revenue of $32.1 billion topped estimates and grew 6.5% year-over-year. Peacock\u2019s revenues surged 82% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, with a 29% increase in paid subscribers to 36 million, reflecting strong growth in its streaming segment. Additionally, strong performance in Media and Studios revenues further bolstered investor optimism, offsetting declines in Theme Parks and other segments.\n\nOverall, analysts' consensus view on Comcast stock is moderately optimistic, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating. Out of 29 analysts covering the stock, 17 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" 11 give a \"Hold\" rating, and one suggests a \"Strong Sell.\" This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with a 15 \"Strong Buy\" rating.\n\nAs of writing, CMCSA is trading below the average analyst price target of $48.04.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Once completed, thousands of homes and businesses will be able to access Xfinity and Comcast Business services.\n\nCoral Springs, Florida\n\nConstruction began in the residential areas west of University Drive. Crews broke ground last year at the intersection of NW 28th St. and SW 94th Ave. Building is currently taking place near NW 49th Pl. and NW 89th Ter. and will continue up and down Westview Dr. and 86th Way. The next areas to be constructed are between Coral Ridge Dr. and Coral Springs Dr., south of W Sample Rd. and north of Royal Palm Blvd.\n\n\"We're glad to see Comcast investing in and expanding to Coral Springs with a brand-new fiber network,\" said Cindy Brief, President of the Coral Springs Chamber. \"Whether you're using the Internet to work, learn or be entertained, an online connection is a must-have. Comcast's decision to come to Coral Springs means residents and businesses will have a new connectivity option, and it is just another reason our city is the perfect place to call home or open a business.\"\n\nThis new, next-generation network will give Coral Springs access to faster Internet speeds that outperform competitors \u2014 up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) for residential customers and up to 100 Gbps for businesses. With this fiber-to-the-home technology, customers can access symmetrical speeds which means faster uploads than ever before.\n\n\n\n\"Coral Springs is the ideal location to bring this remarkable technology,\" said Rafael Visbal, Vice President of Market Development for Comcast's Florida Region. \"We heard from the community. Today, we're answering their call by building a network ready for tomorrow. Once our network is online, families, entrepreneurs and home-based businesses will have the reliability and speed they need.\"\n\nIntroducing Xfinity for Consumers\n\nComcast's residential services are marketed under the Xfinity and NOW brands, and consumers in Coral Springs will be able to take advantage of Xfinity's full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and home security. With fast Internet speeds, powerful WiFi that reaches every corner of the home, and super-responsive connections with low lag available with its plan, customers have a great experience using their connected devices to stream their favorite sports and entertainment content, video chat with coworkers and friends, learn from home or simply surf the web.\n\nComcast Business to Power Coral Spring's Workforce\n\nFor local businesses, Comcast Business offers a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of all sizes achieve their business goals. Industry analysts and associations have consistently recognized Comcast Business as a leader and innovator in flexible, scalable options as well as one of the fastest-growing providers of Ethernet services.\n\nAccessing Affordable Internet\n\nComcast is committed to making Internet accessible and affordable across communities in Florida. Since 2011, the technology leader has offered Internet Essentials. The program provides low-cost Internet service, digital skills training and subsidized computers to eligible income-constrained households. Internet Essentials has helped hundreds of thousands of Floridians since its launch in 2011, including students, senior citizens, veterans and people with disabilities enrolled in public assistance programs and more.\n\nWhile Comcast's commitment to Broward County can be traced back for decades, the technology leader's presence and support is now on full display in Coral Springs. The company recently sponsored the city's Oktoberfest event, where Xfinity representatives chatted with residents about future service areas.\n\nComcast Business also took over Let's Chill Homemade Ice Cream. The team offered free ice cream flights to patrons and shared information about their products and services.\n\n\"This is a new day, Coral Springs. While we have served businesses in the city for some time, we're thrilled to announce we're building a fiber network across the city. This investment should send a strong message that Comcast is here to support this community's connectivity needs for decades to come,\" said Jeff Buzzelli, Senior Vice President of Comcast's Florida Region. \"We're ready to win your business and show you why Comcast is a leader in this space. Whether it's Comcast Business or Xfinity services, we're here to connect you to the moments that matter most.\"\n\nResidents can visit Xfinity.com/mytown and enter their addresses for additional details on construction timing and upcoming service availability. The majority of this project is expected to be completed by late 2025. Comcast's most recent expansion to Coral Springs is part of the company's latest investment in Florida, which also includes expansions to DeSoto County, Citrus County and more areas of Miami-Dade County.\n\n###\n\nAbout Comcast Corporation\n\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

By building Universal Ads with an advertiser-centric approach, as an ecosystem on top of a shared technology infrastructure across publishers, performance advertisers, who were previously limited in their ability to purchase premium, brand-safe inventory from some of the top TV publishers, can now access premium video at scale directly, with a simple, consistent buying experience regardless of the publisher.\n\n\u201cThe north star of advertising has always been combining the premium reach of linear with the precision of data-informed targeting for marketers,\u201d said Mark Marshall, Chairman, NBCUniversal Global Advertising & Partnerships. \u201cNow with Universal Ads, we are delivering that vision to businesses of all sizes.

It's designed to mimic the process of buying ads on social media content and tech platforms.\n\n\"The head scratcher is that there's a sort of large number of advertisers who've built their businesses, or started to build their businesses, on the backs of social video,\" said Rooke. \"Yet when you talk to these advertisers there's an increasing wish to diversify away from a very limited number of big technology companies.\"\n\nRooke said the challenge has been that these big tech companies \"make it super simple to transact on their platforms,\" whereas traditional media, or so-called premium content, does not.\n\nMarshall said he and Rooke had been in discussions over the last several months on how to \"create new demand opportunities\" for the nontraditional advertisers.\n\nComcast built the free, self-service platform using its ad tech company FreeWheel. Many of the partners that have already signed on are FreeWheel clients.\n\nThere are also plans to offer free, automated artificial intelligence tools to help produce the ads, which can be another pain point for smaller companies.\n\n\"Universal Ads has a tremendous opportunity to steal market share from our competitors in a very unique and collaborative way that will fundamentally change the advertising landscape,\" said Marshall.",

It is powered by FreeWheel technology that supports video advertising for a variety of premium U.S. publishers.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe Manager for the free self-service TV ad-buying tool works similar to the way that Google, Microsoft, and Meta drove ad buying from some of the smaller companies on their respective platforms.\n\nMark Marshall, chairman of NBCUniversal Global Advertising & Partnerships, believes TV has always been a \u201cperformance vehicle for brands,\u201d and that Universal Ads will put the reach of premium content TV is known for into the hands of more marketers.\n\nComcast describes Universal Ads as its first cross-industry collaboration for this type of scale to simplify access for small and medium-sized businesses looking for performance-type formats.\n\nJames Rooke, President, Comcast Advertising, believes the platform was built in in response to what advertisers have been asking for\u2014to make TV ads simple to buy and measure. Something for the needs of performance marketers.\n\nA 2024 study of 250 performance-based advertisers conducted by Comcast Advertising showed 50% of advertisers who have never advertised on TV or only done so minimally felt that their return on investment (ROI) from social media had peaked or lessoned. Eighty-nine percent of them indicated they were willing to try TV advertising.\n\nThe network was built on a shared technology infrastructure across publishers, performance advertisers, who were previously limited in their ability to purchase premium, brand-safe inventory from some of the top TV publishers. This platform, Comcast believes, changes the buying landscape.\n\nComcast also plans to offer free, automated AI creative production of TV commercials, and a marketing API that will enable developers to build reporting, measurement, creative generation, and other applications.",

            "content": "Comcast (CMCSA) closed the latest trading day at $37.49, indicating a -0.48% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.55%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.06%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.24%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Comcast will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on January 30, 2025. On that day, Comcast is projected to report earnings of $0.88 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 4.76%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $31.64 billion, reflecting a 1.23% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Comcast. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.62% lower. At present, Comcast boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Comcast currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.53. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.87.\n\nMeanwhile, CMCSA's PEG ratio is currently 1.37. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Cable Television industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.7.\n\nThe Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 156, finds itself in the bottom 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

Meanwhile, Peacock paid subscribers jumped 29% over the past year. Management also has a plan.

            "content": "With internet service providers ramping up fiber rollouts, DOCSIS 4.0 deployments gaining traction, the aggressive demand for more bandwidth by devices, and certified Wi-Fi 7 devices hitting shelves at a more affordable price point, the stage is set for faster, more reliable internet than ever before.\n\n\n\nWi-Fi 7 isn\u2019t just another incremental upgrade, it has been a game-changer. Officially dubbed Extremely High Throughput, it builds on the successes of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and adding wider channels (up to 320 MHz), Multi-Link Operation (MLO), and support for 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz bands. Although theoretical throughput tops out at a blistering 46 Gbps, real-world performance falls much shorter than this.\n\n\n\nThankfully fiber optic deployments are making the kind of headway that tech dreams are made of. AT&T, for instance, is gunning for over 45 million fiber passings by 2025, surpassing its previous already aggressive goal of 30 million. Through public-private partnerships and joint ventures like Gigapower with BlackRock, AT&T is aggressively expanding multi-gigabit connectivity into underserved markets.\n\n\n\nComcast isn\u2019t sitting idle either, blending fiber expansions with its existing hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) network. Since not everyone can get fiber installed to their homes or businesses yet, and that\u2019s where DOCSIS 4.0 comes in. In the US, Comcast has already rolled out the technology to more than 1 million homes across ten markets, including Atlanta, Denver, and Seattle. With symmetrical speeds of 2 Gbps and plans to hit 3 Gbps in 2025 (and 5 Gbps by 2026), DOCSIS 4.0 is proving to be a lifeline for areas still reliant on coaxial infrastructure. The key lies in Comcast\u2019s Full Duplex (FDX) amplifiers, which allow DOCSIS 4.0 to work across larger portions of its HFC network, even in setups with long amplifier cascades. We are expecting to see more DOCSIS 4.0 offerings in two weeks at CES 2025 as unified chipsets from Broadcom are becoming widely available. These chipsets are integrating Full Duplex and Extended Spectrum DOCSIS (ESD) technologies while embedding AI and ML for smarter, more efficient network management.\n\n\n\nThe expansion of fiber networks, DOCSIS 4.0 solidifying its role, and Wi-Fi 7 devices rolling out en masse, 2025 is set to redefine what we expect from our home and office networks. Comcast is already testing its integrated XB10 gateway, a DOCSIS 4.0 modem that\u2019s fully equipped with Wi-Fi 7 capabilities, while AT&T\u2019s fiber initiatives are setting the stage for a seamless multi-gigabit and 10-gigabit experience.\n\n\n\nAvailability of significantly more bandwidth, as well as 8K video displays and streaming finally on the horizon, the hardware ecosystem is ready to explode with new products after stagnating for the last few years. We have already seen Wi-Fi 7 certified routers from Netgear, TP-Link, and Asus but we are expecting many more companies to start hitting the market in 2025 shortly after the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in early January.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "In a recent surprising development, Comcast, one of the leading telecommunications and media conglomerates, has made a decisive move that could significantly impact its stock value. As investors keep a keen eye on the trajectory of the \u201cComcast Aktie,\u201d insights into their recent initiatives can provide a strategic advantage.\n\nExploring Strategic Diversification\n\nComcast has announced plans to diversify its holdings by investing in sustainable technology. This decision marks a shift in the company\u2019s focus from traditional cable and internet services to a broader embrace of green energy solutions. The company\u2019s move towards sustainable tech aims to capture the rapidly growing market of environmentally conscious consumers and investors, potentially boosting its long-term financial outlook.\n\nImpact on Stock Performance\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies that pivot towards sustainability have shown positive growth, attracting new investor demographics interested in ethical investing. As Comcast ventures into this arena, analysts predict a potential uptick in stock prices driven by increased demand for sustainable investment options.\n\nWhat This Means for Investors\n\nFor current and potential investors, monitoring Comcast\u2019s execution on this initiative is crucial. While the immediate impact on the stock may be speculative, the long-term benefits could translate into substantial profits. Keeping abreast of Comcast\u2019s developments and market reactions will be vital in making informed investment decisions regarding this evolving opportunity.\n\nIn summary, Comcast\u2019s strategic move towards sustainable technology presents a fresh perspective on its stock with potential growth. Investors should stay informed and consider the long-term implications of these changes.\n\nComcast\u2019s Green Leap: How Their Sustainable Investments Could Transform the Industry\n\nIn an era where sustainability has become a critical focus for both consumers and businesses, Comcast\u2019s recent announcement to invest in sustainable technology presents a pivotal shift in its strategic approach. This article delves into the potential impact of Comcast\u2019s decision and what it means for investors and industry watchers.\n\nComcast\u2019s Sustainable Tech Initiative: A Closer Look\n\nComcast\u2019s foray into sustainable technology is not just a passing trend but a calculated move aligning with global shifts towards greener practices. This initiative could see the company expanding its portfolio into renewable energy solutions, eco-friendly product offerings, and sustainable infrastructure development.\n\nMarket Analysis: The Future of Green Investment\n\nCurrent trends indicate that companies prioritizing sustainability tend to attract attention from ethical investors, who are continually seeking opportunities that align with their values. As a result, there has been a consistent rise in green investment funds and environmentally focused ETFs. With Comcast entering this space, the company stands to gain from this growing investor interest.\n\nInnovation and Sustainability: A Win-Win\n\nOne of the major benefits Comcast can leverage from sustainable technology investment is innovation. By fostering green tech solutions, Comcast not only enhances its corporate responsibility profile but also taps into potentially lucrative business innovations that can lead to reductions in operational costs and increased efficiency.\n\nStrategic Implications for Investors\n\nFor investors, the implications of Comcast\u2019s shift are multifold. Beyond the potential for stock appreciation, investing in a company with a clear sustainability strategy could offer diversification benefits in a portfolio. As the company advances its green initiatives, investors should anticipate fluctuations in stock performance but may find long-term value in the ethical and sustainable aspects of their investments.\n\nPredictions and Future Trends\n\nAs Comcast embarks on this green journey, industry experts predict a ripple effect, encouraging more telecommunications giants to adopt sustainable practices. The focus on reducing carbon footprints, enhancing energy efficiency, and embracing the circular economy are likely to become standard practice across the industry in the years to come.\n\nComcast\u2019s pivot towards sustainability not only positions it at the forefront of industry change but also sets a precedent for adaptation and innovation in response to growing environmental concerns. For more information on Comcast\u2019s latest initiatives and performance, visit their official Comcast website.\n\nAs we observe these developments, it becomes imperative for investors and businesses alike to stay informed about the evolving landscape of sustainable investments and the opportunities they present.",

Let us know what you think. And we\u2019ll revisit this list at the end of the year.\n\nDeals will flow. Deal makers pretty much universally expect a flood of deals under President-elect Donald Trump after four years of pent-up activity under President Biden, whose antitrust enforcers challenged a record number of mergers. The more interesting question: Which kinds of companies will make those deals? More M.&A. in the energy sector seems probable, given Trump\u2019s support for the industry. Bank deals could also take off: After the regional banking crisis, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the country could benefit from more mergers. Deals may also pop up to address cybersecurity concerns, the impact of GLP-1 drugs and the fierce A.I race.\n\nMedia companies will reshuffle. Media executives and their advisers have been saying for years that the industry needs a drastic overhaul to address its new reality: an overabundance of streaming options and the decline of the legacy cable industry. Deals that were effectively considered a no-go under Biden\u2019s aggressive antitrust enforcers may finally be given a green light under a Trump administration.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s effort to impose fresh net neutrality rules on internet service providers, one of the first cases in which a court has wielded the post-Chevron interpretative powers the Supreme Court granted federal judges last year.\n\nIn Ohio Telecom Association vs. FCC, a three-judge panel of the Ohio-based court cited the 2024 Loper Bright ruling extensively in its Thursday ruling that set aside the FCC\u2019s \u201cheavy-handed regulatory regime.\u201d The court sided with ISPs who objected to being classified as telecommunications services providers and not as information services.\n\nNet neutrality supporters say the rule protects consumers by preventing ISPs from varying access speeds or blocking access to, or favoring, certain sites. The circuit\u2019s ruling likely ends efforts dating to the Barack Obama administration for a federal neutrality policy governing major ISPs such as AT&T, Comcast, Spectrum and Verizon Communications.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Sixth Circuit specifically noted that it would \u201cno longer afford deference\u201d to the FCC\u2019s reading of the 1996 Telecommunications Act given the Loper Bright Enterprises ruling, which ended four decades of courts deferring to regulators\u2019 interpretation of vague wording in federal laws.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s stance on classifying ISPs as telecommunications or information providers has alternated over the past decade, depending on the political party in power, the court noted. \u201cApplying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC\u2019s vacillations,\u201d the panel wrote.\n\nThe ruling restores the status quo for internet providers that was in place during the first Donald Trump administration, which in 2018 rescinded the neutrality policy adopted under President Barack Obama. The court also applied the same standard to mobile broadband providers, preventing the FCC from imposing net-neutrality rules on them.\n\nThe Biden administration last year restored the rule with its Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet Order, leading to litigation by a variety of ISPs.\n\nThe DC Circuit had upheld both FCC postures on ISP regulation in previous litigation, in 2015 and 2018, citing \u201cpermissible\u201d approaches given the deference afforded by the 1984 Chevron ruling.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision represents \u201ca major setback\u201d for consumers and competition, the advocacy group Public Knowledge said Thursday in a statement. The organization, which supports open networks and affordable communications, filed a brief in support of the FCC\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cIn rejecting the FCC\u2019s authority to classify broadband as a telecommunications service, the court has ignored decades of precedent and fundamentally misunderstood both the technical realities of how broadband works and Congress\u2019 clear intent in the Communications Act,\u201d the group\u2019s legal director, John Bergmayer, said.\n\n\u201cThe court has created a dangerous regulatory gap that leaves consumers vulnerable and gives broadband providers unchecked power over Americans' internet access.\u201d\n\nThe ISPs\u2019 trade group, US Telecom, said the ruling will give consumers \u201cmore investment, innovation and competition\u201d in internet access. \u201cSince the birth of the internet, bipartisan Administrations and policymakers have recognized the virtues of a light-touch approach to broadband regulation,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nAfter the ruling, FCC Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to write \u201copen internet principles\u201d into law. Commissioner Brendan Carr, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the commission, praised the ruling as \u201ca good win for the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the appellate court invalidated President Biden\u2019s Internet power grab by striking down these unlawful Title II regulations,\u201d Carr said in a statement. \u201cBut the work to unwind the Biden Administration\u2019s regulatory overreach will continue.\u201d\n\nMajor ISPs will likely not use the lighter regulation afforded by the ruling to advantage their own products and services as such efforts could run afoul of antitrust and competition laws, said Aaron Tifft, a partner with Oklahoma-based Hall Estill who focuses on real estate and communications areas.\n\nThe \u201clighter touch\u201d regulatory approach for internet providers under Title 1 vs. Title 2 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act \u201chas given us an internet system that\u2019s highly robust and I expect that to continue and develop,\u201d Tifft said.",

            "content": "Streaming is up; TV is down.\n\nThose contrasting trends were behind the two biggest corporate deals in the media and entertainment space unveiled in 2024: Skydance Media\u2019s coming takeover of Paramount Global and Comcast\u2019s planned spinoff of most of its cable networks.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery signaled that it, too, would swing into the M&A dance in 2025. The company in December said it would reorganize into two divisions: one comprising its streaming business (plus HBO) and production studios and the other composed of the rest of its cable TV networks.\n\nAnd the erosion of pay TV was behind an M&A event that didn\u2019t happen \u2014 DirecTV\u2019s offer to acquire Dish Network, to gain economies of scale as both try to adapt to new streaming realities. DirecTV scrapped the pact in November after Dish bondholders refused to exchange their existing debt for a discounted rate under the DirecTV terms.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe through line in each case? These are companies \u201ctrying to shift their strategic positioning from defense to offense,\u201d says Christopher Vollmer, managing director at MediaLink and partner at parent company UTA. In other words, Hollywood players are looking to strengthen their ability to compete in a streaming-centric world.\n\nIn 2025, with the Trump 2.0 administration expected to be friendlier to big mergers than under Biden, the stage is set for more dealmaking. \u201cThe overwhelming mood is positive from an M&A perspective,\u201d Vollmer says. \u201cPeople are looking to kick off M&A activity in the first quarter of 2025.\u201d\n\nWBD chief David Zaslav is clearly eyeing some kind of transaction. The reorg, expected to be complete by midyear, will \u201ccreate opportunities as we evaluate all avenues to deliver significant shareholder value,\u201d he said \u2014 prompting speculation that the company could sell or spin off CNN, TBS, TNT and other nets. Zaslav told analysts on Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s Q3 earnings call that the new administration \u201cmay offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different, that would provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nFor Skydance, headed by David Ellison, the imperative is to scale up Paramount\u2019s streaming biz and boost investment in original content, while slashing costs in the linear TV side of the house. The new owners of Skydance-Paramount could look to sell or spin off some of the TV portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe linear TV world, especially the cable world, is a declining business \u2014 but it still generates attractive financial results,\u201d says John Harrison, EY Americas growth leader for media and entertainment. \u201cPrivate equity loves that type of asset.\u201d\n\nComcast\u2019s hypothesis is that offloading NBCUniversal cable nets including CNBC, MSNBC and USA will let the company focus on growing Peacock and the Universal theme parks. The new \u201cSpinCo\u201d is angling to become a growth vehicle itself, by buying up other properties under the leadership of NBCU boss Mark Lazarus. But it remains to be seen how a company reliant on a shrinking base of TV subscribers can find significant areas of expansion.\n\nAnother factor that could spur media deals is the enormous amount of uninvested capital looking for prime investments. Global private equity and venture capital funds held a record $2.62 trillion of total uncommitted capital (referred to as \u201cdry powder\u201d in the industry) as of July 10, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence and Preqin data.\n\nShort of acquisitions, industry observers see another potential scenario that would alter the media landscape: a joint venture between two streaming services. WBD and Comcast have explored a Peacock-Max combo, while Jeff Shell, the ex-NBCU chief who\u2019s set to become president of Skydance-Paramount, said the new company is open to partnerships to create \u201cthe ultimate [streaming] bundle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rationalization of the streaming sector has been telegraphed,\u201d Harrison says. But, he adds, forming such a JV is \u201ca super-complex negotiation, and I think that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen that in the U.S. yet.\u201d\n\nConsumers are feeling \u201csubscription fatigue,\u201d topping out at an average of four video streaming services, says Jana Arbanas, principal in Deloitte\u2019s risk and financial advisory practice. A streaming JV, if executed well, could cut churn and maximize return on content spending. There\u2019s a sense of urgency in the industry, she says: \u201cPeople are looking for results quickly.\u201d",

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Houston?\n\nAT&T Fiber is the best internet service provider in Houston, thanks to its symmetrical download and upload speeds and high customer satisfaction scores. Plans start at $55 and go up to $245 for the 5-gig plan. However, AT&T Fiber doesn't cover all Houston addresses, so Xfinity and Verizon 5G Home Internet are also quality options to consider if you're outside of AT&T's service area.\n\nIf you want the cheapest internet plans in Houston, there are some solid options, too. The cheapest ISP in Houston is Astound Broadband, offering a $20-a-month plan. Astound's service comes with a 300-megabit-per-second connection.\n\nAT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber and local internet provider Tachus Fiber offer the fastest internet speed in Houston. Each provider boasts 5 gigabits of symmetrical speed, costing $245, $130 and $180, respectively.\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Houston\n\nBeyond the three picks above, several other broadband choices exist in the Houston metro area. Some can be found only in small pockets of the city, while others are mainly located in the city suburbs. There are some compelling choices here, even though they're not as widely available.\n\nAstound Broadband: This cable internet provider, known regionally as Grande, offers some of Houston's most competitive starting rates. Its starting price of $20 a month for a 300Mbps plan comes out to an affordable 6 cents per Mbps. The rub is that Astound's price increases are some of the steepest in the industry.\n\nBrightspeed: You'll want to research this because, depending on your location, you may be dealing with mostly DSL coverage for the Houston area (which can be as low as 20Mbps), or if you're in the Kingwood area, you might see the company's much more compelling fiber product.\n\nFrontier Communications: Frontier has a scattered presence in the greater Houston area. You won't find it downtown, but you can get its DSL and fiber-optic service in the northeast outskirts of Baytown, Beach City, Cove and Crosby. You'll also find it in the southern portion of the metro area in League City and Sante Fe. If Frontier Fiber is available -- it features symmetrical plans of 200Mbps, 500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps, 5Gbps or 7Gbps speeds ranging from $30 to $300 per month for the first year -- it's a very appealing choice. If Frontier DSL is your only option, try other alternatives.\n\nKinetic by Windstream: This DSL and fiber provider is available in just a few small pockets within the Houston city limits. Most of that availability is in the southern suburb of Sugar Land. You'll mostly deal with its DSL service rather than the faster fiber-optic plans.\n\nOptimum: First off, I can imagine you might be confused. Suddenlink is the provider you're probably familiar with in the Houston area. Its parent company, Altice USA, renamed it Optimum in 2022. In any case, Optimum service is scattered lightly throughout the metro area but has a heavier density north of the city in Conroe and Kingwood. This cable ISP is notable for its highly competitive starting rates, some of the most affordable in the area.\n\nSpectrum: Charter Communications' ISP has some of the more customer-friendly, straightforward terms you'll find for cable internet service. There are no contracts, no data caps and a free modem rental included in your monthly price, ranging from $50 to $70. It also includes free access to Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. Spectrum service is limited in the city center of Houston. You can find coverage north of the city, mainly in Magnolia, Spring, Tomball and The Woodlands.\n\nTachus: This local ISP, founded in 2018, is notable for its community presence and commitment to building 100% fiber-to-the-home networks within the greater Houston metropolitan area. It's now available to over 50,000 homes in Atascocita, Conroe, East Montgomery County, Kingwood, Magnolia, Oak Ridge County North and The Woodlands. There are five fiber plans, depending on what is available at your location, -- 300Mbps, 600Mbps, 1Gbps, 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps -- ranging from $65 to $180 a month, with no data caps and no contracts. A modem rental is included in the monthly price, but you'll need to provide your own router or rent one for as low as $6 per month.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet: T-Mobile uses its 5G and 4G LTE networks to power its fixed wireless home internet product, which is available to over 50 million homes nationwide and approximately 55% of residents in the greater Houston area. Check your address on the T-Mobile site\n\nGetty Images\n\nCheap internet options in Houston\n\nThe average starting price for internet service in Houston is just over $46 a month, but a few providers offer plans cheaper than that.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nAstound Broadband offers the lowest starting price in Houston. Astound Broadband's $20 plan grants download speeds up to 300Mbps and includes your equipment rental. Xfinity also offers a $20-a-month plan that gets you 150Mbps speeds.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan in Houston?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Houston\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Houston depend on what discounts are available during a given time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nHouston internet providers, such as Xfinity, Astound Broadband, Spectrum and Optimum, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Houston broadband?\n\nHouston, we have a problem. Although it's one of the top five most populated metros in the US, H-Town couldn't crack the top 50 on Ookla's list of the country's fastest cities for broadband. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nPer the speed-testing site's most recent reporting, Houston managed to clock in at only No. 58. By contrast, its fellow Lone Star State cities of Austin, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio all placed in the top 15. Other Texas towns that placed higher on the speed chart -- adding insult to injury -- include Arlington, Garland, Irving, Lubbock, Laredo and Plano. Some small consolation: Houston finished well ahead of Dallas, which was in the bottom 3.\n\nSome Houstonians may have access to the splashy 5Gbps plans from AT&T and Frontier which cost $245 and $130 per month, respectively, and even the 7Gbps plan from Frontier for $300 per month.\n\nFastest internet plans in Houston\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Houston\n\nSee all results for internet providers in Texas.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Houston\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on Houston internet providers?\n\nHouston offers several high-speed internet choices. You can get hooked up with home internet from fast fiber options, including AT&T, Frontier and local internet service provider Tachus. You could hop online via cable connections from Optimum and Spectrum. You could join the 5G home internet movement by trying Verizon 5G Home Internet or T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nComcast's cable internet offering of Xfinity has Houston covered with the most extensive availability across the metro area. As we say in our CNET home internet reviews, a fiber internet connection outperforms cable almost every time. If you can access a fiber provider in the area -- including AT&T Fiber, Consolidated Communications, Frontier Fiber or Tachus -- don't hesitate to sign on the virtual dotted line.\n\nBest internet providers in Houston FAQs\n\nWhich internet service provider has the most coverage in Houston? More than a dozen different ISPs are in the greater Houston metro, including satellite internet providers like Hughesnet, Starlink and Viasat (all three are available to 100% of the area, according to the FCC). Besides those satellite providers, Xfinity covers the most extensive area. You can find Comcast's cable service as far as Conroe to the north, East Bernard to the west, Baytown to the east, and Freeport and Galveston to the south. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet available in Houston? Yes. You can find fiber internet throughout H-Town. Houston's top fiber internet providers include AT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber and Tachus Fiber. It should also be noted that a small percentage of Xfinity locations are also eligible for fiber service, but it first requires a site survey to ascertain if the address is serviceable. Show more",

Construction is underway on a $500 million build at Warner Bros. Ranch, and Comcast is pouring $1 billion into Universal City.\n\nTelevision City is poised to expand as well: The L.A. City Council is expected to give final approval to a $1 billion makeover on Jan. 7. The project has been in the works for years. Hackman Capital Partners bought the Fairfax District lot from CBS in 2018, and submitted its application to the city in 2021 \u2014 when production was a lot healthier.\n\nBut the developer says it believes the downturn is temporary.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cWe are confident these cycles will work themselves out and Los Angeles will continue to be the global capital of media,\u201d says Zach Sokoloff, who is overseeing the project and Hackman\u2019s upgrade of the Radford lot in Studio City. \u201cWhen we talk to our customers, they want to film in L.A.\u201d\n\nTelevision City is set to grow to at least 15 stages, including eight new state-of-the-art spaces.

            "content": "An appellate court has overturned the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules. So, what is net neutrality and what does it mean for you?\n\nWhat is net neutrality?\n\nNet neutrality rules require broadband internet providers to treat all internet traffic equally, preventing companies like Comcast and Verizon from favoring some websites and apps over others. The rules mean internet companies can't block or slow down certain websites or sell fast lanes that prioritize one website over another in exchange for payment.\n\nBig telecommunications companies have fought these rules in court, arguing that they should be able to control the services they built and own. Broadband companies that are a part of America's Communications Association called the ruling this week a \"victory.\"\n\n\"[Our members] can now strengthen their focus on offering people faster speeds, more affordable prices, and quality service without the threat of utility-style Federal regulations hampering their investments,\" their statement said.\n\nIn 2015, under former President Barack Obama's administration, the FCC approved net neutrality rules on a party-line vote, making sure cable and phone companies don't manipulate traffic. The rules were later rescinded under President-elect Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules. Then, this year, Democrats gained a majority of the FCC. The commission voted in April along party lines to restore net neutrality rules.\n\nWhat does the net neutrality ruling mean?\n\nThe ruling this week from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals says the FCC doesn't have the authority to classify broadband as a \"telecommunications' service,\" essentially saying the FCC doesn't have the power to enforce the net neutrality rules set by its order in April.\n\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n\nBrendan Carr, who President-elect Donald Trump tapped to serve as FCC commissioner, celebrated the decision on social media, writing on the platform X: \"While the work to unwind the Biden Admin\u2019s regulatory overreach will continue, this is a good win.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, however, argues that the net neutrality rules keep the internet open, free and unrestricted, preventing internet companies from controlling what people can access online.\n\n\"Today\u2019s ruling to overturn net neutrality will have a devastating effect on free speech online,\" said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, on Thursday.",

It now joins with Starlink, Google Fiber, T-Mobile, and Verizon as the top five national internet providers with the most satisfied customers.\n\nMost companies in this group are 5G and fiber internet providers, while Xfinity is the only exception as a cable internet provider.\n\nCableTV.com attributes the increase in Xfinity\u2019s score not to prices \u2014 which were mostly unchanged \u2014 but to internet performance and value. The company introduced higher speeds to its budget and mid-tier plans. It also launched a bundle called StreamSaver.\n\nThe survey of nearly 9,000 internet users in the U.S., also found that younger internet users are much more likely to choose a bundled internet/cell phone plan than older users (67% of Gen Z internet subscribers compared with 48% of Millennials and 36% each of Gen X and Baby Boomers).\n\nTo compose the customer satisfaction award rankings, the survey asked respondents questions such as: What is your overall satisfaction with your internet service provider? How satisfied are you with your ISP\u2019s customer support? Given your ISP\u2019s internet service quality, how would you rate the price that you pay for them?\n\nThe top 10 providers and their overall customer satisfaction scores are:\n\nStarlink (94%) Google Fiber (83%) T-Mobile (80%) Xfinity (80%) Verizon (79%) Metronet (77%) Armstrong (73%) AT&T (73%) Spectrum (71%) Sparklight (70%)\n\nT-Mobile, Google Fiber, Starlink and Verizon also ranked in the top five for overall customer satisfaction in last year\u2019s awards survey.\n\nThe five leading internet providers with the top customer support teams are: Google Fiber (82%), Starlink (80%), T-Mobile (78%), Armstrong (which is new to the top five list this year, 76%), and Verizon (74%).\n\nThe survey showed that Spectrum, Comcast Xfinity, and AT&T finished in the middle of the results for best customer support. In fact, AT&T dipped below the study\u2019s 70% \u201capproval threshold\u201d for the second consecutive year, the survey said.\n\nMore than 60% of respondents were highly satisfied with the cost of their internet service in this year\u2019s survey.The top-rated providers for price were Google Fiber (80%), T-Mobile (78%), Starlink (77%), Metronet (72%), and Armstrong (71%).\n\n\u201cStarlink\u2019s high base price tag knocked it out of first place, although not by much \u2014 its 77% approval mark was only 3% behind Google Fiber and a point away from T-Mobile,\u201d the customer satisfaction award survey said. \u201cSimilarly, Google\u2019s hardly the most affordable ISP thanks to pricing that starts at $70.00 monthly.\u201d\n\nBased on the survey\u2019s results, CableTV.com surmised that respondents largely value performance and reliability over price. This point was based cable providers such as WOW and Xfinity, which are less expensive than Google Fiber and Starlink, having scored far behind both providers. It said that T-Mobile\u2019s ability to combine cable internet reliability with flat-rate pricing helped it take second place.\n\nCableTV.com said this year it changed its methodology affecting regional ISPs by raising its minimum sample group size to 100 respondents. This change ultimately removed additional providers such as Quantum Fiber, Ziply and Earthlink.\n\nAlthough AT&T ranked eighth in overall customer satisfaction in the CableTV.com survey awards, it led fiber broadband providers in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Telecommunications Study 2024 with a score of 80 (out of 100).",

To that end, InsightFinder AI integrates its real-time machine learning algorithms into clients\u2019 IT systems.\n\nThe North Carolina-based company is far from the only startup leveraging artificial intelligence to support its customers. Robin AI, headquartered in London, has used AI to supplement lawyers\u2019 workload since its founding in 2019.\n\nBoth companies prioritize best practices for enterprise adoption, which involves integrating new technologies into large organizations\u2019 existing operations, ensuring effective use through planning, training, change management and ongoing support.\n\nAs part of the Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs Accelerator program\u2019s cohort in the spring of 2024, InsightFinder AI and Robin AI explored automated technology\u2019s potential at large-scale businesses. The program connects strategically relevant startups from around the world with Comcast to explore partnerships that impact the ways they work and the products and experiences they deliver to their customers and employees.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a real shift in the market, from big enterprises wanting to sort of learn and increase their awareness of AI to now moving to this period of adoption and implementation,\u201d said Lauren Watson, Robin AI\u2019s head of product marketing.\n\nSince its conception, InsightFinder AI has set out to tackle one of the most pressing issues in IT management: the efficiency and reliability of IT systems. The company\u2019s mission is to empower clients, many of whom are Fortune 500 companies, with full visibility into their IT infrastructures, Gu said. This year the company is expanding its focus to include monitoring and management of large-scale AI models.\n\nAt the core of the company\u2019s technology is its Unified Intelligence Engine (UIE), leveraging unsupervised machine learning algorithms to automatically fit various customer environments. After identifying potential issues, InsightFinder AI sends real-time notifications to clients\u2019 IT operators through their preferred channels, such as Slack or email, helping to reduce mean time to detection and resolution (MTTD and MTTR) as well as preventing outages that could lead to substantial operational breakdowns.\n\nInsightFinder AI aims to create a more reliable IT ecosystem, allowing operators to focus on impactful tasks rather than constant troubleshooting, Gu said.\n\n\u201cInsightFinder AI is here to reduce inefficiencies, and even better, prevent them from occurring in the first place,\u201d she added.\n\nSimilarly, Robin AI is working to modernize the legal tech industry by eliminating mundane, repetitive tasks for lawyers, particularly those in the commercial sector. The start-up fundraised $51 million in 2024, including a $26 million Series B round announced in January 2024 and $25 million secured outside of traditional funding rounds. In November 2024, Robin AI announced that a group of customers and existing investors helped raise the latter sum, including PayPal Ventures and Cambridge University. Other customers of Robin AI include Pepsico, PwC, Yum! Brands, AlbaCore Capital Group and BlueEarth Capital.\n\nRobin AI streamlines the process of managing contracts, a time-consuming yet critical aspect of any business. Managing them efficiently can save enterprises significant amounts of time and money, according to Watson.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity to save not just hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions of dollars through being able to accelerate deals, through getting contracts signed and negotiated faster, through being able to spot opportunities where productivity can be enhanced in the legal team,\u201d she added.\n\nLauren Watson. (Courtesy Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs)\n\nIn line with this mission, Robin AI launched its Reports Builder tool in September 2024. This tool, which is built on advanced AI and natural language processing, has significant use cases for large enterprises, Watson said.\n\nImagine an attorney needing to check ESG provisions or ensure compliance with specific data protection regulations. Reports Builder enables users to extract and synthesize key information from thousands of documents without manually reading each one. Its functionality extends to M&A transactions, for which traditionally reviewing hundreds of thousands of agreements could cost millions in external counsel fees. However, with Robin AI\u2019s technology, lawyers can efficiently manage these tasks.\n\n\u201cThis is about humans empowered by AI. Lawyers have unique skill sets, and we\u2019re developing tools that enable them to be more successful and productive,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThis can help lawyers to operate at the top of their license and not do the routine legal work that they didn\u2019t spend years studying for.\u201d\n\nRobin AI and InisghtFinder\u2019s human impact\n\nFor Robin AI, enterprise adoption is not just about putting money back in the pockets of their large clients. It\u2019s about saving time so their users have more hours in the day for their lives outside of work, Watson said.\n\nShe added that she found legal teams can be overworked and under-resourced, but Robin AI\u2019s tools create space for a better work-life balance.\n\n\u201cOur tools enhance productivity, but if we look at what that actually impacts, it means you can go home and have dinner with your kids instead of being in the office all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nGu, similarly, thinks often about the overwhelming workload of IT teams, many of whom perform mission-critical tasks for their organizations.\n\nHer hope for InsightFinder AI is that it creates a robust, automatic system that can prevent sporadic issues, creating more space in IT teams\u2019 lives for high-value projects and rest outside of business hours.\n\n\u201cOur ideal goal is that we also want our operators to have a life, right? They don\u2019t need to do firefighting 24/7 during holidays or during late nights. We want to give time back to people,\u201d Gu said.\n\nUsing real-life experience to inform enterprise adoption\n\nBoth Gu and Watson apply lessons learned from past experiences in their day-to-day roles.\n\nPrior to Gu\u2019s journey as a startup founder, she worked on IBM TJ Watson Research Center\u2019s distributed stream processing system, which is a technology that handles high-volume data streams across various end-users and applications in real time. It eventually became the IBM InfoSphere Stream product.\n\nThis early-career experience at IBM inspired Gu\u2019s research on machine learning for distributed system reliability, which is the foundation of InsightFinder AI.\n\nGu was also a visiting scientist at Google in 2015, helping the tech giant evaluate the patented unsupervised behavior learning algorithm she co-invented. Google licensed it because of its accuracy on real system failure data, and Gu was able to deploy her technology on a massive, cloud-based scale, preparing her for InsightFinder AI\u2019s launch in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe AI engine can constantly learn and become smarter. Our AI platform is organically growing, and we aggregate a lot of knowledge to help people extract insights out of massive amounts of data,\u201d Gu said, \u201cIt becomes more powerful to learn how to operate IT systems and AI models and also improves efficiency.\u201d\n\nHelen Gu. (Courtesy Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs)\n\nWith prior experience as a lawyer and legal tech professional, Watson relies on her empathy when helping organizations facing massive change management issues. Watson understands that law is a particularly risk-averse industry, so lawyers adapting to unfamiliar tools is an uphill battle. She said it\u2019s all about making the technology approachable. For example, Robin AI built an add-in for Microsoft Word that enables lawyers to work alongside AI, rather than having to learn how to use a different application.\n\nThis reduces barriers and enables them to benefit from AI without dramatically changing their processes, Watson said.\n\nGu\u2019s and Watson\u2019s pragmatic approaches to ideation and incremental tech deployment show that enterprise adoption doesn\u2019t mean overhauling all of an organization\u2019s systems in one day.\n\nMost successful enterprise adoption tactics are predicated on a step-by-step approach to showcase all that AI can accomplish, Watson said.\n\n\u201cSuccess is a combination of making the change management piece as straightforward as possible,\u201d Watson added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s through delivering simple, intuitive tools that employees are happy to use because they\u2019re easily integrated into their day-to-day workflow.\u201d",

Last April, the FCC reimplemented net neutrality rules in a 3-2 vote among commissioners that was along party lines, with the agency\u2019s two Republican commissioners dissenting.\n\nThe reinstatement invited a challenge from telecoms and their public interest groups, who complained that the FCC lacked authority to regulate broadband and wireless ISPs as telecommunications services following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that effectively overturned the Chevron doctrine.\n\nOn Thursday, the Sixth Circuit appeals court agreed with the telecoms, finding that the FCC improperly regulated broadband and wireless ISPs as telecommunications services, when they really should have been relegated as information services.\n\nJessica Rosenworcel, the current chair of the FCC who is resigning later this month, issued a statement following the order that urged Congress to act on the matter.\n\n\u201cConsumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open and fair,\u201d Rosenworcel said. \u201cWith this decision, it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality and put open internet principles in federal law.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, telecom advocacy groups are applauding the Sixth Circuit decision.\n\n\u201cOur fight to stop the government\u2019s unwarranted internet takeover has resulted in a major victory for ACA Connects Members,\u201d said Grant Spellmeyer, the President of ACA Connects, which represents small, medium-sized and rural area broadband ISPs and other telecommunications firms. \u201cThey can now strengthen their focus on offering people faster speeds, more affordable prices, and quality service without the threat of utility-style Federal regulations hampering their investments.\u201d",

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Comcast (CMCSA), which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this cable provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.33%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Comcast came out with earnings of $1.12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 per share, representing a surprise of 5.66%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.21 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.01%.\n\nFor Comcast, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nComcast currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.43%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 30, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

According to MSG's press release, Optimum had already raised its core TV package, the one that includes sports, from $95 to $140/month, a nearly 50% increase for viewers. The latest package that included MSG would now be offered at $160/month.\n\nMSG released the below statement:\n\n\"As a last-ditch effort to save their struggling business at the expense of subscribers, Altice is trying to charge their customers more and give them less. They just raised prices \u2013 nearly 50% for current Optimum subscribers and 70% for new Optimum subscribers (after expiration of a promotional offer) for the package that had included MSG Networks \u2013 and cut access to the Knicks, Rangers, Islanders, Devils and more on MSG Networks. We offered Altice a number of fair and reasonable proposals that called for Altice to pay us less than last year. Altice rejected all of them, including our offer to keep MSG Networks on the air while we continued to try to reach a deal. We remain ready to negotiate in good faith.\"\n\nThe network is encouraging its Optimum subscribers to visit KEEPMSG.com for more information, including how to switch providers or find other options for watching MSG Networks' award-winning programming. One such option is the Gotham Sports App, which has an annual price of $359.99 and includes the YES Network for New York Yankees games.

Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Optimum subscribers flipping to MSG \u2013 which also broadcasts Islanders and Devils games \u2013 were greeted with a blue screen telling them: \u201cMSG Networks is no longer available on your TV lineup.\u201d\n\nThe Altice-owned cable operator went on to tout a QR code and a web address that offer \u201coptions to ensure\u201d they don\u2019t miss any Knicks, Rangers, Islanders or Devils action.\n\nThat option is a 30% discount if they subscribe to the streaming service Fubo, which carries MSG Networks, as long as they keep Optimum\u2019s internet service.\n\nThe blackout immediately impacted Devils and Knicks games scheduled on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nOptimum also issued a scathing message Wednesday aimed at MSGN, which is led by Knicks and Rangers owner James Dolan.\n\n\u201cMSG Networks demanded that we pay an exorbitant amount in fees to be able to carry its content and that customers who don\u2019t want the content \u2013 who are the majority \u2013 have to pay for it anyway,\u201d Optimum said.\n\n5 Optimum subscribers were greeted with message Wednesday informing them that MSG Networks is no longer available.\n\n\u201cDespite this, Optimum offered to absorb their egregious price demands if we could package MSG Networks in a way that would give more flexibility and control to our customers. \u2026 MSG Networks said no and refused multiple offers from us to reach a deal.\u201d\n\nMSGN issued a rebuttal in its own New Year\u2019s Day statement: \u201cThis is a pure and simple price gauge from Altice. An attempt to add over $10 dollars a month right to their bottom line. In essence a $10 dollar rate increase on top of a 50 % rate increase.\u201d\n\nThe company also said that it had \u201coffered Altice a number of fair and reasonable proposals that called for Altice to pay us less than last year. Altice rejected all of them, including our offer to keep MSG Networks on the air while we continued to try to reach a deal. We remain ready to negotiate in good faith.\u201d\n\nIn an odd bit of irony, the Knicks owner is feuding with the company founded in 1973 by his dad, cable pioneer Charles Dolan, and then called Cablevision. It was sold, along with the Optimum brand, to European telecom giant Altice for $17.7 billion in 2016. Charles Dolan died last weekend at age 98.\n\nOptimum subscribers, meanwhile, were furious over losing access to their beloved teams.\n\n5 New York Rangers fans will not be able to see their team play on Optimum. Neil Miller\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care whose fault it is now that MSG has gone dark on Optimum,\u201d Lou Panico of Manalapan, NJ fumed. \u201cAs usual the consumer is caught in the middle between two greedy, dishonest entities.\u201d\n\nMSGN was willing to move from the basic Optimum tier where it was getting a roughly $10-per-subscriber fee in 2024, according to a source close to the negotiations.\n\nThat\u2019s about the same rate that national sports giant ESPN charges cable companies.\n\nThe move from basic cable to a premiere tier could hit debt-saddled MSGN\u2019s bottom line by as much as 50%, since the majority of Optimum\u2019s roughly 1 million subscribers in the New York City area would no longer pay for the channel, an RSN executive working for another network told The Post.\n\nOptimum does face the risk also of losing subscribers to rival cable companies like Charter Communications and Verizon\u2019s Fios, which has a deal to carry MSG on basic cable.\n\nDolan recently negotiated a new deal with a major New York-area cable company in which it was moved off the basic tier and accepted lower overall revenue in return for a longer pact, two sources familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nHowever, Optimum is the only cable option in large swathes of the city, and once the hard-core sports fans jump ship it may be in no hurry to return to the negotiating table, a source said.\n\n5 James Dolan\u2019s MSG Networks could be forced into bankruptcy if the channel is dropped by Optimum, a source said. Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nAltice could decide to play hardball and threaten to drop the channel to extract better terms from MSGN.\n\n\u201cWhen you drop an RSN, you lose about 5% of your customers but your revenue increases nearly 20% since you save money by not paying for that channel,\u201d the RSN executive said.\n\nThe impasse could exacerbate the overall trend of cord-cutting that has eaten away at cable\u2019s dominance over the past decade.\n\nIn 2023, MSGN Networks launched a streaming service priced at $29.99 a month. Last year, it teamed with the YES Network, home of the Yankees and Nets, on the Gotham Sports app, which costs $41.99 a month if one combines YES and MSG. Customers can still just get MSG for $29.99.\n\nMSGN has been in a protracted standoff with Comcast for more than two years, impacting subscribers in New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nBut an extended fight with Optimum could force MSGN into bankruptcy, sources said.\n\nThe network, which is part of publicly-traded Sphere Entertainment, has been in default on $830 million in loans since October and has a forbearance agreement with its lenders that expires Jan. 10.\n\n5 New York Rangers fans in some Optimum regions may switch to Verizon\u2019s Fios. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post\n\nThe debt on that loan is trading at five cents on the dollar, the RSN executive said.\n\n\u201cA full drop would ultimately bankrupt MSG Networks,\u201d media analyst LightShed Partners said in a report this week.\n\nMSGN is losing money party because it is paying $187 million in 2025 to broadcast Knicks and Rangers games as part of a 20-year agreement that ends in 2035, according to public filings.\n\nBut the revenue MSGN gets from cable providers, in deals that have much shorter time frames, is falling.\n\nIf MSGN was pushed into bankruptcy, it could renegotiate with the Knicks and Rangers and likely pay much lower rights fees to reflect the new RSN market, the RSN executive said.\n\nAn MSGN bankruptcy would not necessarily be bad for Dolan, who controls both Sphere Entertainment and Madison Square Garden Sports, the parent company of the Knicks, Rangers and operator of the World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.\n\nHe would take a hit from reduced rights fees for the Knicks and Rangers.\n\nBut cleaving away MSGN would likely boost Sphere Entertainment, which also includes the $2.3 billion futuristic Las Vegas music mecca.\n\n\u201cThis would be good news for Sphere shareholders,\u201d LightShed said. \u201cRemoving the $830 million in MSG Networks debt from Sphere\u2019s balance sheet should mean a significant increase in Sphere\u2019s stock price.\n\nMSG Networks declined comment about its financial status.",

The Islanders and Rangers follow with games on Thursday night.\n\nFans have more alternatives for watching games after MSG went dark on Optimum at midnight, including direct-to-consumer streaming options.\n\nMSG programming can be purchased through the Gotham Sports app for $279.99 per year, $29.99 per month or $9.95 per game. (The YES Network also is available through the app and can be purchased along with MSG at a higher cost.)\n\nFor households in Altice\u2019s geographical footprint, MSG also can be accessed via Verizon Fios, DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and fuboTV. MSG lists consumers\u2019 options based on zip code at the website \u201ckeepmsg.com.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, such squabbles are settled before the deadline or shortly thereafter, but the process has grown more fraught as regional sports networks such as MSG and cable distributors such as Altice deal with the shrinking universe of traditional cable bundle subscribers.\n\nComcast dropped MSG more than three years ago, which affected some homes in New Jersey and Connecticut. But Altice, the dominant cable distributor on Long Island, would be a far bigger blow to MSG\u2019s overall distribution.\n\nThe two sides both issued statements on Monday night, each accusing the other of being unreasonable. As of early Tuesday afternoon, the sides remained at odds in negotiations.",

(Getty Images) \u00b7 Ershov_Maks via Getty Images\n\nThose moves have already begun to materialize. Late in 2024, Comcast (CMCSA) said it would spin off most of its cable properties into a new company after teasing the possibility just a few weeks prior. At the time, Comcast said it wanted to \"play offense\" in order to combat increased cord-cutting.\n\nWall Street analysts have said Comcast's spun-off company could acquire other beaten-down cable properties, describing it as a positive development for competitors exposed to traditional networks, like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).\n\nTo that point, shortly after Comcast's announcement, WBD also said it would undergo a corporate restructuring to separate its legacy networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, HGTV, and the Food Network, from growth drivers like studios and its streaming platform Max.\n\n\"It appears we are closer to the tipping point given the combination of secular and cyclical challenges,\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients on Dec. 19.\n\nWhy consolidation 'is needed'\n\nMost streaming platforms are finally profitable or, at the very least, close to break-even. But the demise of the cable bundle is still a complicated mess for legacy players looking to survive in a new digital-first era.\n\nFor years, linear advertising and affiliate fees, or the fees pay-TV providers pay to network owners to carry their channels, had consistently boosted revenues for legacy media. But the shift to streaming saw cable subscribers decline, hurting affiliate revenue.",

The company is slated to reveal its earnings on January 30, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Comcast to post earnings of $0.88 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.76%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $31.64 billion, indicating a 1.23% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $4.25 per share and a revenue of $123.46 billion, indicating changes of +6.78% and +1.56%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Comcast. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.21% lower. Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Comcast's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 8.8. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.84.\n\nInvestors should also note that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 1.42 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Cable Television industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.73.",

            "content": "In 2022, the stocks of Netflix and most Hollywood studios fell to earth. Then in 2023, major media and technology players had another grim year with investors as faith in streaming took another hit. But in 2024, signs of progress in streaming business profitability and renewed M&A talk helped the stocks of some of the sector biggies.\n\nAnd heading into 2025, some on Wall Street are striking optimistic tones. \u201cFor 2025, we are generally bullish on media,\u201d wrote Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich in a Dec. 19 preview of the new year.\n\n\u201cDare We Say We\u2019re Optimistic?\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote that same day in his 2025 preview. \u201cThis is the best we\u2019ve felt about the broader space since \u201921.\u201d\n\nWhy is that? \u201cMedia is in a more constructive place heading into 2025,\u201d he explained. \u201cLinear risks to ad and affiliate revenue have not abated, but we see meaningful strategic improvement in direct-to-consumer (DTC) performance. Sports is moving into streaming from ESPN and likely Fox, unlocking new market potential. We expect M&A will support valuations in TV broadcast, Warner Bros. Discovery and possibly Lionsgate, at least for a time.\u201d\n\n\n\nMedia investor sentiment \u201creally began the most recent downturn in early \u201922 as DTC fundamentals faltered alongside traditional fundamentals, and the trends listed above mean this is the best we\u2019ve felt about potential outperformance since then,\u201d Cahall concluded. \u201cWe believe the ad market is also solid.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne in a Dec. 18 report wrote that in 2024, \u201cthe divergence in (sector stocks\u2019) performance was stark between those with secular growth tailwinds \u2013 a media & entertainment \u2018winner\u2019s circle\u2019 \u2013 and those that are more purely cyclical or face secular headwinds.\u201d\n\nBut he also remains more cautious than others. \u201cDespite the improved streaming industry outlook and general industry consolidation potential, we do not see a reason to get more bullish on these stocks today,\u201d he added. \u201cThe traditional TV headwinds remain significant, TV licensing demand may not fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, and M&A often takes longer to play out than the market expects.\u201d\n\nNetflix, with a 90 percent jump to $891.32, was one of the biggest sector winners of the year, although it was outperformed by Cinemark, which jumped 121 percent. Fox Corp. had a 60 percent gain, and Imax, up 71 percent, was also among the media and entertainment sector stocks that handily outperformed the 23 percent gain in the broad-based S&P 500 stock index.\n\nDespite Netflix\u2019s strong run amid hit content and competitors\u2019 reduced spending, many Wall Street bulls remain optimistic. \u201cOur view remains unchanged that Netflix has won the global streaming race as evidenced by year-to-date results/raised guidance (especially relative to its streaming peers\u2019 results), and this is what, in our opinion, winning looks like,\u201d wrote Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak in late November, boosting his stock price target to a Street high of $1,100.\n\nSome are turning more cautious though. Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould, for example, cut his rating on Netflix shares from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold\u201d in mid-December citing the high valuation. \u201cWe upgraded NFLX almost 16 months ago on the thesis the competitors raising price and reducing spend further boosting Netflix\u2019s competitive position, Netflix having the largest pipeline of unreleased content and global production going into the strikes, successfully implementing paid sharing, and optimistic on advertising,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe believe those issues are largely factored into the stock, and the shares are now approaching fair value.\u201d\n\nMost traditional Hollywood players didn\u2019t match Netflix\u2019s performance and quite a few actually posted declines, as Wall Street continued to eye legacy linear TV networks units as challenged businesses amid cord-cutting and digital competition. That said, moves by Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) signaling they are ready to shed their cable networks operations that could become a deal vehicle to consolidate further parts of the industry drew cheers from some analysts, even though others expressed their doubts.\n\nWalt Disney, rejuvenated since the return of Bob Iger to the CEO role, saw its stock rise 23 percent for the year to $111.35, roughly in line with the broader market. \u201cIn 2025, we are confident Disney will realize improved financial performance in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) unit and better-than-expected results in Experiences (theme parks and cruise lines),\u201d CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon wrote in a Dec. 26, in which he raised his stock price target by $8 to $128 and boosted his earnings forecasts for the current and next fiscal year. \u201cIn our view, DTC has turned the corner to profitable growth with healthy subscriber growth. Sports are a core franchise for live entertainment that needs advertising sponsors to offset sports rights.\u201d\n\nParamount Global finally reached its deal in 2024 as chair Shari Redstone agreed to give up control in a transaction with a consortium led by Skydance Media, headed up by David Ellison, and RedBird Capital. The merger is expected to close in September, and Ellison and his team have outlined their case for Paramount as a growth story. Paramount shares fell 27 percent though to $10.46.\n\nNBCUniversal owner Comcast, led by chairman and CEO Brian Roberts, became the first entertainment titan to unveil the spinoff of most of its cable networks into a separate entity in late November. Led by Mark Lazarus as CEO, the new company didn\u2019t immediately get a name and was instead referred to as \u201cSpinCo,\u201d with Comcast promising \u201ca new growth trajectory\u201d for all its assets.\n\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif-Ehrlich was bullish about the move. \u201cSpinCo could be used as a consolidation vehicle for cable networks across the industry,\u201d she wrote in a report. \u201cThis move by Comcast may also reduce regulatory concerns about another attempted potential merger with a large cable peer.\u201d\n\nBut some observers wondered about the asset separation. \u201cWe question how valuable cable networks would be stand-alone, without ties to NBCU\u2019s studio and streaming capability, and lacking advertising tie-ins,\u201d Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen highlighted after Comcast management first mentioned the possible change.\n\nComcast\u2019s stock ended the year down 14.4 percent at $37.53.\n\nWBD, led by CEO David Zaslav, followed with a similar move on Dec. 12, saying it would reorganize its corporate structure into a global linear TV division, separate from its streaming and studios division. The new corporate structure aims to bolster its \u201cstrategic flexibility and create potential opportunities to unlock additional shareholder value.\u201d Or as Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen emphasized: \u201cThe signal seems clear: divestment of the linear networks could be in the cards, following neatly on Comcast\u2019s recently announced plans to spin off most of its cable networks from NBCU.\u201d\n\nZaslav recently also addressed WBD\u2019s previously stated target of posting $1 billion or more in direct-to-consumer profits in 2025, saying his team was now expecting to meaningfully exceed that, touting \u201cclear results\u201d from the firm\u2019s focus, investment, and patience with streamer Max. WBD\u2019s stock closed the year down 9 percent at $10.57.\n\nLionsgate, one of the biggest Hollywood gainers of 2023, also lost ground, falling 26 percent to $7.55.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox. Corp., led by Lachlan Murdoch after his father Rupert Murdoch moved to the role of chairman emeritus, benefited from optimism about its news and sports assets, including Fox News buoyed by a big election year. Fox ended the year at $48.58, up 60 percent this year.\n\nAmong smaller entertainment companies, AMC Networks, in its second year under CEO Kristin Dolan, lost about half its value, finishing the year down 48 percent at $9.90.\n\nIn contrast, UFC and WWE owner TKO Group, after its creation in September 2023, saw its shares jump for the year, gaining 74 percent to close at $142.11, while Endeavor rose 32 percent on the year to close at $31.29.\n\nCinema operator stocks had another mixed year in 2024. AMC Theatres-parent AMC Entertainment Holdings saw its shares fall 35 percent to end the year at $3.97, while Cinemark\u2019s stock shot up a massive 121 percent to $30.98. Imax Corp. also rode a box office recovery for Hollywood studios to end the year with its shares gaining 70 percent to $25.59.\n\nMusic and audio entertainment stocks mostly lost ground in 2024. Warner Music Group shares fell 13.3 percent to $31.00, the Amsterdam-listed stock of Universal Music Group dropped 4.2 percent to end the year at $24.72, iHeartMedia ended the year where it started to close at $1.98, and satellite radio giant SiriusXM\u2019s stock price ended at $22.80, down 58 percent.",

            "content": "Even a casual market watcher knows that 2024 on Wall Street was defined by a spectacular rise in tech stock valuations.\n\nTech also helped the entertainment sector overcome many of its challenges, dominating the list of the calendar year\u2019s biggest percentage gainers. Reddit, Spotify and Netflix may not be in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d alongside Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla, but they provided some of the brightest rays of hope for media investors this year.\n\nNetflix in particular climbed what Wall Streeters like to call \u201ca wall of worry,\u201d with its push into advertising and efforts to make customers pay to share passwords both bearing fruit. After stumbling badly in 2022, with subscriber declines and rivals ready to pounce, the streaming leader is ending the year on top of the game.\n\nAs far as the dominant media players, Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery ended the year down 14% and 7%, respectively, punished for their problematic linear TV holdings. Comcast at least won praise for proactively announcing plans to spin off linear cable networks in 2025. WBD\u2019s 7% drop for the year in some corners was celebrated as a partial victory given how cheap the stock was (seven bucks!) at one point. Even so, shares remain less than half the level where they started out after the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery in 2022, ending the year\u2019s final day of trading today at $10.57. Paramount Global, also confronting the linear conundrum and also its own merger saga with Skydance Media, slid 29% for the year.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nLinear TV was a major theme for the year\u2019s biggest losers in percentage terms. While the traditional TV business continues to throw off cash, it is shrinking and not growing, with both viewers and advertisers largely abandoning the medium except for live sports.\n\nDisney, which navigated a thorny, multi-player proxy fight early in the year with Nelson Peltz the primary antagonist, ended 2024 up 23%. The company found a way to foreground its cost reductions, revitalized studio business and ever-steady theme parks as ways to ease investor worries about linear holdings. It has found a comparatively consistent level but remains well below the lofty one it reached in 2021, which was paradoxically also a period of corporate unrest with former CEO Bob Chapek at the helm. The waters have gradually calmed under his successor (and predecessor), Bob Iger, but 2025 is apt to bring renewed focus on the CEO role. Iger\u2019s contract is up at the end of 2026 and the company says it will name the next leader by early in that year.\n\nDisney\u2019s upswing, owing in part to this year\u2019s three billion-dollar movie blockbusters (Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine and Moana 2), was mirrored by a rise in the shares of exhibition or exhibition-adjacent companies. Cinemark, the No. 3 movie theater operator in the U.S., shot up 120%. Imax shares got nearly the same boost, powering up 70%, with the cinema equipment specialist signaling improvement in China and in its alternative revenue lines, which provided some stability to the hit-dependent movie business.\n\nCineverse, among the year\u2019s top gainers, also broke through in the challenging indie sector. The resourceful company used its streaming portfolio to drive gory horror sequel Terrifier 3 to hefty returns in perhaps the year\u2019s unlikeliest movie opening. In terms of company value, Cineverse\u2019s reversal of fortune didn\u2019t happen at the vaunted Netflix end of the spectrum, but it was a resounding one for a company threatened with a Nasdaq delisting after its shares fell below $1 a share.\n\nAnother 2024 winner was a returning champ from a strong run in 2023: the Endeavor-controlled TKO Group Holdings. Its 74% rise in value isn\u2019t surprising given the popularity of the UFC, which is on the verge of locking in a lucrative new media rights deal, and the WWE, which sold rights to Raw to Netflix in a milestone, multibillion-dollar deal. The rosy fortunes of TKO are all the more remarkable considering the fact that one of 2024\u2019s earliest Wall Street tableaux saw Dwayne Johnson, Ari Emanuel and Vince McMahon gather to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Just days after that promotional appearance, McMahon exited the company\u2019s board and started selling off his equity after disturbing allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking were made in a lawsuit by a former employee, drawing federal regulatory scrutiny.\n\nEndeavor, for its part, is exiting the stage as a public company, with plans for private equity firm and longtime backer Silver Lake to take it private. Although the company\u2019s shares moved sideways for the most part after its 2021 IPO, this year brought a bit more momentum, with the stock finishing up 32% for the year.",

But MSSPs have been there to detect issues, respond to incidents and protect organizations from cyber criminals.\n\n1. Top 10 Cyberattacks of 2023\n\nIn 2024, our Top 10 Most Read Stories at MSSP Alert reflect MSSP and security-focused MSPs' concentration on what matters most to the cybersecurity channel \u2014 vulnerabilities, breaches, business deals, the cybersecurity marketplace, top cybersecurity certifications and breach liability. Here's a round up of our top stories in 2024:\n\nSome of the largest and most damaging cyberattacks on record occurred in 2023 \u2014 and MSSP Alert covered them all.\n\nThese incursions into business and government\u2019s most sensitive and critical information and data foreshadow a new year when we can expect even more ransomware, malware, phishing \u2014 you name it \u2014 attacks. More than ever, MSSPs, MSPs and all cybersecurity providers will need to raise their game to protect their customers, themselves included, from the endpoint and beyond.\n\n2. Comcast Faces Lawsuits over Breach of 36M Accounts\n\nComcast already faces at least two class action lawsuits over a massive data breach that exposed nearly 36 million U.S. Xfinity accounts after cyber attackers broke into its systems in mid-October, 2023, by exploiting a vulnerability in Citrix software.\n\nThe cable wing of Comcast does business as telecom Xfinity. The lawsuits filed in Pennsylvania federal court this month allege that unidentified hackers exploited a \u201ccritical-rated, unpatched security vulnerability,\u201d according to classaction.org, which reported the filings.\n\nOne lawsuit contends that \"Comcast admittedly failed to safeguard the sensitive personal identifying information of millions of its consumers or implement robust security measures to prevent this information from being stolen.\u201d Another alleges that the Xfinity customers would not have bought the service had they known their data was at risk.\n\nUnder new Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that went into effect on December 18, 2023, public companies experiencing a \u201cmaterial\u201d breach are required within four days to report the incident plus other associated information. So far, according to a review of Comcast SEC filings, the company had not made any related filings with the regulatory watchdog as of December 22, 2023.\n\n3. Law Firm Sues MSP Over Black Basta Ransomware Attack\n\nA managed service provider (MSP) has been slapped with a lawsuit by a prominent Sacramento, California law firm alleging that it failed to protect it from a ransomware attack that took down its systems.\n\nThe lawsuit, which has generated a significant amount of chatter in the channel community, filed by the law firm Mastagni Holstedt in Sacramento Superior Court, claims that LanTech LLC , a privately-owned Sacramento company, failed to adequately protect it from the attackers.\n\nMSSP Alert has reviewed the complaint in which Mastagni is seeking more than $1 million in damages. The firm employs 42 lawyers.\n\n4. UnitedHealth Group: A Cyberattack Timeline\n\nThe massive cyberattack that hit Change Healthcare on February 21, 2024 impacted hundreds of pharmacies worldwide, patient care included, and appears to have been the work of the infamous ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware crew. Change Healthcare is part of insurer UnitedHealth Group \u2019s Optum healthcare business. In 2022, Change Healthcare merged with Optum.\n\nChange Healthcare provides prescription processing services through Optum, which in turn supplies technology services for more than 67,000 pharmacies and care to more than 100 million individual customers. Change Healthcare processes 50% of all medical claims in the United States.\n\nOptum listed more than 100 Change Healthcare services that were affected by the breach. Also disrupted were critical functions such as benefits verification, claims submission and status updates, remittance information transmittal and prior authorization, according to the Healthcare Financial Management Association\n\n5. Palo Alto Networks Buys IBM QRadar\n\nFor devoted customers of IBM Security\u2019s QRadar cybersecurity product line, it was a bit of a seismic shock when Palo Alto Networks recently announced that it was buying the QRadar unit from IBM and changing how customers will get their QRadar services and support.\n\nThe May 15 deal came as a surprise because IBM has historically been active in improving and developing the QRadar product line, including a November 2023 announcement that it was retooling its QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) system to help users scale their hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nThat announcement also included plans from IBM to integrate generative AI capabilities within its QRadar threat detection and response products by tying in its watsonx data and AI platform. And in April 2023 IBM had announced the launch of its then-new IBM Security QRadar Suite , which was built to streamline security analyst experiences across the full incident lifecycle.\n\nBut now IBM is changing that earlier strategy by selling its SaaS-based QRadar line to Palo Alto Networks and moving to work with Palo Alto to provide AI-powered security consulting services to customers in the future, according to the companies.\n\n6. IT Consulting Firm Blames MSP for Data Breach\n\nAn IT consulting firm being sued in federal court for a data breach says it is not at fault. Instead it is pointing the finger at a managed service provider (MSP) for failing to secure its network, exposing it to the breach that affected more than one million people.\n\nBerry, Dunn, McNeil & Parker , a Portland, Maine-based IT and accounting consultancy that operates a medical data analytics business, blames Reliable Networks , an MSP based in Biddeford, Maine. At issue is the failure to protect 1.1 million individuals\u2019 personally identifiable information (PII) stored by Reliable's Health Analytics Practice Group (HAPG). Some 3,100 Maine residents were affected in the security breach.\n\nBerryDunn receives PII from its customers to conduct analytics services. However, it is BerryDunn, not Reliable, that is being sued in U.S. District Court in Portland, Maine by nine customers. Those customers are accusing BerryDunn of negligence, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty owing to the data theft.\n\nIn the BerryDunn action, the plaintiffs hope to form a class-action lawsuit, complaining that it took BerryDunn seven months after the September 2023 breach to notify them of the theft. Whether BerryDunn intends to sue Reliable remains to be seen.\n\n7. China-Backed Salt Typhoon Hack Into AT&T, Verizon Networks\n\nDetails of the work of the Chinese state-sponsored threat group Salt Typhoon, first discovered late last month targeting U.S. internet service providers (ISPs), are becoming clearer.\n\nAccording to a report this week in the Wall Street Journal , the advanced persistent threat (APT) attackers breached the networks of such major broadband providers as AT&T and Verizon possibly by compromising systems used by law enforcement agencies for lawful wiretapping and other activities.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, the news outlet said Salt Typhoon \u2013 also known as GhostEmperor and FamousSparrow \u2013 also infiltrated Lumen Technologies\u2019 networks and targeted some organizations outside of the United States, according to the WSJ and Washington Post\n\nThe goal of the threat group, which is believed to be part of the Chinese government\u2019s foreign spy service \u2013 the Ministry of State Security \u2013 appears to be to gather information, possibly about Chinese nationals that the U.S. government may be targeting for surveillance. The hackers for months may have had access to the \u201cnetwork infrastructures used to cooperate with lawful U.S. requests for communications data, according to people familiar with the matter, which amounts to a major national security risk,\u201d sources told the WSJ.\n\n8. Microsoft Admits Code Stolen in Midnight Blizzard Attacks\n\nIn early January, Microsoft revealed that a Russian-backed cyber syndicate had lifted information from the email accounts of some of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity, legal and other functions.\n\nThe actual event had occurred the prior November. The company has yet to identify the affected employees or disclose which emails and attached documents had been exfiltrated. In that case, the Midnight Blizzard (aka Nobelium) hackers lurked in Microsoft\u2019s systems for months.\n\nNow, in a security update and an 8-K filing , Microsoft provides more information on the incident Midnight Blizzard carried out by the same crew that orchestrated the high-profile SolarWinds attack. It\u2019s also the same perpetrators that the vendor warned about in December 2020 in a four-part blog series\n\nIn what it called an \u201congoing\u201d attack, Microsoft acknowledged in the latest update that the Nobelium intrusion had led to some source code being stolen.\n\n9. Cybersecurity Layoffs: Is the Market Quietly Contracting?\n\nFollowing substantial layoffs in the security sector during 2023, new job cuts ushered in the new year. Now with the all-but-certain impact of AI on cyber thieves, defenders and growth, is the cybersecurity market expanding or is it quietly contracting?\n\nHow would either condition affect MSSPs and MSPs? Is the ever-increasing volume of cyberattacks enough to keep the market growing with the demand for trained security professionals? Ultimately, how will zero days, ransomware and data breach after data breach play out for the cyber protectors?\n\nWhile most, if not all analyst projections point to cybersecurity growth and upward spikes in employment, there are some indicators that the market may instead be set up to shrink.\n\n10. 5 Top-Paying Cybersecurity Certifications\n\nThe number of cybersecurity professionals trained to defend against cyberattacks keeps growing in what is commonly referred to as \"the cyber skills talent gap.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a worldwide problem, with the gap closing in on four million open jobs amid a shortage of trained and qualified people to fill them. What\u2019s more, rapidly emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are making divides in knowledge and experience more evident.\n\nFinding the right people to fill job opportunities isn\u2019t easy but looking for professionals with certifications from qualified bodies certainly helps. As for trainees, people new to the field are best suited to obtain certifications offered by major organizations because they\u2019re readily recognized by hiring companies.",

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.97%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.19%.\n\nThe cable provider's shares have seen a decrease of 12.18% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 1.28% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.36%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Comcast in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.88, signifying a 4.76% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $31.64 billion, reflecting a 1.23% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.25 per share and revenue of $123.46 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.78% and +1.56%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.21% downward. Comcast is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Comcast is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.93. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 10.\n\nInvestors should also note that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 1.44 right now. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Cable Television industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.74.\n\nThe Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 184, putting it in the bottom 27% of all 250+ industries.",
